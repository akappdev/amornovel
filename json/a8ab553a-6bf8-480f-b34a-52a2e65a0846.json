The sensible part of my brain chastised me, calling me a fool. I should have pounded my fists against his hard, tanned, chiseled chest, and demanded that he set me down. He looked at me. His mocking eyes danced with a combination of amusement and suppressed desire. It was as if he could peer into my mind, extracting every sinful thought. I wanted him as badly as a dying man craved one last breath of air, and he knew it. There was no way to deny it when my body so openly betrayed me. My chest heaved with anticipation as his eyes moved to my full breasts that barely peeked out of the thin silk dress I wore. His eyes darkened with yearning, giving me a small measure of satisfaction. He wanted me as badly as I wanted him.</p><p>\"I'm going to make you mine,\" he murmured huskily, lowering his mouth. \"You're going to be screaming my name by the time the night is over.\" His lips were inches away. The expectancy left my own mouth panting with need.</p><p>He stopped just shy of my lips, waiting. I knew he wanted me to beg for it. I would not give in to his silent demands. If he was going to take me, the decision would be all his.</p> <p>His arms tightened around me as he took in my silence. He knew my stubbornness well. It was what had kept us apart all this time. \"Ask me to kiss you,\" he demanded, lowering me to the bed.</p><p>I shook my head resentfully. I don't know why I fought him so hard. My entire body screamed, demanding that I surrender to what it had been wanting for longer than I could remember.</p><p>\"Kassie,\" he crooned, playing on my weakness for his deep, sultry voice. He shifted, angling his body so he was lying between my quivering legs. \"Say it.\"</p><p>I could feel him, hard as stone, pressed against me. I gritted my teeth, trying to remain strong as I fought the urge to grind my hips against him. Using every tool in his arsenal, his hands slithered along my side, grazing my ribs before tickling the sides of my breasts.</p><p>\"Kassie,\" he growled, reacting to my gasping breath as he pressed against me.</p> <p>I shook my head. I would not give in to his demands. He began rocking his hips. My starving body mutinied, matching his movements in search of something to quench its thirst. Our bodies danced, filling my head with the newest song by A Great Big World.</p><p>Wait\u2014what? A Great Big World? That's not right. I jerked my eyes from my computer screen, surprised to find my vision slightly blurred. Sunlight streamed through the blinds that I had forgotten to close the night before. I shook my head to clear some of the cobwebs muddling my brain. The last time I remembered looking up, it had been pitch black outside. I had been writing all night. The music that had grabbed my attention continued to wail from somewhere in the chair I was sitting in. Rubbing a hand across my eyes, I groped for my phone, which had slid down the arm of the oversized recliner and nestled between the cushions. Happy to see the call was from my best friend, Olivia, I slid my finger across the screen before croaking out a greeting from my dry-as-the-desert throat. Judging by the empty cup sitting on the small table adjacent to the chair, it had been some time since I had last drunk anything. I had a habit of neglecting all my basic needs whenever I became engulfed in writing. Case in point, my bladder that was suddenly demanding my attention. It was a creepy thought, but if my bladder could talk, it would try making a case for me to at least wear Depends or something. Considering this wasn't my first novel, you'd think my body would be used to the routine by now.</p><p>\"Nicole?\" Olivia asked, sounding concerned.</p><p>I cleared my throat to find a voice that sounded more human, but my second attempt at talking wasn't much better. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Are you sick?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I answered, grabbing a can of diet soda from the table next to my chair. I shook it to find the can about half empty and took a swig. Yuck. Flat diet soda absolutely sucked donkey nuts. I grimaced as the vile liquid slid down my dry throat. At the very least, it served its purpose to wet my whistle so I could talk without sounding like a toad.</p> <p>\"Are you sure? The way you sound, I feel like I should be ordering a casket. May I suggest something in taupe? That way your pasty-ass complexion won't stand out so much.\"</p><p>\"Nice to talk to you too, whore. Just an FYI, corpses are all pale. Even your tan ass will be pasty when you kick the bucket.\"</p><p>Olivia snorted with laughter through the phone and I couldn't help smiling. I'm sure an outsider listening to one of our conversations would seriously question our friendship. Words like whore and slutbag were regular terms of endearment for us. Nestling my cell phone between my shoulder and ear, I clicked save on my laptop before setting it aside. I hated taking a break when I was in the zone, but my bladder was done being ignored. I stood up, groaning like my grandpa during Thanksgiving at the way my body popped and creaked. Every single muscle in my legs and back was stiff and tight. Considering I was only twenty-two years old, it was nothing to brag about. \"Hey, Liv, can I call you back? I have to pee something fierce and my stomach is threatening mutiny if I don't throw some sustenance in it.\"</p><p>\"No, wait! I was calling for a reason. I need you. Like now.\" Her tone was as dramatic as she could make it.</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I danced outside the bathroom, trying my best not to wet my pants. \"Liv, I'll call you back. I promise.\" My attempt to reassure her was sincere, but the toilet was taunting me like a prized throne.</p><p>\"No, you won't. I know you too well to fall for that line. You'll go pee, fix something to eat and then totally get wrapped back up in your book. I'm not hanging up until you agree to come help me.\"</p><p>\"Come help you?\" I grimaced, catching my reflection in the mirror. To call it bad would have been an understatement. If it were Halloween, I could have terrified every kid that came to my door. My hair stuck out in several directions from what appeared to be a haphazard attempt at a bun on top of my head. I remembered becoming aggravated around two a.m. after my hair kept falling in my face, obstructing my view of the computer screen. Somehow between then and now it had turned into a condemned bird's nest. My stretched-out T-shirt gracefully showcased a chocolate stain from when I became a little overzealous with a Hershey's syrup bottle. I'd unwittingly allowed my chocolate supply to run out, and desperate times called for desperate measures. The worst part was my yoga pants, which made my hair and T-shirt almost seem classy. Most of my thigh area was covered in orange fingerprints from when I'd been too wrapped up in my current work in progress to grab a napkin while I munched on cheese puffs.</p><p>\"Liv, I'm not going anywhere.\" I turned away from the mirror before it could break or my reflection could shriek in disgust. \"I look like something the cat wouldn't bother dragging in. Besides, I want to finish this chapter before I lose my groove.\"</p> <p>\"Nicole, this is serious. If you want that smexy book to have a cover, you need to get your ass down here. The lighting is just right, and we only have a small window to catch it. The forecast for the rest of the week is calling for rain.\"</p><p>Unable to put my bladder off a moment longer, I dropped my cheese-covered pants and sank down on the toilet. \"Liv, you know those crackpots on the news never get the weather right. It's the only job where you can be wrong all the time and still stay employed.\"</p><p>\"Are you peeing while you talk to me?\"</p><p>\"What else was I supposed to do? You said you weren't hanging up. Besides, you've heard worse. Need I mention Brent?\"</p><p>\"God no. Please don't remind me. I still can't believe that ass pimple called me while he was taking a dump. I mean, who the hell does that? Ugh, the noises scarred me for life.\"</p><p>I chuckled as I finished my business.</p><p>\"Are you coming?\" she asked while I washed my hands.</p><p>\"Um, that's a personal question, but no, I was just peeing.\"</p><p>\"You're such a perv. Get your ass down here now. You're gonna make me miss my shot, and then I'm going to have to bitch-slap you.\"</p><p>\"Liv, seriously. I'm a mess. Let me at least jump in the shower and then I'll head out.\"</p><p>\"There's no time. You know I wouldn't ask if it wasn't serious. I feel our window for this cover is closing. You're the one who said you don't want to use stock photos. If I can't get this shot, we're not going to have much of a choice.\"</p><p>I sighed heavily, seeing no excuse Olivia would accept. If she was resorting to the stock photos threat, things must be red-alert serious. Olivia had not only been my best friend since middle school, she was also the creative genius behind the covers for each of the books I had self-published during the last two years. She'd always had an eye for photography, but never put any serious effort into it until I asked her to do the cover for the novel I had written freshman year at college. The book took well over a year to finish, but after endless rereads and edits, I finally found the nerve to put my work out there. It didn't break any records or become the dream of every author by making it into Oprah's Book Club, but it did provide a steady income I never counted on. Three books later, my classes were being paid for without the aid of student loans, and I was able to afford a modest apartment not far from the beach. By the time I released the final book in the series, right after Christmas, I was pulling in enough income to become completely independent.</p><p>\"Fine. I'm on my way,\" I told her, not bothering to look in the mirror again. No reason to dwell on the fact that I looked like pond scum. I wouldn't be gone long, and it wasn't like I was trying to impress anyone.</p><p>\"Thank you.\" She cut the connection without a goodbye. It was nothing new. Olivia was a mover and a shaker.</p><p>Grabbing my bag and keys, I headed out the door after promising my cat, Severus, that I'd feed him as soon as I got home. His only acknowledgement was to roll over and show me his fluffy belly as he basked in the warm rays of sun streaming through my patio door. Obviously, food was not high on his agenda. I wished I could say the same thing, but my stomach was grumbling. I left my apartment before I could change my mind. For Olivia's sake, this trip better turn out to be as necessary as she claimed.</p><p>The sun was almost too bright when I stepped from my apartment complex. Blinking rapidly, I fumbled through my bag for my sunglasses, feeling like I was part vampire or some other creature that preferred the darkness of night. The black asphalt parking lot radiated heat like an oven. I ignored the small beads of sweat already trickling down my back and into the waistband of my yoga pants.</p><p>By the time I made it to my jeep that was parked under the only tree in the lot large enough to provide any kind of shade, I had given the gods of heat or sun or anything else that caused me to sweat an earful. The rest of the lot was filled with palm trees. I figured parking under the larger tree would keep my jeep cooler, but it still felt like one degree cooler than hell inside.</p><p>Swiping a hand across my damp forehead, I climbed into my vehicle and immediately cranked the AC to high, ignoring the initial blast of hot air that hit me in the face as my jeep idled to life. It was less than a five-minute drive to the beach where Olivia was taking pictures. During any other time of the year it made for a pleasant walk, but even with a mild breeze off the ocean, the summer temperatures were too harsh. Besides, I was spoiled by air conditioning.</p><p>The beach looked relatively dead as I pulled into the parking lot. It was the middle of the week and this particular stretch of sand was populated mostly by moms with their toddlers and other small children. Endless beach toys, towels and coolers filled with juice boxes were strewn about under brightly colored umbrellas. Most of the kids were busy playing in the shallow incoming waves or building sandcastles. Their mothers, on the other hand, looked noticeably curious about Olivia and her models set up not far down the beach.</p><p>My feet sank into the warm, dry sand that within a few hours would be too hot to walk on without shoes or sandals to protect your feet. I trudged toward the water, shielding my eyes with my hand as I tried to make out Olivia in the distance. Even wearing sunglasses, the bright sun made it hard to see her without squinting. Finally, I spotted her standing ankle deep in water barking instructions to two models who had waded into the water up to their waists.</p><p>I could tell Olivia was not satisfied by the way she gnawed at her lip. She was never one to hide her emotions. Wondering what had gotten her thong in a bundle, I looked toward the models, wondering if maybe they were having an off day. I recognized Natasha. She was always a pro. The guy was unfamiliar to me, but as my eyes widened, I'm fairly certain I may have gasped. No wonder all the moms I had walked past were staring so intently. Whoever he was, the model Olivia had hired was possibly the most handsome man I had ever laid eyes on. Scratch that. He was beyond handsome. This guy was downright gorgeous. I found myself hypnotized by his perfectly sculpted pecs and broad shoulders. He looked like a freaking damn Adonis, standing in the gentle waves that lapped at his taut stomach. His chiseled abs begged to be licked.</p><p>I shook my head to regain my senses. Errant thoughts like this were not normal for me. Don't get me wrong. I could appreciate a good-looking, sexy man as much as the next girl, but I'd never openly gawked at any guy before. Clearly my mind was still stuck in the sexy scene I had been writing when Olivia called earlier. How else could I explain the fact that I wanted to launch myself at him and beg him to make me his sex slave? Honestly, it should be against the law to have a body that perfect.</p><p>I stopped for a moment, realizing I was in no condition to meet someone like that. Freaking Olivia. I was going to kill her for dragging me out here looking like a wreck when she knew she was photographing someone who gave Ryan fucking Gosling a run for his money. I would have turned around and hightailed it back to my jeep if Olivia hadn't already seen me and waved me over.</p><p>Mr. Adonis watched me as I approached. In a total clich\u00e9 move, I pushed my sunglasses down the bridge of my nose and peeked over the tops of the lenses to get a better look at him. Olivia appeared at my side, yanking my arm to get my attention. Turning my head, I faintly heard her say hello, but barely acknowledged it as my eyes focused instead on the demigod in the water. Olivia regained my attention when she waved at the two models who threw her a return wave before walking toward the shore. I tried to look away, but my traitorous eyes told me to eff off, refusing to move from the pair of models who appeared regal as they strolled out of the water.</p><p>Olivia looked torn between amusement and frustration. \"Jesus, Nicole. Did you have a fight with a bag of Cheetos or something?\" she asked, tugging on my shirt and shaking her head at the large chocolate stain. \"And what's with the hair? That's quite the bold statement you're making there.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Whatever, skank. I tried to tell you I couldn't come, but you freaking said you needed me, like right now,\" I said, mocking her desperate tone from our phone conversation earlier.</p><p>\"I didn't mean you couldn't take two minutes to change your clothes.\"</p><p>I held up my hand, stopping her before she could say another word. \"Just remember, paybacks are an uberbitch.\" I tried to dust off and smooth out my clothes, but the attempt was futile. The only thing that would improve my appearance at the moment would be a genie popping out of a magic lamp.</p> <p>Looking around, I noticed every female eye on the beach was still glued to the man candy show. For good reason. He was pure sex on a damn lollipop stick. Water glistened and rolled down his lean, muscular body in a way that I would have believed had been Photoshopped if I wasn't seeing it with my own eyes.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mr. Sex on a Stick took full notice of my appearance, but not for the reasons I would have preferred. Messy clothes or windblown hair would have been better than why his eyes had momentarily fixated on my chest. A slight gust of wind had blown across the beach at just the right angle, cluing me in that I had forgotten to put on a bra before leaving my apartment.</p><p>Yep, I was going to bury Olivia in a shallow grave. I wished I hadn't left my phone in the jeep because I would have asked Siri where the best place was to dump Olivia's body. Siri would help. Siri would have never led me blind into an embarrassing situation like this.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The unfortunate timing of the gust of wind and my body's reaction had caught Olivia's attention as well. She stepped in front of me like a Secret Service agent protecting the president. I'm sure her intention was to be more discreet, but all she did was draw more attention to my hard nipples that suddenly had a mind of their own. What was it about a woman's nipples that made them want to stand at attention at the worst possible moment?</p> <p>\"You know Natasha, of course. Alec, this is my best friend, and author of the book we're trying to shoot the cover for. That is, if we can get these bitch-ass waves to cooperate\u2014Nicole Blake, or N.S. Blake to her readers. Obviously, fashion isn't her strong point.\"</p><p>I looked aghast at Liv before shaking Alec's hand awkwardly. \"Nicole is fine,\" I said, folding my arms across my chest.</p><p>\"Nicole, this is Alec Petropoulos.\"</p><p>\"Nice to meet you, Nicole. I hope I'm what you were looking for.\"</p><p>\"Huh? I\u2014\" His comment took me by surprise and I began choking on my own saliva. Either I was really that obvious, or he could read my mind. Olivia's eyes sparkled with laughter. I was so glad my grief could be a source of great delight for her. It was all fun and games until my next book, when I would write her in as a character and kill her off by dropping a meteor on her head. After something completely humiliating happened to her first, of course. Maybe she'd forgotten we'd been friends since middle school and there was plenty of good material I could use. She wouldn't look so smug then.</p><p>I glared at her one last time as I tried to recover from my sudden coughing fit. Pulling myself together, I pasted a bright smile on my face just as it occurred to me I'd also forgotten to brush my teeth. I could only imagine how my teeth looked considering my cheese puff-covered pants. I wanted to bury my head in the sand.</p> <p>\"Whoa, you okay?\" Alec returned the smile and placed his hand on my shoulder. My knees shook slightly like the ground was moving beneath my feet. I seriously needed to get a grip. I was acting like some sixteen-year-old virgin from Dorkville. Which, if I had to be completely honest, was partially true. Not the age part, but technically you could say I was still a virgin. It wasn't a conscious decision I had made. The timing just never seemed to be right. Story of my life, so far. There was a groping session gone awry sophomore year in high school when Mitch Klein couldn't figure out how to unclasp my bra. Then his parents came home, putting the brakes on the attempt. We broke up before we could try again. The only other time I came close was on prom night, senior year, but Paul Dent got a little too ahead of himself before we could do the deed, ending things prematurely\u2014if you get my drift. By the time I started college, my plan was to wait for the right guy. I was still waiting.</p><p>Standing on the beach, Alec's hand felt like something more than a simple gesture. It was something delicious and toe curling that made my dormant body parts come to life with a roar.</p><p>The sound of Olivia chuckling broke my reverie. As if I hadn't mortified myself enough, I suddenly realized I had grasped Alec's hand from my shoulder and continued to shake it like a goober. \"Sorry,\" I said, dropping his hand like it was a snake ready to strike. This was why I usually remained holed up in my apartment when I wasn't in class. I was a total introvert who did not belong in public. It was my service to everyone.</p><p>Trying to regain an ounce of dignity, I turned to Natasha, but completely overcompensated, throwing my arms around her like we hadn't seen each other in years. Unfortunately, I didn't consider the fact that we were standing on uneven sand in ankle-deep water. If I had, maybe we wouldn't have tumbled backward into the oncoming waves. Considering how my morning had gone, I shouldn't have been surprised.</p><p>\"Well, there goes my shot,\" Olivia muttered as Natasha and I came up sputtering saltwater.</p><p>Natasha 's shocked expression would have been hilarious had the circumstances been different, but now I just felt terrible. \"Shit, Natasha. I am so sorry,\" I groaned, taking in her soaked hair.</p><p>\"Don't worry about it. You just caught me off guard, that's all,\" she said, trying to regain her balance in the waves. Alec reached out to help us up. At least he was gentlemanly enough to contain his laughter until we were on our feet.</p><p>Olivia, on the other hand, didn't have that kind of tact. She pulled me to the side and hissed quietly so Alec and Natasha wouldn't hear our exchange. \"I called you down here to help me get the shot right. Not to totally sabotage it.\" If anything, Olivia was always professional. She tugged me toward her by the shirt. \"And since when are you a hugger? I thought they made you feel awkward.\"</p> <p>\"Obviously. Look what happened when I tried,\" I whispered. \"Don't forget this is all your damn fault. You dragged me from my apartment looking like this. I didn't even have a chance to brush my teeth.\" She had a lot of nerve trying to blame me for this fiasco.</p><p>\"Don't forget about the bra,\" she deadpanned, blatantly eyeing my chest.</p><p>Now that I was soaking wet from cold water, I may as well have not been wearing a shirt. There wasn't much of my bosom left to the imagination. \"I'm going to murder you in your sleep,\" I said, folding my arms across my chest. Her quiet whispers turned into hard laughter. I knew it was time to throw in the towel, or in my case, my wet T-shirt.</p><p>My departure was as awkward as my arrival had been, but I didn't allow myself to dwell on my performance until I was on my way home. Natasha and Alec had both been gracious, though I could tell they were amused. I groaned out loud in my jeep as I thought about my nipple peepshow. I could have used a Scooby-Doo do-over for the whole morning.</p><p>At least Severus was happy to see me when I got home. He wouldn't judge me for my shameful behavior.</p><p>\"It wasn't my finest moment,\" I muttered to him as I headed for my bathroom.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, I was showered, had squeaky clean teeth, and was dressed in clothes that were actually acceptable to wear in public. Of course, that didn't mean I had anywhere to go or anything in particular to do. My writing zone had fled somewhere between my fluorescent orange smile and my dip in the ocean. Any other time I would have called Olivia to hang out during the brief respite between writing marathon sessions, but I was still pissed at her.</p><p>Instead, I decided to give my apartment the kind of cleaning it deserved. I wasn't an overly messy person, but I was a stacker. Rather than put things away, I had a tendency to build small piles. It was mostly junk mail, magazines and books. Only when the piles began to take up too much counter space would I shove things in drawers or closets to get them out of sight. At least cleaning up gave me an excuse to work off my nervous energy. I set to work on my linen closet, which was where many of my stacks ended up. My towels and sheets took up the first three shelves, while games and any of the textbooks I'd been too lazy to sell back to the college bookstore sat on the bottom two shelves.</p><p>Most of the books spilled out onto the floor when I opened the door because of my typical uneven stacking method. Once again, I debated taking them to the campus bookstore, but from what I'd heard, they didn't pay you squat anyway. I shoved them back into the closet again, figuring it wouldn't be worth my time and effort.</p><p>After the linen closet, I moved to the kitchen. I usually ate takeout more often than I cooked for myself, but the kitchen still remained the drop-off point for everything I brought into the house. Scattered within the mounds of junk mail and various types of book swag I'd collected, I found some bills that needed to be taken care of.</p><p>Sliding into one of the high back barstools at my counter, I absentmindedly reorganized the bowl of fruit Olivia had forced on me a couple weeks ago. She had convinced herself that if she placed it within sight, I would be compelled to ignore my junk food in lieu of eating an orange or banana. The untouched fruit now looked even less appealing covered in fuzz. Not to mention the smell. I tried to tell her she was wasting her money, but Olivia was as stubborn as I was. It was a vicious cycle. Eventually one of us was bound to break. Better her than me.</p><p>I sat the empty bowl on the counter after dumping the fruit in the trash can. My thoughts drifted to my short time at the beach as I attempted to categorize what had happened earlier. There was no excuse for the way I acted. I'd always been a bit of a \"shy mouse\" as Olivia liked to say, but I was capable of acting like a normal human in social circumstances. I'd been around my fair share of good-looking guys. Hell, I sat behind Chip Price in English class my entire junior year in high school wrapped in a cologne haze and waiting for him to turn around to flash me one of his panty-dropping grins. So what if the only time he ever really turned around was to hand back papers from the teacher? What mattered was how each and every one of those grins made me feel special and caused my toes to curl.</p><p>Today, though, was a different story. Alec was drop-dead gorgeous, and his abs should be put on display in some sex god museum, but I wrote romance for crap's sake. I could describe a sex scene in a way that would make a biker blush, but throw me in a situation with a hot guy, and I acted like I'd found my first crush. One thing was certain: at twenty-two I was way past the age for a schoolgirl crush.</p><p>The thoughts continued to filter through my head as I sat at the counter in limbo. I knew I needed to get back to writing. Wicked Lovely was supposed to release at the end of next month, and I still had another twenty thousand words to wrap up the story. My editor was expecting the manuscript in two weeks, which meant I really had no time to mess around. I just couldn't get my mind into writing mode again today. I debated spending some time on Facebook and Twitter, but even that held little appeal. Facebook especially was a complete time suck. I knew from previous experience that a minute would turn into five minutes, which would slide easily into an hour.</p><p>I grabbed my phone and debated asking Siri for advice on where to stash a body before deciding I'd been mad at Olivia long enough. That was how our friendship worked. Neither of us had ever been able to stay mad at one another for longer than an hour or two. Right now I needed the sanity of my friend to show me how ridiculous I was being, so I tapped the screen to dial her number.</p><p>Olivia answered on the first ring, like she had been expecting me to call. \"Took you long enough.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Nothing like being predictable. \"Psh, you're lucky you're not buried in some swamp. How could you do that to me?\"</p><p>Her laugh fluttered through the phone. \"How was I supposed to know you'd show up looking like one of those bad Wal-Mart customer pictures people post on Facebook? Believe me, if I would have known that was the look you were going for, I would have shielded the eyes of the kids on the beach. That was a train wreck.\"</p><p>\"Screw you, whore. That's your last warning.\" I debated hanging up. Maybe I didn't need her after all.</p><p>\"Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" she said swiftly. \"I'm just teasing. Come on, don't be a sourpuss. I'll treat you to lunch,\" she cajoled. \"I found a new Mexican restaurant I want us to try.\"</p><p>\"Another one?\" Olivia was on a perpetual quest to find a decent Mexican restaurant in central Florida. Every month or so, she'd stumble across a new one. Personally, I didn't think any of the previous restaurants had been that bad, but she deemed them all crap. Olivia had lived in California at one time and boasted that you didn't know good Mexican food until you'd tried some of the restaurants just north of the border.</p><p>\"I'm bound and determined to find a place that makes authentic-tasting taquitos. Not something you pulled out of your freezer and nuked,\" she said, taking a dig at me. It was common knowledge between us that I would starve if not for my microwave and my obsession with cereal. If something couldn't be nuked or poured into a bowl with milk, it didn't belong in my kitchen. Olivia liked to tease that if I ever made it big with my writing, the first thing I should do is hire a cook. It was a nice pipe dream. I wasn't exactly killing it with my books, but the income had already far exceeded what I ever thought I would make. When I started college, I knew I wanted an English degree. I had harbored hopes that it would be a springboard to nurturing my love of writing, but realistically I had planned to use the degree to become a teacher. Now in my final year of school, I was beginning to think maybe this writing thing could become permanent. Maybe I would never make enough to hire my own cook, but I would like to travel the world someday. Truthfully, just the idea that I was doing what I loved and that I was able to do it full-time was all I could ever ask for. I was living my dream at twenty-two. No one needed to tell me how lucky I was.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Olivia was already halfway into a margarita when I joined her for lunch an hour later.</p><p>\"Thanks for waiting for me,\" I joked, pulling on my hoodie. It was a gazillion degrees outside, but the restaurant had the air inside blasting at an arctic level. Not that I would complain. I'd rather be cold than sweat my ass off, but living in Florida all my life had taught me to bring a jacket or sweater anytime I ate out.</p><p>Olivia slurped up the last of her strawberry-flavored drink. \"Never fear. I plan on ordering another. After this morning, I think we could both use a few.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rolled my eyes. Olivia loved to make everything a little more dramatic than it actually was. \"Please, if anyone had it bad, it was me. I bet I came across like a complete moron.\"</p><p>\"Yep,\" she agreed, signaling the waitress.</p><p>Unable to help myself, I kicked her under the table. \"Isn't there a friend clause where you're supposed to lie and tell me it wasn't all that bad?\"</p> <p>\"Lies won't get you laid, sweet cheeks,\" she answered, turning to the waitress. I blanched as the waitress grinned at me. Great, why not just announce to the world that I had no man warming my bed? \"I'll take another, and bring one for Cheese Puffs here too,\" she added.</p><p>Olivia grinned as I flipped her off. The problem was she knew I was all talk and no bite.</p><p>\"So, what was your deal this morning?\" She scooped salsa onto a chip and popped it into her mouth. \"I know I pulled you away from one of your writing marathons, which explains the grunge-rock look, but you seemed downright flustered.\"</p><p>I shrugged. \"I don't know. How's Natasha, by the way?\" I still felt terrible for taking her under the water.</p><p>\"She's cool. You definitely shocked the shit out of her though when you tackled her.\"</p> <p>I could feel my cheeks beginning to heat up. How could I explain Alec was the source of my unexpected behavior? That my body felt the need to respond just looking at him. I may be a virgin, but I wasn't naive. I recognized hard-core lust when I felt it.</p><p>Olivia's eyes narrowed shrewdly as she studied me. Shit. She knew. I could tell by the way her eyes widened and a gleeful smile lit up her face. I ducked my head, reaching for a chip, but I had the worst poker face in existence. \"Ahhhhh, the plot thickens,\" she crowed. \"You think he could be the one to unlock the chastity belt.\"</p><p>Despite myself, I couldn't help snorting. \"Chastity belt? Maybe you need to lay off my historical romance books. Welcome to the twenty-first century.\"</p><p>The waitress had returned with our drinks and laughed at my comment. \"Are you two ready to order?\"</p><p>\"I'll take your taquitos with a side of rice and beans, and my friend obviously wants something tall, dark and beefy,\" Olivia said, making the three of us laugh.</p><p>\"You and me both,\" the waitress replied, looking at me.</p> <p>\"Okay, spill it,\" Olivia demanded once I had placed my order. \"I've been waiting for this moment forever. I was beginning to think you swung from the other tree. I already had it worked out in my head how I'd let you down easy when you finally made your move on me.\"</p><p>\"Ha, you wish. If I was going to swing from that tree, it'd be for someone sweet.\"</p><p>She tried to look hurt. \"I'm sweet, bitch.\"</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \"Really?\"</p><p>\"Fine. I was sweet once. I think I was five or some shit like that. My sister wanted the lollipop I got when I had to get a shot and I almost thought about giving it to her.\"</p><p>I chuckled. \"I guess it's the thought that counts...\"</p><p>\"Damn straight. Now stop trying to evade my question. Tell me what it is about my new model that made you all hot and bothered.\"</p><p>\"You mean besides the obvious? How did you find him, anyway? I thought you were having problems finding someone to replace Grant when he moved to New York last month.\"</p> <p>Olivia dipped another chip into the salsa before answering. \"That's an interesting story, actually. I met him when Taylor and I went out the other night.\"</p><p>\"You guys went to that new club down by Church Street Station, right?\" I piped in, dipping my own chip into the salsa.</p><p>\"That's where we met him. He moonlights as a bartender when he's not in class.\"</p><p>\"And he models too?\"</p><p>\"He does now,\" Olivia answered. \"Before you showed up this morning and made your big splash, I could already tell he was going to be a natural. I mean, the abs, right? If I wasn't in a relationship, I would have to rethink my policy about not sleeping with the models. He definitely brings a temptation to the table that none of the others have.\"</p><p>I took a swig of my drink, letting the frozen beverage slide down my throat before answering. \"That's because all your other male models are gay. You'd have more of a chance of hooking up with Natasha than any of them.\"</p><p>\"How right you are, Sherlock. Anyway, when we were at the bar, Taylor struck up a conversation with him. Alec was wearing a Tampa Bay Bucs shirt and you know how guys feel the need to bond over sports. I was practically drooling out of boredom by the time they hashed out the Bucs chances of making it to the World Series next year.\"</p><p>\"Super Bowl,\" I corrected automatically. Born and raised with three older brothers, I knew more about sports than should have been natural. All of them were total jock heads just like my dad. I spent my adolescent years living with the smell of gym socks and Bengay. I didn't care since the majority of the time I was crushing on their friends. Of course, having three older brothers who had been ordered to watch me by our overprotective father didn't help my dating life in high school. Couple that with a naturally shy personality and it was no wonder I became an introvert. Only my brothers' closest friends knew what lay beneath my bashful surface. Although they appreciated a girl who could talk sports, they never looked at me as anything more than a kid sister.</p><p>\"Who cares? Super Series, World Bowl, that's not the point. While they were busy pontificating about the future of a team neither of them play for, I was checking out Alec. He's definitely comfortable in his own skin. It didn't take much convincing to get him to agree. I think he liked the idea of earning some extra cash.\"</p><p>I tried to keep my cheeks from turning red, but the more Olivia talked about him, the more I seemed to blush. \"He definitely has cover model looks,\" I squeaked out.</p><p>\"Wow, you are seriously smitten,\" Olivia mused as the waitress returned with our food.</p><p>\"Now you go with smitten? Olivia, I'm not kidding. You need to open up some contemporary romances. If you start referring to women as dames and men as gents, I'm going to stage an intervention.\"</p><p>\"What can I say? Your books got me hooked on the historical stuff. You should be pleased.\"</p><p>The waitress paused as she handed over my plate. \"Are you a writer?\" she asked with excitement. \"What kind of books do you write?\"</p><p>I ducked my head, nearly choking on the chip I had just shoved in my mouth. Talking about my books with strangers was still a new experience for me. I nodded my head, since I was still coughing.</p><p>\"Don't mind her,\" Olivia answered. \"She spends half her time holed up in her apartment like a hermit while she writes. Thank goodness her books are better than her social skills.\" She smoothly whipped out one of the bookmarks she had designed for me from her purse. \"Here you go,\" she added, handing the bookmark over.</p><p>\"Wow. This is so exciting. I'm an avid reader, much to the displeasure of my husband. He hates it when I start reading a new book. He says I completely block him out.\"</p><p>Finally done coughing, I was able to agree with her. \"I'm the same way. I don't get to read as much as I like now since I spend all my time writing, but there's nothing like losing yourself in the pages of an amazing book.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" she answered enthusiastically, nodding for emphasis. \"I can't wait to get off work and tell my husband I served an actual author. And I will definitely pick up your book.\"</p><p>Explaining where to go online to find my books was always awkward for me. As an indie author, none of my titles could be found in the traditional bookstores. Olivia was much better at explaining the logistics, so I let her take over the conversation. After a few moments, the waitress had the complete lowdown with all the links to find my books. Before walking away, she asked me to sign the bookmark and took out her phone for a picture. I grudgingly agreed. Not because I wasn't appreciative. I just had no idea why someone would want a picture with me. Olivia stood from the table to do the honors. \"Squeeze a little closer,\" she said, giving me a wink. \"Okay, on three say sexy.\" She snapped the picture and handed over the phone to our waitress who thanked us again.</p><p>\"So what else are you working on this week,\" I asked Olivia after swallowing a bite of my \"bland quesadilla\" as she referred to it. Her tastes were spicier than mine. I preferred my mouth not feel like it was set on fire.</p><p>\"I have a couple covers to finish and another shoot for Michelle. She wants a paranormal vibe, so I'm going to do the shoot on Thursday night. It's supposed to be a full moon as long as the clouds behave. Do you want to go out with me and Taylor tomorrow night?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure. I need to finish Wicked Lovely and get it to Hollie for edits by the twelfth.\"</p><p>\"I thought you were almost done.\"</p><p>\"I am, but I sorta got interrupted today.\"</p><p>She merely raised her eyebrow at me. \"I'm not letting you lay that on me. We both know you prefer to write at night anyway.\"</p><p>\"You don't know me that well. Maybe I decided during summer break, since I don't have to worry about classes, I might try writing during the day and actually sleep at night.\"</p><p>\"Right. I'll believe it when I see it. You're a habitual night owl.\"</p><p>I sighed. \"True.\" I had always been more of a creature of the night. Even when I was younger I would stay up past my bedtime reading under my blankets with the small flashlight my oldest brother, Tony, had given me.</p><p>\"I still think you should go out with us. You've been holed up in your apartment every weekend for so long I'm surprised someone hasn't come in and swapped your college ID for an AARP card. You need to get out occasionally. Let your hair down. Go wild.\"</p><p>\"Seriously?\" I snorted. \"In all the years we've known each other when have I ever gone wild?\" I shook my head as I wiped sour cream from the corner of my mouth.</p><p>\"Well, you're still young. There's never been a better time to start. Come with us, Nicole. You'll have fun, and it'll be good for you to get out.\"</p><p>I pondered her words heavily as we continued our meal. I couldn't deny her point. These were the years in my life when I should be living it up a little. Besides, I enjoyed hanging out with Olivia. We had been close since middle school when she kicked Kara Miller's ass for picking on me. From that day forward, we became best friends. We had a yin-and-yang type of relationship. I was shy and reserved; she was confident and in your face.</p><p>Olivia had the type of features any girl would kill for. She was tall and had a beautiful face with long shiny black hair and drop-dead gorgeous eyes. Then there was awkward me with my pale skin, lanky hair and murky, mud-colored eyes. Olivia had always told me I was full of shit; that I was more attractive than I thought and she would kick my ass for thinking otherwise. That was why I loved her so much. She had always been a loyal friend above all else.</p><p>\"Hello, Nicole. You're zoning out again.\" Olivia snapped her fingers in my face, getting my attention. Everyone who knew me had gotten used to my occasional zoning out. Most times it was because I was thinking about my current work in progress. My brothers would tease me, claiming they could actually see smoke coming out of my ears.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" I said, dunking the quesadilla in guacamole.</p><p>\"So, tomorrow? You in?\"</p><p>I nodded. \"I guess. I can always write when I get home.\"</p><p>Olivia smiled with satisfaction. For the rest of the meal we discussed my new cover. I managed to dodge the Alec issue by refusing to acknowledge any more of Olivia's comments on the matter. Eventually we came up with a game plan on how to handle the reshoot. Ironically, after everything that happened on the beach this morning, she admitted it was all for the best because the pose she had envisioned for the models had been overdone and she already had another idea\u2014if she could get the lighting perfect, of course. That was her standard worry for every shoot. At least she was back on track, which was all I cared about.</p><p>We left the practically frigid temperature of the restaurant for the sweltering heat outside. I was surprised I didn't get sick more often. \"Well, what's the verdict? Si or no on the taquitos?\"</p><p>\"Not bad. It wasn't SoCal good, obviously, but maybe we'll keep it in the rotation. Me and Taylor will swing by your place at eight tomorrow to pick you up.\"</p><p>\"Okay, but no sushi this time.\" The last time Olivia had tried to expand my palate I ended up gagging and nearly vomiting on the waiter's shoes. It wasn't something the staff at the restaurant took too kindly, but lesson learned.</p><p>Olivia chuckled. \"Fine, but who knew you would be such a baby?\"</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at her as I climbed into my jeep.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>By two o'clock the following afternoon I was regretting my snap decision to go out with Olivia and Taylor. My groove had returned and I stayed up all night writing. I'd likely suffer the consequences later, but for now I had a euphoric feeling as all the pieces of my story began to click together. I knew if I didn't want to be a complete zombie when I went out later, I needed to get a couple hours of sleep in. Tearing myself away from my manuscript was tough, but at three o'clock I forced myself to shut it down.</p><p>Placing my laptop on the empty side of my bed, I laid back against my pillows, hoping my eyes would become heavy quickly. The problem was, after a long writing session I couldn't turn off my brain immediately, so I usually just laid there full of adrenaline. I figured if I was in bed I was technically resting. That was the reasoning I had used on my parents when I was younger. Thanks to the blackout curtains I had bought, my room was plunged into darkness after I shut off my lamp. I set the alarm on my cell phone for six thirty, resisting the urge to peek at Facebook or check my emails.</p><p>Severus had been waiting patiently at the foot of my bed and now walked up my legs, taking his customary spot on my stomach. He wasn't exactly fat by cat standards, but he was solid. I grunted under his weight as he made bread dough on the blanket until he was satisfied he would be comfortable. I closed my eyes while petting Severus on the head. I must have been more tired than I realized because I felt myself drifting away to the steady rumble of his purring.</p><p>Sometime later, I was startled awake by the sound of pounding on my front door. Severus meowed his displeasure when I abruptly sat up, dislodging him from my stomach. I felt disoriented. My room remained dark regardless of what time of the day it was because of my curtains. Groping around my desk, I managed to find my phone and tapped the button to light up the screen. Another series of pounding on the door echoed throughout the apartment. I groaned when I saw that it was eight o'clock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scrambling from my bed, I rubbed a hand across my eyes and flipped on the lights as I made my way to my front door with Severus trailing behind me.</p><p>\"I knew it. You fell asleep,\" Olivia proclaimed when I pulled open the door.</p><p>Rather than try to deny the obvious, I turned and walked away so she could enter. \"Why didn't you use the key I gave you?\"</p> <p>\"I left it in the car with Taylor. His mom called him as we pulled in.\"</p><p>I bit the inside of my cheek at the way Olivia said mom, like it was a dirty word. Her own parents had been absentee at best. She had warmed up to mine over the years, but still maintained a standoffish attitude where parents were concerned.</p><p>\"Why aren't you dressed? Is this a ploy to get out of going? Because I might as well tell you, it's not going to work. So get your skinny ass in there and get dressed.\"</p><p>\"Don't be bossy. I was up late writing and my alarm failed to wake me up,\" I said, holding up the culprit to take the blame for me.</p><p>Olivia took the phone from my hand and trailed behind me as I headed to my bedroom to change. She perched on my unmade bed while I searched my closet for something presentable to wear. I wasn't a fashion expert, but even I had to admit my closet was sparse. My dresser overflowed with yoga pants and T-shirts, but my closet looked mostly ignored. It was comprised of a few things I'd picked up over the past few years along with a few remnants of my high school wardrobe. Looking at it now, it was really pitiful.</p> <p>\"Your closet is fucking anorexic,\" Olivia complained as she peered over my shoulder. She reached around me, pushing hangers aside to search for the perfect outfit that wasn't there. \"You need a complete wardrobe makeover. And a yoga pants intervention,\" she added, glaring at my hot pink pair.</p><p>I shrugged. Eventually I would supplement my wardrobe, but it wasn't high on my priorities list. Grabbing a black lightweight chiffon top and black cami from the closet, I headed to my dresser and pulled out a pair of jeans I'd had since high school. Judging by the look on Olivia's face, she didn't approve, but I didn't care. Jeans never went out of style, and they still fit.</p><p>Sticking out my tongue at her, I slipped into my bathroom to shower quickly and get dressed.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later I left the bathroom with a puff of steam wafting behind me. I pulled my hair up in a loose knot since I didn't have enough time to dry and straighten it. Makeup was another thing I didn't put much effort into, but I applied just enough to add some color to my cheeks. Growing up, my mom had tried her best to teach me to be a typical girl, but being surrounded by boys constantly, I learned to appreciate roughhousing and burping contests over makeup and clothes.</p><p>When I joined Olivia and Taylor in the living room, I figured my appearance must have passed Olivia's seal of approval because she made no comments to the contrary. Taylor sat on the couch petting a quite content Severus. Olivia was at the counter messing with my phone. \"Your alarm works better if you set it to go off at six thirty p.m., not six thirty a.m., Einstein.\"</p><p>\"Oops, good point,\" I said, catching the phone after she tossed it to me.</p> <p>Taylor grinned. \"It's the thought that counts, right?\" He stood up after giving Severus one last stroke.</p><p>I returned his smile. Taylor was cool that way. He was no slouch in the looks department either. He and Olivia were actually a good match. Clearly he thought she was beautiful because he said so many times, but he also didn't treat her like a trophy. Over the years, I'd seen a steady stream of guys come and go with Olivia. Most of them thrived on the idea of dating someone as pretty as she was, but they were still douche faces who treated her like crap. Thankfully, she was quick to let them go. Taylor had proved to be different. He treated her as an equal rather than a possession. I could tell his intentions were to get more serious, but Olivia had major commitment issues. It would be interesting to see how it all played out. Olivia was a tough nut to crack, but something told me not to count Taylor out.</p><p>We got into our typical lively conversation about nothing in particular during the drive. Taylor was a couple years older than Olivia and me. He worked for a pharmaceutical company in Orlando and made good money. His job required him to travel quite often, but he always had plenty of stories to share with us. I was tempted to put my historical romance stories aside and write a book about flight attendants after listening to some of his anecdotes. The book would practically write itself.</p><p>We ended up eating at a small pizza joint downtown before heading to what I realized had been Olivia's intended destination all along. I shouldn't have been surprised. Truthfully, I should have been suspicious when she let the subject drop the day before. She was never one to give up so easily. As soon as Taylor pulled into Church Street Station I knew where we were and who worked inside.</p><p>My normally brave friend avoided making eye contact with me as we climbed out of the car. Instead, she took her boyfriend by the arm and walked toward the new nightclub. If Taylor was in on Olivia's plan he hid it well because he looked oblivious to our silent standoff.</p><p>We could hear and feel the throbbing of the music from the parking lot. Having been friends with Olivia for so long, I wasn't a complete novice to clubs. They just weren't my thing. Still, every so often, I would let her drag me along. I usually had fun for the most part, but that was because I never had any expectations. Even in a club filled wall to wall with people it was easy to remain inconspicuous. This time was different. I knew exactly why she had chosen the Red Moon. I wasn't an idiot. Olivia was trying to play Cupid, and the Red Moon was where Alec tended bar. Part of me relished the chance to make up for my odd behavior the other morning at the beach. At least I could prove to Alec I knew how to act normal. Unfortunately, the more dominant half of me wanted to run back to my apartment and hide where I felt safe.</p><p>Olivia must have sensed my reluctance since she reached back and grabbed me by the wrist. I told myself I still had time to pull away, but each step brought us closer to the club. Looking around, I spotted a small coffee bar across the street where I could hide out for a couple of hours, but Olivia kept a firm grasp on my wrist. Before I knew it, we had reached the door.</p><p>\"Here you go,\" Olivia said, handing over two IDs to a tall, well muscled bouncer. I snatched my hand away and reluctantly reached inside my small purse. Pawing through the contents, I didn't know whether to panic or feel relieved when my driver's license wasn't in its customary spot.</p> <p>\"Looking for this?\" Olivia held out my license and grabbed me by the hand to tug me inside the club.</p><p>\"So now you're a thief?\"</p><p>\"I borrowed it while you were getting dressed. Just wanted to make sure you didn't have an excuse to bolt.\" My friend knew me too well.</p><p>When we got inside, I stopped before reaching the long bar where people stood shoulder to shoulder waiting to place drink orders. There were three bartenders behind the counter working the crowd, but only one of them held any significance to me. I intended to play it cool, but my palms began to sweat the moment my eyes found Alec's. Damn, he was as handsome as I remembered. He grinned, nodding his head in my direction. He recognized me. Fantastic. Nothing like making a lasting impression.</p><p>Olivia pulled me the rest of the way to the counter where a space had miraculously opened up. It was at the opposite end of the bar from where Alec was working, but was just large enough for Olivia and me to perch on two stools with Taylor standing between us.</p><p>Alec smiled again, watching me as he prepared a drink order. Maybe someone like Olivia would have no problem maintaining eye contact with a hot guy across the room, but I looked away, pretending to fumble with my purse. I stood up to readjust my stool, keeping my head down. After getting myself situated, I found the nerve to glance back at Alec. He smiled as if he had been waiting for me to look at him. Shooting me a wink, he turned his attention back to the customers in front of him.</p><p>That was my weakness, especially from someone with such striking eyes. Call me a slut, but it wouldn't take much more than that to get me to drop my panties for him. Winking for me was like liquor to an alcoholic, and he was getting me drunk. I suddenly realized I had bigger problems than making eye contact. At some point he was going to walk over to us and I would have to say something. Preferably something witty or smart. The harder I tried to come up with something clever, the more my mind went blank. Shit, of all the times to experience writer's block. My heart felt like it would beat out of my chest. I had nothing. All I could think about was how I wished I wouldn't have worn my hair up. I could have used it to hide my embarrassing rosy red cheeks. I fidgeted uncomfortably on my stool, praying to any god that would listen to give me the sanity to make it through this.</p><p>Olivia placed her hand on my shoulder. \"See, it's not so bad, right? What are you going to get to drink?\"</p><p>\"Uh, I'm not sure yet.\"</p><p>Olivia turned her attention back to Taylor. I felt like a third wheel as their voices were drowned out by the crowd. Truthfully, I was probably too distracted to listen anyway. I found myself studying Alec again as he chatted with two women he was preparing drinks for. Neither of the women could have been more flirtatious if they tried. They both wore undersized shirts that displayed as much cleavage as they could possibly get away with. The way they stuck out their chests, you would think they wanted Alec to take a bite. Personally, I found it more funny than attractive, but clearly Alec knew how to handle himself. He leaned in close while they talked before throwing his head back, laughing deeply. The two skanks absolutely ate it up, like either of them stood a chance.</p><p>I didn't know what had come over me. Alec and I were not a couple. We were nothing. Certainly nothing to elicit jealousy over. It had to be his off-the-hook sex appeal. It was clouding my judgment. As if he could hear my thoughts, he turned my way, flashing a devastating smile as he sauntered over.</p><p>Be cool. Be cool. The words rang through my head.</p><p>\"Hey, Olivia,\" he said, greeting her with enthusiasm. \"Taylor, my friend, how's it hanging?\" They fist-bumped before Alec turned his attention to me. \"And the lovely Nicole,\" he said, winking again. Holy hell, there went my hormones again. Was it possible to fall into insta-lust with someone? I'd never believed in love at first sight, even though my current thoughts had nothing to do with anything lovey dovey and everything to do with the persistent throbbing between my thighs.</p><p>I had every intention of returning his greeting. I even opened my mouth with the expectation of saying something, but my tongue stuck stubbornly to the roof of my mouth like I had just eaten peanut butter. He may have just seen my impression of a guppy, but I at least nodded my head for good measure.</p><p>Olivia coughed slightly, trying her best to hide her laughter. Taylor unwittingly saved me by engaging Alec in a play-by-play account of the last Tampa Bay Rays game. Ironically, I had also watched the game while eating dinner at my family's house Sunday night. Even after getting my own place, Mom insisted I still come over every Sunday for dinner. She said it was the only way she could be certain I ate at least one good meal a week. Not that we ever ate a traditional family dinner at the dining room table. In our house we ate while watching TV, usually sports of some kind. It may have been unconventional, but we never claimed to be normal.</p><p>Listening to Taylor and Alec trade stats about the game was like listening to my brothers, Tony, Zachary and Riley. I could have easily joined their conversation and held my own. Like how Davis should have been pulled in the sixth before giving up a two-run homer to tie the game. His arm was obviously shot at that point. I was hesitant to give my two cents, fearing Alec would see me the same way my brothers' friends had back in high school. A cool chick to talk sports with, but not worth dating.</p><p>Olivia knocked on the counter to get their attention. \"Boys, if you're going to talk about boring sports all night, Nicole and I will have to find other ways to occupy our time.\"</p><p>Taylor stopped mid-sentence with his eyebrows raised. \"Oh yeah? I'd be up for watching that.\"</p><p>\"Get your mind out of the gutter, perv. How about you get me a drink instead?\"</p><p>\"Sorry, babe. My manners are horrible,\" Taylor said, planting a kiss on the back of Olivia's hand. She practically melted against him before straightening up. I knew from our conversations she was trying to maintain boundaries with Taylor, but clearly he was slowly finding a way beneath the cracks. I silently cheered for him.</p><p>\"So, what's your poison?\" Alec asked, turning his attention to me.</p><p>I took a deep breath before answering. \"Uh, I'll take a Coke.\" It wasn't the most cosmopolitan choice, but at least I didn't choke on the words.</p><p>\"Hell no. We're doing shots tonight,\" Olivia crowed, tearing her eyes from Taylor. \"We're here to loosen you up tonight.\"</p><p>Alec chuckled lightly at her words.</p><p>\"Liv,\" I warned, glaring at my friend.</p><p>\"Come on, Nicole. It's been ages since you threw caution to the wind. You need to relax and let loose a little. If you're not careful, you'll develop a reputation as some crazy cat lady.\"</p><p>I would never admit it to Olivia, but my worst fear was that she would turn out to be right. I had a recurring nightmare that ten years from now I'd still be a virgin holed up in my apartment writing stories about other couples' love lives. I wished I could change my personality. I wanted to badly. Remaining a virgin at twenty-two was not a status I set out to achieve. Hell, in high school sometimes it was all I thought about. When you're an underclassman you don't want the reputation as a slut, so you kept your knees together, but somewhere between junior year and graduation that stigma began to change. It started with one of my friends losing her V-card, and then another friend after that. Before I knew it, I was the only one in my group of friends who hadn't had sex yet. It didn't feel like a big deal at the time since there were plenty of girls in my graduating class who held the same status as me. All of that changed during my first year of college. Everyone seemed to be hooking up\u2014except me.</p><p>Alec laid out four shot glasses\u2014after I nodded my consent\u2014and filled them to the brim with whiskey. Everyone reached for a glass, leaving the last one for me. \"Are you allowed to drink on the job?\" I asked, stalling for time as I picked mine up tentatively.</p><p>\"I can now. I'm off the clock. It's sorta hard to be on a date while I'm working.\" He winked at me again.</p><p>I gaped at him before turning to Olivia, who wore a feigned expression of innocence. And I was back to wanting to kill her. Throwing caution to the wind, I brought my glass to my lips, downing the contents in one gulp. The fiery liquid burned a path down my throat before settling in the pit of my stomach. A cough trickled up my throat, begging to be released, but I held it back as tears filled my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I couldn't believe Olivia pulled this shit on me. We had both decided after the disastrous blind date she set me up on two years ago that I would handle my own love life. The guy patted my ass so many times during our date it resembled a bruised eggplant. I finally ended the evening early, believing I was on the verge of drinking a roofie cocktail and not waking up until the next morning. The guy was a creep. Of course, the prospect of Alec touching my ass didn't sound like a bad idea.</p><p>Alec refilled our glasses again before heading around the counter to join us. We all clinked them together in the air before downing the contents and slamming the shot glasses on the counter. Everyone except me seemed to be able to handle their liquor like old pros. I remained on the verge of coughing with each drink.</p><p>After a couple shots I was already getting used to Alec's presence, which was good because the crowd around us left him no choice but to move in close. Meaning I could literally see the flecks of gold in his eyes and a small dimple in his chin I had previously missed. He stood with his arm draped casually across the back of my seat. With a little effort I could have leaned sideways into his embrace and we would have practically been hugging. The spicy dark aroma of his cologne tickled my senses. Closing my eyes briefly, I inhaled softly, imprinting the scent to my memory. I could definitely work a moment like this into my current book.</p> <p>\"Here's to the loss of the crazy cat lady,\" Olivia announced, holding up her shot glass. I meant to kick her in the shin, but I missed and nearly fell off my stool before catching myself on the counter. \"Whoa, easy, sister. We'll have to get you a seatbelt,\" she teased. I guess I was more of a lightweight drinker than I thought. My depth perception was a little off. Alec reached around from the back of my chair and handed me my shot glass that had magically been refilled. The move brought us intimately close, just like I had imagined.</p><p>I emptied the glass again without hesitation, feeling an increased level of confidence I hadn't possessed when we arrived earlier. Pressed up against the hardness of Alec's body, I had a sudden desire to snuggle in closer. From there I only meant to take a quick whiff of his neck. It was supposed to be harmless. How my mouth became involved was beyond me.</p><p>Somehow my lips found the soft warm hollow where his neck met his shoulders. Even my tongue decided to join the action, experiencing the subtle salty taste of his skin.</p><p>At first I thought I had imagined the whole thing until Alec's sharp intake of air followed by a reflex tightening of his arm caused me to pull back. My eyes met his as he studied me intently.</p><p>I wanted to drop dead. I couldn't believe I'd actually licked him. Olivia and Taylor sat giggling as I twirled away. I grabbed for the first glass I spotted on the counter and gulped it down. My hasty action caused the harsh amber liquid to go down the wrong tube, making me cough. My breath felt like dragon's fire trying to push through my airway. There would be no end to my embarrassment.</p> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>Shockingly, I did not die. That would have been too easy. Instead, I was pounded on the back by my best friend, who eyed me like she was waiting for my head to spin around.</p><p>Once I could breathe again, and the black spots disappeared from my vision, Olivia dragged me toward the ladies' room. \"Get in here,\" she said, pulling me into the handicap stall. She closed the door behind us, locking it in place.</p><p>\"Ah, we've reached a new level in our friendship. You're peeing in front of me.\"</p><p>\"Well, don't get used to it. I just don't trust you enough not to slide out the back door,\" she said, lining the toilet with a couple layers of toilet paper before sitting down.</p><p>I shot her a wry look before moving to the mirror. My face was a wreck. Thanks to the tears from my coughing explosion, my black eyeliner had smudged beneath my eyes and my cheeks were flushed. Even the knot I had gathered my hair into was sitting askew on my head. On a positive note, I no longer felt buzzed. Using my finger, I worked to repair my eyeliner so I no longer resembled a demented raccoon. By the time Olivia had finished, I had the knot back in position on my head, looking more presentable.</p> <p>Olivia washed her hands, turning to me when she was done. I leaned against the stall door with my arms folded across my chest, waiting for some kind of tongue-lashing. I probably deserved whatever she felt she had to say. \"In my defense, you said I needed to go wild, and if you remember, all I wanted was a Coke.\"</p><p>Olivia surprised me by grinning gleefully. \"That was fucking awesome. I knew you liked him. You wouldn't answer any questions yesterday at lunch, but I knew there was something there. Alec could be the one to take your flower.\" I clapped a hand across her mouth. The acoustics in the bathroom carried her voice outside the stall where I heard an eruption of giggles. \"You go, girl,\" someone said, rapping on the stall door.</p><p>\"Oops.\" Olivia's eyes danced with mirth as she laughed behind my hand.</p><p>\"Why do you insist on announcing my virginity to the freaking world?\"</p><p>\"Oh, so what? It's just a roomful of girls. Believe me, we all appreciate the significance of this moment. So, what do you think?\"</p><p>\"God, I don't know. Is this even something we should be talking about? Isn't your first time supposed to be spontaneous and exciting?\"</p><p>\"Not always. Trust me. It's nothing like the romance books you write. Sometimes the first time is wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, but looking at Alec, I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be the case. The important thing is you'll finally have it behind you and it won't be the noose you're always acting like it is.\"</p><p>\"You're talking about it like it's a foregone conclusion already. Like all I have to do is tell Alec I'm ready and he'll cooperate. What makes you think he would even want to sleep with me? We've said like five words to each other.\"</p> <p>\"Please. He's male. Of course he wants to sleep with you.\"</p><p>\"That's easy for you to say. You can get any guy you want. Even one as delicious as Alec. Just because he's male doesn't mean he wants to stick it in any girl who throws herself at him.\"</p><p>Olivia placed her hands on my shoulders. \"When are you gonna stop that shit? Girls are attractive for different reasons. So, you're not as tall as me. What does that have to do with anything? Your ass is bangin'. And look at these tits,\" she said, reaching for my bosom until I grabbed her hands.</p><p>I couldn't help but laugh even though it was clear people outside the stall were still listening. \"Cool it, freako,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Believe me, Nicole. He's interested. I can tell by the way he looks at you. The guy is definitely jonesing for more of that tongue action.\"</p><p>I backed my head against the stall and looked to the ceiling. \"I still can't believe I licked him.\" The past couple of days had become the most embarrassing of my life.</p><p>\"I wouldn't have believed it myself if I hadn't seen it.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"Like he was some freaking popsicle.\"</p><p>Her laughter bounced off the tiled walls as she doubled over. \"Go out there and tell him that and you're golden for sure.\"</p><p>\"It's not funny, Liv. I don't know what's happened to me. Never in my life have I felt this way. My entire body reacts to him anytime he's within a ten-foot radius. I feel utterly ridiculous.\"</p><p>\"It's called lust, slutbag. Trust me. Good old-fashioned lust is good for you every once in a while. It makes things interesting. Give me lust over love any day.\"</p><p>I debated asking her which one Taylor fit into. Was she in love or lust? I wasn't sure I wanted to know the answer. It was a double-edged sword. If her feelings for Taylor were based only on lust, then their relationship was superficial with no substance and would inevitably fizzle out, which had been the case with several of Olivia's relationships in the past. If that was the case, what did it mean I was feeling for Alec? Not that it should matter. How could I even consider being in love with someone I hadn't even had a full conversation with yet? This was just a means to the end of my virginity. Nothing more.</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" I asked as she fooled with my hair for a moment. Glancing in the mirror, I saw she had pulled some of the hair loose so it fell around my face, giving me a softer, sexier look.</p><p>\"I'm positive.\" She opened her purse and pulled out a tube of lip gloss.</p><p>\"I have lip gloss.\"</p><p>\"This kind is special. It plumps up your lips. Trust me, guys can't resist it.\"</p><p>She slathered on a liberal amount. A pleasant heat followed by a burning sensation covered my lips. \"What the hell, whore? My lips are on fire.\" I raised my hand to wipe them clean, but she stopped me.</p><p>\"Don't be a baby. It's got cayenne pepper in it. Sometimes beauty hurts a little.\"</p><p>\"You sound like a sick advertisement for some demented horror movie.\" Thankfully, some of the heat had dispersed and my lips no longer felt like they were melting off my face.</p><p>Olivia applied the lip gloss to herself before turning to me. \"Let's go get you laid, my trampy whore.\"</p><p>\"God help me,\" I mumbled as she led me from the bathroom toward the opposite side of the club where the lighting was much dimmer.</p><p>I leaned in close to speak over the thudding music. \"What about the guys?\"</p><p>\"Taylor texted me. They got a booth.\"</p><p>After weaving through a sea of bodies gyrating on the dance floor, we came upon a row of booths tucked into a far corner where Taylor and Alec were sitting. My heart thumped wildly in my chest as we approached. At least Alec hadn't run for the hills. I could take that as a good sign. My hope was that everyone would let my embarrassing move slide and I wouldn't be forced to explain.</p><p>Taylor stood from the booth when we arrived, allowing us to slide in to join them. A fresh round of drinks sat on the table and as we got comfortable, a waitress arrived with a plate of appetizers.</p><p>\"Wow, talk about good timing,\" Olivia said, snuggling close to Taylor.</p><p>Alec answered, winking at me. \"It's all about who you know.\"</p><p>I crossed my legs under the table, willing my body to behave. If I was going to have any shot at even starting a relationship with Alec, I would have to learn how to handle the winking that turned my insides to mush. \"Perks of the job, huh?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Most definitely.\" He slid his arm along the back of the booth where I was sitting, angling his body toward me so we could chat over the music. \"So, Olivia tells me you wrote your first book when you were a freshman. That's pretty awesome.\"</p><p>These were normally the types of situations when I looked to Olivia to rescue me, but she and Taylor were wrapped up in their own little private world. Sink or swim. If I wanted Alec, I would have to jump into the deep end myself.</p><p>\"Uh, yeah,\" I answered reaching for one of the glasses of water the hostess had brought out with the food. I took a quick sip to gather my jumbled thoughts. Come on, Nicole. Pull your head out of your ass. \"It started as an assignment for my creative writing class. My professor asked for a ten thousand-word short story, but once I started writing, I couldn't shut the story up. Before I knew it, I had seventy thousand words written.\"</p><p>\"That's seriously impressive. Would you judge me if I admitted I struggle with three thousand-word thesis papers?\" His eyes lit up when he laughed, giving him a different dimension of charm.</p><p>\"Not at all.\"</p><p>\"What if I told you on one paper I resorted to lots of quotes and narrowed the margins slightly in order to hit the ten-page requirement?\"</p><p>I laughed. \"Been there, done that.\"</p><p>\"Really? I thought writing came naturally to you.\"</p><p>\"Oh, hell no. I love to write, but about something I'm passionate about. Ask me to write a ten-page microeconomics paper and you might as well be asking me to have my teeth pulled.\"</p><p>\"That's funny. You're passionate about love stories, I guess?\" He moved his hand from the booth behind me and began lightly stroking the back of my neck. Luckily I was wearing a long-sleeved shirt, hiding the goosebumps that I felt covering my arms. His touch felt warm and inviting, tempting me to roll my head forward to give him more access. I resisted the urge, not wanting to embarrass myself more than I already had.</p><p>\"I'm a sucker for romance,\" I answered.</p><p>\"Me too.\" His arm continued forward past my neck before settling across my shoulders. He gently nudged me toward him. I took the hint, sliding along the booth until I was tucked against his body.</p><p>\"Is this okay?\" His breath tickled the inside of my ear.</p><p>I merely nodded, not wanting to take the chance that my tongue would refuse to cooperate. This was more than okay. This was exactly where I wanted to be.</p><p>\"Are you coming out to the shoot tomorrow?\" Alec asked, distracting me from my runaway thoughts.</p><p>\"I'm not sure.\" Normally I stayed away from Olivia's photo shoots unless she asked me to be there. Creatively, we both had different styles, and I had grudgingly learned that Olivia's eye for good covers surpassed mine. Occasionally, like yesterday, she would get me to come by to approve something, but beyond that, I trusted her judgment.</p><p>\"That's too bad. It would have been nice to see you again,\" Alec said, lacing his fingers through my left hand and placing them on his thigh.</p><p>If it were possible for a person to spontaneously combust, it would have happened to me the moment my hand touched his leg. \"Are you going somewhere now?\" I worked to maintain my composure, splaying out my fingers to feel the muscles beneath his jeans.</p><p>\"Not unless you want me to leave,\" he murmured, tracing his fingers over the back of my hand.</p><p>\"Good, then stay,\" I said bravely. Olivia was right. All the signs were pointing in the right direction. Unless I was completely misreading things, tonight could be the night if I wanted it to be.</p><p>\"Would you like to dance?\" He stood from the booth and extended his hand.</p><p>I looked warily at the dance floor. Everyone seemed to move effortlessly in sync with the music. I learned early in life that I was rhythmically challenged. When I was six my short stint in ballet ended when Mom and Dad figured out I had no balance. After that, they put me in jazz/tap classes, which also came to a screeching halt when my instructor informed them that I must be tone deaf. She claimed I couldn't find the beat if my life depended on it. I really wasn't devastated since I preferred to spend my spare time reading anyway. Zachary and Tony, who had been blessed with natural athletic ability, still liked to tease me mercilessly about how uncoordinated I was anytime the opportunity arose.</p><p>Despite my lack of dancing prowess, I didn't want to reject Alec's invitation. I felt I should warn him though. At least so he would know his toes were in danger. I needed a warning label on my forehead that read: May cause bodily harm when dancing within close proximity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luckily for me, the dancing gods must have been on my side since the music transitioned from a heart-pounding beat to something much slower. Ironically, it was the same song by A Great Big World that I used as a ringtone. It had to be a sign. The way things were going I seemed to have every cosmic force in the universe helping me.</p><p>Alec led us to the dance floor, pulling me gracefully into his arms with his hands on my waist. Strangely, it didn't feel nearly as uncomfortable as sitting in the booth stumbling through awkward conversation. Maybe the music combined with the soft lighting made it easier to ignore my insecurities. Whatever the reason, I felt at ease enough to loop my arms around his neck. The movement brought me against his chest where I laid my head. I could feel the gentle beating of his heart as he hugged me tightly, bringing my entire body flush with his. Our bodies fit like they were made to go together. We barely moved. The desire-laced impulses I had been fighting were clearly not one-sided. His hardened body practically spoke to me, starting from my toes until it crept into my head, bringing images of what we could do together. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. Curiously, I tilted my head up, meeting the hooded look in his eyes with mine. It didn't take a genius to know what the look meant. Even a virgin like me knew. I had written about it many times. It was a look of passion and need.</p><p>We weren't dancing as much as we just stood swaying together. Even after the music transitioned back to a fast-tempo club beat we remained in each other's arms as other dancers let loose around us. I allowed my hands to slide down his shoulders to explore his body. His tight shirt did little to hide the reaction of his nipple as I traced my finger around his pecs. It felt justified after my own unfortunate experience on the beach. His stance shifted slightly, but I had already felt the evidence of my exploration pressed against me.</p> <p>We both seemed to forget the crowd around us. Alec's hands moved from my back down to my ass where he gripped tightly and pulled me against him. If not for the music, my pleasure-filled moan would have been heard throughout the room. I nearly fell to my knees when he placed his lips on my neck, running his tongue up to my earlobe. I couldn't imagine what Olivia had to be thinking, but I also didn't care. The only thing separating Alec and me was a thin layer of clothing that I wanted to tear off at that moment. Every part of my body was his. I wanted him more than I had ever wanted anything.</p><p>I lost track of how many songs had played. It felt like we were in our own bubble\u2014like submerging yourself into a warm bath, but a million times more stimulating. My entire body hummed.</p><p>Alec breathed into my ear. \"Do you want to get out of here?\" He could have said, \"Drop to the floor right here\" for all I cared. I would have taken either. I eagerly nodded my consent.</p><p>We zigzagged quickly through the crowded dance floor like we were on a mission. I needed my purse, but also wanted to let Olivia know I was leaving. She approved, of course. Taylor and Alec fist-bumped as Olivia and I hugged goodbye. \"Text me later,\" she whispered in my ear. She then turned her attention to Alec. \"Hey, take care of my girl.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure he will,\" I answered for him without thinking. Taylor laughed until Olivia slugged him in the arm. How I managed to keep finding ways to embarrass myself was mind boggling. The comment sounded different in my head. Considering how hot my cheeks felt, my face had to be as red as a tomato.</p> <p>Alec laughed it off. \"Don't worry. She's in good hands. I'll see you tomorrow at the shoot.\" He shot Olivia a wave before placing his hand on the small of my back to lead me out.</p><p>Alec said a few goodbyes to some coworkers along the way, but eventually we made it outside the noisy club and reached his small hatchback in the employee parking lot behind the building. For some reason, I'd assumed he would drive something large to accommodate his tall frame. Not that it mattered.</p><p>He chuckled when he saw my expression. \"Has this changed your whole image of me?\"</p><p>\"Huh, no. I mean, you're\u2014you know, bigger. And your car is smaller.\" I shook my head, wishing I would stop sounding like an idiot when I spoke to him. \"It's fine. I swear. You know how sometimes you can have preconceived notions about a person and then when you see it's different from what you imagined it catches you off guard? That's all.\"</p><p>\"You mean when a guy like me who should be driving a lifted Ford Super Duty truck opens the door of his Focus instead?\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry. I know I was being stupid.\" I lowered my head again, feeling like I had ruined the mood.</p> <p>\"Hey, wait. Don't get upset. I'm agreeing with you. Actually, I think it's funny as hell, but the fact of the matter is I'm a poor college student and this baby gets forty miles to the gallon.\"</p><p>\"How do you even fit?\" I folded my body easily into the passenger side, but I was tiny in stature compared to him. I noticed the driver's seat was moved as far back as it would go, leaving no room in the backseat.</p><p>\"Carefully,\" he said, backing into the seat while he ducked his head inside the car before swinging his legs in last. \"See. Nice and snug.\"</p><p>\"Yep. Like a glove.\" I had to snicker a little. \"Good thing no one else is riding with us.\"</p><p>\"That's why I got the hatchback. Just fold the seat down and they can lay back there.\" He looked dead serious. I was on the verge of questioning his scenario before the corners of his mouth quirked into a smile.</p><p>He grabbed my hand, laughing. \"I knew you were full of shit,\" I said. At least he had a sense of humor to go along with his exceptional physical attributes. So far, Alec was adding up to be the perfect guy. Too bad this was all about sex. He had decent boyfriend potential.</p><p>\"So, your place or mine?\" He started the car and slid the transmission in reverse, waiting for my answer.</p><p>Suddenly the laughter died in my throat like someone had wrapped their hands around my throat to choke me.</p> <p>\"I should warn you. I have a roommate. Chances are he's out, but there's no guarantee.\"</p><p>\"Oh, my place works,\" I croaked. This was really happening. The air in the car felt heavy and humid. Of course, I'm sure my blood pressure had just shot up a hundred points. I reached for the temperature knob, turning the air down to cool me off. \"I hope you don't mind. I'm sweating like a pig.\" Brilliant. I couldn't believe I had said that. Comparing myself to a pig was the perfect picture he needed to keep his blood boiling. Maybe next I'd do my impression of a sheep.</p><p>\"It's all right. Make it as cool as you need.\"</p><p>I settled back in my seat, giving him directions to my apartment while I willed my nerves to behave. Second thoughts began to weigh heavily on me. I was anxious to end my virgin status, but I had always pictured my first time being with someone I loved. Not someone I lusted over.</p><p>I shook my head, trying to snap myself out of a possible change of heart. I wanted this. After tonight, when I wrote a love scene it would come from personal experience. The feelings and sensations would be legitimate. I should have done this a long time ago. Hell, this was research. Writing romance was my job. I owed it to myself and to my readers.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>The drive to my apartment passed in a countdown of mixed emotions. Just when I had myself convinced it was no big deal, Mom's voice would creep in, telling me how special sex was and that it shouldn't be casual. On the other hand, I wasn't sixteen anymore. I wasn't even eighteen. I was a real adult. If I could drink, I could have sex. Surely Mom didn't intend for me to be a virgin forever. My dad probably had other plans, but even he had to realize I couldn't be his little girl forever.</p><p>\"You okay?\" Alec asked as he merged off the highway.</p><p>I nodded my head wondering if the indecision on my face had been that obvious. Looking down, I realized his question probably stemmed from the way I was gripping the sides of my seat like I was expecting him to hit an eject button at any moment.</p><p>Alec reached over to rest his hand on mine. My fingers tensed in response before loosening so he could thread his fingers through them. He lifted our joined hands, placing them on his thigh like he had in the restaurant. This time they were higher. Like danger-zone high. Looking down at the bulge in his pants, it was clear he wanted this to happen. In a way, it flattered me. I wondered if that made me sound slutty. On the other hand, don't all women want to be desired?</p><p>Testing the waters, I moved my hand a fraction of an inch, smiling with satisfaction when he shifted in his seat. My confidence began to skyrocket at his reaction to my touch. I moved my hand a bit higher as he turned down my street. The dampness between my legs became shockingly noticeable to me, along with a dull ache that was begging to be alleviated.</p><p>Alec's fingers flinched on top of mine, but he didn't stop my hand from moving upward. My pinkie made contact with the side of his cock, which felt like a hard pipe in his jeans. I shifted in my seat, trying to alleviate the twinge of dampness between my legs. I was so worked up I nearly missed the turn into my apartment building.</p><p>At my instructions, he abruptly jerked the wheel into the parking lot. Feeling powerful and utterly sought after for perhaps the first time in my life, I placed my hand firmly on top of him, feeling the full extent of what he had to offer in his pants.</p><p>He slammed the car into park, but neither of us moved to get out. Instead, he leaned his head back and closed his eyes as my hand slowly stroked him through his jeans. His breath whistled between clenched teeth.</p><p>\"You're killing me, sweetheart.\" He reluctantly removed my hand from his lap and opened his door. I climbed from the vehicle, more than pleased with myself. I could do this. I was ready.</p><p>Alec adjusted himself before joining me at the front of the car. I couldn't help smiling. \"You look awfully happy with yourself,\" he murmured. Taking me by surprise, he lifted me effortlessly and stepped forward so my ass rested on his car. The hood was warm from the drive. He parted my legs, settling right where I wanted him.</p><p>I nearly groaned with pleasure. Actually, I think I did groan, but I couldn't say for sure. My body felt like it was controlling itself. I was just along for the ride. Hopefully, the best ride of my life.</p><p>Alec dropped his mouth to my neck, nibbling on my earlobe. I wrapped my legs around his waist to pin him against me. Not that he was going anywhere. \"You're so fucking sexy,\" he growled. His lips trailed across my lower neck to the top of my bosom. He tugged at the neckline of my shirt, nimbly popping the top two buttons open. I bucked against him at the contact. With his shirt gripped tightly in my fist, I pulled at him, practically begging for him to take it off.</p><p>The humid air outside combined with the heat we had generated between us caused a fine sheen of perspiration on our skin. \"My apartment,\" I finally managed to say when I heard the distant sound of someone chucking trash into the large bins on the far side of the parking lot.</p><p>\"Definitely,\" he said, moving his hands under my butt so I clung to him like a monkey. His lips continued to explore my neck as I pointed toward the stairs that led to my apartment. For the first time ever I wished I lived on the ground floor.</p><p>He climbed to the second floor without releasing me. When we reached my door he slowly lowered me to the ground, allowing our bodies to grind against each other. I fumbled around in my purse for my keys with my back pressed against the door. Alec stared at me in anticipation. Finally, my hand closed around them and I practically yanked the keys from my bag. Before I could negotiate the lock, Alec anchored me in place. \"I've wanted to do this since yesterday.\" His face moved forward, ready to kiss me.</p><p>\"I was a mess yesterday,\" I sighed, waiting for our lips to meet.</p><p>\"A hot mess. I wanted to rip that wet T-shirt off after you went in the water.\"</p><p>My legs had as much substance as cooked spaghetti. If he wouldn't have been holding me up, I would have fallen at his feet in a puddle. He maneuvered his body so he could part my legs with his knee. \"Yes,\" I moaned softly, grabbing at his back with my free hand.</p><p>He stopped and lowered his head to my chest. \"Good god, woman. You seriously know how to make me want you. Keep this up and I'm going to take you hard and fast against this door,\" he warned a breath away from me.</p><p>\"I dare you,\" I whispered brazenly just before his lips claimed mine. His mouth was gentle, but commanding\u2014guiding me like the conductor of a symphony. I realized quickly that I needed to rethink the way I wrote kissing scenes in my books from now on. All my male characters should use their tongues as boldly as Alec. It left me wondering, or flat-out hoping, he was as adept with his tongue in other areas. He pulled back, making me slouch with disappointment.</p><p>\"I figured we better take this party inside unless you're up for giving your neighbors an after-dinner show.\" He reached for my keys and deftly opened my front door. His lips claimed mine again as he backed me in through the doorway. What he said made sense, but all I cared about was that he didn't stop. I had entered the point of no return. Hopefully, his passion had reached the same level. He closed my front door behind us and bolted the lock. All else faded as he lifted me into his arms. I wrapped my legs snugly around his waist as my hands dragged through his hair, holding him in place as we kissed.</p><p>I pointed over my shoulder, down the short hallway. \"That way,\" I said without releasing my lips from his. With nothing but the intermittent green lights from the Internet router to guide our way, he slowly lowered me to the bed. My back touched the mattress and a second later his hard chest was pressed against mine. He settled in between my thighs. Even with clothes on, my back arched with wanting need.</p><p>Our mouths parted, but not before I nipped at his lip for good measure. He chuckled darkly, finding the opening in my shirt with his hand. With one light tug, the rest of the buttons popped open. He could have torn my shirt open for all I cared. I wiggled the shirt the rest of the way off and he murmured his approval after seeing that my bra clasped in front. His nimble fingers unsnapped it, freeing my full breasts. He massaged them greedily, using his thumb to tease my already hard nipples. He was killing me. I was on the edge of an orgasm and we hadn't done the deed yet. His hips rocked against mine. I could feel what I wanted inside his pants. It was sweet torture. As if he wanted to send me completely over the edge, his wonderfully proficient mouth took me to a new level when it closed around my nipple.</p><p>Desperation took over. I yanked at his shirt, trying to pull it over his head. I needed to feel his skin pressed against me. He rose to his knees and removed the shirt the rest of the way before throwing it to the floor. I gasped with pleasure as his naked chest covered mine and his lips took mine again. My virgin status would be gone in a few minutes. I could see the light at the end of the ecstasy-filled tunnel. Why I had waited this long was beyond my comprehension. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My movements became almost frantic under him. He responded by unclasping the snap of my jeans. I lifted my hips to allow him to slide them off when all hell broke loose.</p><p>By hell, I meant Severus, who decided at that moment to suddenly become an attack cat. In the dark room, neither Alec nor I had seen it coming, but judging by his reaction and the string of curse words that followed, Severus had gotten Alec good.</p><p>\"Motherfucker. What is that?\" Alec screeched, leaping off my bed like he had been zapped by electricity. Now that my eyes had adjusted to the darkness, I could faintly make out Alec dancing around my room with Severus clawed to his back. I tried not to laugh, but the howling coming from both of them was too hard to resist.</p> <p>\"Severus, no. Come here.\" I patted the bed, barely able to get the words out without laughing. Thankfully, he unlatched his claws from Alec's bare back and leapt onto the bed with me. He climbed on my lap, purring like nothing had happened.</p><p>Alec fumbled along my wall for the light switch. \"What the hell was that, a tiger?\" He twisted his head around trying to survey the damage on his back.</p><p>\"Sorry. It's my cat, Severus. Maybe he thought you were attacking me, I guess? I don't know. He's never acted like that before. I didn't realize cats were protective like that.\" Severus flopped over on his back, prompting me to rub his belly the way he liked. \"Did he get you good?\"</p><p>\"Protective?\" he asked incredulously, turning around so I could see the thin streaks of blood running down his back.</p><p>\"Holy shit.\" I leapt from my bed to help him, forgetting that I was essentially topless. Despite his obvious discomfort, Alec's eyes zeroed in on my ample breasts. I was ill prepared for being so exposed in the harsh light of my room. I snatched my shirt off the bed and tried to throw it on quickly, but the sleeves had been turned inside out. Clutching it in my fist, I pulled the balled-up shirt to my chest, trying to at least make sure my boobs were covered.</p> <p>Alec walked toward me. He no longer seemed concerned about Severus or the scratches on his back. He took my hands, gently tugging on them until I released my death grip on the shirt. \"We should have turned the light on from the beginning,\" he said, sliding his hands up my ribcage until he had cupped my breasts. \"You're worth being appreciated in the light. Maybe I would have seen your attack cat too.\"</p><p>I knew he was trying to lighten the mood, but I didn't want to laugh anymore. The way his hands stroked me reignited my passion like gas on a fire. \"Sorry again about that. I guess he's not used to strangers being in my room. I think Olivia is the only person besides my family who's ever been in here.\"</p><p>\"You don't bring guys home?\" He dipped his head down and ran his tongue along my shoulder.</p><p>Momentarily distracted, it took me a second to answer him.</p><p>\"Hmmm?\" he prompted.</p><p>\"You're the first,\" I admitted, trying not to blush.</p> <p>He lifted his head. \"First guy here?\"</p><p>I swallowed hard. My virginity was my own business, but I felt he deserved to know. He would probably find out anyway. \"First ever,\" I said, exhaling deeply. It was an embarrassing thing to admit considering we were about two minutes from changing that status anyway.</p><p>\"First ever?\" He pulled his hands away like I had a disease.</p><p>I wanted to tell him it was okay, that I wasn't expecting anything from him, but the words were locked in my throat. His reaction surprised me. Frankly, I didn't see the big deal. It wasn't like I was the last virgin on earth. If anything, I'd always heard guys were into being the first.</p><p>I opened my mouth to speak, but he interrupted me. \"You're a virgin?\"</p><p>\"Yes, so what?\" Until now, I had always been embarrassed and even a little ashamed for my lack of sexual experience, but his tone was making me feel more defensive than I deserved. It was almost like he was expecting an apology or something. I stepped back and snatched my shirt from the floor to cover myself. I should have known this would turn out bad. Who was he to judge me? It wasn't like I just told him I had an STD. He should be glad to know I was squeaky clean, which was more than he could probably say.</p><p>He sighed, running his hand through his hair. \"A virgin? How did I miss that?\" He bent over to pick up his shirt off the floor. \"I know how. I let my little head out think my big head.\" He spoke without even looking at me, like I wasn't in the room. I fucking hated that.</p><p>As he shrugged on his shirt, I had the sudden urge to slug him in the face. It may have been a bit immature, but for a second I was glad Severus had clawed him. \"What the hell is your problem?\" I asked, throwing on a tee shirt I had grabbed from my dresser drawer.</p> <p>He sighed again, tugging on his shoes. \"Look, Nicole. You're cool. And I'm not going to lie. I wanted this. More than I'd like to admit,\" he said, adjusting himself. \"But I don't sleep with virgins.\"</p><p>His words slashed through me. They shouldn't have, but even as pissed as I was becoming, my armor wasn't that strong. I crossed my arms across my chest, trying to maintain my composure. My face was sure to give away my true feelings, but I couldn't let him see my hurt. \"What does that even mean? Are you really that vain?\"</p><p>\"It's not you. It's just a rule I have. Virgins expect more. They want more, and they're willing to do whatever's necessary to get it.\"</p><p>\"'Get it?' Because the it you have is so desirable?\"</p><p>Two minutes ago the answer to that question had been a resounding yes. There was nothing I wanted from him except his body. What else did he have to offer? Nothing that I needed. I was quite happy with the path my life had taken. His rejection had taken all the appeal from him. The desire and lust that had been dictating my emotions for the last twenty-four hours was gone. I wanted nothing except for him to leave.</p><p>Luckily, it appeared we both agreed on that point. He couldn't seem to get out of my room and apartment fast enough. I was still standing flabbergasted in the middle of my room when I heard the front door softly close. The tears of anger, mortification and hurt I had been holding back came spilling out.</p><p>I robotically made sure the front door was locked before heading to my bathroom. Peering at myself in the mirror, my hands reached out to grip the sink when the full impact of his rejection hit me. I felt stupid. Tarnished.</p><p>Turning away from my mocking reflection, I stripped out of my clothes and twisted the knob of my shower to the hot setting. The water washed over me, mixing with my tears.</p><p>I stayed in the shower until I cried myself out and my attitude had hardened. To hell with him and his no-virgin rule. He could boink as many sluts as he wanted. I had clearly dodged a bullet. I only wished I didn't feel like I was lying to myself.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Music chimed from my cell phone the next morning to wake me up. Obviously, I would need to change that song now. When it played at the club while Alec and I danced, I had believed it was fate, but now it was a shitty reminder of a night gone badly. The sucky part was that I liked A Great Big World. I guess I'd have to find another one of their songs to use as a ringtone.</p><p>I reached for my cell phone without opening my eyes. \"Yeah,\" I answered, already knowing it was Olivia. I even knew what her first words would be.</p><p>\"Sleep all day, why don't you? You were supposed to text me. I need the details, slutbag,\" she demanded.</p><p>I sighed, opening my eyes. They felt raw, but were at least dry. I hated crying and couldn't believe I had succumbed to tears the night before. \"What time is it?\" I answered in a monotone voice.</p><p>\"Almost one. Did you do it so many times you can't even get out of bed? Alec wouldn't spill any of the deets at the shoot this morning, so fess up.\"</p><p>I had forgotten about the shoot. At least I knew Alec had remained tight-lipped about what happened, but I couldn't figure out why. Maybe he assumed that since Olivia and I were friends that I would tell her. I'm sure he was also hoping what happened wouldn't affect his opportunity to earn money for the modeling gig. \"There's nothing to tell,\" I said, rolling over.</p><p>\"That's what Alec said too. Did you two rehearse your answers or something? What do you mean 'nothing'? I saw you two dancing. You were all over each other. I was sweating just watching you. Matter of fact, Taylor wanted me to thank you because he got lucky last night because of it.\"</p><p>I actually appreciated how funny that was, but I still wasn't ready to laugh. I couldn't even find a sarcastic retort. At least someone had gotten lucky last night. Not that I was blaming Olivia. This wasn't her fault. Sure, she'd been behind the blind date, but I knew she would never have orchestrated the whole thing if she knew what a dick Alec was.</p><p>\"Nicole? Are you alright?\" She sounded worried, and I realized several seconds had passed since her question.</p><p>\"I mean, we didn't do the deed. He freaked when he found out I was still a virgin.\"</p><p>\"No fucking way. You mean to tell me he did the old enter-and-retreat?\"</p><p>Severus, who had been snuggled up along my side, stood up and stretched. I reached over and stroked my hand down his back. \"We didn't even get that far. I told him beforehand.\"</p><p>\"Why? Why would you mention it?\"</p><p>\"Does it matter why I mentioned it? What about the fact that it shouldn't matter?\" I snapped at her.</p><p>She let out a loud breath of air. \"You're right. It doesn't matter. He's an asshat. What guy doesn't want to bang a virgin? It's like the Holy Grail.\"</p><p>My anger dissipated instantly as a reluctant smile spread across my face. \"I know, right? That's what I thought, but not to him, I guess.\"</p><p>\"Did he give a reason?\"</p><p>\"Not really. Truthfully, I just want to put it behind me. Trust me when I say it wasn't my finest moment.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry, babe. It's his loss. I'm glad he didn't get to be your first. You deserve better. Your first time should be special.\"</p><p>I appreciated her loyalty. There was a reason Olivia and I had been friends for so long. We took care of each other first, no matter what. Besides, deep down, what happened between Alec and me last night had been special until he found out my secret and freaked. Even lying in bed now, I remembered his touch on my skin. The way he kissed me. The hardness of his body against mine. It felt wrong to have those thoughts in my head. They were traitorous. Thinking about him would do me no good.</p><p>Olivia and I chatted for a few minutes more. She even suggested she would find another model for my cover. I weighed the notion without replying. I honestly wasn't sure how I felt about it. Thankfully, Olivia dropped the subject, asking if I wanted to grab lunch. I declined the offer. My plans for the next couple days would consist of not leaving the house at all. I had several takeout menus on hand so I wouldn't starve, but I planned on submerging myself into my manuscript. I'd had enough human contact to last me awhile.</p><p>Olivia disapproved, but didn't push. Once we ended our call, I turned my ringer off. For the next forty-eight hours I was cutting myself off from the outside world.</p><p>I threw my hair up into a messy bun and pulled on my favorite pair of yoga pants and a sweatshirt. To make sure I wouldn't get hot, I turned the AC down in my apartment. It was backward thinking, but I preferred it cold while I was writing.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I snuggled into my writing chair with a large glass of iced coffee. It wasn't as good as Starbucks, but it would have to do. Severus climbed up on the cat tree I kept between the window and my chair. I reached out to pet him while my computer booted up. He purred, appreciating the attention before curling up into a ball as I started to type.</p><p>Over the next couple of days, Severus and I didn't move except to scrounge for food, use the bathroom and to fall in a heap on my bed when my eyes refused to stay open a moment longer.</p><p>This particular writing marathon killed two birds with one stone. I finished my novel ahead of my deadline, and I was able to successfully push thoughts of Alec to the far recesses of my mind. Grudgingly, I had to admit his rejection helped my story. I was able to draw from my feelings and weave them into the story. In the end I was pleased with the way it had turned out.</p><p>Blurry eyed and more than a little dizzy from a lack of moving around, I headed to the bathroom to wash away the grime from two days without a shower. Feeling lazy, I decided to run a bath so I could shave my legs and spoil myself a little.</p><p>For the rest of the day I caught up on social media, contacting bloggers about my upcoming release, and preparing swag that I would need to send out on Monday.</p><p>Olivia had sent me an email with the cover while I had been in lockdown. I hadn't opened it yet. Alec's mocking face wasn't something I had been ready to see. In the end, I knew I was being ridiculous, so I finally clicked the link to open the file.</p><p>I studied the cover art for a few minutes, trying to analyze it for how well it captured the essence of my story rather than the fact that Alec's hypnotizing eyes were staring back at me. I had been wondering if I made the right choice by not telling Olivia to find another model. Seeing the finished product, I had to admit, I was glad I hadn't said anything. The cover for Wickedly Lovely was stunning. It was easily Olivia's best work to date. Natasha was as beautiful as ever, but it was Alec who brought the cover to life. Olivia had been right all along. He was a natural. Readers were going to immediately take to him. He embodied the very essence of the book boyfriend that all females wanted. Plus, he was a dead ringer for my main character, Harrison. Alec's face alone would make me want to pick up the book.</p><p>Along with the cover files, Olivia had also sent mock-ups for bookmarks and magnets, which she said she would order if I liked the proofs. I had a full schedule of indie book signing events during the coming months and the swag was good for promoting my titles. Hopefully, I could get some buzz going for the new series. The idea of launching something new scared the hell out of me. Just because my first series had done well didn't guarantee readers would take to my new stuff. I felt my writing had improved with each book, so hopefully that would be evident in the story.</p><p>That night I actually went to bed at a normal time. I guess I didn't realize how exhausted I had been. The cover for Wicked Lovely remained on my mind as I drifted to sleep. More accurately, Alec was on my mind, which carried over into my dreams. Distorted images of our failed night together filled my subconscious. We'd get right to the point of the actual deed and then something would interrupt us and we would start over again. It was frustrating and appealing at the same time.</p><p>Dreaming about near orgasms all night left me throbbing with desire by the time I finally woke before dawn. I debated taking a cold shower, but my body wanted more. Sliding my hand into my pajama bottoms, I could feel how wet the dreams had made me. I closed my eyes and conjured images of Alec and what he could have done with his tongue. My finger slid inside me easily as my body moved against my hand. I imagined it was Alec touching me. My breathing became labored and I moaned as if he were lying on top of me. I felt like I should stop, but my hand wouldn't cooperate. My release came almost immediately. I lay in bed motionless, wondering if I should feel bad for getting myself off over a guy who had rejected me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I managed to fall back asleep before waking again several hours later. The ache was gone, but I felt bereft. What I had done earlier was a poor substitution for the real deal, but maybe I wasn't being honest with myself. If so, I might have to admit I still wanted Alec.</p><p>I was tired of pondering it either way so I climbed from bed to get my day going. Every Sunday I gave my apartment a good cleaning, including tossing my bedding into my washing machine and dusting every surface area. I vacuumed my bedroom and living room and then gathered all the takeout binge-eating trash that was stacked on the counter from the last two days.</p><p>Once I finished, I showered and got dressed to head over to Mom and Dad's for afternoon dinner.</p> <p>I was the last to arrive when I got to my childhood home a half an hour later. Zachary and Tony were on the front lawn tossing a football while Zachary's forever girlfriend, Ashley, sat on the porch swing reading a book.</p><p>Zachary gave me a crushing one-armed hug. \"What did you bring for dessert?\"</p><p>\"Nice try. I know for a fact it was your turn to bring dessert. I hope it's something decadent and super rich. I've been holed up in my apartment for two days and my sweet tooth is weeping from neglect.\"</p><p>\"Lucky for you, Ash made her famous Hershey's chocolate bar brownies. If you're good, maybe I'll share,\" he teased, rubbing the top of my head with his knuckles.</p><p>I squirmed away before he could do any more damage. \"Douche-breath,\" I grumbled, trying to smooth my hair.</p> <p>\"Zach, you know she doesn't like that,\" Tony said, chastising him as he pulled me in for a quick hug before placing a wet finger in my ear.</p><p>\"Gah, are you two ever going to grow up?\" I swung at him, but he was too quick and easily darted out of the way. I stomped toward the porch, glaring at them both.</p><p>Ashley shook her head sympathetically as I climbed the porch steps. \"Your brothers.\"</p><p>\"Hey, Ash.\" I greeted her with a hug that didn't involve noogies or wet willies. \"I know, right? Mom should have given them back when they were born. I now know why some species eat their young.\"</p><p>Ashley laughed. She and Zachary had been dating long enough for her to know how things worked in my family. She knew deep down we all loved each other, even if at times I wanted to bury them in a shallow grave. \"What are you reading?\" I asked, trying to catch a glimpse of the cover.</p><p>\"That one you picked up for me at your last book event.\" She moved her hand to show me the cover of my friend Melissa Brown's newest book.</p> <p>\"Oh, that's such a good book. I read the entire thing during my flight from Chicago last month.</p><p>\"I'd believe it,\" Ash chuckled. \"I just started it this morning and I'm almost done. The writing is flawless.\"</p><p>\"I agree. Plus, the storyline is freaking amazing.\"</p><p>She stood from the porch swing to follow me inside. \"How's your book coming along?\"</p><p>I shot her a smile. Ash was a beta reader for me, which meant she was one of the first people to read my books and give suggestions on the story before release. Some writers used more beta readers than others, but Olivia and Ash worked perfectly for me. I figured too many cooks in the kitchen would ruin the meal. \"Funny you should ask. I actually finished it last night,\" I told her, smiling broadly when she jumped up and down like a kid in a candy store. Hopefully that enthusiasm would carry over when she read it. Wicked Lovely was different from my previous work, and I was worried about my readers' reactions to it.</p><p>She rubbed her hands together greedily. \"When do I get it?\"</p><p>I waited to answer as Mom engulfed me in a delicate hug that smelled like her favorite perfume. It was a scent she had worn for as long as I could remember. Dad made sure to replenish her supply every Valentine's Day. \"You look tired,\" she said, staring me in the face.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Her mom radar was always on. \"I don't know why,\" I lied easily.</p> <p>Ash chuckled behind me, earning her the same look I had given my brothers outside. No book for you, I mouthed. Her expression went from humorous to horrified in an instant.</p><p>Mom was too busy clucking over the bags under my eyes to pay attention to our exchange. \"Why do you look peaked? Are you eating right?\"</p><p>\"Mom, you just saw me last Sunday. How could I have completely fallen apart in one week?\"</p><p>She held me at arm's length, studying my face intently. \"A mother knows. You're working too hard. You have to stop pushing yourself like this.\"</p><p>\"I know, Mom, but believe me, I'm fine. I just haven't slept all that well the last few nights, that's all.\" Of course, I neglected to mention the reason why I hadn't been sleeping. There was no way I would admit the source of my insomnia was a guy. That was a can of worms I wasn't willing to open. I gave her a quick peck on the cheek to distract her. \"By the way, Olivia sent me the cover proof for Wicked Lovely. Do you two want to see it?\"</p><p>\"Oh, I do,\" Ash chimed in, bouncing up and down. Her enthusiasm was infectious and was one of my favorite things about her. Zachary was a complete asshat for not proposing to her yet. My worst fear was that Ash would eventually get sick of waiting for him to pop the question and move on. I loved my brother dearly, but if that happened I would have to disown him.</p><p>Pulling out my phone, I clicked on my pictures icon where I had already stored the new cover. Both Mom and Ashley reacted with the appropriate enthusiasm I had expected.</p><p>\"Oh my. That's what I call smoking,\" Ash said, fanning herself as Zachary and Tony came in from outside.</p><p>Zachary looked over, understandably curious. \"Let me see,\" he demanded, holding out his hand for my phone. I debated not giving it to him. Alec had been a complete monkey's ass the other night, but I wasn't all that keen on hearing him being criticized.</p><p>Tony peered over his shoulder and I could tell they both wanted to find something negative to say, but neither of them could find anything.</p><p>\"Too bad he's gay,\" Zachary finally said, handing the phone back to me.</p><p>I should have kept my mouth shut. It was an easy out. Let them assume Alec was gay. But no, I had to open my mouth like a complete dipshit. \"Alec is definitely not gay,\" I stated with more emphasis than I intended.</p><p>Everyone's eyes pivoted to me, including Dad's and my other brother Riley's, who had walked in on the tail end of the conversation. \"Who's not gay?\" my dad asked. Great. Big Mouth Nicole had struck again.</p><p>\"Apparently, 'Alec is definitely not gay,'\" Zachary said, snapping his fingers in the air.</p><p>\"Zach, stop teasing her,\" Ash said, coming to my defense.</p><p>Dad kissed me on the cheek and walked to the fridge to fill a glass he had pulled from the cabinet with ice. \"Who's Alec?\" He sat his glass on the counter and cracked open a can of Diet Coke.</p><p>\"The model on her new cover. Quite the looker, I must say,\" mom said, winking at me.</p><p>Before I could react, Riley snuck up behind me and snatched the cell phone from my hand. \"Oh yeah? If he's got Mom singing his praises, he must be something special,\" he said, swiping the screen to reveal the cover picture. \"Holy shit. Oops.\" He covered his mouth and ducked out of the way when Mom swiped at his head with a dish towel. Even though we were all adults, my mom would not tolerate cussing in the house. \"Sorry, Mom. That's just a very pretty man in that picture.\"</p><p>\"Pretty? Maybe you're the one who's gay,\" Tony said, grabbing Riley in a headlock. They wrestled around, nearly knocking Dad's drink from his hands.</p><p>\"Hey, knock it off,\" Dad yelled. My brothers stopped roughhousing immediately. He had always kept my brothers under control, and they knew when they had pushed him to the limits. \"So what if this Alex is gay? It's none of our business.\"</p><p>\"It's Alec, and he's not gay. I mean, I don't think he's gay,\" I lamented lamely, trying to fix my mistake. At this point it was a lost cause. I had already put my foot in my mouth. Zachary's and Tony's eyes sparkled, obviously sensing a conspiracy. Even Mom looked delighted, like she could read my mind. Shit. Shit and double shit. She'd have me married off before the evening was over if it was up to her.</p><p>\"Be still, my heart. I think our Nikki Pooh has a crush,\" Riley proclaimed. And to think he was my favorite brother. We were the closest since we were only a year apart. What a traitor. See if I asked him to do the playlist for Wicked Lovely now. Riley had aspirations of becoming a producer after studying music in college. He was actually quite talented and could play seven instruments. Still, music genius or not, he could stick it.</p><p>\"I do not.\" I wished I had more conviction in my words, but how could I when I didn't believe them myself? Instead, my traitorous lack of a poker face decided to show up.</p><p>\"There it is, ladies and gentlemen. Nikki Red has shown up for the party,\" Zachary laughed, using the nickname they had coined for me when we were kids because my cheeks would blush bright red from embarrassment.</p><p>\"Boys, stop teasing your sister,\" Mom said. I shot her a grateful look, hoping we could all return to being adults. \"Now, tell me all about this boy who has you so worked up,\" she added, slinging an arm across my shoulders.</p><p>I sighed. They were all incorrigible. \"Mom, I'm not worked up. I just meant to say I went out with him and he's not gay.\" I was doing a horrible job of thinking before I spoke. The words came out before I could stop them. Seriously, I needed to cut out my tongue.</p><p>Suddenly no one had anything to say. They all looked more shocked than anything. It wasn't that farfetched of an idea that I had a date. Maybe in their eyes Alec was out of my ballpark or something, but they didn't have to look like I'd just told them I was carrying Satan's baby. \"I have to use the bathroom,\" I said, walking away before they could say another word.</p><p>Closing the bathroom door behind me, I sighed with relief when I twisted the lock and heard it engage. The downstairs bathroom was only a half bath with a pedestal sink and a toilet, but it felt like a luxurious sanctuary after the barracuda's nest I had just left. I knew they would pounce on me the moment I opened the door, but for now I was safe.</p><p>Gripping the cold porcelain of the sink, I glanced in the mirror and nearly startled myself at the almost wild look in my eyes. No wonder they had all been eyeing me like I'd gone off the deep end. I was being utterly ridiculous. I needed to get over Alec. Just because he was on my new cover didn't mean I'd have to see him again. I'd also tell Olivia not to use him on any of my covers in the future. She'd understand.</p><p>When I resurfaced from the bathroom I didn't get the full-blown inquisition I had been expecting. I didn't know if I should have felt insulted or relieved. Maybe Mom and Dad had told my brothers to lay off. Whatever the reason, no one uttered another word about Alec. Instead, the conversation shifted to the Rays game that was about to start. We sat in front of the TV eating pizza like every other Sunday.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\"Don't be mad.\"</p><p>Nothing good ever came from those words. Truthfully, their use together should be stricken from the English language.</p><p>I paused the show I had been binge watching. Anytime I finished a book I allowed myself an entire day of mindless TV. I'd watch an entire season of one of my favorite shows without any guilt. This time I picked one of my favorite shows on HGTV and I didn't want to miss it. I shifted my phone to my other ear. \"What did you do?\" I asked Olivia.</p><p>\"First, you need to remember that I always have your best interests at heart. You know I'm your biggest cheerleader when it comes to your victories and milestones. I want nothing more than N.S. Blake to be a household name. I feel your brand is the most important thing at the moment and that we should be working aggressively to build it.\" Her words poured out like a tidal wave.</p><p>\"What did you do?\" I repeated.</p><p>\"Fine. It's no big deal anyway. I answered one of the emails that you haven't gotten a chance to get to yet.\"</p><p>I waited. So far she wasn't confessing to anything she hadn't done before. Olivia not only helped with my covers, but she also acted as an assistant when she knew I was deep in my writing cave. She helped me answer emails and keep my schedule organized.</p><p>When I didn't speak, she continued. \"Anyway, Indie Booklicious Con wanted to know if you would participate in their Cover-Extravaganza. Naturally, it seemed like a great idea. I know that you wanted to get the word out for Wicked Lovely, so I figured it was a win-win situation.\"</p><p>Her words sounded reasonable. I couldn't argue with anything she had said, and yet, the way she acted it didn't take an Einstein to know there was a boom on the way. It had to be a doozy the way she was buttering me up.</p><p>\"So, I told them you would absolutely like to participate this weekend at the signing, and that you would be happy to bring your cover model with you.\" She spoke quickly, like she felt if she got the words out fast enough I wouldn't have time to object.</p><p>I shook my head even though she couldn't see me. There was no way that my best friend, who I loved, who I trusted above anyone else, would do this to me again. Especially after I basically told her I would rather poke my eyes out with a rusty fork than see Alec again.</p><p>\"What are you telling me, Liv?\" I rubbed my temple to ease the sudden headache that had popped up.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Nic, but I honestly feel it's the best thing for you at the moment. We both know from your last book event in Chicago that bringing your cover model with you has become popular. Readers like taking pictures with them. It makes them feel like they're getting a chance to actually step into your pages.\"</p><p>I closed my eyes in resignation. I knew she was right. We had even talked about it after the Chicago signing. It was a great marketing advantage and definitely attracted attention at signings. Up to this point I had shied away from bringing attention to myself at events. Talking to new people was something I was still getting used to. I envied my writer friends who were naturally outgoing at the signings. They interacted and engaged their readers in a way I hadn't done yet. Making it through one signing with Alec could help change that.</p><p>\"Nicole?\" Olivia said my name cautiously, waiting for me to bite her head off.</p><p>\"Okay,\" I answered, giving in.</p><p>\"Okay?\" She squealed jubilantly.</p><p>\"Yes, okay. I'm not going to say I'm crazy about the idea, but I know if I want this new book to make its way into the hands of new readers, I need to step outside my comfort zone. I feel like I'm being thrown into the deep end of the pool with Alec, but I'm sure I'll survive. And hey, if I don't, you'll get all my stuff. Just make sure Severus is taken care of.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"It's a good thing you're not being dramatic or anything,\" she said dryly. \"So, if it's settled and you're not going to kill me, I'll set it up with Alec. I'm sure he'll jump at the chance for more exposure and to\u2014\" Her words stopped as she remembered who she was talking to.</p><p>\"That's fine, Liv. Just make sure you lay down the ground rules.\"</p><p>\"Ground rules?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, like no fondling the women during the signing, and no going home with anyone.\" I'm sure my rules sounded ludicrous. It wasn't like I could dictate who Alec could and couldn't flirt with, let alone who he slept with.</p><p>\"Uh, Nicole. I think Alec knows the boundaries of being professional.\"</p><p>\"Fine. I just want to make sure he understands we're promoting my book. Not finding him a date,\" I snapped, taking out my aggravation on her. I ended the call abruptly before I could say anything else stupid.</p><p>The rest of my week passed in a flurry of activity that was broken up by bouts of self-doubt. Wicked Lovely had been sent to my editor, and I decided to take the week off from writing to prepare for the signing that weekend. Olivia came over midweek to help me pack my inventory and sort through my swag. Neither of us mentioned Alec.</p><p>Instead, we talked about how since Indie Booklicious Con was being held in Orlando, this would be the first significant signing my family would be attending. I was nervous about their expectations. My reader following was slowly growing, but there were plenty of other authors at the signing who had diehard fans. I had to remind myself that this signing was about the new series. It was about putting myself out there.</p> <p>I couldn't help teasing Olivia about seeing my brothers. It was common knowledge in our household that Tony had been crushing on Olivia for years. She had shot him down numerous times, claiming she wouldn't let some guy ruin her friendship with me. Dating Tony would inevitably do that. Tony remained persistent and never let an opportunity to flirt with her slide by. This Saturday would be interesting since we were all going to dinner after the signing and Taylor would be joining us.</p><p>Olivia laughed it off, but I knew her well enough to know she was also nervous about Saturday. At least it wouldn't just be me who might become frazzled.</p><p>Friday night Olivia and I headed out to hang out with some of my blogger and author friends who had arrived a day early for the signing. It had become a ritual of ours to get together anytime we did the same events. There was an organized mix-and-mingle party at the hotel where the signing was being held.</p><p>To save time in the morning, our plan was to drop off my stuff for the signing tonight since we'd be there for the mixer anyway. The hotel lobby was abuzz with groups of convention-goers scattered around the large room talking and gossiping about everything from the latest books they had read to who said what and why on social media. Over the last year that I'd been attending these types of events, I had come to realize writing was such a solitary experience that when you got a bunch of authors and book lovers together, a pent-up noise explosion was sure to follow. At times it could be overwhelming, but for the most part it was fabulous hanging with so many people with common interests.</p><p>\"You want a drink?\" Olivia asked, scanning the room for the bar.</p><p>I shook my head. \"You go ahead.\" I had spotted Melissa across the room and wanted to chat with her.</p> <p>\"You sure? Not even a Coke?\"</p><p>\"Maybe in a little while.\"</p><p>\"Okay. I'll be back in a few.\"</p><p>I nodded. \"I'll be with Melissa and Tracey over there,\" I said, heading toward two of my friends I had met through Facebook. The idea that I had met so many people online was funny to me. It reminded me of the dating sites I would see commercials for on TV, but for friendships.</p><p>\"Nicole!\" Melissa greeted me in her normal exuberant way, giving me a tight hug. \"What took you so long to get here?\"</p><p>\"I had to drop off all my crap in the ballroom,\" I answered, giving Tracey a hug. \"When did you guys arrive?\"</p><p>\"I got here a couple hours ago,\" Tracey answered.</p><p>\"Me too,\" Melissa added, taking a sip from her drink. \"Is it always armpit hot down here?\"</p> <p>\"This is nothing. Wait till August. When you live here you learn to go from one air conditioned spot to another.\"</p><p>\"My family came along so we could visit the Mouse House. My kids have been dying to go to Disney, but we're going to be like fried eggs out there,\" Tracey said dryly.</p><p>Melissa and I laughed. By the time Olivia joined us, we were all comparing the good and bad of our home states. Eventually, more and more people joined our group until we had about a dozen different conversations going on. The tension I had been feeling during the week began to sap away, and for the rest of the evening Alec became an afterthought.</p><p>Our late night made it hard to get up the next day. Olivia and I were grumpy and barely spoke until I drove through a Starbucks and picked us up a couple of coffees. The caffeine didn't help my nerves, which were already on edge. Alec may not have been on my mind last night, but this morning was a different story. The thoughts bounced around my head like a ping-pong ball on crack, painting different scenarios of how our interaction today would go.</p><p>Would he say something about that night, or pretend it never happened? The last thing I wanted was to create a scene and become the topic of the latest gossip in everyone's Facebook groups. As long as Alec and I both acted like professionals, the day would work out fine.</p><p>The closer we got to the hotel, the more anxious I became. My stomach was tied in knots. If I didn't have Olivia with me, I would have considered skipping the event. Luckily, she was my rock and would drag me inside if she had to. Not to mention, my family and readers would be disappointed.</p><p>\"You okay?\" Olivia asked as I pulled into a parking spot. Her voice startled me. I didn't realize I had been gripping the steering wheel like it was a life preserver.</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" I lied, opening my door and forcing my body out of the jeep.</p><p>Olivia carried our coffees while I signed us in and collected our ID lanyards from the convention's registration desk. People from different directions waved and called out greetings to us as we headed toward the large banquet room to set up. Inside, dozens of authors scurried about like busy bees organizing their tables with books, swag and other types of merchandise to sell. Tall banners were being assembled and placed prominently around the room. Some of the authors were quite creative with their displays.</p><p>Olivia and I were currently fighting with the stand for my vertical banner when the subtle scent of Alec's cologne caught my attention. I realized how sad it was to be able to recognize him by his cologne, but the smell seemed to be engrained into my senses. Of course he would walk up when I was bent over with my ass in the air.</p><p>\"Need some help there?\"</p><p>\"No, we got it.\" Olivia looked at me without saying a word, but I knew she was questioning the harshness of my response.</p><p>\"If you say so,\" he replied.</p><p>I could practically see the shit-eating grin on his face without turning around. Mocking me wasn't going to get our day off to a good start. My hand closed around one of the metal bars from my banner stand. For a moment, I considered whacking him in the nuts, but I counted to ten in my head to calm down. It came to my attention since meeting Alec a few weeks ago that I'd developed quite the violent tendencies. I was becoming downright demented. My brothers would be so proud. Zachary and Tony always claimed I was too much of a pushover.</p><p>Alec stood idly by while Olivia and I fought and cursed my banner, trying to get it extended to its full height. The problem was neither of us was tall enough to lock it into place at the top. Olivia opened her mouth to ask Alec for help, but I shot her a look that stopped her. Reaching over with my free hand, I dragged my chair closer so I could stand on it to click the banner into place. I may have knocked over my boxes in the process, but it was better than asking for Alec's help.</p><p>Just as I stepped off the chair to pat myself on the back, the banner came undone at the top of the stand and tumbled at my feet. Olivia snorted, trying to hide her laughter. She turned away and knelt down to pick up the boxes I had knocked over.</p><p>\"Here, let me,\" Alec said, stepping in close behind me. The scent of his cologne wrapped around me like a warm blanket on the coldest of days. I closed my eyes, inhaling it in deeply.</p><p>I finally turned around to face him, convinced I could handle it without cracking. I was wrong and right at the same time. Physically, I was able to hide my emotions behind a mask of indifference, but inside I was mess. \"Fine,\" I said, stepping away from the banner. Dragging my chair with me, I slid around to the other side of the table and began setting up my books.</p><p>I watched from the corner of my eye as Alec finished assembling the stand in no time at all. It didn't escape my notice when his shirt pulled up slightly, hinting at the full set of abs I had run my hands over intimately. Glancing around the room, it became evident I wasn't the only one who had noticed him.</p><p>Alec was clearly the topic of conversation among several women who suddenly seemed more concerned with his ass than finishing the setup of their displays. I didn't know whether to laugh or flip them off. Actually, I couldn't blame them. I had firsthand experience with how sexy he was. I'd felt his hands and lips on my body. My legs had wrapped around his narrow waist, feeling every glorious hard inch of him.</p><p>\"I'll be right back,\" I said, rising abruptly from the table.</p><p>Olivia looked surprised, holding a handful of bookmarks. \"Wait, what about your table?\"</p><p>\"Just put the finishing touches on it. I trust you. I'll only be a minute anyway.\" I had to get away to collect myself. The very body that I was sitting there lustfully reminiscing about was the same one that had left me hanging high and dry and practically humiliated. Several people tried to get my attention as I walked by, probably to ask about Alec, but I dodged them with the excuse of a bladder emergency as I quickly made my way into the main hallway.</p><p>Thankfully, I found the bathroom empty. As it turned out, I hadn't lied after all. I really did have to pee. Once I finished, I deliberately stayed in the bathroom washing my hands as long as possible before I knew I absolutely had to get back to my table.</p><p>Walking through the lobby on the way back to the banquet room, I spotted the long line of readers waiting to get into the signing. Their excited chatter echoed down the hallway, making the butterflies in my stomach flutter. Picking up my pace, I entered the banquet room and saw everyone at their tables, ready to go.</p><p>\"Two minutes,\" a voice announced over the loud speaker.</p><p>I waved to a few more of my friends in passing before finally reaching my table, which looked fantastic. Olivia had outdone herself again. My books were creatively stacked and prominently displayed on one side of the table while my bookmarks were fanned out on the other. She had even laid out my two favorite signing pens along with a fresh can of Coke. \"Thank you,\" I said, giving her a quick hug. \"I'm sorry for acting like a freak.\"</p><p>\"It's cool. You know I'm here for you. Just remember what you're here for. This is your chance to shine.\" She squeezed my hand and collected the empty boxes to stack under the table and out of sight.</p><p>Olivia was right and I knew that. I just needed to suck it up and do my job. Alec stepped out from behind the banner he had been moving into place. In my absence he had removed his shirt, which shouldn't have been shocking considering it was part of the plan. He looked amazing, which was why he was here. Now all I had to do was avoid any physical contact with him and I'd be fine.</p><p>As I made my way around the table to my chair, my foot caught on the leg of the table next to me and I stumbled forward. I would have landed face first if not for Alec's firm hand reaching out to grasp my upper arm. He had saved me from possibly a bloody lip or a case of rug burn on my face, but my plan to avoid physical contact with him had lasted all of thirty seconds. That had to be a world record.</p><p>His hand remained on my bicep even after I had found my footing. Our eyes met as I waited for him to release me. I was powerless to pull away. We both acted like we had something to say, but the time wasn't right. Not here.</p><p>The buzzing of voices entered the room as the doors opened and the line of people that had been waiting poured in. Something in my eyes must have clicked with Alec because he abruptly dropped my arm. I scooted around him, sinking into my chair as he took his spot, standing at the front of the table. Olivia raised her eyebrows at me, but I shook her off. I could barely figure out my behavior, let alone explain it to her.</p><p>It didn't take long for Alec to attract the attention he was brought here to get as clusters of women began converging on my table. Surprisingly, many of them were not shy about expressing their feelings for him.</p><p>One woman in particular even asked for my opinion as she waited for her turn to get close to him. \"Have you ever seen a set of abs like that?\"</p><p>\"Of course. Right here,\" I replied meekly, handing her a Wicked Lovely bookmark. I wasn't ready for this kind of attention so quickly.</p><p>\"That's him? I think I've died and gone to hunk-a-luscious heaven.\" She fanned herself with the program she was handed at the door.</p><p>\"Oh sweet decadence,\" the woman with her said, snatching up one of the bookmarks for herself. \"It doesn't come out till July? I need to read this now,\" she whined. \"Will you at least sign these for us?\"</p><p>\"My pleasure,\" I said, removing the cap from my silver pen.</p><p>As they waited, one of them reached for one of my older titles. \"And these are your other books?\"</p><p>\"Yes. Do you read historical romance?\"</p><p>\"Girl, I read anything steamy,\" she said, turning the book over to read the synopsis. \"Wait. I've seen this on Amazon. I've actually had it on my to-be-read list. I might as well get it now so I can add it to my autographed book collection.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" her friend added.</p><p>Olivia handled the transaction while I finished signing and personalizing the copies of their books. The rest of the day progressed in much the same manner. The crowd never thinned out. I had to hand it to Alec and the way he'd handled the attention like a pro. He'd taken endless pictures, been touched countless times, tolerated pecks on the cheek and even a couple butt pinches. He had even been propositioned more than once and simply ogled more times than I could count. All the Wicked Lovely swag I had brought was gone, and the excitement for its release seemed tangible. It was a mentally draining day, but I couldn't help responding to the enthusiasm of everyone I met. My family showed up midway through the signing, and even they were excited to see that I was too busy to do more than give them a quick hug before returning to my table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Holy fuck. That was insane,\" Alec stated, sinking into Olivia's chair when she abandoned it to go to the bathroom. The last attendee had been shuttled out the door a few minutes prior and the majority of the authors were packing up. I needed to decompress for a few minutes before I could think about leaving.</p><p>I shot him a weak smile. I was tired, but I couldn't imagine how tough it must have been on him. At least I had a table to hide behind. \"You did great. I appreciate you handling it so well,\" I said, speaking to him for the first time in four hours.</p><p>\"It was fun.\" He laughed when I raised my eyebrows skeptically. \"Really. I'm being serious. It's not every day a guy has hundreds of women waiting in line just to take a picture with him. Well, unless you're Channing Tatum, I guess.\"</p> <p>I rolled my eyes. \"I'm sure it didn't hurt your overly inflated ego. Of course, you're more a tease than anything else.\"</p><p>He laughed. \"Tease? That's the first time I've been called a tease.\"</p><p>I looked away, afraid he would see through the shabby wall I had built.</p><p>\"Look, about the other night\u2014\"</p><p>I cut him off. \"If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not talk about it, okay? You had your reasons, and I don't see why we need to rehash things. I got it. Loud and clear.\" I stood up, making busywork of packing up my stuff.</p> <p>\"Nicole.\" He reached out to touch my hand, but I jerked it back like it was a venomous snake.</p><p>\"Alec, please don't,\" I pleaded as Olivia joined us.</p><p>It was clear she knew she had walked in at a bad moment. Her eyes moved from Alec to me, but I looked away. My nerves were frazzled and I was just ready to be done. I'd never been a glutton for punishment anyway, so today had definitely tested me.</p><p>Knowing when to give me space, Olivia remained silent as she helped me clear off the rest of my table. Alec took down my banner without being asked, and I grudgingly thanked him.</p><p>We carried my belongings out to the car, saying more goodbyes to some of the authors I knew. My family would be meeting us at a local Italian restaurant not too far up the road from the hotel. I would have just as soon bowed out of dinner, but I knew tonight was supposed to be a bit of a celebration since it had been the first time they had seen me in action at a signing.</p><p>I could have done without Alec tagging along, but Olivia had already mentioned it and I saw no graceful way of taking back the invite. Plus, I would have looked like a mega-bitch after all his help during the event. To say he'd been a trouper would be putting it mildly.</p> <p>The dinner rush was in full force when the three of us arrived as the line of waiting customers overflowed out the front door. Luckily, Olivia had made a reservation. We shuffled through the crowd to get inside, spotting Mom, Dad and Ashley sharing a loveseat off to the side of the hostess stand.</p><p>\"Honey, you were amazing,\" Mom gushed, standing to give me a big hug. \"I can't believe how many people came out to see you. You're famous.\"</p><p>\"Mom, really? You're attracting attention. Look at those people staring,\" I said, ducking my head in embarrassment.</p><p>\"What? Sweetie, it's my job to brag over you.\" She turned to the young couple standing to her right. \"My daughter is a famous author.\"</p><p>\"Oh lord. Shoot me now,\" I groaned as Olivia stifled a chuckle.</p><p>Mom couldn't have made more of a spectacle of me unless she had pulled out a bullhorn and shouted to the entire restaurant. My brothers returned from the bathroom, thumping me enthusiastically on the back. Tony took my hazing a step further by rubbing the top of my head with his knuckles, earning him an elbow in the ribs. \"Knock it off, ass\u2014\" My voice trailed off when Mom tugged at my shirt, shooting me her famous glare. Alec looked on in amusement, getting a firsthand look at what I had grown up with. This dinner was going to be so much fun. Not.</p><p>\"Nicole, why don't you introduce us to your friend,\" my mom said, taking note of Alec, who stood quietly at my side.</p><p>\"Friend\" wasn't the word I would have used to describe him. \"Well, he's...\" I stood like an idiot, searching for the right way to introduce him. I looked to Olivia for help. She shook her head, smiling.</p> <p>\"It's all you,\" she giggled.</p><p>Zachary jumped in when I still couldn't manage to put a sentence together. \"For Pete's sake. You're Alec, right? You were kind of busy at the signing today, otherwise we would have said hello there. I'm Zachary. This is my girlfriend, Ashley.\" They shook hands with Alec as Zachary continued with the introductions. \"Over here is our brother Tony, and that's the other one, Riley.\"</p><p>\"We already saw the cover, so you don't have to take your shirt off here,\" Riley joked, patting Alec on the back.</p><p>\"Good thing,\" he laughed. \"I've spent the whole day shirtless. I'm due for a break.\"</p><p>Alec handled the ribbing in stride, laughing with my brothers like they had been friends for years. Zachary finished up by introducing him to my parents as I practically hid myself behind Olivia. Luckily, Taylor showed up to save me from once again becoming a bullseye for any further humiliation.</p><p>Tony's good mood suddenly slipped as he eyed his competition disdainfully. The hostess showed us to our table with Taylor leading Olivia by the small of her back. Zachary, Riley and I exchanged knowing looks. My fear was that Tony would say something stupid and make the dinner even more unbearable. As everyone began to sit, I quickly snagged the chair next to Olivia before Tony could take it. Only part of my intention had been to make sure he behaved. Really, I didn't want to be stuck next to Alec. With my chair angled just the right way, I didn't even have to make eye contact with him. He and Riley had seemed to hit it off anyway and pretty much stayed in constant conversation the entire time.</p><p>Dinner turned out not to be the horror show I had anticipated. Tony managed to leave the Olivia-and-Taylor situation alone and the book event became the main topic of conversation for most of the meal. The rest of my family seemed as impressed as my mom with the bevy of activity they had witnessed at my table. I was just glad readers and bloggers had taken the time to stop by to see me. It would have sucked if I'd been sitting there twiddling my thumbs when my family showed up.</p><p>Eventually, we exhausted all conversation about the signing and Mom turned her attention to Alec at the far end of the table. I wanted badly to hear what they were saying, but the guys had gotten into a heated debate over the baseball game from the night before. Knowing my luck, she was probably trying to play the dating game and set me up. I could have spared her the trouble. That ship had sailed.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\"I don't know why you're even arguing. You know as well as I do it's a good idea,\" Olivia stated, pausing the movie we had been watching.</p><p>\"Liv, you know releases are stressful enough for me. The fact that I'm doing three back-to-back events is already freaking me out. I have no idea how I'm supposed to keep up with the blog tour and all the other promo stuff you set up while I'm gone for three whole weeks. There's no way in hell I'm going to add Alec into the mix.\"</p><p>Olivia sighed. \"Seriously, Nicole, you need to grow up. This isn't high school. Haven't we moved past the whole he doesn't like me, therefore I'll never speak to him again phase? The next three weeks are bigger than the silliness you're still holding on to. I'm not just saying this because you're my best friend. I truly believe in you, and Wicked Lovely is your best book yet. Don't get me wrong. You know I adore your writing like a mommy elephant loves her two-ton baby, but this book is special. It's like you dug down deep and wrote from your gut. It's raw, beautiful and true love at its finest.\"</p><p>\"Did you steal that from a review for another book?\"</p><p>\"I'm serious, whore. You owe it to this book to give it your all. If that means biting the bullet to bring your cover model along, so be it.\" I tried to interrupt again, but she held up her hand. \"You need to do this.\"</p><p>I mulled over her words, gnawing on my bottom lip. I knew she was right. There was stiff competition in the book market and if I wanted Wicked Lovely to get the launch it deserved, I needed an advantage. I hated being boxed in a corner, but Alec provided that advantage. \"I can't believe I agreed to all of this,\" I sighed. \"Three signings back to back. I hope you'll miss me when all this kills me. Good luck finding another best friend who watches polygamy shows obsessively with you like I do.\"</p><p>\"I know you said before if you die I get all your stuff, but do I have to take Severus?\" She glared at my cat, who took a swipe at her hand when she reached out to pet him. They had never been terribly close. \"Keep it up, fleabag, and I'll turn you into a rug.\"</p><p>I laughed when Severus turned his back in response, making me think cats were the superior species.</p><p>Olivia took another sip of her wine. \"That little shit just basically gave me the cat version of the finger, didn't he? All right, if you accepted your fate, I'll book Alec's side of the trip, okay?\"</p><p>\"Are you sure we have enough cash in the marketing budget?\" I already knew the answer, but I was grasping for one last out.</p><p>\"More than enough. Putting aside twenty percent of your earnings has given you a nice nest egg. If this book does what I'm hoping it will, that nest egg will become a dozen. This trip couldn't have come at a better time.\"</p><p>I raised my own glass of wine but didn't take a sip right away. I absently ran my thumb over the stem. I wished I were as optimistic as she was. The entire trip had the makings of a nightmare as far as I was concerned.</p><p>\"Doughnut?\" Alec opened the wax-covered paper bag and held it out to me.</p><p>I sat back in my seat at the airport, crossing my arms over my chest. \"No, thanks. I'm not hungry.\" My rumbling stomach said otherwise, but I felt too nervous to eat.</p><p>\"You sure?\" He gave me a sideways look after hearing the evidence of my empty stomach.</p><p>\"I'm sure. I can't believe you eat those anyway. I would have pegged you for a healthier eater.\"</p><p>\"Usually, but I love me some Krispy Kreme.\"</p><p>I looked out the large floor-to-ceiling window. The sun hadn't come up yet, so it was still too dark outside to see anything but my reflection staring back at me. Our flight to Nashville was due to leave in forty-five minutes and everyone at our gate seemed eager to start boarding. A fluttering of panic settled in my stomach, which increased in intensity as the minutes clanked by. If I left now I could go back to my nice, safe apartment. It wasn't that I was afraid of flying. It was the idea of spending the next twenty-one days with someone I couldn't connect with that had my mood as black as the sky outside.</p><p>Alec, on the other hand, was like the freaking sun. \"You know, we don't have to be enemies,\" he said, taking a large bite of his dreamy glazed breakfast. My mouth watered. Krispy Kreme doughnuts were one of my weaknesses.</p><p>I tore my eyes away from the enticing glistening pastry. \"We're not enemies. I don't even know you well enough to be your enemy. I don't want to know you well enough to be enemies, or anything else for that matter.\" I hated being mean. That wasn't my personality. Everyone who knew me would say the same thing. Most of the time I would bend over backward to make sure everyone was happy. My mom said I was a born people pleaser. She liked to joke that nice ran through my DNA like fleas on a dog.</p><p>Alec didn't reply right away, but his eyes bore into me as he rolled up his paper bag. \"Nicole, shouldn't you be happy I wasn't willing to take things further? That you weren't wasting yourself on a one-night stand?\"</p><p>I couldn't help looking around in embarrassment. It wasn't like we were sitting at an empty gate. \"What do you want, a thank you?\" I hissed through gritted teeth.</p><p>\"I'm just saying you should be glad I wasn't a dick. I'm not saying you have to thank me, but surely you realize I did us both a favor.\"</p><p>Laughter erupted out of me. He had to be kidding. \"A favor? Of course. Why hadn't I seen it before? Rejecting me was like getting an extra slice of birthday cake. I'm so glad you stopped things when you did.\" I stood up angrily, no longer worried about the people sitting around us.</p><p>Gripping the handle of my carry-on suitcase, I stomped away, much like a child threatening to run away. What a bullshit way to justify what happened between us that night. He basically told me I wasn't worthy of having sex with and then wanted to tell me he did me a favor. I walked past the filled rows of seats to stand by the window. In the reflection of the glass, I saw that someone had taken the empty seat I had vacated next to Alec.</p><p>Stubbornly, I remained by the window until the boarding of our flight was announced. The first rays of the sun were beginning to peek through the horizon, filling the sky with delicate shades of pink and creamsicle orange. My actions felt more and more childish the longer I stood there. Regardless of our history, I had to figure out a way to make it through this trip. Olivia had been right. This wasn't high school.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, I probably would have jumped from the plane without a parachute if given the chance. A hard thump hit the back of my seat, jolting me for about the hundredth time since we had taken off.</p><p>\"Johnny, please stop kicking the poor lady's seat.\"</p><p>\"Nooooooooo,\" Johnny bellowed, making several passengers turn to look at the offending row where he was currently tormenting his mother.</p><p>\"Sorry. He's just excited to be flying,\" Johnny the Kicker's mom said, peeking between our seats.</p><p>\"It's fine,\" I said, flashing her a tight-lipped smile. Alec shook with silent laughter. Without thinking, I swung my foot out bringing it smartly against his shin.</p><p>\"Damn, woman,\" he said, rubbing his shin. The way Johnny's mom gasped, it sounded like she may have thought Alec was talking to her. Regardless, it was enough to make me smile.</p><p>Alec leaned in conspiratorially to whisper into my ear. \"You know you could tell her it's not okay?\"</p><p>\"Or you could just switch seats with me,\" I said out of the corner of my mouth.</p><p>\"Not on your life. Johnny might find himself strapped to the wing of the plane if we did that.\"</p><p>I couldn't help snorting with laughter, nearly losing my iPad from my lap.</p><p>\"What are you working on?\"</p><p>\"Nothing much. I planned on starting the sequel to Wicked Lovely, but my brain is refusing to cooperate. I'm never very productive when I have a lot going on. I should probably resign myself to the fact that I won't get any writing done for the next few weeks,\" I said, closing my iPad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"How many books do you write a year?\" He stretched his long legs out in the limited space.</p><p>\"I seem to be averaging one every four to five months start to finish.\"</p><p>He whistled through his teeth. \"Impressive.\"</p> <p>\"That's nothing. I have friends who release more than that. It makes my head spin sometimes. Readers seem to love it though.\"</p><p>\"I guess I didn't realize books were produced that fast. I feel like I have to wait forever for some of my favorite authors to put a book out.\"</p><p>\"That's traditionally published books. They tend to move slower because of the way they fill their release calendar. Indie-published authors have the autonomy to release whenever they want.\" The conversation felt odd. We were talking like we were friends.</p><p>He held out the bag with the remaining doughnut inside. Unable to deny my hunger any longer, I accepted it and made him grin when I devoured the tasty treat in two bites.</p><p>\"Impressive,\" he said, crumpling up the bag.</p> <p>\"Sorry. I really was hungry. Thanks.\"</p><p>\"So, is that why you decided to indie publish, so you can release whenever you want?\"</p><p>I shrugged, licking the glaze off my fingers. \"Partly. At first I was too impatient to try the traditional route, but I wouldn't say no to an offer now. I've always been one of those people who wants something as soon as I've made up my mind. I'm an instant gratification kind of girl.\" I regretted the words the moment they left my runaway mouth.</p><p>Even Alec sat in silence. Probably pondering what he thought was a hidden meaning in my explanation. I opened my mouth to clarify what I meant when an object flew over the seat hitting him in the side of the head.</p><p>This time his curse words were more colorful and an octave louder.</p><p>\"Do you mind?\" Johnny's mom asked, glaring at Alec through the seats. \"My son is young and impressionable.\"</p> <p>\"He's going to have a Spider-Man shoved up his young impressionable ass in a minute,\" Alec mumbled under his breath as I handed Johnny's mother the offending action figure. It was refreshing to see Alec flustered since it was normally me embarrassing myself when we were together.</p><p>By the time we landed in Nashville an hour later, both Alec and I were long past ready to get off the plane. We were both up and out of our seats as soon as the pilot turned off the fasten seatbelts sign. In hindsight, it may have been a better idea to let Johnny and his mom go first, because he screamed the entire way down the narrow aisle.</p><p>\"I now know of another good use for duct tape.\"</p><p>\"Wow, tell me how you really feel about kids.\" I was teasing of course, but Johnny had been enough to drive anyone batty.</p><p>\"Hey, don't get me wrong. I like kids, but that one was like the reincarnation of Chucky.\"</p><p>\"You're comparing a screaming kid to a freaky killer doll? He wasn't that bad.\"</p><p>Alec shot me an incredulous look as he walked purposefully through the terminal. \"Were you just on the same flight as me? That kid made my sperm run and hide in fear. He was a walking, screaming endorsement for safe sex, or better yet, abstinence.\"</p><p>\"Well, that shouldn't be a hard stretch for you.\" It was a catty comment, but I couldn't seem to help myself. I was fine having a normal conversation with him, but bring up the word \"sex\" and my inner bitch showed up to the party.</p> <p>\"Would it help if I let you punch me in the nuts?\"</p><p>Not sure I heard him right, I stopped in the middle of the terminal, causing several annoyed passengers to go around me. \"What did you say?\"</p><p>\"If I let you punch me in the nuts, will you forgive me for leading you on? I'd like to be friends with you, Nicole, but I don't think that's possible until you've had your revenge. If that means I take a shot to the nuts, so be it.\"</p><p>\"You're willing to sacrifice your jewels to be friends? Is it even possible for a man and woman who almost slept together to be friends?\" We stepped back into the flow of walking traffic after an aggravated man dressed in a business suit tripped over my rolling suitcase.</p><p>\"Sure, it's possible. Don't you have any male friends?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I answered, trying to keep up with his long strides toward baggage claim. \"Are you telling me you have female friends? Females you haven't slept with? And I'm not talking about the girls your buddies are dating.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, one, and we're going to be together for the next three weeks, so wouldn't it be nice if we could manage to get along?\" he cajoled, turning his devastating smile to the full-wattage setting.</p><p>\"You shit.\" I smiled in return. I knew he was right. It was time to bury the hatchet. The night he'd rejected me may have been the most humiliating night of my life, but it was time to let it go. \"Fine, but no smiling at me like that. It's a sex-on-a-freaking-stick kind of move, and since that's not an option, you might as well save it for the women you'll actually sleep with.\" I followed Alec down the escalator, pulling my wheeled suitcase with me.</p><p>\"Sex on a stick? What is that supposed to mean?\"</p><p>\"Trust me, it's a thing. I might as well add no winking to the list too.\"</p><p>He grasped his chest like he was in physical pain. Two flight attendants going up the opposite escalator openly checked him out. \"What's wrong with winking?\"</p><p>I had to be blushing by now, but I figured what the hell? I'd already put myself out there. \"Not all winking. Just your winks. They're worse than your smile. It's a clear invitation to jump your bones.\"</p><p>\"If you say so,\" he said, chuckling.</p><p>We made it downstairs and joined the crowd of people around the luggage carousel that was starting to spit out our bags. \"Would you have really let me punch you in the nuts?\"</p><p>An elderly couple waiting for their bags looked at us with interest.</p><p>Alec nodded at them before reaching out and grabbing my suitcase as it made its way around the carousel. \"If that's what it took, but I hoped you wouldn't take me up on it. I don't want to sing soprano.\"</p><p>\"Well, don't think you're in the clear. Your nuts are safe as long as you stick to our agreement.\"</p><p>\"I'd listen to that gal of yours. She looks like she can pack a mighty punch.\" The old man clapped Alec on the back, laughing at his own comment as he wheeled his large suitcase away.</p><p>\"Wise words,\" I said, pointing to Alec's own suitcase as it passed us by.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Being friends with a guy like Alec was like being friends with a movie star. Anywhere we went women openly admired him, gawked at him. Hell, the bravest of them even offered him their room keys. Just like the previous event in Orlando, most of the women had no shame in asking him for pictures or kisses or to sign their boobs. That actually happened more times than I would have expected. Through it all, Alec remained a good sport, and much to my annoyance, seemed to be enjoying himself. He was a male after all.</p><p>I knew a majority of the attention had to do with where we were. The Romance Lovers event lived up to its name, attracting all the big-name authors, many of whom had been in the business forever. Most of them had dozens of titles under their belts, giving them a loyal and dedicated reader base. Women walked through the hotel sporting T-shirts and tote bags with their favorite book covers. Needless to say, Alec was an overnight sensation.</p><p>Sitting across from him after he had been asked to sign yet another woman's cleavage, I couldn't help feeling disgruntled. Alec, on the other hand, looked like a cat that had swallowed the canary. He shoveled his eggs in his mouth with sparkling eyes.</p><p>I frowned at him over the rim of my mug of coffee. \"You know, you don't have to look so satisfied.\"</p><p>\"What can I say? I'm a dude. Who am I to deny the ladies?\" His face started to spread into a devilish grin, but he humored me by looking down at his plate as he dipped his bacon into the syrup runoff from his pancakes.</p><p>He looked up to find me clearly astounded at the amount of food he was consuming. Besides the eggs, bacon, pancakes and hash browns, he also had a bowl of oatmeal that he planned on finishing.</p><p>\"I work out a lot,\" he said with a mouthful of pancakes. \"I blaze through calories. Are the events always like this?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure. This is the first time I've gone to this particular event. It's definitely grander than the few signings I've done in the past.\" My voice hinted at the insecurity I felt being here.</p><p>\"I noticed you don't seem very comfortable here. Is it still me or something else?\"</p><p>I shrugged. \"No, it's not you. After all, we decided to bury the hatchet, right? I like seeing everyone at the events, and there's no denying these are my kind of peeps, but meeting new people always freaks me out. You've seen me. I can become awkward even when I'm comfortable. I prefer small settings that are less overwhelming.</p><p>\"Then why do the big events?\"</p><p>I sighed. \"To put myself out there. Indie publishing is a dog-eat-dog kind of business, and I've only been at it a short time. I'm still building a readership.\"</p><p>He nodded his head, polishing off the last of his bacon. \"Makes sense. You know, I could help you.\"</p><p>\"Help me?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, to be more open. You know, relax a little. I'm good at that kind of stuff.\"</p><p>My mind automatically went to the gutter. He could absolutely open me up. I had no doubts about that. I tried to shake the image of him and me, minus the clothes, up in the room. A couple hours of that and I'd be ready to take on any event. Go figure, after my lecture to him about boundaries and everything he wasn't allowed to do, it would be perverted me who had the nasty thoughts. Like his luscious lips trailing down my neck, past my collarbone ...</p><p>\"What do you think?\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" I said, shaking my head. \"What was I thinking? I mean, what did you say?\"</p><p>He looked at me like my sanity was in question. It wasn't the first time. I was used to it by now. \"Would you like my help?\"</p><p>\"Uh, sure,\" I finally answered. I had to stop fogging out like that.</p><p>\"Don't sound so enthused,\" he teased, signaling the waitress for the check.</p><p>\"I'm just not sure you know what a lost cause I am. My tongue refuses to work at the oddest times, and I suck pig's hooves when it comes to talking about my own books. Olivia has been trying to help, but even she's said I'm pretty much hopeless.\"</p><p>\"Pig hooves?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, hooves. You know, since pigs don't have toes.\"</p><p>He chuckled. \"Yeah, I know, but who says that? You crack me up with the off-the-wall things you say. I like it.\" He smiled warmly. It wasn't sensual like the smile he pasted on his face during the book signings, and yet, something inside my stomach coiled with awareness.</p><p>\"Gee, I'm glad my weirdness has your seal of approval.\"</p><p>\"Are you always so hard on yourself?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked, reaching for the bill. He grabbed it before I could get my hands on it. \"Hey, what are you doing?\"</p><p>\"I'm not comfortable having you pay for everything.\"</p><p>I laughed. \"Don't be ridiculous, Alec. It's all part of the job. This is a business expense.\"</p><p>\"Maybe so, but my ego takes a hit every time you pay for something.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure you have plenty to spare,\" I joked, sliding my credit card into the holder for the waitress.</p><p>He rolled his eyes, but elaborated. \"Look, my dad was old school. It was ingrained in my head at an early age that a gentleman always pays.\"</p><p>I smiled. The sentiment was cute, but old fashioned. \"Well, unfortunately, you're working for me, and I cover the expenses when we travel. Including the astonishing pile of food you just devoured and our adjoining hotel rooms.\"</p><p>One thing I found curious was the way he referred to his dad in the past tense. I realized again I didn't know anything about Alec's life. Being naturally nosey by nature, I could people watch like nobody's business, so of course I wanted to ask him, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. It felt too personal.</p><p>\"So are you?\"</p><p>\"Am I what?\" I asked, not remembering his question.</p><p>\"Always so hard on yourself. It's just that in the past twenty-four hours I've seen you put yourself down at least a dozen times. Is it just a ploy, or do you really feel you lack in all these areas?\" His question was pointed and serious, making me uncomfortable. I wasn't sure I was ready to be analyzed.</p><p>\"An attention-seeking ploy? Yeah, right. Obviously, you don't know who you're talking to. I don't like attention enough for that. Besides, aren't we supposed to acknowledge our faults and embrace them?\"</p><p>\"Only when it's healthy. Your fascination with putting yourself down borders on emotional mutilation.\"</p><p>I snorted as the waitress handed back my credit card. \"Emotional mutilation? You sound like a doctor, not a bartender.\"</p><p>His eyes lit up in amusement. \"That's good since I'm premed. Believe it or not, I don't have aspirations of flirting for tips tending bar and modeling forever. Not that I don't appreciate the gig,\" he said, raising his cup of coffee to toast me. \"It's just a means to an end.\" He stood up, reaching out a hand to help me to my feet.</p><p>\"No shit? Like a surgeon or something in that capacity?\" My knowledge of the medical field was limited to watching Grey's Anatomy. I had binged watched the show so much I felt I could be a doctor.</p><p>\"That's the end goal. I haven't decided on a specialty yet, but I have plenty of time for that. I was forced to take some time off and now I'll be starting medical school in the fall.\"</p><p>\"Wow, I had no idea.\"</p><p>\"Surprised that this face has a brain?\" He looked pleased that he had shocked me. I smiled, pulling out my agenda for the day from my purse.</p><p>\"You said it, not me,\" I laughed. \"All kidding aside though, I think it's great.\"</p><p>He peered over my shoulder. \"What's on the schedule first?\" His breath skated across my cheek and his mouth was so close to the side of my face that if I turned my head slightly my lips would have touched his. It was such a tempting thought that I had to dig my fingernails into my hand to resist.</p><p>Trying to regain some of my self-control, I shifted slightly to avoid another of my embarrassing slips. \"We have the Dream Model panel Olivia was able to get us on last minute. That's in thirty minutes, but nothing else until the Hunky Ball tonight, so the afternoon is yours. I'd rest up since they'll be auctioning you off.\" I tried unsuccessfully to hide my grin. I'm not sure how Olivia had talked him into participating, but it was bound to be entertaining. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I think I'll just tag along with you. You don't mind, do you?\"</p><p>\"Are you sure? It's bound to be boring for you. I was going to catch a few panels and then have a late lunch with some of my blogger friends.\"</p><p>\"Works for me. Since I'm your friend and all, I should fit right in.\"</p> <p>I saw no viable argument with his reasoning. It was his funeral. He had already experienced how women at these events could be relentless when a hot guy was around. I sucked my bottom lip into my mouth, gnawing on it lightly as I racked my brain for an out. His eyes moved to my mouth and he licked his lips. Interesting. He may not have wanted to sleep with me, but he was definitely still paying attention.</p><p>Alec, of course, charmed his way through the day with all my friends. I didn't know why I was surprised anymore. Maybe it was the bartender in him, but he was a born chatterbox and had no problem holding his own when the conversation repeatedly turned to books. I was surprised to learn that he enjoyed reading almost as much as me. Not that he read much romance, but we did share the same interests in several of the same authors.</p><p>True to his word, Alec followed me around the entire time. Where originally I thought his presence would be oppressing and uncomfortable, I found myself engaging in conversation with him anytime we weren't in a panel or surrounded by a group. He was charismatic, funny and easy to talk to. The secret voice in my head called him perfect. I tried to ignore that voice and instead, dredge up the hurt he had caused me, but my heart refused to go there anymore. Alec had won it over. The barrier of insecurity that his rejection had caused that night still remained, but I wanted to tear it down. I couldn't do it alone. Alec would have to give me a vivid sign that he was interested.</p><p>That didn't mean I couldn't throw a little bait on the hook to test the water, as my dad would say\u2014just small things to gauge his reaction, if he gave any at all. Knowing I was stepping outside my comfort zone, I attempted to channel one of the strong female characters I was used to writing\u2014characters that were the opposite of me and were not afraid to seduce a man. Someone who knew what she wanted and wasn't afraid to show it.</p><p>It felt understandably awkward, especially after my first attempt that nearly shook my confidence. The idea was to lean in and whisper something in Alec's ear during the panel we were sitting in. At which point my lips would \"accidentally\" graze his ear. The problem with my plan was that I was still me, not one of the characters from my books. In my typical fashion, I forgot about my cell phone on my lap, which of course fell to the floor. In my haste to try and catch it, my face nearly ended up in his crotch, which would have been interesting, but was not my intention. For once my awkwardness actually paid off, since I caught myself by placing a hand on his leg. His glorious, hard thigh, to be exact. It could have\u2014and should have\u2014been a disaster that turned my face several shades of red, but somehow I maintained my composure. Alec reached down and picked up my phone and handed it back to me. His eyes stopped on my hand that still sat on his thigh before he looked up and smiled. A warm giddy feeling filled my belly. A hand on the leg was definitely bigger bait than a lip grazing his ear, and I would take it as a subtle victory.</p> <p>My next attempt went more according to plan. As the crowd filed out of the small convention room after the panel discussion, Alec stood behind me when I dropped my purse. I abruptly put on the brakes, and as planned, Alec bumped into my backside. Trying to keep from bowling me over, his hands circled my waist, anchoring me snugly against his hips. \"Oops, sorry,\" I murmured. Feeling him pressed against me felt so obnoxiously good I had to fight off the urge to snuggle closer.</p><p>\"Butterfingers today, huh?\" He laughed, kneeling down to pick up my purse for me. I looked down to catch him, taking notice of where his head was in respect to certain areas of my body. Needless to say, it made that particular area take notice also. \"Here you go,\" he said, standing.</p><p>High with power, I filed from the room with a new bounce in my step. The signals were subtle, but it seemed he was still interested. Some stupid code of ethics was just holding him back.</p><p>It was time to put Operation Seduction into play.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Deciding to try and seduce Alec was easy. Figuring out how was the hard part. It would be different if I was as beautiful and confident as Olivia, but this was me. I could write a steamy seduction scene, but the thought of actually orchestrating one practically broke me out in hives.</p> <p>That evening as I dressed for the Hunky Ball, I mentally sifted through a list of ways I could possibly get Alec into bed. The obvious methods, like simply asking, were not an option, and everything else that came to mind sounded either ridiculous or just plain desperate. He'd already seen my breasts, so that would be nothing new. Besides, he'd gotten more than his share of cleavage in his face during the trip. Liquor could be an option, but considering he was a bartender, and I was the lightweight drinker, I would likely get nothing out of that scenario but a hangover.</p><p>Finally, as I applied a light layer of makeup, it occurred to me that I could do what I had been doing all day. Be myself. Anything else would seem forced and transparent. I had already thrown out some bait today and it went a long way toward snagging his attention. All I had to do now was reel it in. It may not have been the most creative plan, but it was me. If I couldn't get Alec that way, it wasn't going to ever happen.</p><p>My thoughts were interrupted by a light rap on my door. Giving myself a quick once-over, I tucked a lock of hair behind my ear that had escaped the knot I had gathered on my head. I was shooting for something elegant, but I wasn't the best at fixing my own hair. My messy buns usually ended up looking more like birds' nests. Attracting pigeons would probably be a little over-the-top dorky. With my luck, I had just jinxed myself.</p><p>Sighing, I gave my bird's nest one last pat before pulling my door open with gusto. I was unprepared for the sight of Alec dressed to the nines. Everything I had been thinking flew from my head, along with my ability to breathe.</p><p>I sucked in a mouthful of air at the time I should have been exhaling. My confused lungs expressed their displeasure by taking it out on my throat, which closed.</p><p>Choking on thin air is embarrassing enough, but doing it in front of the man I'd like to see in my bed while he pounded me on the back wasn't exactly the essence of sexiness I was hoping to start the evening with.</p><p>\"Jesus, are you okay?\" Alec sounded concerned. He should be. My life felt like it was coming to an end. How ironic that this would be my final moment. Dying as a virgin in the arms of the man I wanted to take my virginity. Hopefully Olivia would learn to love or at least coexist with Severus.</p><p>Catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror as I hacked my lungs out, I could see my mascara mixed with tears running down my cheeks. My face was red and blotchy and my hair had fallen down. This would be the last image Alec would have of me.</p> <p>My description was a tad melodramatic. I might not have been dying, but the raccoon eyes, clown face and scarecrow-like hair were true enough.</p><p>I turned away from my reflection, focusing on dragging air into my asshole lungs that wouldn't be happy until I had barfed all over Alec.</p><p>Thankfully, that didn't happen. After several more pounds on my back, I began to breathe again\u2014barely. I felt like I'd just run a marathon.</p><p>As my heaving breaths returned to normal, Alec began rubbing his hand in wide circles along my back. It felt so good I almost forgot I looked like something from a Stephen King novel. \"You gonna make it?\" He smiled, trying to make me feel better.</p><p>I stepped away from him reluctantly, even though I couldn't help returning his smile. \"I'm fine,\" I croaked. \"Tell me you would have at least known what to do if I had passed out.\"</p><p>\"Most definitely. I was tops in my class in mouth to mouth,\" he said, winking. \"Whoops. It slipped. I'm still working on that.\"</p><p>\"Funny. I'll let it slide since you practically saved my life. Give me a sec to fix\u2014well, this,\" I said, waving my hands up and down my body and face.</p><p>It only took five minutes to scrub my face clean and reapply my mascara. I decided to throw my hair up into a high ponytail this time that would be easier to manage. At least my throat was already beginning to feel better. I smoothed on some lip gloss as a finishing touch. No one would mistake me for a model, but it was a vast improvement over what I looked like before.</p><p>Alec was sitting on the edge of my bed when I left the bathroom. This time I was able to better appreciate his appearance. To say he was devastatingly handsome in a tuxedo would be clich\u00e9, but it was true. In my opinion, a tux automatically knocked every guy up two notches in the looks department. Considering Alec's looks were already a ten, shoving him in a tux knocked him off the freaking charts.</p><p>\"You look lovely,\" he said, standing up.</p><p>I didn't snort. It would have ruined the ladylike image the dress I was wearing was supposed to project. Next to him, I was the ugly stepsister.</p><p>\"You doubt me?\" My look of reservation had not escaped his notice. He stepped closer, offering me his arm.</p><p>\"No, I just disagree. Olivia is lovely. I'm average. You know, the girl next door. The one guys eventually settle down with after they're tired of doinking anything that moves.\" Chicken-eggs-in-a-crap-basket. As usual, the words left my mouth before I could retract them. Highlighting the fact that I wasn't beautiful wasn't the best way to seduce a guy.</p><p>\"Doink?\" He laughed, holding the door open for me.</p><p>Shooting him a sheepish grin, I grabbed my room key off the dresser and slid it into my small clutch before leaving. \"Sorry, my brothers used to say that all the time. You'd never know I was in college by my thirteen-year-old mouth.\"</p><p>Alec placed his hand lightly on the small of my back, leading me toward the bank of elevators. \"I didn't know you were in college.\"</p><p>His touch made me want to do cartwheels, but I was able to keep my head as we stepped on the elevator together. \"I'm finishing up a bachelor's degree in English lit. Slowly, since I only take a couple classes per semester. The sense of urgency to finish dissipated as soon as I realized I was already working my dream job. I'll graduate eventually. Besides, it'll be nice to have a degree to fall back on if my books begin to tank, but for now I'm happy with the way things are going.\"</p><p>\"And you're all of what, twenty-one?\"</p><p>\"Twenty-two,\" I said, correcting him. He laughed. \"Sorry, habit. I've always looked young for my age, so I'm constantly forced to convince people of my actual age. Each year counts. How old are you?\"</p><p>\"Twenty-five, but I feel much older,\" he admitted as the elevator slowly chugged downward. The book convention had booked the hotel to peak capacity, so all the elevators had been abused the past few days. Thankfully, we were only on the fifth floor and didn't have to wait as long as others.</p><p>We could hear the buzz of voices in the lobby before we had even reached the ground floor. It sounded like a bunch of bees in a hive. As the elevator doors opened, the noise swelled and we were engulfed in the loud chatter. \"You ready for this?\" I asked Alec as we stepped into the throng of women all dressed to the gills, waiting for the ballroom doors to open.</p><p>We received more than our share of whistles and catcalls, or should I say, Alec received them, as we walked arm in arm through the lobby.</p><p>\"Hey, sweetheart, show us your pecs.\"</p><p>As women, we never liked to admit it, but sometimes we could be as raunchy as a bunch of construction workers. Alec took it all in stride. \"You can dress the woman in a fancy dress, but the horndog is still waiting to bark,\" I muttered as Alec grabbed my hand. His long lean fingers laced through mine and we continued toward the cash bar set up on the far side of the room. I appreciated the seemingly intimate gesture more than he may have realized. There were a serious number of bodies waiting for the ballroom doors to open and I was feeling claustrophobic.</p><p>Alec leaned in close to talk over the loud echoing pitch in the room. \"What's your poison?\"</p><p>\"Something fruity, please.\" I tilted my face toward his, making our cheeks touch\u2014accidentally. Smiling to myself, I remembered my original plan to graze his ear in the panel earlier that morning. It seemed the only way my plans ever worked was by accident.</p><p>With drinks in hand, we moved to the far corner of the room, away from the majority of the crowd. I took a long sip of my drink to take the edge off. My lips puckered from the strong taste of alcohol, but I didn't let that deter me from taking another long drink.</p><p>\"You okay?\" Alec watched as I sucked down my drink like it was a Coke.</p><p>\"Sure, this is my favorite thing in the world to do. You know what would make it even better? If they decided to seal up the room and slowly fill it with water. That would make everything dinosaur nuts fabulous.\"</p><p>He barked out a laugh, taking a pull off his bottle of beer. I was sure he hadn't meant to do it, but he managed to distract me anyway. Alec was sexy even when he was taking a drink. I decided it had to be his mouth. Anytime it came into contact with something, my body responded.</p><p>\"I thought you had a lot of friends here. You look so nervous.\"</p><p>I answered, pulling my thoughts from my lip watching. \"I do. I just get overwhelmed in crowds. All the conversations going on at once gives me sensory overload.\"</p><p>\"So, you don't really want to fill up the room with water and drown everyone?\"</p><p>\"What? No. What I meant was being in a crowded room was about as much fun as being in a sealed room filling with water.\"</p><p>\"I take it you're afraid of water too, then?\"</p><p>\"Not water in particular. I actually like to swim when I have time. I'm afraid of big water, like tsunamis, hurricanes, flash floods. Any of those reach my freak-out meter.\"</p><p>\"Sweetheart, I hate to break the news, but you sorta live in the wrong state.\" The word sweetheart left his mouth like thick honey, but much more enticing. It made me want to lick his lips.</p><p>I blamed the drink I had just consumed. \"That's why I don't live on the beach. I have it down to a science. Even if a tsunami hit the east coast of Florida, the water wouldn't reach me on the second floor of my apartment complex.\"</p><p>\"I guess a romantic getaway to the Keys is out.\"</p><p>I couldn't tell if he was propositioning me or just moving the conversation forward. \"Are you kidding? I'd have to be tranquilized before you could even get me across the Seven Mile Bridge. Not to mention I would need to be knocked out to stay on an island surrounded by water.\"</p><p>\"It's really not that bad. The farther south you go, the more crystal blue the water gets. You can literally see everything in the water when you stand in it.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Pass. I don't need to see the shark before he snaps my hand off,\" I joked.</p><p>\"You're afraid of sharks too?\"</p><p>\"Who isn't? Have you seen the movie Jaws?\" I realized the list of phobias I was admitting to was quite extensive, and I hadn't even mentioned my fear of spiders, heights or roller coasters flying off their tracks. \"How about you? I bet you're not scared of anything.\"</p> <p>\"Snakes.\"</p><p>\"Snakes?\"</p><p>\"Yep, Indiana Jones had nothing on my fear of those slithering bastards. They should all die in the pits of hell.\"</p><p>I couldn't help laughing at the passion in his voice. It was cute.</p><p>\"Ms. Blake,\" a voice called out from behind Alec. Instinctively, I looked around for my mom. Ms. Blake was so formal. It took a moment before it registered in my head that the voice was talking to me.</p> <p>\"Yes?\" I answered, stepping away from the wall I had been slouching against.</p><p>\"We're ready for you and your model,\" a woman said, blushing brightly when she nodded in Alec's direction.</p><p>\"You need me too?\" I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \"We'd like the authors to introduce their models before each one is auctioned off.\"</p><p>\"Like with a microphone?\" I groaned as we followed her through a side door into the ballroom.</p><p>\"Yes, ma'am,\" she answered respectfully, though she wasn't much older than me.</p> <p>Alec leaned in to whisper in my ear. \"Microphone phobia too?\"</p><p>\"Public speaking,\" I answered out of the side of my mouth.</p><p>He chuckled but didn't comment as his warm hand found the small of my back again.</p><p>We stepped onto a makeshift stage that had been set up on the far left side of the ballroom. With the paranormal theme of this year's event, the room was decorated top to bottom to resemble a dark and mysterious lair. Purple and magenta lights shining on the walls combined with the crystal chandeliers twinkling on the ceiling gave the illusion of movement as the music throbbed throughout the lair.</p><p>Alec let out a low whistle of admiration. \"Swanky. This is something else.\" He turned to the girl who had fetched us and winked at her.</p><p>She beamed. Even under the dark purple lighting, I could see the bright red shade of her face. I couldn't blame her. Alec was intoxicating.</p><p>The assistant left us on the stage with the other models and authors. I edged closer to my friend Jennifer, and Tristan, the model she had used for some of her previous books and who also adorned the cover of her current release. Tristan was a veteran in the cover-modeling scene. Currently, he looked plain bored. His abs and pecs had graced more than a hundred romance novel covers. I knew from past conversations with Jennifer that he was hardcore. He maintained a daily regimen of exercise and buffed and waxed his entire body every single week. He also went to the tanning salon at least four times a week and was a dedicated vegan. His services came with a big price tag from what I understood, but readers loved him.</p><p>\"Hey, Jennifer,\" I said, giving her a quick hug.</p> <p>Tristan's bored expression disappeared the instant he took in Alec standing next to me. Watching the way he eyed Alec like he was a delectable treat made it clear what side his bread was buttered on. \"Jennifer, this is Alec,\" I said, introducing them.</p><p>She shook Alec's hand, looking as nervous as I was. \"Nice to meet you.\"</p><p>Tristan cleared his throat, waiting to be included in the introductions. \"Oh, right,\" she said, shaking her head. \"This is Tristan.\"</p><p>\"Good to meet you.\" Alec gripped Tristan's hand firmly and patted him on the shoulder. Watching the almost giddy look on Tristan's face made me wonder if that was how I had looked the first time I saw Alec. I debated having a little fun with him, but I became distracted when a couple more people joined us on stage. Specifically, the author who would be my archenemy if I had one.</p><p>Samantha Tran and I started self-publishing at the same time and had naturally formed a friendship as we waded through the trenches together. She found greater success a little quicker than I had when her third book took off like a rocket. I was thrilled for her. It was encouraging to see someone I knew find a larger audience for their books. The way we had supported each other, it felt like a shared success. Somewhere between hitting a couple bestseller lists, Samantha decided our friendship was no longer necessary. Some of the personal thoughts we had shared with each other about our fears and insecurities had started being whispered back to me through social media. Of course, what she neglected to tell anyone was that some of the things she was giving me the embarrassing credit for saying had come from her mouth, not mine. The worst part was she did it all to fit in with a different crowd. Her crushing betrayal almost made me walk away from the business. It was like high school all over again, but so much worse. We were adults after all. Hell, we were supposed to be professional.</p><p>Eventually, Mom and Olivia stepped in to shake some sense into me. They basically told me to pull on my big girl panties and stop moping. Business was cutthroat sometimes, and all I could do was learn from the experience. Since then, my relationships in the industry became more guarded. I had developed plenty of friendships, but most were surface deep. Even those I trusted never got the full me. I saved it all for Olivia. If I needed to vent, bounce ideas or share exciting news, Olivia was my go-to person.</p><p>\"Is something the matter?\" Alec seemed to sense the tension that had slowly claimed my limbs.</p><p>I shook my head. I saw no reason to let him in on my troubles. It would do no good to stir the pot, and truthfully, deep down, I was embarrassed by the whole situation. Alec had already gotten a front row seat to the craziness I seemed to attract. There was no reason to include him in this drama too.</p><p>I pasted a fake smile on my face that felt heavy, but I bared the brunt of it. The lights around us began to swirl wildly as the big disco ball I had missed hanging in the ceiling began to spin. It reminded me of the times I used to go roller skating as a kid. The rink in our neighborhood was about thirty years past its heyday, but had remained a popular spot for birthday parties before kids hit middle school. After that it was no longer cool. I even had my ninth birthday party there. The thing I remembered most about that party to this day was the way my mom and dad skated around the rink together. I remember watching them and the way they had eyes for each other.</p><p>Maybe if I mapped my journey to becoming a romance writer, it had started that day. Even at nine years old, I knew I wanted to be a part of a love story that grand. A love that seemed to have no beginning and no end. It was perfect and I wanted it.</p><p>\"Whoa, trippy. We should all get high and chill,\" Alec drawled in a flawless impression of Matthew McConaughey from the movie Dazed and Confused.</p><p>A startled giggle bubbled out of me, taking my tension with it. Matthew was one of my secret teenage crushes. I was thirteen when my brothers introduced me to the movie, and I was instantly hooked.</p><p>\"Classic movie.\"</p><p>Jennifer looked at me strangely. By the look on her face, she wasn't familiar with the cult classic. \"Dave? From Dazed and Confused?\" I probably shouldn't have sounded so judgmental, but it was one of my favorites.</p><p>\"All right, all right, all right,\" Alec chimed in again, deadpanning another line from the movie. I had to grab my side from laughing so hard. Evidently my mirth was contagious because even Jennifer couldn't help laughing with me. The only person who didn't seem to find any humor in the situation was Samantha Tran, who had been making an obvious attempt to ignore me since walking on stage. Judging by her annoyed expression, she probably believed she was the butt of our joke, but she didn't have the nerve to ask. The look on her face only made me laugh harder. Without thinking, I turned to Alec and buried my face in his chest. He embraced me in his arms, rubbing my back until I was able to regain my composure. We swayed back and forth like we had the first time we danced together. Suddenly, laughter was the furthest thing from my mind. I could have stayed in his embrace for hours.</p><p>I pulled away when I realized everyone else was no longer laughing. \"Do my eyes deceive me, or are you blushing?\" Jennifer crowed, peering closely at me as I wiped gleeful tears from my eyes. I shook my head minutely, dismissing the twinkle in her eye.</p><p>\"I'm not surprised. Her face always turns fifty shades of red when she's excited,\" Alec said, winking at Jennifer. I reacted almost immediately, slapping him on the shoulder.</p><p>\"OMG, now that one I got. Don't worry. My lips are sealed,\" she said, acting like she had locked the corner of her mouth.</p><p>I grabbed Alec's elbow, pulling him close to me. \"Thanks a lot. Watch how fast the rumor of you and me together spreads on social media.\"</p><p>The moment was surreal. Not that I would have any problem with anyone believing Alec and I were together, if it were true, but gossip spread like wildfire and I wasn't comfortable with people talking about my personal life.</p><p>Alec's dark and smoky eyes bore into mine, reflecting the fire that raged from me. They saw past my insecurities, probing until they found the passion that swirled inside me like molten lava. Words were not necessary between us. His stare slowly seduced me, stripping away layer after layer until the raw core of my desire was exposed. My mouth dried, leaving a thirst that needed to be quenched, but not by any liquid. I thirsted for him. My tongue moistened my lips, hoping to give them some relief. Our faces moved closer. We could have been the only two souls in the room. Somewhere between a laughing fit and blushing over an assumed romance that hadn't happened yet had become the most intimate moment of my life.</p><p>\"Pardon me,\" Samantha Tran interrupted, sliding her way between Alec and me like we were somehow blocking her way across the stage. \"Hey, handsome. Where have you been hiding all my life?\"</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\"Well, excuse me, Sam,\" I said, knowing she preferred to be called Samantha. \"What, the entire rest of the stage wasn't good enough to get your wide ass around on?\" Ordinarily it wasn't in my nature to stand up for myself. I'd spent my life avoiding conflict, but she needed to die. I wasn't saying I was going to be the one to do it. I may or may not have known how to get away with murder, but there had to be tons of ways to make it look like an accident. Even if I did get caught, I was pretty sure a judge would side with me. Especially when I explained how Samantha had slithered her slimy, disgusting body between me and the man who was about to plant the greatest kiss of my life on my lips.</p><p>Gritting my teeth, I pivoted around to face Jennifer before I could follow through on my instincts to shove the microphone stand straight up Samantha's ass. \"What a bitch,\" Jennifer whispered, shaking her head.</p><p>Alec placed his hands around my arms to help calm me down as the ballroom doors opened, allowing the party attendees to enter. Their excited chatter filled the room along with whistles and catcalls as they took in the tuxedo-clad models on stage. The rage I felt toward Samantha converted quickly to the nervousness I had been trying to tamp down earlier over speaking in front of a crowd. Michael Hinks, one of the event reps, made his way up the three shallow steps to the stage wearing a microphone headset.</p><p>\"Ladies, ladies, are you EXCITED!\" His voice boomed through the speakers, addressing the crowd. \"Ah, I take that as a yes,\" he said, responding to the many screams and whistles. \"Who here is ready to dance with the man of their dreams? To step into their favorite novel and become the heroine they've always wanted to be?\" He paused, waiting for another eruption of excitement to subside. He knew how to play to the crowd. \"Tonight you'll be able to say whether or not what happens under the cover\u2014stays under the cover,\" he said, winking outrageously at the crowd. More yells and squeals followed his words as everyone crowded closer to the stage.</p><p>Excited giggles and appreciative sighs colored the faces of those standing close to the stage. The blinding spotlights made it impossible to see past the first row of people. The other authors and models attempted to shade their eyes, trying to see the crowd, but I welcomed the blindness. The inability to see everyone staring back at me would make my introduction smoother. At least that was what I was trying to convince myself.</p><p>As Michael continued to work the women up into a frenzy, I rehearsed my introduction in my head, focusing on each word individually. What I had prepared was short, but I didn't want to make a fool of myself, especially for about the tenth time in front of Alec. Just once I'd like to show him that I wasn't some blathering, stumbling idiot.</p><p>Michael turned his attention to the stage as the spotlight moved away from my face and zeroed in on author Trisha Scott and Adam, the first of three models she had brought with her who had graced the covers of her last series. Each book had sailed effortlessly into the number-one slot on the New York Times list. Trisha was a pillar in the business and the most successful author attending the event. She had been around long before any of us had even considered writing professionally. Her voice was coarse and her skin lined with wrinkles from a lifetime of smoking the menthol cigarettes she was so fond of. She refused to acknowledge the consensus that cigarettes were harmful to your health. A person would literally secondhand smoke a pack a day if they stood around her long enough. The best part of Trisha, though, was her flair for using the word fuck. She said it stemmed from a tough Brooklyn upbringing, and she never apologized for it, no matter who she may have offended. She was tough and scary as hell, but I so wanted to be her when I grew up.</p><p>The crowd responded to Trisha's introduction of her models with a roar of pleasure. It was hard to tell if their enthusiasm had to do with her man candy or her. I suspected it was a combination of both. Even I couldn't help feeling awestruck. Trisha's books had been the first romance novels I had ever read. I would huddle under my blankets with a flashlight, knowing Mom would have crapped a brick if she caught me. Trisha's books actually taught me more about the birds and the bees than I learned in school.</p><p>Michael introduced the next author, who was someone I didn't know. She looked as uncomfortable as I felt as she stumbled through the introduction of her cover model. I felt her pain. Samantha went next. I silently cursed her the entire time, wishing a hole would open up in the earth and swallow her whole.</p><p>Before Jennifer's turn, I urged her to drag out her introduction so I could get the sudden shaking in my hands and butterflies in my stomach under control.</p><p>Before I could mentally prepare myself any further, the microphone was thrust into my hand and the bright lights were pointed in my face. I gulped briefly, trying to dislodge the brick that had formed in my throat.</p><p>My introduction flew by in a blur, but judging by the crowd's reaction to Alec as he waved, I must have managed to get the words out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michael smoothly stepped in after the introductions were finished. \"Well, there you have it, ladies. You've read the stories and now you've met the inspiration. Now it's time to bid on the one who makes your heart pitter-patter. You'll get an unforgettable evening of dancing and dining in the exclusive rooftop restaurant with the man of your dreams. Remember, all proceeds will go to the local battered women's shelter, so dig deep. After all, your fantasy is worth it.\" Michael's voice was enticing. \"Okay, hunks. Let's show these lovely ladies what they're bidding on,\" he added, gesturing for the guys to strut across the stage and show their stuff.</p><p>Jennifer and I exchanged amused looks now that the pressure of the introductions was over. Our amusement morphed to laughter as we watched Alec flexing his muscles. You couldn't see anything because of his tuxedo, but many of the women had stopped by my table during the signing and had already seen him with his shirt off. They hooted and hollered following his display, knowing what their money would be getting. Alec was clearly the crowd favorite. My laughter became more forced as the women pressed closer to the stage. Alec grinned broadly, eating up the attention. A mishmash of emotions swirled through me. I berated myself for the green-eyed monster that was suddenly rearing its head. Two hundred women were willing to donate their hard-earned money for a chance to dine and dance with Alec and yet, I was jealous as hell. Even knowing it was for a worthy cause did nothing to tame the beast.</p><p>One model after another was matched up with squeaking bid winners who bounced up to the stage to collect their prizes for the evening. Most of the women seemed to be waiting for Alec, and there was clear anticipation for his turn. I couldn't blame them. I wanted to bid on him too.</p> <p>In the end, the bidding came down to a war between an older stout woman who could have been his mom, and a leggy brunette with waist-length hair that belonged on a shampoo commercial or a Barbie doll. I crossed my fingers, praying for the older woman, but since when did I have that kind of luck? Of course Barbie won. She practically glided her way on stage. I'm pretty sure she said her name was Candy. I could have gagged. I pasted a smile on my face, pretending to be tickled pink over the outcome. In reality, I debated pulling every strand of hair from her head. We'd see how attractive she looked then.</p><p>I couldn't tell if he was putting on an act for the sake of the show, but Alec looked positively gleeful when she led him off stage to the dance floor where the other couples had already collected. I didn't know who I was kidding. Of course he was happy with his winning bidder. The speakers crooned out a love song and I almost puked when Candy snuggled into Alec's arms.</p><p>\"Do you want me to hold her arms while you pound on her?\" Jennifer whispered in my ear. \"We can turn this dance into our own version of Fight Club.\"</p><p>I sighed, turning away from Alec as he led Candy effortlessly around the dance floor. \"Is it that obvious?\"</p><p>\"If you mean, can I tell that you want to poke her eyes out? Yes, it's obvious.\"</p> <p>\"Gah, I'm trying not to.\"</p><p>Jennifer laughed, raising an eyebrow. \"Are you and Tall, Dreamy Twinkie dating? Or maybe even more than that? I know I would be if I had the chance.\"</p><p>I blanched at her words. I liked Jennifer, but the idea of anyone else doing something with Alec I hadn't done made me cringe. \"You don't think Kevin would mind?\" I asked dryly as we left the stage together. Kevin and Jennifer had been married for almost ten years and had the kind of relationship I wanted.</p><p>\"I think he'd give me a free pass if he saw Alec. Where did you two meet?\" She held the ballroom door open for me so I could exit behind her.</p><p>Glad to leave the loud music and flashing lights behind, I rolled my shoulders, trying to ease the tension that had gathered into a knot behind my neck. \"I can't take the credit for discovering him; Olivia found Alec.\"</p><p>\"Why am I not surprised? That girl has an eye for talent. I'm shocked she's not here with you.\"</p> <p>\"She wanted to, but her client list has almost doubled in the last six months. She was too busy,\" I said, stopping in front of the bank of elevators.</p><p>\"Good for her. Her talent is off the charts. Hopefully she won't get too busy for us though.\" She winked at me as the elevator doors dinged open.</p><p>I waited for the elevator to empty before stepping on. \"She better not. Are you going up?\"</p><p>Jennifer shook her head. \"No. I'm going to the bar. It's definitely time for a little liquid recuperation. Do you want to join me? Kim and Malory are supposed to meet me there.\"</p><p>\"No, thanks. My head is ready to declare mutiny if I don't find a little quiet and some Advil. I plan on taking an extra-hot bath and climbing into my sweats for a little HGTV and room service.\" Just saying the plan out loud made the introvert side of me happy. A little alone time was exactly what I needed.</p><p>Jennifer shook her head. \"You know you're twenty-two, not forty-two, right?\" she called out as the doors clicked closed.</p><p>Her words followed me up the five flights to my floor. The throbbing in my head that had been a dull pounding became a fully fledged marching band. Jennifer was right and I knew it. She wasn't telling me anything I hadn't heard from Olivia a million times. Many single women my age would likely prefer a night of partying, drinking or sleeping with guys over my good time of a hot bath, room service and Property Brothers.</p><p>The doors opened on my floor, revealing an empty hallway. Disgusted with myself, I trudged off the elevator unenthusiastically. I should have gone back downstairs with Jennifer for a little fun. If Olivia had been here, she wouldn't let me hole up in my room all night. Should have and could have were two different things with me as usual. I shuffled down the long hallway toward my room.</p> <p>I heard the sound of a door opening behind me, but gave it no thought until a loud voice startled me by calling out for my attention.</p><p>Jumping about a mile out of my skin, I turned around clutching my heart that was beating erratically. A middle-aged man with a freakishly hairy gut, who had no business being shirtless, stood leering at me. He was holding a half-empty beer bottle. Judging by the way he leaned against the doorway, it wasn't his first drink of the evening. \"Hey, sweetheart. You looking for a party?\"</p><p>\"No, thanks,\" I answered, edging backward. Standing in a quiet hotel hallway, I suddenly realized just how alone I was. I was surrounded by rooms on both sides, but I had no idea if any of them were occupied. Most normal people were probably out eating or enjoying the nightlife, not sitting in their rooms. I silently berated myself for being in this position. If I had stayed downstairs, I wouldn't be trapped in a hallway with some drunk who was looking at me like I was a treat delivered by room service.</p><p>\"Come on, baby. I'll give you the goods.\" He swayed slightly on his feet, watching as I took another step backward. His lack of steadiness gave me hope that he was too drunk to comprehend much of anything. I took another half step backward as he lurched toward me. For somebody who'd been drinking, his reflexes were surprisingly quick. He reached out and grasped my wrist, holding me in place.</p><p>A knot of dread twisted in my stomach as he pulled me toward him. \"Come on. Don't be like that,\" he belched out, making me gag. I dug my heels into the carpet as he dragged me toward his room where the door was still ajar.</p><p>I shook my head, tugging on my wrist. \"Fucking let go!\" I said, yanking harder to free my wrist. \"Let go!\" I was on the verge of panic before I remembered the self-defense moves Tony and Zachary had drilled into my head when I was thirteen. At the time, I thought they were being too overprotective and that I would never have to use any of it, but as the asshole in front of me tightened his hold, I knew I had to try something.</p><p>He tilted the beer up and took a long pull. Most of the beer went down his chest rather than into his mouth. Swiping a hand across his lips, he tossed the empty beer bottle into his room and pulled harder on my wrist. \"Come on, sweetheart. You don't know what you're missing.\" My hand scraped along the wall as I fought to keep him from getting me into his room. I opened my mouth and let out a piercing scream that echoed down the hallway.</p><p>With a final jerk, he pulled me into his meaty arms, wrapping them around my neck. I tried screaming again, but his grimy hand covered my mouth. He held me tightly against him, anticipating a fight.</p><p>This couldn't be happening. It was every woman's nightmare, but I never thought it would happen to me. If he got me into his room, nothing would ever be the same again. My screams could no longer be heard, coming out as a muffled grunt against his hand. My teeth cut into the inside of my lip, filling my mouth with the iron taste of blood. I welcomed the pain as it cut through my panic like a knife, clarifying my senses.</p><p>His rancid breath blew into my face and I felt his free hand snake around my waist, creeping up toward my breast. The idea of his nasty paw touching me made tears spring to my eyes. I would not let that happen.</p><p>Finally recalling some of my brothers' training, I let all the fight leave my body. It went against everything inside me to let myself go slack in his arms, making his job easier. His surprise and approval were evident. \"I knew you wanted to party,\" he growled in my ear, bringing his face exactly where I wanted it. Knowing I only had one shot, I reared my head back into his face with all the force I could muster. The blow smacked soundly into his nose as a ringing filled my ears. He released his hold immediately, stumbling back into the wall with blood streaming down his face. I raced down the hallway, screaming as loud as I could while I fumbled to get the key card into my door.</p><p>A woman and a burly gentleman opened the door to my left at the sound of my screaming. It wasn't hard for them to figure out what had happened when they spotted my tattered appearance and the blood gushing from the nose of my assailant.</p><p>The large man stepped from his room, standing between my attacker and me. \"What the fuck is going on? Are you messing with this little lady?\" he growled, taking a threatening step toward the drunk, who was now cradling his broken nose while fighting to stay on his feet.</p><p>\"Hey, man, I ain't looking for any trouble.\"</p><p>\"You may not have been looking, but you sure found it.\" He reached my attacker and forced his hand around the scumbag's throat, pinning him to the wall. \"Sally, call the front desk and tell them to get the cops. I got this perv.\"</p><p>She stepped closer and wrapped an arm around me. I thought by the way her body shook she must have been frightened\u2014until I realized the shaking was coming from me.</p><p>\"Is this your room?\" She reached for the key card that I still gripped in my fingers.</p><p>I nodded as my eyes filled with tears. The shakes that had overtaken me increased to the nth degree as I comprehended what had just happened. Or worse yet, what could have happened. The adrenaline that had raced through my veins burned away and I sagged weakly against my door. The kind woman gently extracted the key card from my fingers. Opening the door for me, she helped me into my room.</p><p>I looked back at my open door, terrified the guy would suddenly follow us in. \"Don't you worry, honey. My Jim isn't going to let that prick near you again,\" she said, leading me to the only chair in the room. The hallway filled with the sounds of raised voices, but I couldn't seem to focus on them. I sat huddled in the chair with my knees tucked under my chin. Wrapping my arms around my legs, I rocked back and forth, trying to still my quivering body.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The next hour passed with hotel security, police officers and paramedics crowding into my room. I was checked over thoroughly and asked repeatedly if I needed to go to the hospital. Other than the bruises on my wrist, a torn shirt and my bloody lip, I assured them I was fine.</p><p>In the midst of the chaos, Alec showed up. I had no idea how he had heard, but his presence gave me some relief. He stood stoically against the wall near where I sat, waiting quietly as I finished giving my statement to the police. His jaw was set and any of his normal playfulness was nowhere to be found.</p><p>I kept my eyes locked on his as I gave my statement, providing all the details I could remember. Describing the incident caused my voice to shake as I recounted how the drunken doughboy had tried to drag me into his room. I noticed Alec's hands ball into fists that he lightly rapped against the wall while he listened.</p><p>My two rescuers, Jim and Sally, also gave their statements and eventually my hotel room began to clear out. The paramedics were the first to leave, followed by the two police officers and then hotel security. The officers took pictures of my face and neck before handing me their cards, telling me to call if I needed anything. After they had documented my injuries, they followed hotel security out to check the surveillance cameras. The hotel manager was the last to leave after apologizing profusely, though it wasn't her fault. She assured me that my room would be comped and that anything I needed from room service would also be covered by the hotel. I nodded numbly, barely processing her words.</p><p>After giving me her card, she left my room, leaving Alec and me alone. The room felt like it doubled in size once everyone left. Neither of us moved for a moment, and I couldn't help wonder what he was thinking. Was I nothing but a walking disaster in his eyes? I tried to recall if he had seen me in any kind of setting where I wasn't the center of attention. The majority of it was me acting like a fool, but this time the situation had been beyond my control.</p><p>Unable to stand the silence any longer, I finally forced my limbs to unlock and I dragged myself to my feet. \"I'm going to take a shower,\" I mumbled. His eyes met mine and he took a half step away from the wall before hesitating.</p><p>Entering the bathroom, I leaned against the door for a moment before forcing myself to walk toward the shower. With the water at its hottest setting, I let the bathroom fill with steam as I pulled my clothes off, tossing my torn shirt into the small wastebasket. An unexpected sob clawed its way up my throat.</p><p>The water muffled the sobs and tears that followed as I let them wash away. Feeling the drunken asshole's touch still lingering on my skin, I scrubbed my body vigorously with a washcloth. By the time I stopped because I heard the bathroom door open, I had rubbed myself raw in several places. \"Alec?\" When he didn't answer, I peeked around the shower curtain to find my favorite pair of sweats and a hoodie folded on the counter. A small smile of gratitude tugged at the corners of my mouth before being replaced by a yawn.</p><p>I had no more tears left to cry, but I felt dead tired. Twisting off the shower, I stepped over the side of the tub to the bath mat to dry off. The evening's events had drained my energy supply, and all I wanted to do was crawl under the blankets and sleep. My stomach ached lightly, reminding me of my previous plan to order room service. The thought of eating now held no appeal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once I was dressed, I pulled my hair up into a loose knot on top of my head. Wiping my hand across the mirror, I studied my reflection, surprised to see the signs of the attack on my face. The guy hadn't wailed on me, but he might as well have. My bottom lip was swollen from being pushed against my teeth. Upon closer inspection, I could see a large cut inside my lip. Faint bruises had materialized on my cheeks from where his fingers gripped my face. My neck was also bruised, along with my collarbone.</p><p>The most startling feature was my almost lifeless eyes that usually danced with laughter. Mom always commented that the sparkle in my eyes was her favorite thing she had given me. At the moment the sparkle had been replaced by a dull, haunting nothingness.</p><p>Studying them critically, I felt like I'd somehow lost a part of myself tonight. For the first time in my life, I realized that I'd been pretty much kept in a bubble of safety. I'd had my share of injuries during the years, like the broken arm I got when Zach decided to pull me down our sloped driveway on roller skates. Another time Tony challenged me to a tree-climbing contest, leading to six stitches. At least I had beaten him to the top. I was able to scale the tree like a spider monkey, but during my celebration I forgot I was supposed to be hanging on. As it turned out, falling through branches was nowhere near as fun as climbing them. Despite those couple of instances, my life had been surprisingly free of any blemishes. I had never gotten into any fights. Mom and Dad were never the types of parents who spanked me or my brothers. I had even managed to escape high school relatively drama free. Honestly, I had probably transitioned into adulthood almost too easily.</p> <p>My eyes were like windows into the mixed-up feelings swirling through me. I needed to put what happened tonight behind me and move on.</p><p>Turning from the mirror, I left the bathroom, uncertain if Alec would still be waiting. I found him sitting in the chair I had vacated, talking on my cell phone. A tray with two covered plates of food sat on the foot of the bed. My stomach, which had rejected the idea of food just moments before, let out a low rumble.</p><p>Alec ended the call and looked up at me. \"Olivia,\" he said, setting my phone on the table.</p><p>I nearly groaned. \"You called, Olivia?\" I wasn't sure how I felt about him taking the liberty of calling her. She was sure to call my parents, and I wanted to tell them about the incident on my own terms, after I had fully digested it in my head.</p><p>He stood up and scooted the chair closer to the foot of the bed where the tray of food sat. \"I didn't call her. Your phone was going crazy, so I decided to answer it. I told her you'd call her back in the morning. I think she was on the verge of catching a plane if I wouldn't have answered.\"</p> <p>\"What? How did she find out?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure specifically.\" He lifted the lids off the covered plates. \"I ordered burgers. I hope that's okay.\" He patted the edge of the bed so I could sit across from him. \"I only found out because I ran into Jennifer downstairs and she told me you had gone up to the room for the night. I came up to see if you were okay. Olivia said someone who also has a room on this floor came up while all the commotion was happening with the cops and hotel security and somehow found out you were involved and posted something on Facebook. That's how she found out.\"</p><p>\"Damn it,\" I groaned. \"It's on Facebook?\" So much for privacy.</p><p>I sank down on the bed and absently picked up a fry to nibble on. I couldn't help feeling embarrassed everyone knew. \"What did Olivia say?\" My voice was barely above a whisper.</p><p>Alec looked up from slathering his burger with ketchup and mustard. \"She's concerned, just like the rest of us. I think between the two of us, she and I could have given that asshole the beating he deserves.\"</p><p>Alec had venom in his voice. I'd never seen him angry. It wasn't directed at me, but was intimidating as hell nevertheless. \"That's cool of you to say, but you don't need to fight my battles. Besides, that guy is sitting in jail probably wondering how he ended up there. I really think he believed I'd be up on his offer when he asked. My prospects might be low, but even my V-card has standards.\" I thought maybe my joke would lighten the mood, but it fell flat and sounded harsh, even to my ears. Maybe it was my mind's way of coping. It was better than the images of his disgusting hands on my body, or how close I'd come to losing the one thing that meant the most to me.</p> <p>Alec's hand tightened around the plastic cup he was holding, making it creak and crack. Neither of us spoke as we sat watching the water inside cascade down his fingers and to the floor.</p><p>\"Sorry. I know that sounded shitty. It's just\u2014\" I said, breaking the silence. I couldn't finish my thought because I really didn't know what to say. I jumped off the foot of the bed to retrieve a towel from the bathroom, but Alec had stood first, blocking my way. Unlike my incident earlier, there was nothing threatening about the way Alec stood in front of me. My eyes remained on his chest. I was too afraid of what I would see if I looked at his face. I thought I had already cried myself out, but tears collected in my eyes, spilling out and falling to the floor like the water from his cup.</p><p>Alec dragged me into his arms. My face remained tightly pressed against his chest as a new wave of sobs left me. All the fear and shame I had been fighting to hide poured out. He tightened his hold on me as I began to shake. Sweeping me up off my feet, he carried me to the bed and without releasing his hold, lowered us both so that we lay together with me cradled in his arms. He was tender and compassionate. I couldn't help but wonder how one person could be so rough while another was so gentle.</p><p>I felt awful for ruining Alec's evening. It wasn't like he had signed on for this, but it would have taken the Jaws of Life to pry me from his arms. For the first time since I'd stepped off the elevator earlier, I felt safe.</p><p>I wasn't sure when I stopped crying because I fell asleep shortly after we lay down together. The last thing I remembered was Alec rubbing his hand smoothly over my back in soothing circles. At one point I thought I felt him pull the comforter up over me, which made me burrow even closer to him, afraid he would leave me.</p><p>I slept void of any dreams in spite of what had happened, which I was thankful for. By the time I finally pried my eyes open, the room was dark, but I could tell it was morning because of the sun peeking around the edges of the curtains. Initially I thought I was alone in bed. I stretched my arms over my head, fighting the disappointment that flared through me. Of course, it was selfish to expect that Alec would have stayed with me all night. Especially since he had allowed me to soak his shirt without complaint.</p><p>I felt the bed dip down beside me, making my eyes fly open.</p><p>Alec peered at me with concern. \"God, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?\" He brushed a lock of hair off my forehead. His touch was comforting and familiar. If anything, last night had brought us closer.</p> <p>I sat up and dragged myself up against the headboard. Afraid of what I must have looked like, I smoothed a hand over my head. Medusa probably had nothing on me. \"No, it's okay. I just thought you had left.\" My voice sounded raspy and dry.</p><p>\"I did for a little bit. I figured you could use a Starbucks.\" He handed over an insulated cup with a paper sleeve on it.</p><p>I raised the steaming cup to my nose, inhaling appreciatively. \"Bless you.\" I took a sip of my coffee, marveling that he had doctored it up to my preference. His attention to detail surprised me. \"How did you remember how I take it?\" I asked, taking another sip.</p><p>He chuckled. \"I think it's a hazard of being a bartender. I tend to remember what people order. My head is filled with hundreds of worthless drink orders.\"</p><p>\"That kind of memory should come in handy when you start medical school,\" I added.</p><p>\"Let's hope so. I'd hate to take an exam in human anatomy and totally blank on the right answer for the femur when all I can think of are the ingredients for a Sex on the Beach.\"</p><p>I laughed. \"I don't know. You get the right professor and they may appreciate that. Grading anatomy exams has to be tedious. They could probably use a drink. So, why a doctor?\" I pulled my legs up and folded them under me.</p><p>\"Versus a tightrope walker like I thought I wanted to be?\" He plopped down on the bed beside me with his own coffee.</p><p>A giggle bubbled up through me. \"Tightrope walker? You're teasing.\"</p><p>\"Much to my parents' horror, no. From the time I was six years old until I was twelve, I was convinced I wanted to be a tightrope walker in the circus.\"</p><p>\"You didn't want to be a lion tamer or maybe a clown?\"</p><p>He looked at me with disbelief. \"A clown? You're kidding, right? Clowns are fucking messed up. Haven't you ever read It or seen the movie Poltergeist? Clowns are like demons. As a matter of fact, they're the only reason I changed my mind about being a tightrope walker. There was no way I could have balanced on a rope fifty feet in the air with those freaky bastards looking up at me.\" He shuddered at the thought.</p><p>My giggles turned to belly laughs. He was almost too cute for words. \"How can a big strapping guy like you be scared of sweet clowns who hand out balloons?\"</p><p>His reaction to my statement made me laugh even harder. \"I'm not sure I even know you,\" he sputtered, scooting away from me like I was a special kind of crazy and he was afraid of catching it.</p><p>Laughing as hard as I had made not only my side ache, but my lip throbbed painfully. I ignored it, not wanting to ruin our happy bubble. \"At least I know what the theme for your birthday will be this year,\" I joked. \"Oh, and Poltergeist. Thanks for reminding me. Now I know what to get you too.\"</p><p>\"You wouldn't dare.\" Anyone who had seen the movie, Poltergeist, remembered the iconic scene where the possessed clown puppet jumps from under the bed to choke the poor frightened kid.</p><p>\"What, you don't want a clown puppet? Don't worry. I'll wrap it and not just stick it under your bed or anything creepy like that,\" I said with a mischievous smile.</p><p>\"You are just plain evil.\" He wagged a finger at me, downing the rest of his coffee. \"Oh, by the way. You might want to call your parents. I guess they're freaking out too.\"</p><p>Shit. My smile dropped.</p><p>\"Did they call?\" I asked, patting around the bed for my phone.</p><p>Alec pulled it from his pocket. \"At six, seven, and again at eight. Judging by the pattern, I'd say your mom will be calling in approximately thirteen minutes,\" he said, checking the time on my phone.</p><p>\"Oh lord. Have you talked to her?\"</p><p>\"Only to reassure her that you're fine and that I was standing guard over you while you slept. Her demand, not mine.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry. Both my parents can be a wee bit overprotective. For that matter, my brothers are too. That's why I planned on keeping this from them for now. I knew I should have called Olivia last night. She probably told them,\" I grumbled, jumping out of bed. \"I'm sorry you had to hang around here all night. My mom wouldn't have known if you had gone to your own room.\" I paced back and forth, tapping my phone against my head. \"Okay, should I call her or wait for her to call me back? If I wait any longer she could work herself up even more. For all I know, she's already jumped on a plane to rescue me.\"</p><p>\"Are you talking to me or yourself?\" Alec watched me in amusement while I paced the floor. \"You know it's just a call, not the Spanish Inquisition.\"</p><p>I stopped mid-step and turned toward him incredulously. \"I would prefer the inquisition. Once my mom gets started, you're in for the long haul.\"</p><p>\"She sounded understandably concerned but very sweet.\"</p><p>\"Oh, she's sweet all right, but she's a worrywart. Even when I assure her that I'm fine, she'll probably still insist on flying here to be with me. I wouldn't be surprised if she and my brothers are in a taxi on the way here. It's the curse of being not only the baby of the family, but the only girl.\"</p><p>My phone rang in the middle of my tirade. Much to Alec's delight, the conversation went much like I had anticipated. It didn't help that Mom had me on speakerphone, so my entire family fired questions at me. It took nearly forty-five minutes to convince them they didn't need to attend the rest of my events to watch over me. I assured them having Alec around was enough to keep me safe. Of course, much to my continued mortification, once I mentioned his name, they all insisted I put him on the phone. I had to hand it to Alec. He handled the onslaught of questions like a pro. He agreed with my brothers that I would no longer wander any halls at any hotel by myself, and that I would be escorted everywhere I went. My attempts to protest were dismissed like I didn't have a say in the matter.</p><p>By the time Alec finished talking with my brothers, they had worked out a security plan that rivaled any A-list celebrity. I felt bad that Alec was pressured into their demands, but once we hung up, I would let him off the hook.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>As it turned out, it was Alec who wouldn't let me off the hook, claiming he had given my family his word. I tried to argue that my mom would never know, but he countered that he would never be able to face them, let alone forgive himself if anything happened now that he had promised to keep an eye on me.</p><p>After speaking with my family, I decided to get the inevitable call with Olivia out of the way next. Our conversation went much the same way it had gone with my mom. Alec had already given her the details of what he knew, so she basically just wanted to hear from me that I was okay. That and to tell me not to go anywhere alone again. After telling her about the elaborate security plan Alec had hatched with my brothers, she felt better and made me promise to call her again later.</p><p>I found everyone's concern for my well-being touching, even though it bordered on overkill. One isolated incident didn't mean I would be in danger everywhere I went. Still, I would have been lying if I said having Alec playing the role of knight in shining armor was unpleasant in the slightest.</p><p>Looking at the time on my phone, I gathered my clothes for the day and walked to the bathroom to get ready for an author brunch that was scheduled to begin in less than thirty minutes. My initial instinct was to skip it, especially after realizing the news of the incident had spread in my social media circles. The last thing I wanted was to become the center of attention and be asked to recount the details of something I just wanted to put behind me.</p><p>Walking out of my room felt like an act of will. Even though the drunken slob who attacked me was gone and in jail, I still had to walk by the door of his room. The room he had nearly dragged me into. As we approached from the far end of the hallway, my pace slowed. I felt like a small child, expecting the boogeyman to jump out at any moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alec must have sensed my reluctance because he grabbed me by the hand and guided me to his left side, so he stood between me and the door of the room that had nearly changed my life forever. As I looked at his face, he smiled and squeezed my hand gently to let me know everything would be okay. We continued forward. Alec's long fingers laced through mine, stroking the back of my hand. Our palms, pressed together, provided the best distraction I could have asked for.</p><p>Alec held my hand until we entered the elevator, letting go when we heard the faint sound of a train whistle coming from my purse. \"Oh yeah. I forgot about that. I hope you don't mind, but that's why your phone was on silent mode this morning. That noise wouldn't stop. I felt like we were at a train station,\" Alec said, pushing the button for the lobby.</p><p>I felt bereft, releasing his hand. \"Sorry. That's my Facebook notifications.\" I pulled out my phone and clicked on the app for the first time since waking that morning. For a minute I thought my account had been hacked. I had missed more than a hundred comments and messages since midnight. I'd never been so popular on social media.</p> <p>\"Oh god,\" I said, clicking on my timeline to see all the well wishes. Obviously, the events from the night before had spread more than I had anticipated. Reading through several of the messages, I saw that not only had the news spread like wildfire, but it had also been embellished to the point that some people were convinced I was on my deathbed.</p><p>I didn't know whether to laugh or cry as I read some of the comments. It was a poignant feeling to know so many people cared about my well-being, and clearly I would have to do a status update. So much for not thinking about it.</p><p>I clicked out of Facebook for the time being. It would take hours to respond to all the messages that were continuing to post. I decided instead to wait until Alec and I sat down for breakfast and then make my own simple post, reassuring everyone that I was okay and thanking them for their concern. My hope was that everyone's attention would move to other things and that I would be old news by the end of the day.</p><p>Walking into the author brunch a minute later, I realized maybe I'd been a tad bit na\u00efve to think it would blow over. Every single person pivoted toward Alec and me when we entered the double doors of the ballroom. It felt like I was the guest of honor of some demented bereavement party, which was ironic considering I wanted to drop dead. I had been hoping to gain some visibility by doing the bigger signing events, but not become infamous. What happened wasn't my fault, but I still felt stupid for putting myself in the position in the first place.</p><p>Jennifer offered the respite I needed by waving me over to her table where she had two extra chairs. I focused on her like an oasis in a desert, ignoring everyone else in the room as we made our way to our seats.</p> <p>\"You okay?\" she asked, giving me a quick hug before I sat down.</p><p>I nodded, smiling meekly. The other five people sitting at the table looked at me with a mixture of concern and curiosity. Luckily, none of them were brave enough to say anything. It was only human nature. We were drawn to anything dramatic. I actually felt as writers, we were naturally more curious and possessed a thirst for drama flowing through our blood that the average person didn't have. A writer's curiosity definitely rivaled that of a cat.</p><p>Thankfully, the keynote speaker was introduced, taking the spotlight from me for the time being. She was a worldwide bestseller who had hit the New York Times list more times than she probably could count. I'd been looking forward to hearing her address, but I found myself having a hard time focusing on her words as I unfolded my napkin and smoothed it over my lap. I felt like I had a load of bricks in my stomach, making it difficult to breathe.</p><p>Alec reached over, covering my hand that was nervously fidgeting with my napkin. His touch was warm and soothing against my skin. I looked up from my lap to find Alec smiling subtly. Grateful that he seemed to sense what I needed, the corners of my mouth raised slightly as my nerves instantly settled. I took a sip of water from the glass in front of me, waiting for my stomach to return to normal.</p><p>Of course when Alec decided to lightly trace patterns on the palm of my hand with his finger, it didn't help my erratic breathing. I was appreciative to have him caring so intently, but his touch made my body react in ways that were equally as distracting as everyone watching me.</p><p>Only when everyone in the room began clapping had I realized the keynote speech had ended. For the sake of my own sanity, I pulled my hand from Alec's, glaring at him when he chuckled. He knew exactly was he was doing. Maybe he was onto the little seduction plan I had been working on before the craptastic events of the night before pushed them to the back burner. Having him now acting so attentive and quite frankly, like a boyfriend, had me seriously wondering if Alec had his own agenda for us or if he was just really good at being the hero.</p> <p>The noise level in the large dining hall rose after the keynote address and the servers began coming out with trays of food. \"How you doing, hun?\" Jennifer asked quietly.</p><p>I pasted on a bright smile, nearly shrieking when I felt the cut on the inside of my lip reopen. I ran my tongue over it, capturing a drop of blood. \"Okay,\" I said ruefully, wiping my napkin across my mouth. Despite my efforts to the contrary, it was clear I wasn't my normal self. \"I was shaken up last night, but I feel much better this morning.\"</p><p>Jennifer scooted her chair to face me, turning away from the others seated at the table. \"Is it true he dragged you in his room?\" She asked her question carefully, but I knew she wasn't trying to be intrusive. She was truly concerned.</p><p>I directed my answer at her even though I knew everyone at the table had one ear on me and the other on their own conversations. Alec slung his arm across the back of my chair, providing moral support. I sighed before continuing, but I figured the sooner I spread the word about what had really happened, the quicker things would die down.</p><p>\"He tried, but I fought him off,\" I finally answered.</p><p>Jennifer gasped. \"And you didn't know who he was?\"</p><p>\"No. He was just some asshat who had too much to drink. He was pretty convinced I would want to join him in his partying.\"</p><p>\"God. So he was drunk?\"</p> <p>I nodded. \"Plastered. I'd like to think if he would have been sober he wouldn't have tried to force me into his room.\"</p><p>Alec shook his head next to me, growling in disagreement.</p><p>I turned to him in surprise. Even through my river of tears the night before and his phone conversation with Mom and Dad, Alec and I had skirted around talking about what had happened. He hadn't asked for any more details beyond what he had heard while I gave my statement to the police. \"Obviously, you disagree,\" I said, raising my eyebrow.</p><p>\"From what I saw when the cops dragged him away, the guy was a serial asshole who wasn't afraid to try and throw his weight around. Drunk or not, you don't try to handle a woman against her will unless you're a perverted fuck to begin with. Hopefully, they give him more than a slap on the wrist and then he gets what he deserves in jail.\"</p><p>I was shocked at the venom in his voice. He seemed adamant about his opinions, speaking like he had some type of previous experience with something similar.</p><p>\"What a freaking scum,\" Jennifer piped in, patting my hand. \"How did you get away from him? I would have been so scared. You're so brave, Nicole.\"</p><p>I shrugged. I didn't feel brave. I felt foolish and dumb. \"My brothers drilled self-defense into my head when I was younger. I actually panicked at first and forgot some of what they taught me. I was more shocked than anything when the guy grabbed me and started pulling me toward his room.\" Alec stiffened beside me, and I paused for a split second before continuing. Describing the details felt like pulling off a Band-Aid\u2014the quicker the better. \"It wasn't until he wrapped his arm around my neck and placed a hand over my mouth that was I able to recall what my brothers had taught me. I guess I took him by surprise.\"</p><p>Jennifer looked horrified by the time I finished. Looking around the table, I saw she wasn't the only one. I guess I couldn't blame them. If I was a sitting in their seats, listening to someone else recount how they had been attacked, I would have probably reacted the same way. You hear similar stories all the time on the news, but when it happens to someone you know, or worst yet, when it happens to you, things become more surreal.</p><p>Jennifer leaned in, giving me a one-armed hug. \"I'm so proud of you. Thank god you kept your wits. It gives me the creeps to think about what that asshole would have done to you.\"</p><p>\"French toast?\" Alec held out a serving dish to me. His blatant move to change the subject wasn't lost on me or anyone else at the table. Jennifer and the others took the hint and let the subject drop. We began passing around serving dishes filled with breakfast foods that had been served family style. I was thankful for his interference and grateful to finally be done talking about the unfortunate incident for now.</p><p>As the day wore on though, I was asked to retell the story over and over again. I found it funny and sad at the same time how news of such a horrible occurrence could spread like wildfire on social media and then so many people still had no qualms about wanting to hear the nitty-gritty straight from the horse's mouth.</p><p>By the time of the massive signing later that evening, the real reason for the whole event, my teeth were on edge. I had to paste a smile on my face for something that should have been a joy. I handed out Wicked Lovely swag to everyone who came by my table, acting as if everything was okay, but truthfully, I needed a break from people. More to the point, I needed them to stop asking about the incident. I just wanted to interact with readers and book lovers like me, and talk about romance and swoon-worthy male characters. More than two thousand tickets had been sold to the signing alone. It was important that I get swag into the hands of as many readers as I could. That was the point of the trip.</p><p>Alec acted as a major buffer during the signing. The many women waiting had no idea of knowing, but I could tell that although charming as always, he seemed to be on edge also. He posed for pictures and tolerated all the groping and touching he had become used to, but beneath the surface, I sensed Alec was functioning on a slow boil.</p><p>Eventually, the three-hour signing came to a close. The smile I'd pasted on my face the entire time slipped as I slumped into my chair. Alec immediately began breaking down my banner and I jumped up to help him. Neither of us spoke as we packed away my belongings. Plans for late dinners were being thrown around and several people asked us to join them, but Alec politely declined each one, speaking for the both of us. Our attempt to leave the ballroom was a slow process, as everyone seemed to want to say goodbye or at least offer some type of condolence.</p><p>When we finally made it back to my room, we dumped everything in the corner and Alec sat on the edge of the bed, grabbing the room service menu.</p><p>\"Why don't you take a shower and I'll order us some dinner?\"</p><p>Ordinarily, I might have bristled at his almost insistent tone. I may have been a shy person, but my mom always said I had been stubbornly independent from the moment I started walking. My biggest fights with my brothers growing up had been when they tried to boss me around.</p><p>Maybe this time I was just tired, but nothing about the way Alec seemed to be ordering me around ruffled my feathers. If anything, I liked it. Coming from him, it felt good to be told what to do. I wished he would make up his mind and take command another way.</p><p>\"Anything in particular you want?\" Alec asked without looking up from the menu.</p><p>\"No. How about you surprise me?\" It amazed me how he always managed to ask a question that made it seem as if he were reading my mind.</p><p>\"Take your time,\" Alec answered.</p><p>Taking his advice, I decided to forget the shower and sit in a hot bubble bath. I used the bottle of vanilla bean body wash I had brought with me to build a mound of suds and dipped my body into the warm water, letting it swaddle me like a cocoon. I lay perfectly still, listening through the door to the sound of the TV Alec had clicked on. After more than thirty minutes of draining the tub slightly when the water cooled off and adding hot water again, I stood up to towel off before I fell asleep. I opened the bathroom door wearing my sweats, inhaling the scent of hot pizza.</p><p>Alec sat on the bed, already devouring one of the slices. \"I hope pizza is cool?\"</p><p>\"It's perfect,\" I answered, grabbing my own slice and climbing up on the bed beside him. In between bites, he passed me the remote control and I flipped around the channels, settling on a baseball game on ESPN. \"We watch sports when we eat pizza at my house,\" I said, shrugging my shoulders at his look of surprise. It felt comforting to be doing something so normal and familiar.</p><p>\"I'm not sure I've ever been with a girl who actually enjoys baseball,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have no idea. We could turn down the sound and I could do the play-by-play and you wouldn't know the difference. I was raised watching sports.\"</p><p>\"Well, kiss my ass. We're going to be good pals after all,\" he laughed, patting my thigh. I flinched, trying to control my suddenly erratic pulse.</p><p>We managed to polish off the pizza and breadsticks he had ordered, along with an entire two-liter of soda. I leaned back against the headboard, feeling completely full and content.</p><p>Alec stood up, grabbed the boxes off the bed and placed them on the small table in the corner. I sat up, slightly panicked at the idea of him leaving. \"I'm going to go take a quick shower and then we can watch the rest of the game, if that's okay?\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I answered, relieved that he was coming back. \"Can you leave the door open between our rooms?\" If he thought I was being childish for asking, he didn't say so.</p><p>\"Sure. I'll only be a few minutes,\" he said reassuringly before heading out.</p><p>I slid under the blanket on my bed, pulling it up to my neck as I waited for Alec to return. I barely paid attention to the game as I practically counted the minutes in my head. Each second dragged as if Father Time wasn't willing to let them go. I grabbed my phone off the nightstand, but only to make sure I hadn't missed any calls from Mom or Olivia. I had no interest in checking on anything else.</p><p>Finally, after what felt like an eternity in my head, Alec returned wearing loose-fitting mesh basketball shorts and a muscle shirt, which truly lived up to its name while on him. His towel-dried hair, still slightly wet from the shower, did nothing but add to his sex appeal.</p><p>\"Sorry that took so long. I trimmed up my stubble a little too,\" he said, smoothing a hand over his light cover of facial hair. He climbed up on the bed beside me and leaned back against the headboard.</p><p>I tried to mimic his relaxed posture, but all I could focus on was how delectable he looked next to me. I'd seen him shirtless, in a tuxedo and even in wet swim trunks, but something about the way he looked fresh out of the shower and ruffled was pleasing on a whole new level for me. His shorts sat low on his hips, held up by a simple elastic band. The thin material kept hidden, but teased at what lie underneath. It was like finding myself in a gourmet chocolate shop, but unable to buy anything. His body screamed to be sampled and I wanted a taste. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alec seemed oblivious to what he did to my body by lying next to me. His apparent lack of interest had me second-guessing what I had tried to convince myself all the touches and overprotectiveness throughout the day meant. To him, I was a buddy to hang with and talk sports, nothing more. He kept a running commentary through the game, munching on the chocolate chip cookies he had snagged from the lobby. Basically, he seemed to be having a grand old time. I, on the other hand, was in confusion hell.</p><p>When the game came to an end, a sudden awkwardness entered my mind as I wondered whether he would leave for his room. I hated the idea of being alone, but had no idea how to ask him to sleep with me, or sleep next to me would be the better way to put it. It was irrational. Eventually I would have to be alone again. Just not here. I wanted to curse the son of a bitch who had put me in this position, but I didn't want to work myself up and cry again in front of Alec.</p><p>Saving me the embarrassment of asking, he took the matter out of my hands and slid under the blanket, making himself comfortable. I looked down at him gratefully, hiding a smile as I slid down on my own pillow. He didn't ask if he could stay, and obviously I didn't object. It was nice to have him there.</p> <p>He reached over and switched off the light once we were both settled. Following his lead, I turned off the television, plunging the room into darkness.</p><p>I became hyperaware of a couple of things at once. With the exception of the previous night, which didn't count because he hadn't actually confirmed whether he slept next to me, this was the first time I'd ever slept with a man. I had always envisioned this moment coming after a long night of passionate lovemaking, after which I would fall asleep in the arms of the man who had finally taken my virginity.</p><p>The way we both laid like statues was nothing like I had imagined. It was like we had an invisible line down the center of the mattress that neither of us wanted to cross. Even our breathing was quiet and slow so as not to disturb the other. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought he had somehow slithered out of bed without me feeling it and snuck next door to his room without saying anything. I wanted to inch my hand over to check, but I clenched it into a fist and fought the urge. Instead, I tried focusing on his breathing over the sound of the air conditioner that I wished would cycle off so I could hear better.</p><p>My eyelids became heavy as I waited. I struggled to keep them open. Only when I heard the deep rumble of snoring did I smile with relief and allow myself to succumb to sleep.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>A scream tearing through my throat woke me several hours later. Before it had even ended, I was embraced by a pair of comforting, familiar arms. I tried to pull myself from the grips of fear that had followed me out of the dream that was already fading. I couldn't even remember what had frightened me, but it was enough to give me the shakes upon awaking. Grateful for the protective cage Alec's arms provided, I snuggled closer.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" He stroked a hand gently up and down my back. \"It must have been quite a nightmare.\"</p><p>I nodded against his chest. It had been a nightmare, but the only detail I could remember was the bone-crushing fear that had wrapped around me like a trap.</p><p>\"Do you want to talk about it?\" He moved his hands in small massaging circles down my back.</p><p>I shook my head, though it was too dark for him to see my response. I nestled in closer, relieved when the last of the shakes left me. \"I honestly don't remember what it was about,\" I finally answered against his neck. \"I just remember being more scared than I've ever been.\"</p><p>His hand paused at my words as he shifted his body slightly. Suddenly, I became aware of just how close we were. My breasts were pressed against the hard planes of his chest while my face was tucked into the crook of his neck. It was the bottom half of my body, though, that had changed the dynamics of our embrace. Our legs had somehow become intimately tangled together, and there was no way he could hide how hard he had become. A delicious heat traveled through me, relishing in the fact that the desire I felt for him was indeed not one-sided. A steady throbbing at the junction of my legs begged me to press closer to him, but I couldn't be the one to make the first move. There was no way I could handle his rejection again, but more than that, I didn't want him to leave.</p> <p>We remained silent, neither of us acknowledging what both of our bodies clearly wanted. His hand continued to travel along my back and along my side, making my panties damp. The feeling was maddening. \"Can I ask you a question?\" I finally asked bravely.</p><p>His hand stalled as if he had a sense of what I was going to ask. \"Sure,\" he answered apprehensively.</p><p>Swallowing hard, I nearly lost my nerve before I could get the question out. \"Why do you have your virgin rule?\" I spit the words out, afraid that if I didn't they would get lodged in my throat forever.</p><p>When he didn't answer right away, I regretted my question. His hand lay heavy on my back. I was sure my intrusive question had placed a wedge between us. It was the question he didn't want me to ask. I tried sitting up to give him the chance to leave, but he surprised me by tightening his hold around me.</p><p>He took a deep breath and exhaled. \"It's a long story,\" he said, sounding like he dreaded telling me the answer.</p><p>My hand inched up until it rested on his chest while I waited for him to continue. His heart beat slow and steady in my ear.</p><p>The silence stretched again between us and I began to think he wasn't willing to share his secret. I couldn't help feeling disappointed. He knew so much about me\u2014gotten a glimpse of my weaknesses and seen me at my worst, and still, he wasn't willing to open up to me.</p><p>\"It's difficult for me to talk about because it's not something I'm particularly proud of,\" he said, finally breaking the silence as his hand began to draw patterns on my back. \"When I was nineteen, I met a girl at a college party my fraternity had thrown. My buddies and I were all freshmen and complete dogs when it came to chasing ladies. Sleeping around and one-night stands were all part of the norm. And it wasn't like the girls didn't know that going in. Sometimes they were as bad as we were. It was like a revolving door of drinking and sex. We were young and dumb.\"</p> <p>I knew what he meant. Olivia had spent a fair amount of time jumping from one bed to the next. I never judged her. Hell, there were times when I wanted to do the same thing, experience different guys, but it was never my scene. I always managed to find an excuse. By mid-freshman year, I had become neck deep in writing, and from that moment on, I rarely emerged from that bubble until last spring. That was when I came to the startling realization that just like in high school, everyone I knew was having sex but me. It wasn't like I didn't have chances. Many guys on campus hadn't exactly been shy about propositioning me into the world of illicit sex, but somewhere in the process of writing my novels, I had built up my first time on a pedestal to the point where I began to idolize it. Like no one shy of Prince Charming himself would deflower me. What a dipshit I was.</p><p>\"So, anyway,\" Alec continued. \"We were both pretty much shitfaced when we stumbled into each other. We laughed our clumsy asses off and ended up heading out to the patio to talk and drink some more. Well, you know how those things go. We ended up doing a whole lot more than talking. Hell, I was so drunk I didn't even bag my junk like I normally would have. I knew better, but that night things escalated so fast.\" His voice was bitter and filled with regret. \"Before I knew it, we were in my room and she was on top of me with her tongue shoved down my throat. She was wearing this little skirt that made it very easy for things to spiral out of control. The next day, I didn't give it much thought. She had left and we'd both gotten what we wanted out of the evening.\"</p><p>I shifted, trying to put a little distance between us. I was the one who had asked the question, but hearing how he had banged some chick made me feel slightly nauseous. I didn't want to think about his hands on some other girl while he did things to her that I ached for him to do to me.</p><p>Alec's arms remained firm, not allowing me to move. It was as if he were forcing me to listen since I had pressed. \"Anyway, a couple days after the party, she started coming around, wanting to hang out like we were a couple. Literally every day after my afternoon classes I would find her sitting on the steps of the frat house. I wasn't interested in a relationship, but even when I tried to explain that to her, she wouldn't listen. Where it got really fucked up is when she dropped the bomb on me that she wasn't even a student at UF. She was starting her senior year in high school. And not only that, I was her first time\u2014with, you know. She practically turned into a stalker, telling me she loved me, leaving notes on my car. I didn't know what to do. I was young and stupid, so I ignored her after that. She freaked. One day she showed up at the frat house and busted a window with a brick. She screamed we were over like we'd been dating for a year or something. I tried calming her down, but she wouldn't let me touch her. She stormed off and I didn't hear from her for a couple of months after that.\"</p><p>\"Sorry. It must have been rough, huh?\" Suddenly I began to understand Alec's hesitancy toward me. Not that I had any intention of going psycho on him like that poor girl had, but I could see why he would remain cautious.</p><p>\"Wait, there's more. Like I said, I screwed up during our night together at the party and didn't take the necessary precautions. I believed her when she said she was on the pill. Two months later, she and her dad showed up at the frat house as I was heading out to take my bio exam.\"</p><p>Dread filled me as I began to suspect where this was leading. I stopped trying to pull away and instead snaked an arm around his torso so I could be the one to comfort him for a change.</p><p>\"Her dad claimed that since I had knocked up his seventeen-year-old daughter, it only seemed fitting that I marry her. The only thing missing was a shotgun. It was a fucking mess. She cried the entire time and looked totally pitiful. Seeing her in tears, I realized had I not been so wasted, maybe I would have noticed that she wasn't a college student. I mean, this girl seriously looked young, even for seventeen. Sometimes, now, I think that subconsciously I had known, but all I cared about was keeping my dick happy. I was utterly disgusted with myself.\"</p><p>I tightened my arm around him, feeling his pain. It was a shitty situation, and I felt bad for him.</p><p>\"I knew I was the king of assholes, but I also knew I couldn't marry some girl I didn't even know. We would have made each other miserable. When her father pressed me, I had to get my parents involved, who of course, agreed with me that forcing two people to get married wouldn't help either of our lives. Her father made it clear that abortion was not an option. I tried to tell Candace that I would be there for the baby. I had acted like a dickhead up until that point, but I wasn't going to shirk my responsibilities. Candace's father refused to discuss any other solution but a wedding, and everything pretty much fell apart after that. The fraternity decided they didn't want to deal with any more drama, and threw my ass out. Candace's father did everything in his power to keep me from becoming involved in the pregnancy.\"</p><p>I gasped at his words. \"No.\" I couldn't believe her father had done that. I wondered what my dad would have done if I had put him in the same position. I suppose no father wanted to feel like his daughter had been taken advantage of.</p><p>\"Yep. It was a nightmare. My parents had to get the courts involved. It got to the point where I couldn't concentrate on my classes, so I left school for a year while we tried to sort out the situation. I felt like my life was ruined. One single night had totally kneecapped me. All my plans and dreams had now changed.\"</p><p>I could not believe my ears. It was a terrible thing to happen to any person. \"God, I'm sorry. They shouldn't have done that to you. You didn't deserve it.\"</p><p>He sighed. \"It definitely made me grow up, and in the end I got a daughter out of it. She just turned five last month. She's cute as a button. I can't regret that night because without it I wouldn't have her. I hated that it played out the way it did, but Candace and I both had to make sacrifices. She basically had to give up her senior year of high school. No one was left unscathed that night, except for Lily.\"</p><p>My throat was thick with emotion. Alec had a daughter, and clearly he was quite fond of her. His admission was far beyond what I had been expecting when I pressed him for the answer to his virgin mystery. Hearing the way his voice had softened when he talked about Lily made me melt. Alec was proving to be a great guy.</p><p>\"So, that's what you meant when you said you had to take time off from school?\"</p><p>He nodded against my head. \"It took me a while to get my shit together. After a lengthy court battle, I was awarded joint custody. It was rough for a couple of years after that, but eventually Candace and her family came around. She'd grown up a lot since the night we met. I guess having a child will do that. She apologized for what her dad had done and for lying to me about being on the pill. I wanted to stay mad at her, but we both agreed that we would do everything in our power to make sure Lily always came first. Candace likes to joke that Lilly wrapped me around her finger and won't let go.\"</p><p>\"You two are close? You and Candace?\" The way he talked about her, I wasn't sure I wanted to know.</p><p>He nodded. \"She's the mother of my child. We're always going to have that connection, but I was right when I refused to marry her. We would have never worked. I guess you could say we were destined to be friends. Maybe If I wouldn't have been some horny teenager when we met, I would have realized that.\" He removed his hand from my back and raised it above his head to stretch his shoulder. \"I guess you could say I'm a lot smarter now when it comes to that.\"</p><p>Maybe I was jumping to conclusions, but I felt I knew what he was getting at. This was Alec's way of telling me we would never work. As far as he was concerned, we would never be more than friends. My stomach twisted into knots as I struggled not to embarrass myself by doing something crazy like crying. I knew that I would have to respect his decision, especially knowing what he had gone through. \"Okay,\" I muttered against his neck. We would be friends. It's not like I had any reason to complain. He'd proven to be excellent in that category, so it wouldn't be any great hardship.</p><p>\"Okay what?\" he asked, pulling me closer. Feeling him pressed against me only made me angry, like he was now taunting me. If he just wanted to be friends, he shouldn't be allowed to press his hard cock against the part of me that was being denied what it wanted the most.</p><p>I attempted again to squirm out of his arms. \"Okay, I get that you just want to be friends, but if that's the case, you need to stop rubbing your junk against me,\" I said sourly, scooting to swing my legs over the edge of the bed. I needed to put some distance between us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alec's firm arm encircled my waist, dragging me back to where I had just been. This time I was on my back with Alec perched over me on his hands and knees. I could barely make out his features in the thin band of moonlight that peeked around the curtains. \"You know what, sweetheart? For someone who writes romance novels, you're clueless when it comes to reading a man.\"</p><p>I blew out an exasperated breath in his face. \"Oh, well enlighten me, oh wise one. You just said you're smarter about knowing when a relationship would be better as a friendship, and let's not forget, it wasn't that long ago that you flat turned me down. What would you expect if you were me, except that you were trying to let me down easy? Well, message received.\"</p><p>\"Hush up a second,\" he said, resting his lower body so he was cradled between my legs. Every inch of him was still hard and ready with desire. I couldn't help lifting my hips, pressing myself against him. My toes curled under and gripped the blanket. \"Does that feel like someone who wants to let you down easy?\" His hand reached out for the side of my face before he paused. \"Are you okay with this?\"</p> <p>I knew what he was asking. A lot had transpired in the last day or so. Maybe what happened to me in the hallway should have made me gun shy about intimacy, but what my attacker had tried to do felt nothing like this. That had been a violation. What Alec was asking was worlds apart.</p><p>I nodded my head and without hesitation, his lips captured mine. A thousand sensations flooded my mind at once. Like the way his tongue entered my mouth with finesse and ease, tangling with mine and stroking it boldly. How it moved in my mouth in such an intimate way that I felt we were already making love. The heat between my legs rose to a feverish fire as my hips began to grind against him. I pulled relentlessly at his shirt, wanting to rip it from his body.</p><p>He reached out and captured my hands, chuckling as he pulled back slightly. \"Baby, slow down. I've been obsessing about this for weeks. I'm not ready for it to end before it really gets started. Trust me. I'm going to do you the way you deserve.\" He nearly brought me to climax with his statement. He raised his body and pulled his shirt over his head.</p><p>I placed my hands on his expertly sculpted abs, but he captured them again, placing them back over my head. I began to think he was deliberately toying with me until I felt him lifting the hem of my shirt. Moments later his mouth found the sensitive skin of my stomach and I almost came up off the mattress. Gripping the sheets with clenched fists, I arched my back as his lips left a fiery trail over my abdomen. I moaned, begging for more of his tongue that stroked over my ribcage, traveling up my side. His tongue moved over the swell of my breast, taking me fully in his mouth. He tugged gently at my hard nipple with his teeth and my hands moved instinctively to his hair, pulling me closer against his mouth. I wanted so much more, which sounded greedy, but I didn't care.</p><p>\"Please,\" I begged.</p> <p>He listened but continued tormenting my hunger as he swirled his tongue around my nipple before releasing it and looking up at me. \"Please what, baby? What do you want?\" His voice was husky and sexy as hell. He knew exactly what I wanted. My body felt like it was coming apart at the seams, and we were just getting started.</p><p>My breathing began to rise like I had been sprinting and I panted the words out, trying to tell him what I wanted. \"You,\" I finally said, pulling his mouth to mine. I tried wrapping my legs around him to drag him back where I needed him to be, but he took control again, anchoring me in place. He rested again on top of me and I moaned in pleasure. Every nerve in my body was alive and seemed to be seeking the same release.</p><p>I reached for his shorts, trying to pull them off his hips. He lowered his body, taking them out of my reach. Just as I was about to display my displeasure, his mouth returned to my lower stomach again, taking a southern turn while dragging my sweats and panties with him. Yes, god, yes, I chanted. He was a magician with his mouth, making everything from my hips down quiver with need.</p><p>He lifted his head for a moment. \"You like?\" He didn't wait for an answer as his mouth returned to the part of me that throbbed out of control.</p><p>The wave of pleasure that had approached time and time again, only to be squashed when he pulled away, began coming at full force. The faster his tongue moved, the more intense it felt. I was no stranger to orgasms, but none that ever came from my own hand had felt like this. This was no fantasy. It was real and beyond my control.</p><p>Alec lifted his mouth and dropped another hot kiss on my stomach. He stood and shed his shorts, pulling a condom from his pocket before dropping them to the floor. I watched with hooded eyes as he rolled on a condom. The anticipation was almost more than I could take.</p> <p>He climbed on the bed again, settling himself between my legs. I could feel his hard cock pressed against me and I spread my legs farther. \"I don't want to hurt you,\" he said raggedly.</p><p>\"You won't,\" I responded, coaxing him forward by looping my legs around his waist. I felt the tip of him waiting hesitantly to slide into me and I welcomed the intrusion by lifting my hips.</p><p>\"Sweetheart, it's going to hurt,\" he panted. He was trying his best to make my first time as pleasurable as possible. The sentiment was sweet, but I needed him inside me. I ran my hand along his neck, bringing his mouth down to mine. My tongue parted his lips as my hands moved smoothly down his back, cupping his tight butt. Without warning, I lifted my hips, thrusting him against me.</p><p>He groaned against my mouth as I bit back a gasp of pain. A burning sensation had replaced the tingling between my legs as my body struggled to accept his size.</p><p>Alec held himself still as I began to adjust to having him inside me. His tongue gently tickled my lips, coaxing my mouth to open. He kissed me and the burning sensation began to disappear as desire began to stir in me again. My eyes found his as he slowly began to move inside me. My body, which seemed to reject him at first, began to open and accept him fully as my wave of need rose. His hands gripped mine above my head, holding me in place as his movements increased. I lifted my hips, not wanting him to stop.</p><p>He moaned, thrusting faster and faster. \"How can you feel so fucking good?\"</p><p>His words sent me over the edge as my orgasm ripped through me like a freight train. I yanked my hands from his grip, tearing into his back with my nails. He moaned loudly, pushed into me one last time before collapsing on me.</p><p>Alec stroked his hand over my hair as we both struggled to catch our breath. After a few seconds I was able to talk again. \"Holy shit, why didn't I do that years ago?\"</p> <p>He chuckled on top of me, which nearly made me jump from the tingling sensation between my legs. \"I hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but it's not always like that.\"</p><p>\"It's not? So, are you telling me you're like some sex god or something?\"</p><p>\"No, I'm saying you must be. It's never been like that for me before.\"</p><p>\"Shut up.\" I knew he was trying to make me feel better, but I appreciated it anyway.</p><p>\"I'm not kidding. I'm thinking we're going to have to do it again so I know for sure.\"</p><p>We continued making love for the rest of the night, stopping only to give him a chance to recover in between. By the time the sun was beginning to rise, I was afraid I had put him out of commission for a week. It was as if my body wanted to squash years of pent-up sexual frustration into one night. \"Did I break you?\"</p><p>\"Let's put it this way: I don't think I have any fluids left in my body,\" he laughed, looking completely spent. I kissed him across his chest, loving that he looked so content. \"I've never worked out that hard at the gym.\"</p><p>\"And to think we have to catch a plane in less than four hours,\" I said, making him moan. He managed to drag himself out of bed and got dressed to go downstairs to grab us a couple of lattes. I snatched up my phone, seizing the opportunity to call Olivia.</p><p>\"Do you have any idea what time it is?\" She sounded like I would have had I not just had the best night of my life.</p><p>\"I know, sorry. I only have a few minutes and wanted to give you the big news.\" I could barely contain my enthusiasm enough to tell her. \"Alec and I did it last night.\" The phone was quiet for a second and I pulled it away from my ear to make sure I hadn't lost the connection.</p><p>She moaned before the impact of what I had told her sank in. \"Wait. Did you just say what I think you did?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I squeaked.</p><p>\"Oh my god. I freaking knew it!\" she yelled exuberantly. Her voice was so loud I had to pull the phone away from my ear. \"How was it? Is he hung like a horse?\"</p><p>\"That's disgusting, but pretty much, yeah. And it was good.\"</p><p>\"Just good? Come on, give me more than that.\"</p><p>\"I only have a minute before he comes back. It was excellent, okay? It kind of hurt at first, if you know what I mean, but after that, I didn't want to stop.\" It was a little embarrassing giving her the dirty details, but we had been waiting for this moment forever.</p><p>\"See, didn't I tell you? Now just keep doing it. It only gets better and better.\"</p><p>\"All right. Well, go back to sleep. I have to go before he gets back with our coffees.\"</p><p>\"You got him to fetch your morning coffee too? Damn, you go, girl.\" We both laughed and said goodbye. Before I hung up, she made me promise to call her again when I had the chance to give her more details.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Alec and I left behind Nashville and all the bad reminders of my attack. Needless to say, we had created some new memories that trumped anything else. We flew into New Orleans for the second stop on our book signing tour. Since the Wicked Fantasies Book Festival didn't officially begin for another day and a half, we pretty much locked ourselves in my hotel room to see if we could create the same magic we had in Nashville.</p><p>The necessity of sustenance to replete our drained bodies coaxed us out of bed the next morning. We showered together, bringing a whole new meaning to the process. There was something incredibly sexy about a man's soapy hands skating smoothly around every curve of your body. Repaying the favor was even better. Feeling lethargic and relaxed, I flopped down on the bed, wrapped in a towel. I tried luring Alec to join me, but his stomach was threatening mutiny. Plus, he was anxious to explore the city since I had never been to New Orleans. He said he would give me the expert tour. Begrudgingly, I allowed him to drag me up to my feet so I could get dressed. After twenty minutes and one last longing look at the comfort of the room, we left to head downstairs.</p><p>\"I think I've created a nympho,\" Alec teased as we stepped into the empty elevator.</p><p>\"Pssh. I think I've always been one. You just helped release the beast. Does that disturb you?\"</p><p>He tugged me into his arms. \"Not on your life. If anything, it makes me want you more.\" He lowered his voice to a deep, seductive whisper. \"I want to touch every inch of you, letting my fingers lead the way before my mouth follows the same path.\" His mouth moved across my neck and up to my earlobe where he nipped gently. \"I want to take you every way possible and make you beg for more,\" he growled lightly before his mouth took mine.</p><p>His actions sent a shudder of pleasure rippling from my head to my toes. \"You better stop or the only part of the city you're going to see is the view from the room,\" I said, pulling away.</p><p>\"Babe, you have no idea what's coming. We're going to turn our tour of the city into a giant foreplay session.\" He trailed his hand across my chest, making my hardened nipples tingle beneath my lacy bra. I snatched his hand, pulling it tightly against my bosom.</p><p>\"Careful. You think because I'm new to this I don't know how to play?\" I slid my hand down to his crotch, rubbing him until he became rock hard under his jeans. \"You want me to take this right here, right now?\" He watched me intently as I began lowering myself to my knees, reaching for the clasp of his jeans.</p><p>\"Too late,\" I said, standing when the elevator dinged, signaling our arrival at the lobby. I breezed through the doors when they opened, leaving Alec to walk awkwardly past a group of women waiting to get on.</p><p>Alec caught up with me outside the hotel before I could reach the three shallow steps that led to the sidewalk. \"Touch\u00e9,\" he said, lacing his fingers through mine. \"Obviously you've got game. Who would have thought?\" I threw my head back, laughing.</p><p>The air outside in New Orleans was thick and muggy. Alec tucked me under the crook of his arm as we made our way along uneven streets that were littered with tourists. Having never been to New Orleans, the city was different than what I had envisioned. It had been almost nine years since Hurricane Katrina and everywhere you looked there was still evidence of the storm's destruction and damage that still had not been repaired. I remembered being in middle school when the storm hit and watching the coverage on TV with my parents. I felt so sorry for the people the news stations would show who had lost everything they owned.</p><p>Alec laughed, seeing the sour expression on my face as we sidestepped a pothole filled with murky water. \"Why do you keep wrinkling your nose?\"</p><p>\"Because it's stinky here,\" I whispered so I wouldn't offend any of the locals.</p><p>\"That's because it's pretty much a party town. There are nicer areas. Bourbon Street here is just a whole different experience,\" he said as an attendant standing outside a strip club tried to entice us inside with the offer that ladies got in for half price.</p><p>\"Oh lord,\" I muttered, scooting closer to Alec, who chuckled again.</p><p>\"You don't want to go check it out?\" I could tell by his tone that he was teasing, but he placed a soft kiss on my cheek to leave no doubt. I shivered with delight. I'd discovered during the past couple of days that Alec was a hands-on kind of guy. He was always finding excuses to touch or kiss me. I liked it more than I probably should have. He made me feel wanted and desirable. Hell, even irresistible. Being with him was a heady experience. Women openly admired him as we strolled down the street, but he didn't seem to notice. Or at least he didn't let on. He appeared to only have eyes for me.</p><p>\"Do you want to see some boobs?\"</p><p>My question obviously took him by surprise because he nearly fell down laughing as he clapped his hands.</p><p>I stopped and crossed my arms across my chest. \"What?\" I knew my question was direct, but I was curious whether he was into places like strip clubs.</p><p>\"Did you really just ask me if I wanted to see some boobs?\" He could barely choke out his words. \"You should work as an attendant outside one of the clubs. That's a great line to get people inside,\" he said, practically coming to tears from laughing so hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Whatever,\" I said, turning my back and walking away.</p><p>\"Hang on,\" he said, placing his hand on my shoulder to stop me. He spun me around, but looking me in the eyes only made him start laughing again. \"Wait, don't leave.\" He shook his head to collect himself. \"Okay, seriously now.\" His eyes fell to my chest before meeting mine. \"Only yours, sweetheart. Only yours.\"</p><p>That was how the day went. Well, not the laughing-at-my-expense part. We flirted and touched, driving each other mad with thoughts and innuendos. Somewhere along the way, we even managed to take in the ambiance of our surroundings. After Bourbon Street, I stopped focusing on the sour smells and general lack of cleanliness and began to appreciate the actual beauty of the city that was steeped in tradition and culture. We sampled local delicacies, liking each one more than the last. My favorite culinary delight was the beignet from Cafe Du Monde. It was like a pastry from heaven. The dough was so light and fresh it melted in my mouth. I became instantly addicted, so Alec ordered extra so we could take them back to the room.</p> <p>Near the end of our exploration, we stumbled upon one of the old parks in the heart of the city where a couple stood, exchanging vows in front of a minster and a couple dozen friends and family. The colors in the sky had just begun to change in the pre-dusk hour when the sun wasn't quite as hot and a mild breeze cut into the humidity. Two peacocks strutted across the grass without fear, their brilliant feathers fanned out behind them. Combined with the backdrop of the historic architecture of the surrounding buildings, the scene was absolutely picturesque and became my favorite moment of the day.</p><p>\"Oh no. You're one of those girls who is a total sucker for weddings,\" Alec whispered, seeing the starry-eyed look in my eyes.</p><p>I shook my head, scrunching up my nose distastefully as he slid an arm around my waist. \"Not at all. I'm a romantic at heart, but I can totally do without the hoopla of an actual wedding ceremony. I've been a bridesmaid twice, and after witnessing the pre-wedding mayhem, I would rather elope.\"</p><p>\"And she surprises me again,\" Alec said, kissing the top of my head.</p><p>\"It's the peacocks. I'm a bit obsessed with them,\" I said, pointing to the majestic birds that had migrated to the bushes. \"I've always thought they were beautiful, but I was researching them for Wicked Lovely, and I was instantly hooked by their symbolism.\"</p> <p>\"Really? So, what do they symbolize?\"</p><p>\"It's fascinating. A lot of religions believe the peacock is a symbol of immortality, while others believe it symbolizes new beginnings. The idea of immortality has always fascinated me, but I actually used the new beginning symbolism in Wicked Lovely.\"</p><p>\"New beginnings? I like that,\" he murmured, trailing his lips along my neck.</p><p>I leaned back into his embrace, completely agreeing with him. The kind of new beginning we were experiencing was definitely something I could learn to love.</p><p>We watched the peacocks for several more minutes before strolling away. Maybe someday I would have a peacock at my own wedding. Maybe with Alec. It could be our one and only witness. My glimpse into the future wasn't something I would share. The virgin thing was a big enough hurdle to get over. Still, I was beginning to fall for him\u2014hard.</p><p>We headed back toward the hotel after a long afternoon of walking the city. The foreplay and teasing followed by the moment we had just shared made me more than ready to be alone with him.</p> <p>We detoured briefly into a tourist shop because I had it in my mind that I wanted to get Olivia the most obnoxious souvenir I could find. I had called her after the first night Alec and I had done the deed. She was, of course, appropriately enthusiastic, but turned crude when she demanded to know the details. I wanted to get her something absolutely hideous to pay her back.</p><p>Alec's phone rang in his pocket and I smiled, checking the time on my phone. He had told me the day before that Lily liked to call him every night at eight o'clock, right before she headed off to bed. The one conversation I had witnessed wasn't long and seemed entirely one-sided as he asked her about her day at summer camp.</p><p>Alec stepped outside for some privacy, so I headed toward the store's selection of tee shirts. Most of them boasted crude messages. Some were downright hilarious and I couldn't help laughing as I searched the rack.</p><p>\"Get her that one,\" Alec said, sneaking up behind me. He had pointed to a shirt with a cartoon picture of a woman's vagina that looked like a giant crawfish that read: \"The taste of New Orleans.\"</p><p>I laughed, thumbing through the stack of shirts until I found Olivia's size. \"That's totally gross, but she's going to die. Did you want to pick something for Lily?\"</p><p>\"She wants a toy airplane from the airport. I'll pick one up before we head home. I am getting this though,\" he said, holding up a box of beignet mix.</p><p>\"You know how to cook?\" I clapped my hands gleefully.</p><p>\"You're looking at a master chef here. I make a mean French toast that would make any mademoiselle weep,\" he said in his best French accent.</p> <p>\"My oh my. Aren't you multitalented?\"</p><p>\"Not nearly as talented as you, sweet stuff. I can barely write a decent grocery shopping list. Forget about an entire novel. It blows my mind that you can sit in front of your computer and create an entire story. That's something spectacular.\"</p><p>His compliment made me blush. \"I don't know. To me, it pales in comparison to becoming a doctor. I think saving lives trumps couples hooking up.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I wouldn't go that far, especially when they're hooking up in places like balconies or on the deck of a pirate ship.\" He smiled crookedly.</p><p>\"You read my book?\" I had a hard time believing it since I knew from past conversations that he preferred a more \"manly\" type of fiction. Historical romance didn't seem to fit into his normal reading forte.</p><p>\"Books, sweetheart. I read all of them. I have to say, for a virgin, you definitely sounded like you knew your way around the bedroom.\" He winked at me, making my cheeks flush.</p><p>\"All of them? Wow.\" I wasn't sure how to react. My family had all read my books. Even Dad, much to my chagrin, but I always believed it was because they felt obligated. Like when someone tells you a bad haircut looked good. Knowing that Alec had read my books made my heart swell. The emotions I was feeling for him were as foreign to me as the Creole dishes we had eaten for lunch. Not to mention, it was too soon. I could be setting myself up for the biggest disappointment of my life. As an avid reader, I hated insta-love stories. It never felt real to me. I wanted love built on a relationship that had grown and matured along the way. Not because he made my toes curl in bed or filled me with desire with only a wink. Love was an invested emotion. Not something you handed out willy-nilly.</p><p>\"Damn right, all of them. I tried the first book after we met at the beach, but how could I not continue after that cliffhanger with Jacques and Liz at the end of the second book?\" Alec's eyes twinkled with humor. I couldn't tell if he was screwing with me. Over the years, I'd been teased mercilessly by the testosterone clan in my family, so I was a pro at sniffing out bullshit. Alec was harder to read.</p><p>\"People hated me for that cliffhanger, you know. I vowed I'd never end a book like that again,\" I admitted, purchasing my shirt before he could argue. During the last couple of days, he had tried to revisit the subject of me paying for things, claiming that if we were dating, he would be picking up the tab from now on. Not that the idea of him thinking of us as an item wasn't wonderful, but I had to put my foot down on him paying. It took some convincing, but I still had the solid reasoning that my purchases were a business expense. Uncle Sam wanted his money and according to the accountant who did my taxes, I needed all the deductions I could get.</p><p>Alec scoffed as he held the door open for me to exit the souvenir shop. \"How could someone hate you for the way you ended your book? I'd like to see anyone say something when I'm around. That cliffhanger was necessary,\" he said indignantly.</p><p>I smiled at his protective vibe. \"You're pretty cute when you're in defensive mode, but don't sweat it. You'd be surprised how passionate readers get about books.\"</p><p>He growled, pulling me in tightly. \"Cute? Don't you mean frightening? At least call me an intimidating badass.\"</p><p>\"Oh, that goes without saying. You are one. Big. Strapping. Scary. Man.\" I kissed his neck between every word and then sucked hard to give him a hickey at the end.</p><p>\"Okay, okay,\" he said, pulling away. \"How did you get so good at this so fast? That's what I want to know.\"</p><p>He hugged me again, tightly against his chest. I laughed breathlessly, loving the closeness of our embrace. We'd made love several times in the past forty-eight hours, but being wrapped in his arms still felt special. I couldn't seem to get enough. Everything about him was like an intoxicating drug, and I was becoming addicted.</p><p>In the beginning, I had dreaded the idea of being away from home for three weeks in a row, but Alec had changed everything. Spending time together didn't feel like work. It was more like an extended vacation. I couldn't help wondering if things would remain the same after we returned home and got back to our everyday lives. Would we still see each other, or would the fairy tale end for me? Neither of us had actually expressed our feelings in any way other than sex. It could be possible that this was just a fun time for him and the feelings I had developed were completely one-sided. Besides, I would be diving into my next book, and he would return to his own life. A life that I now knew included a daughter. I could have continued driving myself nuts with what ifs, but I decided to make the most of the next week and a half and cross the next bridge when it came. I would enjoy my drug while it was still readily available.</p><p>We arrived back at the hotel and Alec dragged me into a quiet corner of the lobby. With my back pressed against the wall, he bracketed me on either side with his arms that were like bands of steel. \"See, intimidating,\" he cajoled.</p><p>\"Sexy as hell,\" I countered, finding his hips and bringing him even closer to me. \"Sorry, but you don't scare me in that aspect. You're too swoony.\" I stood on my toes and nipped the underside of his chin.</p><p>He pressed his lower body against me so I could feel how I was affecting him. \"So I do scare you in some way?\" He leaned in close, breathing huskily into my ear. \"I was just playing, I hope you realize. I don't want you to ever be scared of me.\"</p><p>I trailed my lips along his jugular, trying to distract him. \"Me too,\" I said. I wasn't completely lying. How could I tell him my fear had nothing to do with physical harm and everything to do with feelings? It was my heart I was worried about. \"Let's go to the room,\" I breathed into his ear.</p><p>As usual, Alec's instincts were right on. His eyes peered into mine as if he suspected there was more to my answer than what I had let on. I ducked my head, finding the soft hollow above his collarbone that had become my favorite spot. My tongue traced the sensitive skin before I gently nipped him with my teeth. \"Fine. You win again,\" he said, dragging me to the bank of elevators.</p><p>My body hummed with anticipation as we watched the numbers above each of the elevator doors slowly descend toward the lobby. Groaning when the numbers paused at various floors along the way, I glanced around, happy to see we were still the only people waiting to ride up. I licked my lips, imagining the fun we would have once the doors closed.</p><p>The center elevator dinged just as it arrived at the lobby. Alec and I nearly burst through the doors when they opened before we had to pause to allow a couple of giggling kids to exit. Alec guided me inside, placing his warm hand on the small of my back. I was already twisting around to face him when he pinned me against the mirrored wall of the elevator.</p><p>He dipped his head toward mine just as a hand snaked in and stopped the doors before they could slide closed. We both took an immediate step away from each other as two elderly women stepped inside to join us.</p><p>I wanted to pull out my phone to take a picture of the frustrated look on Alec's face that said more than any words I could write. The two women covertly stole glances our direction. I was used to Alec catching the attention of women wherever we went, but never from someone these ladies' ages. I had to hand it to them. They may have been a couple of dirty old cougars, but they still knew what they liked, even though he could have been their grandson.</p><p>Alec seemed oblivious as usual as he steadfastly watched the numbers moving from one floor to the next. I'd been in some slow elevators before, but this one took the cake. It was even less tolerable riding awkwardly with a couple of strangers.</p><p>The two women became more animated as their whispering turned to excited chatter. \"Excuse me,\" one of them asked as they turned toward me. I had already prepared myself for the inevitable question. They wanted me to take their picture with Alec. The way they were practically stumbling over their tongues to ask was a dead giveaway.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I answered, already holding my hand out to accept their camera or phone.</p><p>\"You're N.S. Blake, right?\" She blushed slightly, holding open the Wicked Fantasies event program to the page with my bio and author photo.</p><p>Luckily, the elevator had mirrored walls. Otherwise I wouldn't have noticed my jaw hanging to the floor in the reflection. I was used to people coming to my table at book signings and knowing who I was, but that was because of my eight-foot-tall vertical banner with my name on it. This was the first time I'd been recognized away from that environment. I couldn't even get the words out to answer. I merely nodded.</p><p>\"I told you,\" she squealed, grinning triumphantly at her friend. \"Can we get a picture with you?\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" Alec happily boomed as the elevator stopped on the ninth floor. Once the doors opened, he positioned himself to block them from closing again. Just moments ago he'd been antsy that the elevator was taking too long and now he was more than happy to be an amateur photographer.</p><p>\"Thank you so much,\" the elderly lady crowed, pulling an iPad out of her bag. \"Take it with this so I can use it for my screensaver.\" She practically bounced with excitement as I stood sandwiched between her and her friend with my arms wrapped around their waists.</p><p>Alec smiled at her indulgently as he waited for us to be ready. \"Say Grant,\" he coaxed, holding up the iPad to snap the picture.</p><p>\"Oh my god, I love Grant,\" the friend piped in. \"I nearly went through an entire box of tissues when his daddy died. You made me feel his pain so completely.\"</p><p>I felt dumb, mumbling my thanks for their kind comments, but I was flustered and more than a little in awe at the surreal moment. The fact that she'd immersed herself so wholly in the words I had written that she actually cried was the best compliment I'd ever been given. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alec continued to hold the elevator while we took several more pictures and I signed their tote bags. Acting like I'd made their entire day, the two women thanked Alec profusely, calling him a \"nice young man\" for taking our pictures. They waved while they blew kisses of thanks at me as the elevator doors closed.</p><p>A giddy feeling of warmth filled my heart as we continued the ascension to our floor. Moments ago, I wouldn't have thought anything could distract Alec and me from our back-and-forth game of foreplay, but those two women had gotten to me. The way they showered me with praise and admiration had nearly brought me to happy tears. They not only understood my stories, but had invested themselves in the characters as well. Submersion into a story was an incredible experience for someone who truly loved reading. It's that point when you can actually see the landscape, taste the food, or sympathize with a character's pain. The result of which is book-topia. For those two ladies, I had written a novel that had helped them reach that magical place. I had never felt more like a writer than I had then.</p><p>I was floating in the clouds when the elevator doors opened on our floor. My mind continued to process the significance of the moment when my feet were suddenly lifted off the ground and I was being twirled around. \"That was awesome! You were a total rock star to those two women,\" Alec said, beaming at me.</p> <p>I returned his smile, completely taken in that he seemed as excited as I was. He was almost too perfect. How could one guy be freaking drop-dead handsome, easy to talk to and a damn magician in bed? And he liked to read. It was like he was created from my own perfect male bucket list. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop that would expose some dark skeleton, but I already knew his secret. Was it possible this relationship was getting the green light from all sides?</p><p>\"Well, rock star is a bit much,\" I corrected modestly.</p><p>He lowered me to the ground, but kept his arms locked around me. \"Rock star,\" he repeated, looking me dead in the eyes before capturing my lips with his. All else was forgotten as we moved against each other. The moment in the elevator had only paused the hunger we shared. Alec backed us toward our room right off the elevator.</p><p>Somehow he was able to retrieve the key card from his pocket and open the door to the room without our lips ever leaving one another, displaying yet another talent.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p> <p>The next morning I woke before Alec. I kept still, watching him as he lay on his side facing me. Even while he slept he was sexy as hell with his rumpled hair and five o'clock shadow. The scruff on his face gave him an edgy look that would have intimidated me if I didn't already know the sweetness that lay beneath the light covering of hair. I wanted to reach out and caress his face, but I forced myself to climb from bed.</p><p>I tiptoed to the bathroom, taking care not to make any noise. Waking up next to a man was still very new to me, and I felt I needed to freshen up before he woke up. For the last three mornings, I had forced myself to get up first, so I could brush my teeth and fix my hair so I resembled something other than a scarecrow. I may have even added a little makeup too. Once I was presentable again, I'd climb back in bed all Catfish-like. I felt a bit like a fraud, but that didn't stop me from doing it.</p><p>I was gently lowering myself back into bed when Alec's arms shot out like a snake and yanked me toward him. \"You know, you're giving me a complex. Waking up to a beauty with minty fresh breath\u2014while I look and probably smell like something a dog wouldn't chew on\u2014is a hard act to follow.\" He pulled me in close so my back was nestled against his chest. \"See what you're missing when you rush out of bed?\"</p><p>\"You have a point,\" I yawned. I snuggled closer, enjoying the way it felt to be spooned by him.</p><p>\"So, how are you doing?\" His question was vague, but I knew what he was getting at. The real reason I had woken up early. I would be kidding myself if I thought I wouldn't stress about it all day\u2014the release of Wicked Lovely. I had been manically anticipating this day while dreading it at the same time. I'd gone through four other release days and it never seemed to get any easier. If anything, it got harder each time. When I released my first book, I didn't know what to expect, but now that I was a little more seasoned, the pressure had increased tenfold. I'd confessed my fears and apprehensions to Alec the night before over a bottle of wine we had downed during dinner. The liquor had loosened my tongue, and I'm sure I had come across as a complete whiner.</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" I lied. Truthfully, I was ready to pull my hair out. Olivia and I had gone to great lengths to arrange release day posts, including the e-book purchase links, with several bloggers who were gracious enough to help with the launch. They had been scheduled to post simultaneously at eight a.m. Eastern time. Planning ahead was one of the ways I had learned to cope with the stress of release day. Now it was a waiting game to see how the book would be received. Initial reviews had been coming from the advanced copies Olivia had sent out, and all of them had exceeded my expectations. The next few days would determine how my readers took to the story and reveal if they were ready to accept a new series from me. Normally, I spent release day holed up in my apartment in a junk food coma, obsessively checking sales numbers and social media sites to gauge public reaction. This time I vowed to not obsess as much. Actually, it was more Olivia's idea than mine. She felt it was the only thing that would maintain my sanity since I was away from home for this release. Her reasoning was sound. There was no way I could concentrate during the book signing if I was checking my phone every five seconds. I had only agreed when she promised to send me periodic texts regarding the book's progress. We devised a code that wouldn't make sense to anyone but the two of us. It was based on my obsession with the group A Great Big World, and the code words were the titles of some of their songs. If the book was doing well, Olivia would text \"Rockstar.\" If it was doing fair, she would text \"You'll Be Okay,\" and if it was totally tanking, she'd send \"Cheer Up.\" Her message wouldn't come in until later this evening after the book had been live for the majority of the day. By then we would know. Now, staring at my phone in my hand, I was ready to throw the plan out the window and follow the book's progress myself.</p> <p>\"I can see the only way to help is to spend the day distracting you.\"</p><p>\"True,\" I said, pressing my butt against him.</p><p>He chuckled, sliding his hand down my hip. \"That would work for me, but isn't the signing at ten today?\" He glanced at the clock on the end table.</p><p>I groaned, pulling a pillow over my face. I must have been insane when I agreed to do a signing on release day. Obviously, I must enjoy torture.</p><p>Alec left the pillow in place, but tugged the blankets down, exposing my naked body. The cool air kissed my skin, causing goosebumps to form. I felt exposed and self-conscious. \"I think we have a little time,\" he said as he kissed his way between my legs. \"Consider this the beginning of Operation Distraction.\"</p><p>To say his plan was successful would be putting it mildly. By the time we left the room an hour and a half later, I was feeling downright content. Alec was more intoxicating than the bottle of wine we had shared the night before.</p><p>Operation Distraction didn't end with the mind-numbing sex. Alec also maintained a running commentary, peppering me with personal questions that had nothing to do with writing. He kept things silly, like the first cartoon I remembered seeing, and which character was my favorite growing up. We bantered back and forth over the best movies of all time, which for me wasn't even close. Pride and Prejudice any day of the week. While waiting in line at Starbucks, he moved the questions to favorite and least favorite foods. We both preferred pizza, although he was a New York-style guy while I liked deep dish.</p><p>By the time the event started, Alec was as busy as always, taking picture after picture with the long line of screaming females. The difference this time, however, was that I was receiving just as much attention. Readers were making a point to tell me how they had already downloaded Wicked Lovely and were excited to start reading it. I was being congratulated like I had won some sort of prize. Beyond the praise and sudden overwhelming recognition, the demand for signed Wicked Lovely paperbacks was far more than I had anticipated. Olivia had shipped fifty copies to the hotel, which was more than I had ever sold of any of my books at an event. I sold out after only an hour into the signing. I didn't know what to make of things, but I also had no time to give it a second thought. Even if Olivia had texted me, I couldn't have checked my phone. The activity at my table was nonstop for three hours.</p> <p>I sat in my chair once the signing had finished, feeling completely spent. My hand actually cramped from signing my name so many times. That also had never happened before.</p><p>\"That was insane. I don't think I looked over one time when you weren't talking to someone or signing something,\" Alec said, breaking down my banner.</p><p>\"I know, right? I've never gotten that kind of response at an event. I want so badly to check the status of Wicked Lovely, but I promised Olivia. I just wish she would send me something.\"</p><p>\"Hey, regardless of how it's doing, you just had your best event yet. You deserve a celebratory dinner.\"</p><p>He had a point. I didn't buy it completely, but it was still valid. If the signing today was any indication, Wicked Lovely might actually be making a splash in e-book sales. Time would tell. We made quick work of packing up my things before heading to the room to freshen up before dinner.</p><p>The restaurant we chose was on the small side and offered an upscale cuisine. Alec insisted on paying, which made me feel terrible considering the prices on the menu. I knew he was on a tight budget.</p><p>\"So, here's to Wicked Lovely. May the odds be in its favor,\" he said, raising his glass of wine.</p><p>I glared at him without raising my glass. \"You did not just say that. Good book, good movie, but so the wrong genre and category.\"</p><p>He laughed. \"I'm just teasing. Seriously though. Congrats on your book. I'm sure it's killing it.\"</p><p>\"You're a big part of it, you know,\" I said, clinking my glass with his. \"Try to accept this without your head getting too big to fit out the door, but you made the cover. This book is getting attention because of that pretty face.\" Actually, Alec had done more than his share during our trip. Not only had he excelled at drawing readers to my table with his abs, but he'd also taken on extra duties like lugging all my crap around, setting things up for me, and acting as my personal bodyguard and sex slave. All the lines had been blurred now that we were in whatever this relationship thing was we had going on.</p><p>\"You don't have to pay for my meal,\" I told him after the waiter took our orders.</p><p>He rolled his eyes, reaching across the table to lace his fingers through mine. \"You know, it's okay for someone to do something nice for you, especially the guy you're seeing. Today is a special day, and as such, I want to buy my girl dinner.\"</p><p>\"I like when you say that,\" I admitted, running my thumb over the back of his knuckles. I found myself craving his touch and missing it when it wasn't happening. I'm sure it wasn't healthy, but I didn't care.</p><p>\"Which part?\"</p><p>\"The being your girl part. It's like we're going steady.\"</p><p>\"Is this where I give you my class ring?\" he teased as the waiter returned with artichoke dip and freshly made pita chips.</p><p>\"Most definitely. And I'll need a picture for my locker.\"</p><p>\"Nude?\" I almost choked on my sip of wine, glancing around to make sure no one could hear us.</p><p>\"Sure. Here, let me take it now,\" I said, holding up my phone like I was expecting him to strip in the middle of the swanky restaurant.</p><p>He tugged at his shirt, revealing a section of his chiseled abs. \"Works for me.\"</p><p>I giggled but didn't stop him, deciding to call his bluff.</p><p>His shirt made it up to his pecs before he conceded. \"I think you would have let me keep going.\"</p><p>\"You better believe it. Dinner and a show, baby,\" I teased, grinning wickedly.</p><p>\"I knew it. I've created a monster.\" He pretended to frown, but the effect was ruined when he slid his leg along mine under the table. \"You're just using me for my body,\" he added.</p><p>\"Well, that's a given. Have you seen your abs?\"</p><p>He clutched his heart as the waiter came out with our salads. \"I'm wounded. I'm nothing but your sex toy.\"</p><p>I blushed as the waiter grinned broadly.</p><p>\"I got you something,\" he said once the waiter left.</p><p>My eyes widened. \"You did?\" I was used to receiving little gifts from Mom growing up. She was one of those people who would spot special little things wherever she happened to be that she knew a particular person would love.</p><p>This was my first gift from a guy I wasn't related to.</p><p>\"Close your eyes,\" he directed.</p><p>I eyed him skeptically for a moment. If Zach, Tony and Riley had taught me anything, it was that you never closed your eyes when they wanted to give you something. That's how I ended up with a handful of worms one time and a small snake in my lap another time. Dad had threatened to ground them for life after the second prank since he wasn't overly fond of snakes.</p><p>\"Close them,\" he repeated.</p><p>\"Fine, but you better not be handing me some yucky bug or anything.\"</p><p>He chuckled but waited for me to close my eyes.</p><p>Reluctantly, I let my eyelids slide closed. He took my hand in his and I instinctively snatched it back. \"Sorry, habit,\" I said.</p><p>He took my hand again and caressed my palm with his finger before I felt the touch of cool metal slide over my fingers and onto my wrist. \"You can open them now.\"</p><p>Opening my eyes, I saw a silver bangle on my wrist with a metal ornament pressed on the center. It only took me a moment to realize the ornament was an etching of a peacock feather. Overwhelmed, I ran a finger over it, trying to hold back tears.</p><p>\"To new beginnings,\" Alec said, reaching for my hand.</p><p>I opened my mouth to thank him, but the dinging of my phone interrupted me. I looked at my phone that I had deliberately placed face down on the table. I knew the text was from Olivia. As soon as I flipped it over, I would know if all our hard work had paid off. Her text would confirm whether the story, the gorgeous cover, endless teasers and help from my blogger and author friends had been enough.</p><p>\"Do you want me to look?\" Alec asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \"No, I got it.\" I dragged my lip between my teeth, gnawing slightly like I had been doing all my life when I was nervous. Reaching for my phone, I closed my eyes, holding it face down in my palm as I chanted in my head. Please be good news. Please be good news. I flipped the phone and opened my eyes, spotting the one-word text I had been stressing over. My head lowered and I slumped backward into my seat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alec grabbed my hand to comfort me. \"Shit, babe. Is it bad news?\"</p><p>I looked up, unable to hide the smile that lit up my face. I turned the phone to show him Olivia's text that read: ROCKSTAR!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Alec was up and out of his seat, pulling me into his arms before I could catch my breath. \"Holy shit, babe, you did it. New beginnings.\" His enthusiasm caught the attention of just about every table in the small restaurant. Any other time I would have been mortified over such a display, but at that moment I felt nothing but pure joy.</p> <p>\"I think I need a tub like this,\" I said, using my foot to turn off the water of the oversized tub Alec and I were sharing. A mix-up in reservations had resulted in us getting a deluxe top-floor corner room with a king-sized bed, a sixty-inch television and a tub that was easily three times the size of the one in my apartment. We spent our first night in Atlanta christening the bed with the blinds open, which provided a spectacular view of the city's lights.</p><p>I sat with my legs stretched out in front of me and my back tucked against Alec's chest. He plucked my bottle of bath gel off the side of the tub and poured a liberal amount onto his palm. Rubbing his hands together, he reached around my shoulders and began slowly soaping my breasts. \"It definitely has its perks,\" he agreed, using his thumb to circle my nipples that were already hard.</p><p>I tilted my head to the side as he moved my hair to lick a droplet of water off my shoulder. \"A regular bath alone will never measure up again,\" I purred.</p><p>\"Is that a way of telling me taking baths together will be part of my regular duties?\"</p><p>I tilted my head back to look at him. \"You'll obviously have to apply for the position.\"</p> <p>\"I'm sure I have the proper skills,\" he murmured, smoothing his hand in slow circles across my lower stomach. \"Consider this my audition.\"</p><p>\"Mmmmm, I don't know. I can be pretty demanding.\" I could feel him pressed against my lower back, making it clear he was enjoying his work. His hand dipped below the mound of suds around us and I moaned with pleasure when his finger slid inside me. Tilting my head so I could find his lips, I gripped the side of the tub, rocking my hips against his hand that was taking me to the edge.</p><p>\"I want you, now,\" Alec whispered against my lips. He stood suddenly, pulling me to my feet. We stepped over the side of the tub onto a plush bath mat where he scooped me off my feet and carried me to the large bed. Neither of us cared about the water and soap dripping from our slick bodies.</p><p>I waited on the bed as he prepared himself before climbing on top of me. He slid slowly inside, filling me completely. We stared intensely into each other's eyes as he moved. The emotions of the last few days welled up inside me, bringing me on the verge of weeping. I'd been trying to hold back my feelings for him, but they were screaming to be expressed. We were so close and I couldn't help crying out. \"I love you.\" The words spilled from my lips as we both found our release.</p><p>I closed my eyes, waiting with bated breath as his body stalled. I wasn't expecting him to return the sentiment. We were in the early stages of a relationship. Hell, in my own books I had always put my characters through trials and tribulations before admitting their love for one another. I had just blurted it out unexpectedly in the throes of passion. It was too soon. We hadn't suffered enough to feel love yet. I was rushing our story. If I could have retracted the words, I would have, but they were hanging in the air like giant neon signs. Obviously, I needed to stick to writing other people's love stories since I was failing at my own.</p><p>Alec still hadn't responded and my self-loathing turned to panic. My mind searched for a way to save the situation. I could make a joke of it. Tell him I was referring to something else. If I had time, I could have asked Olivia how to take my foot out of my mouth. The problem was I had said, \"I love YOU.\" Not, \"I love the bed,\" or \"I love that sexy mole on your shoulder.\" There was no disguising what he had heard.</p> <p>I watched with hooded eyes as he stood up and walked away, which wasn't anything new. He always went to the bathroom after we made love to dispose of things. It would be what he looked like when he came out that would determine his state of mind.</p><p>I knew the moment he opened the door, fastening the jeans he had worn before we climbed in the tub together. Suddenly feeling vulnerable and exposed, I dragged the sheet up to cover my naked body as I scooted against the headboard.</p><p>Alec stood in the doorway with indecision written all over his face. In a sense, I felt bad for springing my feelings on him, but I hadn't planned for it to happen that way. Now the only emotion I felt in my thudding chest was anxiety. I waited without saying anything.</p><p>\"Nicole...\" His voice trailed off and he raked a hand through his hair, searching for the words.</p><p>Unable to wait any longer, I jumped in to add an explanation. \"Look, I'm not asking you to say it. It's fast. I realize that, but I also can't help the way I feel.\" Listening to my own words aloud, it sounded like I was trying to defend myself, which I hated. There was a fine line between offering an explanation and defending your actions. The second made me feel like I had done something wrong. It wasn't that big a deal. I told him I loved him. So what? He could take it or leave it.</p><p>He moved to the edge of the bed and sat down. As he looked into my eyes, I realized it was a big deal to him. I could have written the next words that would leave his lips. They were spelled out in his eyes and in his actions. The way he held himself, the way he no longer reached for me said everything. \"Nicole, those words change everything. I'm not in a place in my life where I can reciprocate something of that magnitude.\" He sounded so wounded, I nearly wept.</p><p>\"You don't need to reciprocate anything. Just because I feel a certain way doesn't mean you have to.\" My words sounded desperate, which was worse than sounding like I was defending myself.</p><p>He made a move to touch my hand, but I pulled back before he could reach me. \"Nicole, that wouldn't be fair to you. You deserve better. If I wasn't a selfish bastard, I would have stuck to my rules and never started this in the first place. It's not your fault. This sits entirely on my shoulders.\"</p> <p>\"Great, so we fuck and now I get pitied. I suppose you regret all of it, right?\"</p><p>He shook his head. \"That's not what I'm saying. I just think you misinterpreted what was happening between us. I shouldn't have misled you.\"</p><p>I looked at him incredulously. Alec had revealed the chink in his armor that so many other guys possessed. \"Alec, it sounds like you misled yourself. It's funny that I was the virgin you felt you had to tiptoe around and yet, you don't seem to know shit about women.\" He tried to speak again, but I interrupted him. \"Like all guys, you think you can have both sides of the coin. Fuck me as much as you want, and expect me to feel nothing. I mean, come on. I tell you I love you and we're over? How fucked up is that?\" Explaining myself no longer became important. He had pissed me off.</p><p>He sighed, scrubbing the light fuzz on his chin. \"It's for the best. If we kept this up, your feelings would keep getting stronger. It would make it even harder when whatever this is comes to an end.\"</p><p>I snorted. \"The 'THIS' that you keep referring to is a relationship, and I'm pretty sure I can control my feelings.\" I wanted to sound resolute, but my argument held no water. If I could have kept my feelings in check, we wouldn't have been having this conversation. We'd be naked, snuggled up in bed together rather than ending things. Tears of anger threatened to spring to my eyes, but I willed them back. I would not cry.</p><p>He opened his mouth to reply, but the ringing of his phone distracted him. Taking a peek at the screen, he jumped from the bed to answer. \"Candace?\" He sounded concerned. Glancing at the clock, I saw it was almost ten p.m. Way too late for a casual chat about Lily. \"When?\" I could faintly hear Candace through the phone. It sounded like she had mentioned something about a hospital. Alec's knuckles turned white as he gripped his phone.</p><p>Climbing from the bed, I opened the dresser drawer and pulled out some clothes to throw on.</p><p>\"I'll catch the first flight home.\" He paused as Candace spoke over him. \"It doesn't matter. If Lily is asking for me, I'll walk over fucking glass to get to her. Hell, I can drive it in six hours. Just tell my girl I'll be there soon.\"</p><p>He hung up the phone and jerked his suitcase from the closet in one fluid movement. \"What happened?\" After our fight, I was apprehensive to ask, but I truly cared.</p><p>\"Candace took Lily to the park after work tonight and she fell from the top of the jungle gym. She broke her arm and has a concussion,\" he said, throwing clothes into his suitcase with little regard for neatness. \"The hospital is keeping her overnight for observation.\" He wouldn't look at me when he spoke, but continued to toss his belongings into the suitcase. \"She's asking for me.\"</p><p>I gasped, placing my hand over my mouth. \"Oh no. I'm so sorry. I'll come with you,\" I said, grabbing my own bag from the closet.</p><p>He looked up from zipping his suitcase. \"You can't. You have the signing tomorrow.\"</p><p>I paused. The event had totally slipped my mind. \"So, this is an emergency.\" I barely had to give the decision any thought. Family came first.</p><p>He turned to face me. \"Nicole, you can't do that to your readers. They're excited to see you. Especially considering Wicked Lovely is doing so well. It's important for you to stay here. You need to keep your face out there. This week more than ever.\"</p><p>I bristled slightly at his words. I knew I needed to be here. This signing could be the most important one of my life. Wicked Lovely was still sailing up the charts, and I was absolutely floored by the amount of support that had been pouring in. All of that aside, I wanted to be there for him. I could tell he was worried, and I wanted to be his rock for once.</p><p>I grabbed my clothes from the dresser and shoved them into my suitcase.</p><p>\"Nicole, stop. I don't want you to go.\" He took one last quick look around before lifting his suitcase from the bed and walking swiftly to the door. \"My life was already derailed once. I can't allow myself to get caught in a relationship that will distract me from my goals.\" He turned and left, leaving the door to close softly behind him.</p><p>His final words were like a sucker punch to the stomach. When I was eight years old, I had climbed from the back of my uncle's pickup truck and my foot got caught on the tailgate. I ended up kissing the pavement. For several minutes afterward, I remained on the cement, unable to breathe and convinced I was going to die. The pain from the fall had been intense, but the fear of not being able to take a breath eclipsed that. Alec's statement had done the same thing.</p><p>I slumped to the floor, gasping for air. Dragging my knees up to my chest, I bracketed my head between my legs, wishing the pain would stop. There was nothing I could say or do. Alec had already hurt me once when he rejected me the first time. The fact that he had done it again was on me. I had set myself up for heartbreak.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>I snatched up one of the extra pillows next to me and pressed it against my face. The sun was just beginning to rise and my eyes rejected the light. I'd tossed and turned the entire night, unable to get comfortable. The bed was too big. The room was too quiet. It seemed like everything was bound and determined to keep me up.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes closed beneath the pillow, wishing for a few hours of respite. The signing wasn't until later that afternoon. If I could have just turned my brain off and stopped thinking about Alec, I could have at least slept the time away.</p><p>An hour later, I finally gave up in frustration. I threw the pillow across the room, knocking over a table lamp and a half-empty can of Diet Coke I'd left there the night before.</p><p>Sighing, I grabbed tissues from a nearby box and tried mopping up the mess. The tissues were cheap and did nothing but fall apart as I blotted the carpet. Tossing a handful of shredded tissue pieces into the trash can, I stood up and headed for the bathroom. I was sick of this room. It was nothing but a constant reminder of our fight the night before. I wanted out.</p><p>I turned on the harsh and probing bathroom light, refusing to look at the oversized tub in the corner.</p><p>I climbed into the separate shower stall and made quick work of brushing my teeth and washing my face before leaving the bathroom in a hurry. There was a vanity mirror over the dresser near the bed where I did my hair and makeup. I opted out of blow-drying my hair, sweeping it up into a high ponytail instead. It may have been too casual for the signing, but I was past caring. I just wanted to escape the oppressiveness of the room.</p><p>Grabbing my gear for the signing, I decided to leave my banner behind. Putting it up was never easy, and I had gotten used to Alec taking care of it for me. I stowed my laptop in my shoulder bag, along with my phone and wallet. The signing wasn't for several hours, but the hotel had a Starbucks in the lobby, and I planned on getting a little work done.</p><p>With the exception of the day after the release of Wicked Lovely, I'd been slacking on my social media time during the past few weeks and figured I would take the opportunity to catch up. If I still found myself with extra time, I'd start to draft out the second book in the series.</p><p>Glad to have a plan that would keep me busy, I left my room and headed for the elevators. I felt a brief stirring of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I heard the sound of a door opening behind me. My pulse quickened as my heart nearly jumped out of my chest. I could hear the sound of shoes swishing across the carpeted floor, but I couldn't bring myself to turn around. It was the first time I had found myself alone in a hotel hallway since the attack. An overwhelming sensation of fear clawed its way up my throat like a hungry beast. I was ready to scream.</p><p>\"Hey, Nicole. Is that you? I didn't know you were on this floor,\" a familiar voice called after me, dousing my fear.</p><p>Turning around, I spotted Karen, an author I'd been friends with since the beginning. She was closer to my mom's age, but we'd formed a close bond after discovering our shared love for books and cats. \"Karen,\" I said, exhaling. \"I didn't know you were doing this signing.\"</p><p>She gave me a quick hug. \"I signed on at the last minute when they had a cancellation. Where's the steamy cover model I've heard so much about? I've been stalking all the pictures these past few weeks. You two are too adorable for words. If my Stan and I weren't getting ready to celebrate our twentieth, I'd be awfully tempted to get my own hunk.\"</p><p>I blanched at her words. Up until now, I hadn't considered the fact that Alec and I weren't very discreet about our affair. Affair. It seemed like an odd choice to describe what we had shared, but I guess it was accurate. I had set out to lose my virginity, and Alec had given me more than he probably planned. That was all I should have expected and asked for. It certainly wouldn't be healthy to regret what happened. He'd made my first time special and hot as hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Karen was watching me intently when I realized I'd gone into one of my infamous silent modes. \"Sorry. He had to go back home for a family emergency,\" I answered, mashing the button for the elevator.</p><p>\"Well, nuts.\" She looked forlorn before flashing me a smile. \"I guess it's a good thing. I may have been tempted to steal him from you. Lucky girl. Are you headed down for the signing already?\" She had noticed the cart I wheeled onto the elevator.</p><p>\"I decided to head down early so I can get a little work done. My room was too much of a distraction,\" I answered honestly. \"Where are you headed?\"</p> <p>She grinned sheepishly. \"I'm going to check out the Georgia Aquarium for a couple of hours. You want to come?\"</p><p>I debated her question for a moment. If I went with her, it would help kill the morning before the signing, but it could also backfire if she continued to talk about Alec. \"I better not. I've been a social media leper lately and I need to do some serious catching up. My notifications and messages on Facebook are pretty scary.\"</p><p>\"Honey, I can completely relate. By the way, huge congratulations on Wicked Lovely! I told you that book would go big. It's your best work yet.\"</p><p>I blushed as the elevator doors opened, revealing a lobby full of people. \"Thank you so much. And thank you for the blurb also.\" It helped to have a well known author provide a quote for the cover of the book.</p><p>\"The honor was all mine. Are you sure you don't want to go check out some fish with me?\"</p> <p>I shook my head. \"I better not. It's time I did a little work. Have fun though.\" I gave a little wave before heading toward the Starbucks.</p><p>\"You too. Tell your hottie we miss him,\" she said, blowing a kiss at me.</p><p>My smile remained fixed until she walked out of the lobby. The moment she was out of sight, it dropped. In our short conversation I'd come to the conclusion that today was going to suck. Every single person who visited my table would expect to see Alec. I was going to have to field endless questions while smiling the entire time and pretending that my heart wasn't in shreds. Joy.</p><p>My foreshadowing proved to be dead on. By the time the signing ended later that evening, I was ready to stab myself in the eye with my Sharpie, which was too bad considering it had been a complete success. The event was bittersweet. The success of Wicked Lovely had brought me more attention than I had seen during the previous events. Even without Alec, readers still flocked to my table. Not that they weren't asking about him, which only made me miss him more. The anger I'd held on to the night before was long gone, and all I felt now was sadness for what I no longer had. Time and time again throughout the day, I would hear or see something that I knew we would have laughed over. It felt like I'd not only lost the man I loved, but a close friend.</p><p>I was tempted to text him. To ask about Lily, and to make sure he got home okay. I was searching for an excuse to maintain a connection to him.</p><p>Eventually, I stowed my phone at the bottom of my bag so I wouldn't cave. Alec had made his intentions clear, and I needed to retain the small shred of dignity I still had. I would not contact him again.</p> <p>The evening was capped off by a special VIP reception for readers who had attended the signing. I had been able to cope during the day, but my sleepless night had finally caught up with me. I had become about as much fun as a zombie. I stuck around long enough to mingle with a few of the bloggers I knew before ducking out. I dragged myself up to my room and collapsed on my bed without bothering to undress.</p><p>A dreamless sleep welcomed me, which was all I could ask for.</p><p>\"Sheesh, Nicole. You look like hell,\" Olivia greeted me when I opened the door for her the day after I returned home.</p><p>\"Hello to you too,\" I sniffled, blowing my nose with a tissue.</p><p>\"No, I'm serious. You look bad.\"</p><p>I rolled my watery eyes, shuffling to the nest of blankets I'd set up on my couch. \"Does that mean you don't want to make out?\"</p><p>She pretended to gag. \"I'd rather drink bleach. When you said you were sick, I had no idea it was this bad.\"</p><p>\"Duh. Why would I exaggerate that?\" I blew my sore nose again, wishing I could cut it off. In the last twenty-four hours, it had been like a faucet. I was ready to scream. It only seemed fitting that I would pick up the worst summer cold I'd ever had. Nothing like adding insult to injury.</p> <p>\"I thought maybe you were wallowing.\"</p><p>I had spewed all the sordid details about Alec and me over a bottle of cheap wine the last night of my book tour. As my friend, Olivia listened with a sympathetic ear, but I also knew she probably thought I was in idiot for even using the L-word. Like Alec, she had a phobia of commitments, and had dumped guys in the past for even hinting about getting that serious.</p><p>\"He hasn't mentioned anything about it, you know,\" she added when I chose not to comment.</p><p>\"I didn't ask.\"</p><p>\"I know. I'm just saying.\"</p><p>\"Well, stop.\" I loved Olivia, but I wasn't in the mood to start a conversation that had the potential to turn nasty.</p><p>She sank down on the chair next to the couch, not wanting to get close to me. I was tempted to plant a big old smooch on her lips so I wouldn't be the only one miserable, but I could barely stop shivering as I pulled my blanket up to my chin. My fever had obviously returned from the night before.</p><p>\"Well, this sucks. I wanted to go out and celebrate. Wicked Lovely is ranked in the top ten on all the sites. How are we not screaming this from the rooftops?\"</p><p>\"My throat is too sore for screaming.\" A ragged cough tore its way out of my mouth, emphasizing the point.</p><p>\"Damn, Nicole, you sound awful. You need to go see a doctor.\"</p><p>\"I'm fine. It's just a summer cold. I'm sure I got it from one of the germ incubators I flew in during the last three weeks. I'll be better in a couple days and we can celebrate then. My parents want to do something too.\" I rested my head against the arm of my couch. I didn't confess that several sleepless nights in a row had probably done little to help my health and well-being.</p><p>\"Fine, sicky. Speaking of your family, your mom called me yesterday. She wanted a list of your friends. I think she's planning a party.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \"Oh lord. That seems a little pretentious, don't you think?\"</p><p>\"You, pretentious? Is that even possible? You're the most humble person I know. I think a celebration is a great idea. You've worked hard, and I think you deserve it.\"</p><p>I opened my mouth, but held off as a series of sneezes ripped through me. \"Seriously, this cold is the asshole of all colds,\" I muttered when I finally stopped and had blown my nose loudly again.</p><p>Olivia stood up, trying not to look too disgusted. \"On that note, I think I'm going to bolt.\"</p><p>I glared at her cold skittishness. What a baby. I really should have licked her.</p><p>\"I'm going to run to Publix. What do you need?\"</p><p>I forgave her abandonment and no longer felt I needed to pass my germs on to her with my tongue. \"I want to marry you,\" I declared, blowing my nose again.</p><p>\"I'm flattered. What do you need, sicky?\"</p><p>\"More tissues,\" I said, holding up the nearly empty box. \"And OJ would be amazing.\" I hacked again.</p><p>\"Okie-dokie. I'll get chicken soup too. When I get back, I may do the ol' ring-the-bell-and-run trick.\"</p><p>\"Will you get me some 7UP too?\" I added before she could close the front door.</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah,\" she said, waving as she left.</p><p>Once she was gone, I slumped back against my sofa. My smile faded. I really did feel like crap, but beneath the cold was a deep-rooted sadness that I couldn't seem to shake. It had been four nights since Alec had walked out on me. Despite my own personal pep talks that there were other fish in the sea, I couldn't shake the feeling of loss. So, I tried to bury it. Maybe that was how I got sick. The cold made it easy for me to dwell in self-pity. Either way, they were both kicking my ass, and I needed to shake them.</p><p>Severus jumped up on the couch, seeking some attention. At least he hadn't cared that I was sick. It took him a while to forgive me for leaving him alone for three weeks, but once he got over it, he didn't leave my side. I turned up the volume on the television while Severus made bread dough on my lap. After a few minutes he had kneaded the blanket to his liking and settled in. I stroked a hand over the back of his head and he purred with approval.</p><p>\"I missed you, sweet boy,\" I crooned, scratching under his chin where he liked it the most. \"Who needs guys when I have you?\" He purred louder, obviously agreeing with me.</p><p>I snuggled deeper into the cushions, trying to adjust to the way my body had ached all day. I hadn't planned on falling asleep when I closed my eyes, but that's exactly what happened. I welcomed the darkness. At least I would be free from the thoughts that bogged me down.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>It took me almost a week to shake the cold, but by the time I was finally healthy, I was able to function without thinking about Alec every minute.</p><p>During my recovery, I caught up everything I'd fallen behind on during my trip and even outlined a rough draft of my next book. For the most part, I did a lot of sleeping. Olivia and Mom took turns checking on me and keeping me company. I did end up going to the doctor when my fever spiked, and it turned out I had a case of strep throat.</p><p>Despite being sick the entire week, there were some positives that happened. Wicked Lovely had made the major bestsellers lists and was still going strong. I'd been passed out in a medicated slumber when Olivia charged into my apartment with one of those horns you blow during New Year's Eve. It took me several minutes to process what she was so excited about, but once I did, I could hardly believe it. I could now call myself a New York Times Bestseller. My entire family had shown up to congratulate me as well, and we celebrated by eating pizza in my living room since I wasn't fit to leave my apartment.</p><p>Mom threw herself into planning my party with the help of Olivia. Neither asked for my input, which made me happy. I still wasn't thrilled with the idea of holding a party to celebrate me. My objections fell on deaf ears, so I ignored their efforts for as long as possible until Olivia showed up on the day of the big celebration.</p><p>In my typical fashion, it had been weeks since I had left my apartment. I was neck deep in book two of the Wicked Lovely series. The story was darker than my normal fare and I didn't need a psychiatrist to know why. All the emotions I had bottled up over my affair with Alec poured out in my writing. The story unfolded before my eyes. It wasn't exactly our story, but the passion and angst came directly from my soul. Never had a story flowed so effortlessly for me. It was like melted butter poured over popcorn.</p><p>When Olivia showed up at my apartment to \"style me up,\" I used the new book as an excuse to try to get out of the afternoon torture session she had arranged.</p><p>\"Absolutely not. You've been holed up in this apartment for almost a month, you hermit. Do you even know what the sun looks like anymore?\"</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders, glancing in my hallway mirror. So my skin was a bit pasty, but it was all in the name of sacrifice. With Wicked Lovely still holding on strong on the charts, I wanted to make sure I was able to release book two sometime in the fall. \"I've peeked out the window. The sun is that big bright thing that makes it so hot outside.\"</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \"Good guess,\" she muttered. \"Now learn to use a washing machine.\" I almost took offense to her comment until I looked at my yoga pants that were showing the signs of wear and tear. My tee shirt wasn't much better.</p><p>\"Fine, skank. You can fix me up for the party,\" I finally conceded.</p><p>She took my words to heart and spent the afternoon giving me a complete makeover. From filing, buffing and painting my short nails to trimming and styling my hair. By the time she pushed me toward my bedroom to put on the dress she'd picked up for me, I was feeling pretty damn refreshed. I couldn't remember the last time I'd been pampered in such detail. I considered offering Olivia a raise and making these sessions regular occurrences. That way, I'd actually feel like a girl at least once a month.</p><p>Looking at myself in the mirror hanging on the back of the door, I admired the elegant knot Olivia had worked into my hair. I unzipped the dress bag she had hung on my closet door, smiling with satisfaction when I saw the gorgeous bright pink summer dress with a full skirt. I probably would never have bought it for myself, but as I pulled it on over my head and spun around, the full skirt twirled around me and the bright color complemented my pale skin and light hair.</p><p>I slid my feet in the silver strappy shoes Olivia had also bought and then stood in front of the mirror, studying my reflection. I no longer resembled a street urchin. Once again, Olivia had proved to be the best friend a girl could ask for.</p><p>She entered my room without knocking and smiled at the fruits of her labor. \"I knew that dress would be perfect. You look beautiful.\"</p><p>\"You did well, my friend,\" I said, linking my arm through hers. For a moment, we stood framed in my mirror and for the first time ever, I looked comfortable standing next to Olivia without feeling self-conscious.</p><p>\"Ready?\"</p><p>I nodded, feeling the first stirrings of excitement. Now that we were leaving, I realized it would be nice to get out of the apartment. Even if it was to attend a party in my honor. I would have to suffer through that part.</p><p>\"Are we picking up Taylor on the way?\" I asked, sliding into the front seat of her car.</p><p>She slid into the driver's seat before answering with a telltale shake of her head.</p><p>\"Oh no. What happened? I thought you guys were great together.\"</p><p>She shrugged, backing out of the parking space. \"He wanted more than I was willing to give. I liked being with him, but he wanted all that commitment-and-future kind of stuff. I'm too young to be thinking about tying myself down to someone right now.\"</p><p>Her words were like a slap in my face. She had no idea how close they came to what Alec had said to me. It would seem that the two of them had more in common than he and I did. They both felt relationships were the equivalent of being tossed in a jail cell with no chance for parole.</p><p>I decided to change the subject before the thoughts could completely funk up my mood. \"I've decided to take next semester off.\"</p><p>She wasn't as surprised as I thought she would be. \"I suspected you probably would. I know getting your degree is important to you, and I'm sure you eventually will finish school, but honestly, you're already in your dream job. You're a walking, talking advertisement for the slogan 'Dreams do come true.'\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I do want my degree, and eventually I'll get there. I've just decided it doesn't need to be a race. Someday I'll have the diploma, and it'll look good framed on the wall, but beyond that, what will I do with it. I guess I'll have something to fall back on if this writing thing goes in the toilet.\"</p><p>\"I don't see that happening anytime soon,\" she said, grinning wickedly like she knew something I didn't.</p><p>\"Spill it,\" I demanded.</p> <p>She laughed with delight before answering. \"Obviously, you haven't checked your emails today.\"</p><p>\"You know how I get when I'm writing. I haven't checked them in days.\"</p><p>\"Well, I'm not sure what it means exactly, but a literary agent emailed expressing her interest in Wicked Lovely. She asked if she could set up a phone conference with you.\"</p><p>My heart kicked into overdrive. Other author friends of mine had signed with agents, and I had wondered if it was in the cards for me. \"Are you kidding me?\"</p><p>She grinned broadly. \"I would never joke about this, slutbag. I emailed her back and set up a time for tomorrow afternoon.\"</p> <p>\"Holy shit. That's insanity. Do you know what this could mean?\" I bounced in my seat with excitement.</p><p>\"This means we're one step closer to seeing you in bookstores, baby.\"</p><p>\"I think I'd pass out if that ever happened.\"</p><p>\"Better get ready, then. Mark my words: One day soon you'll need smelling salts.\"</p><p>I laughed with glee. We had talked about this. What I would do if the opportunity arose, but I never put much stock into the conversations. Now that it was actually a possibility, I felt like a whole new door had been opened. I opened the email on my phone and for the rest of the drive, we analyzed every word, and what questions I should ask the following day.</p><p>The party was already in full swing by the time we arrived. I wasn't surprised in the slightest. Olivia had this thing about never being the first person to show up anywhere. She never let it happen, claiming it made people look needy. I argued that at least showing up early meant everyone wouldn't be looking at you when you arrived late. Since she was orchestrating this night, I went with the flow.</p> <p>\"Gah, how many people did you guys invite?\" There had to be at least a dozen vehicles parked in the driveway and down the street of my childhood home.</p><p>She shrugged, climbing from the car and lighting a cigarette. If I would have been more observant earlier, I would have picked up on the fact she was smoking again, thus ensuring Taylor was history. Olivia only smoked between dating guys. It was her coping mechanism. I'd tried to Dr. Phil her on more than one occasion, but eventually I let her have her vice. If it gave her the comfort she sought, then so be it.</p><p>She put the cigarette out after only a few puffs and deposited it in Dad's trash bins on our way past the garage to the front door. Linking her arm through mine, we entered the crowded house together.</p><p>\"Sweetheart, you look lovely,\" Dad greeted me, sweeping me up in a bear hug.</p><p>\"Thanks, Daddy. Olivia waved her magic wand and this is what we got. The spell will be lifted by midnight and I'll return to my normal reclusive self.\"</p><p>He laughed, ruffling my hair. Olivia glared at him playfully before smoothing it back in place. \"Careful. My magic only stretches so far.\"</p><p>\"Holy cannoli. Is that Nicole?\"</p><p>\"Can't be. That girl actually looks like a girl.\" If Zach and Tony weren't my brothers, their smart-ass remarks would get them a kick in the ass. I would let Olivia do it though. I wouldn't want to ruin my cute shoes.</p> <p>\"Har - har. You two are so funny.\"</p><p>Tony whistled as he stepped closer, looking me over like a new car. \"Hear that? She sounds like our sister. I guess she kinda looks like her too. I think we need to mess her up a little to make sure.\"</p><p>Olivia stepped between us, not willing to let sibling shenanigans ruin her work. \"Touch her hair and you'll be singing soprano for a week. Got me?\"</p><p>Tony's eyes sparkled like they always had when Olivia spoke to him. He stepped closer, invading her personal space. \"The pain might just be worth it, coming from you,\" he murmured.</p><p>They stood chest to chest. \"You would like that, wouldn't you?\" Olivia's hand slid provocatively across Tony's shoulder. \"Maybe we can try it out sometime,\" she whispered into his ear. She turned her head, practically offering Tony her lips. He looked hypnotized and leaned in to take what he had always wanted. \"Or not,\" she added, stepping away from him. \"I need a drink. How about you, Nic?\"</p><p>Zachary roared with laughter as Olivia and I walked away. \"You dumb bastard. How many times are you gonna fall for that?\" He licked his finger and shoved it in Tony's ear, causing Tony to attempt to put him in a headlock. Before I knew it, my dad walked over quickly and separated them, slapping each one on the head. My brothers would never grow up. They were both older than me and still had to be treated like a couple of teenagers.</p><p>Olivia and I made our way to the patio where Mom stood off to the side of the makeshift bar, chatting with her best friend, Eloise. They had been friends since we were kids, and my brothers and Eloise's boys played soccer together. Her sons spent as much time at our house as they did their own growing up. Mom and Eloise liked to joke that they shared custody of them all.</p><p>\"Nicole, you look lovely,\" Mom said, pulling me in for a hug before passing me to Eloise, who also gave me a hug. Being the only girl among five boys had ensured that I was treated differently. Eloise always considered me the daughter she never had. She loved taking me shopping when I was younger and designated at least one day a month as \"girl time.\" She was worth admiring since her husband walked out on her and the boys ten years ago and she finished raising them on her own. To this day, their sons Ryan and Hunter hadn't forgiven their father for hurting their mom.</p><p>\"Hey, Eloise. How's the gardening going?\"</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \"Don't ask. Whatever possessed me to think I'd have a green thumb when I can't even keep a houseplant alive is beyond me.\"</p><p>\"Maybe you should hire a hot young landscaper to help you out,\" Olivia piped in, winking outrageously as she poured herself a glass of wine. \"Or give up gardening altogether and just hire yourself a pool boy.\"</p><p>Mom and I both laughed when Eloise blushed brightly. She had never recovered from her husband's betrayal. We had all been trying to nudge her into the dating pool for years.</p><p>\"I'd have to get a pool first,\" she finally tittered.</p><p>\"That's just a technicality,\" Olivia laughed, taking a sip of her wine.</p><p>The patio became crowded as more of the party guests made their way to the bar.</p><p>\"Hey, look who it is.\" My ears perked up at the sound of my brother Riley's voice. I was about to turn around, thinking that he had been talking to me. \"You might need to take off your shirt for us,\" he laughed. \"You know, give us a little flex.\"</p><p>An achingly familiar laugh drifted my way. I shot daggers at Olivia, who was suddenly too busy to look at me. Surely she wouldn't do this to me. As my friend, she should automatically be on my side when something went wrong with a guy. Just like I'd do for her. It was the friendship code.</p><p>\"Hey, Riley, it's good to see you again.\"</p><p>\"You too, Alec.\"</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The hole in my heart that had been held together by a haphazard Band-Aid felt like it was bleeding.</p><p>\"And who is this pretty lady?\" Riley asked.</p><p>And he brought a fucking date? I was in hell. Maybe this was his way of showing he was over me, or she could be a buffer to make sure I didn't try to beg him to take me back. Evidently, he didn't realize I couldn't have begged him even if I wanted to. There was no way I could handle the rejection again. I couldn't take the pain.</p><p>The only way I could save face would be to turn around and show him I was the one who was over him. Paste a brilliant smile on my face for him and his slut date. My nonchalance would be enough to prove I was fine. First, I needed to believe all that bullshit myself. Convince my face to accept a smile. Plead with my eyes to not betray me. Channel all the inner help I could muster.</p><p>\"This little lady is Lily Bell,\" Alec answered, his voice brimming with pride.</p><p>I whirled around so quickly I nearly lost my balance. My eyes peered at perhaps the cutest little girl I'd ever seen. Maybe I was a bit biased because I knew she belonged to him, but no one could deny she had been blessed with some dynamic genes. Her auburn hair hung in ringlets halfway down her back, and her rich brown eyes were highlighted by long, thick eyelashes. She was a striking replica of Alec.</p><p>\"Alec and Lily, I'm so glad you could make it,\" Olivia said, stepping smoothly around me while I remained gaping at them.</p><p>Alec's eyes met mine. \"I wouldn't have missed it for the world. It's not every day my pecs have the words 'New York Times bestseller' written across them.\" He smiled at me and I tried to return it, but my mouth seemed to have formed an alliance with my broken heart.</p><p>\"Daddy, what are pecs?\" Lily asked, tugging on Alec's arm.</p><p>\"Uh.\" Alec struggled for an acceptable answer, looking around helplessly like the words would suddenly magically appear.</p><p>Mom leaned in and whispered in Lily's ear, making her cover her mouth, giggling. I noticed she had a purple cast on her arm.</p><p>\"You have to make sure it's okay with Daddy,\" Mom said conspiratorially.</p><p>\"Daddy, can I go make an ice cream sundae with the lady?\"</p><p>\"Sure thing, pumpkin bug,\" Alec answered, rustling her hair.</p><p>Lily laced her small fingers with my mom's and skipped along her side toward the kitchen.</p><p>\"Hey, I want a sundae too,\" Riley whined, following behind. Olivia and Eloise brought up the rear, leaving Alec and me together. The whole thing reeked of a setup. Alec had to know what he would be walking into and yet, there he stood.</p><p>I remained as frozen as a statue, unable to follow my family who had just abandoned me. A small part of me was thrilled about seeing Alec again, and even happier to be alone with him. That was my sensible side. The vulnerable half of me wanted to cower in the corner.</p><p>\"How have you been?\" he asked, closing the distance between us. My limbs threatened to betray me. He was like a tractor beam, drawing me in. It took everything inside me not to throw my arms around him. Trying to clear my muddled head, I took a step backward to regain a small measure of dignity.</p><p>A half-dozen responses to his question sprang to mind. How was I? It was a loaded question. Did he want to know about the sleepless nights? How about the story I was currently writing that was channeling all my hurt? I was sure only one answer would satisfy him. \"Fine,\" I lied, smiling brightly.</p><p>He nodded, taking another hesitant step toward me. My smile faltered. I couldn't keep up the charade with him so close. I was barely hanging on as it was.</p><p>I stepped backward again, only to run into one of the patio chairs. Of course, being me, I lost my balance and would have landed face first on the cement if not for Alec's quick reflexes. He reached out and snagged my wrist, keeping me on my feet.</p><p>His touch was as familiar and as warm as I remembered. It had been a month since we last saw each other, but it felt like no time had passed. Neither of us spoke as we looked down at his hand that clasped my wrist. His hold was not intimidating or confining. It was more a caress than a shackle, holding me gently in place.</p><p>My eyes moved to his, wondering what his game was. Did he know how susceptible I was to his touch? Couldn't he tell that he was stealing a piece of my heart every time he did this to me? Maybe he wouldn't be satisfied until he had shattered me into a thousand tiny pieces.</p><p>Not surprisingly, I couldn't find the words to end his games. It wasn't the first time he'd had me tongue-tied.</p><p>His eyes bore into mine as he made a confession. \"It's funny, but I haven't been fine.\"</p><p>His words slowly filtered through my head as I tried to process them. \"You haven't?\" I finally croaked out.</p><p>He shook his head, running his hand gently up my arm. \"I thought I'd be okay. I was sure I'd made the best decision. In my head, I thought it was crucial that I focus on what was important.\" He ran his hand back down my arm, clasping my fingers with his. \"The only problem is I suddenly had the feeling I had walked away from something really special in my life.\" His eyes held mine, soaking in my response.</p><p>My heart thudded painfully in my chest, warning me not to trust him again. A voice in the back of my mind told me I was making this too easy for him.</p><p>\"I tried to ignore it and move on, but every single damn thing reminded me of you. It didn't matter if it was a puddle in a parking lot or if I was driving by a Starbucks. You were everywhere I looked except the one spot I wanted you the most.\"</p><p>My eyes glistened at his words. Any resolve I had left was crumbling with everything he said. \"Where is that?\" I asked.</p><p>He tugged me until I was standing in his embrace. \"Here in my arms. I'm sorry I was a fool, Nicole. I was scared and reacted the only way I could think of.\"</p><p>\"It was too soon for me to lay that on you. I know that now,\" I said, taking ownership for my part.</p><p>\"Does that mean your feelings have changed?\"</p><p>I debated lying. Confessing how I was feeling had pushed him away once. What if I admitted that even though he'd broken my heart almost a month ago, I was still in love with him? I couldn't even convince myself that I didn't want him back. \"Would it scare you away if I told you my feelings haven't changed?\" What else could I do but pour my heart out and hope he didn't stomp on it? If that happened, at least I would have closure.</p><p>He tightened his arms around me. \"Sweetheart, that's what I'm trying to tell you. Somewhere along the way, maybe it was in New Orleans or hell, it could have been the first time I saw you and you were soaking wet. At some point, I fell for you. I was just too stupid to listen to my feelings. When that asshole put his hands on you, I wanted to kill him. I can't tell you how hard it was for me to let the police handle it. I wanted to break every single finger on his hands.\" His voice was ragged and thick with emotion. \"Then selfishly, I was the one who turned out to be the asshole who hurt you. It took me going home without you to make me realize what you had come to mean to me.\"</p><p>I shook my head in confusion. \"You expect me to believe that? If all that's true, you could have come see me as soon as I returned home.\"</p><p>\"I wanted to. I swear, but I convinced myself I didn't deserve you, that you would be better off without me. I come with a whole lot of baggage, and I tend to make poor decisions constantly.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Do you love me?\" I was sick of hearing excuses. If he couldn't answer that one question, then any more talk was pointless. My voice shook slightly, but I didn't look away from his eyes.</p><p>\"More than what's probably healthy.\"</p><p>\"And you expect me to trust you? You rejected me not once, but twice, indicating both times that I would somehow mess up your life. That's some heavy-ass baggage to lay on someone. I don't think I can be with you. I'd always be afraid you'd walk away at the drop of a hat.\" My words were raw and piercing. I had basically closed the door on a relationship with him. The thought nearly kneecapped me.</p> <p>He looked thunderstruck, taking several moments to answer. \"Babe, I know I don't deserve your trust, but I'm willing to show you. I'm not going anywhere. I've sucked at commitments in the past, pushing everyone away when they get close, but I want to fight for us. I believe in this. Please, let me prove it to you. Let me have the chance to woo you. To prove I want you in my life.\"</p><p>I almost caved. I wanted to so badly my knees trembled, but I held myself rigid. He'd already crushed my heart once. Another rejection might damage it beyond repair. \"You want me in your life now, but what about six months later when you're neck deep in medical school and you begin to think I'm holding you back again?\"</p><p>He stepped closer, placing my hand over his chest and holding it in place. \"I can't see into the future, but I promise you that's not going to happen. This past month has been hell without you. I want you in every aspect of my life\u2014in my bed, in my arms and next to my side. Will you let me prove it?\"</p><p>His words took my breath away and my resolve began to crumble. I searched his eyes, seeing nothing but naked truth in them. After a long, hesitant pause, I finally nodded my head.</p><p>He pulled me tightly to his chest to capture my lips.</p> <p>I placed my hands against him, holding him back. \"Not so fast. You're going to have to prove it first, just like you said you wanted to do. No kisses, no intimate touching or anything else. I want to know that you want me, not just sex.\"</p><p>He smiled willingly. \"Done. Should we shake on it?\" He held out his hand and I eyed it before letting it engulf mine.</p><p>I lit another candle as my phone rang.</p><p>\"So, what was today's delivery?\" Olivia greeted me.</p><p>I shifted the phone to my other ear as I lit another candle. \"Nine historical romance books. One for each time we made love,\" I answered, blushing as I recalled the note that had accompanied the package that had been dropped off earlier that day. For the last two weeks, Alec had showered me with gifts. One day it had been a dozen daisies for the number of weeks we'd known each other. Another day he sent a bag of Sour Patch Kids for the time I had confessed my weakness for them. Each delivery was left on my doorstep and always had a small note, reminding me of its significance. The wooing didn't end there. Alec would text me sweet messages during the day and spicy messages before I went to bed, ensuring that he would be the star of my dreams. I saved each note and text message, reading them over and over again. I fell a little more in love with him each day.</p><p>\"Oh lord. That boy has got it bad,\" Olivia sighed. I knew she thought Alec and I had gone off the deep end, but even her fear of commitment couldn't break the bubble of happiness I seemed to be floating on. It wasn't the gifts or even the messages that Alec had bestowed on me. It was the other things, like the day he took me to the park to fly kites with him and Lily, or the morning he and I went to the zoo to see the peacocks. The best part was the late-night phone calls that seemed to last forever that won me over. Surprisingly, he'd stuck to his word and hadn't tried to touch me or kiss me since the party, but he had wooed me in every other way possible. Now, after two weeks, it was me who was ready to end the deal. I wanted him so badly it had begun to consume my every thought.</p> <p>\"It's sweet,\" I lamented, blushing again. Olivia just didn't know what it felt like to be in love. I stood up to turn off the lights, smiling at the flickering candles I had set around the room.</p><p>\"So, I guess that means you're ready to get back on the Alec train. Admit it. You want his steam engine back in your station.\"</p><p>I snorted at her crude words. \"Sheesh, Liv. You're worse than a guy.\"</p><p>\"Ha, you wish, slutbag.\"</p><p>My doorbell rang before I could throw out my own term of endearment. \"He's here. I'll call you tomorrow. \"</p><p>\"Fine, but at least let him walk in the door before you throw your panties at him.\"</p><p>I giggled like a schoolgirl. She wasn't that far off. \"Can't make any promises. Love ya,\" I said, heading for my door.</p><p>\"Love you too, even if you are a ho.\" She snorted with laughter, disconnecting the call.</p> <p>Tossing the phone on the counter, I glanced in the mirror, smoothing my hair down one last time before pulling the door open.</p><p>He looked more gorgeous than should have been legal, but my feelings ran deeper than that. What I felt was as much affection as attraction.</p><p>\"Are you ready?\" He inhaled the scent of my candles that had filled my small apartment. \"That smells good.\"</p><p>I nodded my head, knowing when he said \"ready,\" he was asking about our date, but I wanted something else. I surprised him by reaching for his hand and slowly dragging him into my apartment.</p><p>His seemed confused until he took in the dimness of the room. \"Are you sure?\"</p><p>I stepped closer to him. \"I've never been more certain.\" I looped my arms around his neck so my body was pressed against him. He placed his hands around my waist, anchoring me in place. The contact made me tremble. It had been so long since I had felt his embrace.</p><p>\"I wasn't done winning your heart back,\" he said huskily, running his hands up and down my side.</p><p>\"My heart is already yours,\" I whispered, placing my lips on my favorite spot on his neck that I had first licked so long ago. This time it was his turn to tremble in my arms.</p><p>\"And mine is yours,\" he said as his lips claimed mine. \"I have something for you.\"</p><p>\"I know, let's go to the bedroom and you can give it to me.\" I grabbed his hand and tugged him toward the hallway.</p><p>\"No, well, I want that for sure, but I want to give you this first.\" He reached behind his back, into his pocket. \"I was going to give it to you at the restaurant, but this works too.\" He brought his hand around holding out a single, perfect peacock feather. \"I'm hoping this will be our new beginning.\"</p><p>His hand moved to the back of my neck, massaging me gently. \"Nicole, I love you.\" His voice was deep and husky, but more importantly, sincere.</p><p>\"I love you,\" I echoed a moment before his lips crashed to mine.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>\"Are you ready for this?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"Not on your life. I can't believe I allowed you and Olivia to talk me into this.\"</p><p>\"Interview phobia?\" Alec teased, reminding me of a conversation we had long ago.</p><p>I ignored his question as I sat on the edge of the loveseat in the green room of the local news station. Fear didn't even begin to cover how I was feeling at the moment. Maybe when I tossed my cookies, Alec wouldn't think it was so funny. I'm sure when the morning wake-up talk show asked to do an interview with me, they thought I would be more sophisticated and put together. Not a jittery mess. I wished I would have taken Olivia's suggestion and downed a bottle of wine, but it was too late now.</p><p>Thomas, one of the producers we had been introduced to, entered the room. \"Ms. Blake, Mr. Petropoulos? This is Lisa Shaw,\" he said, introducing us to a tall, leggy beauty I recognized from watching the show.</p><p>I stood up to shake her hand, trying to control the shaking in my knees. \"It's nice to meet you.\"</p><p>\"Likewise,\" she said, beaming at me. \"I have to say, I read your book and I absolutely adored it. I'm a little awestruck at the moment, so you may have to excuse me if I start fangirling too much.\"</p><p>A warm feeling spread through me as some of my tension left. \"I'm so happy to hear that. I enjoyed writing it, and I'm so glad readers were able to connect with it.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I connected all right,\" she laughed. \"I can barely wait for book two to come out. Have you picked a date yet?\"</p><p>I nodded. \"Hopefully soon. That's all I can say at the moment.\"</p><p>\"I can't wait,\" she gushed. Thomas cleared his throat. \"Oops, that's our cue to get rolling,\" she said as an assistant attached a microphone to my shirt and then Alec's. \"This will be a short segment. Just keep your focus on me and forget about the audience.\"</p><p>\"Sounds great,\" Alec said, placing a warm hand on my knee that had started bouncing nervously.</p><p>We followed the assistant into the studio where a small audience sat waiting for the show to return from commercial break. Two empty plush chairs sat next to Lisa, separated by a small round table. Thomas counted us down and Lisa turned directly into the camera as the audience applauded. \"Welcome back, everyone. You all know how I love me some romance,\" she said, making the audience roar with laughter. \"Fortunately, we have one of the hottest authors in the business right now living in our own backyard. Here to talk about her latest book, Wicked Lovely, is New York Times bestselling author, N.S. Blake, and for an extra treat, the cover model\u2014yeah, this is him right here\u2014Alec Petropoulos.\" She held up the book, pointing to the cover as the audience applauded loudly.</p><p>Alec and I both waved, although I wanted to disappear into my chair.</p><p>\"So, Nicole, your book burned up the industry charts almost overnight, making it an instant sensation. Did you expect to be so openly embraced?\" Lisa asked, holding up a copy of the book again.</p><p>I laughed lightly. \"No, it was definitely a surprise. As a self-published author, I'd seen some moderate success with my previous books. I knew when I started writing Wicked Lovely that it was going to be entirely different than my Pirate Nights series. A bit darker, more angst and sexier. My hope was that my readers would come to love it like I had.\"</p><p>Lisa laughed with delight. \"That we did.\" She fanned herself with her hand. \"I can imagine becoming a New York Times bestseller at your age must have been a surreal experience. Just so viewers know, you celebrated your twenty-second birthday earlier this year, right?\"</p><p>I nodded. \"Yes, in March,\" I answered, blushing slightly. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would hit a list, let alone the most respected. That title belongs to real writers.\"</p><p>\"I hate to break it to you, Nicole, but you're as real as they come. Wicked Lovely has quickly become my favorite book.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I said, blushing again. \"I think with every book a writer releases, they hope the story will resonate with the readers. I'm so grateful Wicked Lovely is that story for me. I credit it to my great cover model,\" I teased, trying to shed some of the attention on Alec.</p><p>\"Ah, yes, the gorgeous cover model. Alec, how has your life changed since you posed for this shot? I can imagine you're in high demand. I'm sure viewers in my age bracket can't help thinking of the popular cover model Fabio,\" she said, clutching her chest dramatically. The audience burst into laughter again as she continued. \"I have to say, you put Fabio to shame,\" she added as the Wicked Lovely cover appeared on a giant screen behind us. The audience hooted with glee.</p><p>Alec's eyes moved to mine as he slid his arm around me. \"The biggest change in my life is I managed to get the girl. I guess you could say that cover made my dreams come true too.\"</p><p>Lisa practically swooned as the entire audience let out a collective \"ah.\" Lisa regained her composure quickly, tapping the book. \"So, this led to a brand-new love story?\"</p><p>Alec and I both nodded. \"I guess you could say it was love at first sight,\" I teased.</p><p>\"Oh, that's a love story I'd love to read. Any plans to turn it into a book?\"</p><p>\"What happens under the cover ... stays under the cover,\" Alec drawled.</p><p>Lisa laughed at the play on words. \"No, that story belongs to us,\" I clarified, lacing my fingers through Alec's. \"But I may weave certain parts of our love story into something I write in the future,\" I said deviously, making Alec hide a chuckle with a cough.</p><p>Lisa laughed brightly. \"That's all we can ask for. So, what's up next for N.S. Blake?\"</p><p>I debated her question for a minute. It was hard to pick one thing. Wicked Lonely, the next book in the series, was finished, but I couldn't mention it since we were currently in negotiations with one of the major publishers. They were excited about the series and Jillian, my new agent, suspected I would be signing a deal soon. I could mention the next series I planned to write, but that was in the beginning stages. Maybe the right answer would be to mention what was next for Alec and me since we were both here. But I wasn't sure I wanted to share any more of our story. I liked that it belonged only to us.</p><p>I laughed again. \"Lots of exciting things,\" I finally answered, squeezing Alec's hand.</p><p>Lisa nodded, seeming satisfied. \"I want to encourage everyone watching to pick up Wicked Lovely. Ladies, you'll thank me,\" she said, holding up the book again. \"Everyone in our audience today will, of course, be taking home a copy. Alec and Nicole, thank you for joining us here on the morning wake-up show. We wish you future success on not only your written love stories, but also your unwritten love story.\"</p><p>\"Thank you for having us,\" I answered.</p><p>Lisa shook our hands after the cameras went off for another commercial break. She asked me to sign the book, and I promised her an advanced copy of Wicked Lonely when it was ready.</p><p>We waited around until after the show ended to sign the copies the studio audience had received. As we left the building, Alec slid his arm around me and I snuggled into his embrace that felt so right.</p><p>I had told Lisa during the interview that I would never pen the Alec and Nicole love story, but honestly, it would probably make a pretty decent read. We had everything a good romance story needed\u2014a rocky beginning, a slow build to a budding relationship, several hurdles to overcome, and finally, a happily ever after. So, yeah, maybe one day I would sit down and put something together. I even knew what I would call it. After seeming like we were wrong for each other, as an author, only one title felt appropriate. The Write Stuff. </p> </body></html>"]
