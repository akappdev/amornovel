She was in so much pain. Unimaginable and inescapable. Her body, her swollen belly, her mind, her heart . . .</p><p>No. She had no heart. It was silent. An empty, useless organ.</p><p>It was a realization that had once filled her with curiosity. She was a vampire. A veana. Not a shifter, like her adopted family. Gone were the perpetual feelings of being an outcast among a society who wanted nothing more than to embrace her. Now she had living proof of her own existence. Now her questions could truly be answered.</p><p>Whom did she belong to? Where were others like her? What could she expect from her life? How long would that life be?</p><p>He had gifted her with those answers. That male. The dark-haired, dark-eyed paven who\u2019d come to the Rain Forest to bury his beloved, and himself if Petra hadn\u2019t been there to stop him. Inside the shelter of her tree house so many months ago, Synjon Wise had told her everything, offered her a future. He\u2019d just had to kill someone first. She could hear his voice in her head even now. That deep, rich accent.</p> <p>\u201cVengeance before romance, love.\u201d</p><p>But the one he\u2019d had to kill, the one who had murdered his Juliet, well . . . he was Petra\u2019s only connection with the outside world. Her only connection to her blood. He was her father.</p><p>Cruen.</p><p>Another pained cry wrenched from Petra\u2019s lungs, from deep inside, from the place where the ache seemed to originate, and she stopped and gripped the cool, moist curve of the cave\u2019s entrance.</p><p>She heard her mother\u2019s voice somewhere behind her. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Not the mother who had given her life, but the one who had raised her. As part of her pride, a cub to be cherished.</p><p>The beautiful lion shifter Wen had been the best mother any creature, shifter or vampire, could hope for. Now she nearly wailed in pain at Petra\u2019s distress.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the other female, the one who had brought Petra to the Rain Forest a week ago. This was her biological mother, Celestine. A Pureblood vampire who was as desperate to make up for lost time and bond with her daughter as Petra was to push her away.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need another parent. Especially not one who considered her part in creating Petra a grave mistake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vampire, like her,\u201d Wen continued, her unsteady voice carrying on the breeze. \u201cSurely you\u2019ve seen this kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Celestine\u2019s tone was emphatic, impassioned. Fearful. \u201cHer sister, my daughter Sara, is also in swell, but she is an Impure. She never went through Meta. Getting pregnant before you\u2019re of age, before you experience your transition, is very rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s why she\u2019s reacting this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotional surges are expected in pre-Meta swell . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not like this.\u201d</p><p>Celestine paused before saying, \u201cNo, not like this. And not this far along. The surges are purported to be very early on in the pregnancy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d Wen said, her own voice breaking with emotion. \u201cShe\u2019s been here a week, and every day\u2014every hour\u2014it grows worse.\u201d</p><p>Their impassioned chatter grated on Petra\u2019s exposed nerves, searing her mind with agony. Her nails scraped against the rock.</p><p>\u201cThere must be something we can give her to ease this suffering,\u201d Wen continued. \u201cThis strange hunger. The pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood,\u201d said Celestine.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t drink it,\u201d Wen returned. \u201cI\u2019ve tried. You\u2019ve tried. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Petra snarled over her shoulder, tears raining down her cheeks, relentless. \u201cStop talking about me as if I\u2019m not here!\u201d</p><p>Both females froze in the glare of the sunlight, their gazes cutting to her immediately. Petra despised the fear and empathy she saw in their eyes. Or maybe their expressions made her feel frustrated . . . or was it desperately sad? She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Whimpering, she gripped the underside of her large belly. She couldn\u2019t decipher her feelings. There were too many of them, and too much of them. What was wrong with her? And was it affecting her baby?</p><p>Celestine moved toward her. \u201cYou must drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Petra growled. Blood. Just the thought of it on her tongue, running down her throat, made her gag, made her vicious. She hissed at the both of them and pressed herself back against the mouth of the cave. She wanted to drink, wanted to feed her growing balas, but she couldn\u2019t keep anything down. Gods, wasn\u2019t vomiting worse for the child?</p><p>Tears in her own eyes now, Wen started rolling up her sleeve. \u201cYou can have mine, baby. Take all the blood you need. Please, Pets.\u201d She bit her lip, the loving childhood nickname swallowed up by a sob of despair. \u201cSeeing you like this . . .\u201d</p><p>Overhead, the hawk cried, swooping in low, before returning to the sky. Petra glanced up and growled at the bird. She\u2019d told Dani she didn\u2019t want to see her, didn\u2019t want a ride over the treetops of the Rain Forest, didn\u2019t want the female\u2019s looks of sympathy or fear. But her best friend refused to leave, to retreat to her nest.</p><p>\u201cOur blood won\u2019t stop this, Wen,\u201d Celestine said gently. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she needs his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe father of the child . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Father! Petra silently screamed. Synjon Wise was no father. That bastard wanted to kill her, and the baby. She\u2019d seen it on his face in the dim light of the mutore Erion\u2019s dungeon a week ago, heard it in his voice when he\u2019d repeated her admission about the child she carried being his.</p><p>She turned and ran into the cave. Sobs burst in her chest, scraping her throat. She wanted to get away from her mother and Celestine. From everyone. From light, heat, sound. She wanted to search for darkness. Maybe it would claim her.</p><p>No. Fuck no. She had to survive for the balas. She had to fight her pain and misery, grant this child the home and family it deserved.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods!\u201d she heard Wen cry. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to bring Synjon Wise here, is it? To ask him to care for her and the child? After what was done to him, does he even remember their time together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis memories weren\u2019t taken, just his emotions,\u201d Celestine said, her voice echoing inside the walls of the cave. \u201cHe knows about her and the balas. He knows that she carries the grandchild of his enemy. The question is, will he care?\u201d</p><p>Petra met the back of the cave. It was dark and wet and cold and rough, but it welcomed her. Breathing heavily, panic and sickness and fear and anger rippling through her, she curled up against it and tried to force every thought, every feeling, every memory out of her mind.</p><p>But it was impossible.</p><p>Along with the staggering emotional and physical pain in her body, her brain conjured her past, flipping by, scene after scene. She saw every bit of her childhood in the Rain Forest. She saw the hunts, the shifters, her friends. She saw her work, helping shifters with their early transitions. She saw her brothers.</p><p>She saw Synjon.</p><p>Once again, she experienced the desperation and pain of dragging him inside the cave she huddled in now. She felt his interest in her, both mentally and sexually. She felt his kiss, his touch.</p><p>She felt the moment he\u2019d placed a child in her womb.</p><p>Tears flooded her cheeks. He was responsible for this, what she was going through. And yet he was completely at peace, his brain turned off to any and all emotional connection. She didn\u2019t know if she was grateful or pissed off at the Romans for striking the bargain between Cruen and Synjon. She\u2019d hoped for so much more than just being free, her balas momentarily out of harm\u2019s way as she\u2019d watched Synjon\u2019s emotions being bled from his body on the dungeon floor.</p><p>She\u2019d hoped for something of the male who\u2019d held her, kissed her, cared for her once upon a time in the tree house that she had yet to return to.</p><p>Petra swiped at her eyes and whimpered. As she leaned into the cool, hard rock, growing more and more lost but still blindly determined to do anything and everything to protect her child; Synjon Wise was out there in the world somewhere, devoid of care, of concern. The balas and its mother the furthest thing from his mind.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Within his sprawling penthouse of glass and brick, Synjon Wise sat comfortably at his B\u00f6sendorfer, his fingers moving quickly across the keys as he played something light and pointless.</p><p>The party guests circulated through the six thousand square feet of interior space, leaving the wraparound terraces and 360-degree views of Manhattan to the shard of moon and the cold December night. It was his third party in seven days. The first had been the very night he\u2019d bought the place. The small crowd had been courtesy of his Realtor. Broadway actors, artists, financiers, Pureblood and Impure vampires. He\u2019d never thought much about owning a flat, or dipping into the massive wealth he\u2019d accumulated over the years. He\u2019d been far too busy working, spying, following the trail of vengeance . . .</p><p>This was so much better.</p><p>This was a blissful nothingness.</p><p>And the vengeance? It would be coming to him now.</p><p>He glanced up from the sheet music he didn\u2019t need to read. The dull hum of conversation, the deep thirst of those who continued to empty glass upon glass of Dom P\u00e9rignon White Gold, and the females whom he\u2019d instructed not to come near him until he ceased playing. It was a far cry from the manic scene in the mutore\u2019s dungeon a week ago. Here, no pleas for mercy pinged off the walls, no shocking secrets were revealed, and no blood was being extracted from his person.</p><p>In this house, he did all the drinking.</p><p>A flash on the terrace snagged his attention even as he continued playing. Three massive fanged blokes appeared on the flagstones, their eyes narrowed, their expressions grave in the bleak moonlight as they quickly assessed their surroundings, then headed for the glass doors. Synjon knew them, of course. One far better than the other two, and although the memory, the history, he shared with them held a good amount of tension, he knew absolutely that they were not his enemies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dressed in black and taller, wider, and far more fearsome than any of his guests, the three males entered the great room, bringing with them the winter chill and a swimming pool\u2019s worth of testosterone. Every set of human eyes widened, every pair of human feet drew back. His fingers still sliding over the keys, Synjon tracked the males, waited for them to spot him, scent him. It took no more than a moment before they did, before a pathway was created across the polished stone floor.</p><p>Syn continued to play as the Roman brothers approached, stalking him like prey. They appeared rather tense. Syn wondered what that felt like.</p><p>The one he knew best, a nearly albino vampire male with a perpetual sneer, spoke first. \u201cNice party. But I think our invitation got lost in the mail, Brit Boy.\u201d</p> <p>There was a time when Syn had risen to the male\u2019s caustic play. Reveled in it, in fact. He had no interest now. \u201cYou weren\u2019t invited, Lucian. In fact, none of you were.\u201d</p><p>The male turned to his skull-shaved brother, Alexander, and snorted. \u201cGood to know the guy still has some asshole left in him.\u201d</p><p>Alexander didn\u2019t respond. His focus was entirely on Synjon, his tone serious as he spoke. \u201cWe have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Synjon asked, his fingers moving into Bach\u2019s Concerto in F Minor. He used to despise the piece, had been forced to practice it over and over as a balas, but now he felt only the smoothness of the keys against his skin.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s voice dropped, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cThe veana who carries your child\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPetra,\u201d Syn supplied, picturing the dark-haired veana and feeling . . . nothing.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alexander ground out. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t gone through her Meta. We didn\u2019t know that before. When we brought her back home . . . We didn\u2019t know how a veana in swell who hadn\u2019t gone through her transition would react . . . She\u2019s losing her mind, Syn.\u201d</p><p>Synjon looked up, assessed the male. He couldn\u2019t imagine why Alexander was telling him this. \u201cNow that you\u2019re here, would you like to stay? Join my guests?\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled in Alexander\u2019s chest. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Lucian muttered, leaning against the piano.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone to drink, then?\u201d Synjon caught the eye of one of the humans who enjoyed feeding his vampire guests. She grinned hopefully at him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here for a party,\u201d Nicholas said tersely, moving around to the other side of the piano. \u201cPetra is ill, Syn. She can\u2019t control her emotions. She\u2019s in pain. She\u2019s going out of her mind. It happened soon after she returned to the Rain Forest. You have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttend to my guests,\u201d Synjon said evenly. There was so much to do\u2014he had to select his blood donor for the evening as well as his sexual conquests. He had discriminating tastes in both. But first, a little Prelude in C-Sharp Minor. Rachmaninoff used to make him snarl.</p><p>Times changed, it seemed.</p><p>Arching an eyebrow at the three males, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Excuse me\u2019?\u201d Lucian repeated, giving Syn a disgusted look. \u201cWhatever happened to \u2018Get the fuck out of my way, you bleeding tossers\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Useless. Words with emotions attached.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t react to people and problems with threats and anger anymore, Lucian,\u201d he said, his voice even. \u201cI take care of them quietly, quickly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Lucian muttered. \u201cMerry fucking Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go, find another way to help her,\u201d Nicholas said tightly. \u201cThis paven doesn\u2019t give a shit about anything. And it\u2019s our fault. We made him that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruen made him that way,\u201d Alex amended.</p><p>\u201cWe forced him, held him down and allowed that ancient bastard to drink the emotions from his blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had to.\u201d Alex\u2019s gaze slid away from Synjon. \u201cHe was unreasonable and dangerous. We couldn\u2019t risk having Petra or the child harmed.\u201d</p><p>Lucian growled, pushed away from the piano. \u201cWell, now he feels nothing for them, and Cruen got to run free.\u201d</p><p>Not free, Synjon mused, closing in on the seven-measure coda. \u201cWell, gentlepaven, it was a successful plan all around. I\u2019ve never felt better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel nothing,\u201d Lucian returned.</p><p>\u201cOh, I feel quite perfect where it matters\u2014all things physical. I\u2019m not burdened with tedious, irrational emotions. It\u2019s all very civilized, really.\u201d Rachmaninoff ceased to exist, and Synjon glanced up at Alexander. \u201cI appreciate what was done to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about all that is being done to Petra? All she can\u2019t control?\u201d Alexander returned with barely disguised menace. \u201cShe needs your blood. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate for her.\u201d Syn jerked his chin in the direction of the great room. \u201cAs you can see, I am otherwise engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lost,\u201d Luca muttered. \u201cFucking lost.\u201d</p><p>Synjon stared at the three faces, all twisted into ravaged masks of worry. It suited them\u2014that intensity, that feral, predatory glare. But it held no interest for him. He was rather relaxed\u2014though he could use a pint or two, perhaps a quick, hard fuck as he continued to wait for the inevitable. The one guest he wished to see above all others. The one who would come begging.</p><p>Alexander spoke through gritted teeth, \u201cSyn, your child and Petra . . . they could both die without your help. Your blood.\u201d</p><p>Done with this repetitive, pointless conversation, Synjon replied smoothly, \u201cThen I suppose they will die,\u201d before he returned to the cool white keys and another song from his past: Nirvana\u2019s \u201cDrain You.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>Cruen despised being laid out on his back.</p><p>Even if he\u2019d been the one to request it.</p><p>Near his ear, the one that was still intact, the one Synjon Wise hadn\u2019t gotten around to slicing off with his razor-sharp blade, the female bloodletter\u2019s breath came quick and sharp as she sucked. She\u2019d been at it for over an hour. Retrieval and extraction being the primary goal. But it wasn\u2019t going well. Bruises painted Cruen\u2019s wrists and thighs. The vein in his neck was her final resting place.</p><p>He was starting to grow concerned.</p><p>Freedom was nothing to a vampire without power. And he was becoming weaker with every moment that passed.</p><p>The bloodletter pulled her fangs from his vein, her head from the curve of his neck, and turned toward her metal spit bowl. She deposited a mouthful of blood with a cough and a sputter, then returned to him. Framed by a cap of short black hair, her ashen face and deep-set blue eyes held an almost wry concern.</p><p>\u201cYou embedded them too deep,\u201d she said, blood staining her teeth.</p><p>Cruen eyeballed the extractor, his skin itching, attempting to heal. \u201cI didn\u2019t embed anything. I removed and released only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you released, but it wasn\u2019t emotion.\u201d She snatched a cloth from the table and wiped the blood from her mouth. \u201cThat cluster of bubbling intensity inside your mind remains. And it\u2019s too far for me to reach.\u201d</p><p>With excruciating effort, Cruen forced his weakening body to sit up on the stained pallet. Rising anger fueled his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ve taken and released emotion hundreds of times. It is a simple procedure.\u201d</p><p>The bloodletter stood, grabbed the bowl, and walked over to a nearby sink. \u201cNot always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Cruen demanded to her back, his voice sounding fearfully thin.</p><p>\u201cMost of the time, the extraction of emotions is transient,\u201d she called over her shoulder. \u201cIn and out. There and gone. But sometimes it can stick, become a permanent fixture within the mind.\u201d</p><p>Apprehension washed over Cruen as he watched the female dump his blood into the sink. Permanent? That couldn\u2019t be. All he had performed was a basic emotional extraction in Erion\u2019s dank dungeon. Taking Synjon Wise\u2019s passion to kill in exchange for walking free.</p><p>\u201cThe one you drained,\u201d said the bloodletter, \u201cwas he familiar with this type of grab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cruen said tightly. \u201cHe used to be a very competent spy for the Order. And a military operative for the government.\u201d</p><p>The female released a weighty breath, then turned and came to stand before him. Her gaze remained serious. \u201cI don\u2019t think this was an accident. Not with the depth of those implanted emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His nostrils flaring, Cruen growled, a sound that used to have anyone who heard it shaking. Now it felt as feeble and nonthreatening as that of a balas. \u201cAre you saying the paven whose blood I extracted did this to me on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is my belief, yes.\u201d</p><p>Cruen stared at the female, his lips parted. This was madness. Why would Synjon Wise permanently implant his emotions inside Cruen? Yes, the paven wanted revenge, had ever since he\u2019d found out that Cruen had not only taken and caged his beloved veana, Juliet, but had taken her life as well. But why wouldn\u2019t he have just continued with his torture? The bloodletter\u2019s assessment had to be wrong.</p><p>\u201cDoes this paven have a beef with you?\u201d the bloodletter asked, as if reading his thoughts.</p><p>A beef? Cruen sniffed with lackluster humor. \u201cThe paven whose blood and emotion I ingested wanted me laid out in the sun\u2014after he made sure I suffered first, of course.\u201d</p><p>The female\u2019s eyes narrowed, her expression tight and resolved now. \u201cYou were hoping that by taking his emotion you would be taking his desire to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say it was a bargain struck. A bargain that was intended to benefit all.\u201d Protect us all. Cruen, Petra, and the balas as well. Even that bastard Synjon Wise. If he had truly hurt Petra or the child, he would no doubt have suffered gravely for it.</p><p>The bloodletter was staring at him, her lips rolled under her teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cruen demanded, his skin now healed, his mind jumping. His body being stripped of energy with every breath. He needed to find strong, pure blood to bring back his power and his strength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe paven has done this to make you suffer,\u201d she said in a quiet voice. \u201cBut also to make you his prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrey?\u201d Cruen ground out. How absurd. \u201cHe feels nothing for me now. No anger, no hunger for revenge. He won\u2019t come after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t have to. Because you\u2019ll be going to him.\u201d</p> <p>Cruen lifted his upper lip, flashed his fangs. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>The female shrugged. \u201cYou might even fall to your knees before him and beg.\u201d</p><p>The insolence! Cruen\u2019s fangs dropped and he hissed. He had limited strength, but there was nothing he wanted more at that moment than to rip the vocal cords from this female\u2019s throat. Clearly, she was taunting him now. Perhaps trying to extract more money.</p><p>Pulling on every fiber of strength he possessed, Cruen leaped from the table, and with a fearsome snarl, headed for the door, and for his guards on the other side. The guards that would have to flash him home, as he was quite without the power to manage it himself.</p><p>He pulled the door wide and was almost through it when he heard the bloodletter\u2019s words of doom on the air behind him.</p> <p>\u201cOne final word, my lord. If you ever want to find peace or strength, if you ever want to function normally again, you\u2019ll have to find this male and give back what you took.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cDespite what\u2019s occurring with your mental and emotional state, everything within you is working well and is healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Petra said, pulling her eyes from Brodan and shifting on the bed in her room at her mother\u2019s house. Unable to keep herself still for any length of time, and hating to be around groups of people, she\u2019d refused to go to the clinic when her mother had insisted that she see Brodan for a checkup.</p><p>The doctor, who was also a bear shifter and one of Petra\u2019s closest friends, placed his warm hands on her stomach and gently prodded around the balas. \u201cI wish you\u2019d come stay with me, Pets. I\u2019d feel better if I could watch you full-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Wen agreed, hovering somewhere near Petra\u2019s head, along with Celestine. \u201cIt\u2019s not far, my dear, and with you a few months from your time . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be watched.\u201d Petra closed her eyes and attempted to breathe through the waves of misery and depression threatening to consume her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brodan. For acting like a complete asshole most of the time when you\u2019re just trying to help me. I appreciate the offer. I just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPets, look at me,\u201d he said, his voice clear and strong through her haze. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>It took everything she had to turn back and face him. He was such a great male, handsome and strong and caring. And if her luck didn\u2019t completely run out, the male she would turn to when the balas was born. But, right now, if she continued to engage with him, be touched by him, scent him, she was going to bite him. Hard. And not out of hunger. Out of irrational anger. Her fangs were already dropping and saliva was pooling in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need, Pets.\u201d His eyes implored her. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll do whatever you ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you find a way to stop this?\u201d she said, her tone pathetic even to her own ears. \u201cTurn off this insanity inside me before I explode or lose my mind? Or gods help me, do something terrible. Hurt you or my family. I don\u2019t know how long I can keep this anger and sadness and manic energy penned.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and brushed a few strands of hair back from her face. The gesture repelled her. Like every touch she\u2019d experienced in the past week: her mother, her brothers, her best friend. It all made her recoil.</p><p>Brodan acted as if he hadn\u2019t noticed. He was also incredibly kind. And she was a great fool for not giving herself to him ages ago when he\u2019d made it clear he wanted to be more than friends.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for how long, Pets?\u201d he said, his voice low and masculine but gentle.</p> <p>Petra forced a bleak smile. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve always trusted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. What are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to try something.\u201d He left her side and dug into his medical bag, which was propped up against some books on her dresser. When he returned he was holding up a bag of blood.</p><p>Petra cringed, her insides recoiling, panic rushing through her. \u201cI\u2019ve tried drinking blood. I can\u2019t make myself swallow it. And what I do manage to force down comes right back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He gestured for Wen and Celestine to hold the bag and tubing. \u201cI want to try putting it directly into your vein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Celestine exclaimed. \u201cThat could work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d Wen agreed.</p><p>Hope flared inside Petra, and she quickly pulled up the sleeve of her shirt. There was nothing she wanted more than to shut off these overwhelming feelings racing through her, controlling her. \u201cWhose is it?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cA combination of donors.\u201d He swabbed the inside of her wrist with a square of wet cotton. \u201cI want to see if you have a reaction to this first. If you do, we\u2019ll give you the blood of each donor separately until we find a match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if there\u2019s no match?\u201d She hated to ask the question, but couldn\u2019t stop herself.</p><p>Brodan gave her an encouraging smile. \u201cLet\u2019s not go there yet, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her breath hitching in her lungs. Please let this work. Please.</p><p>With skilled fingers, Brodan quickly inserted the needle into the soft skin of her wrist, then followed up with a tiny plastic tube into her vein.</p><p>She bit her lip. Not from the pain. There was barely any. Whatever little pinch occurred on her wrist was drowned out by another onslaught of emotion. Tears scratched at her throat and she gritted her teeth against them and silently screamed. She was so fucking sick of tears! She was not this weak . . . But even with the effort, the admonishment, the salty bastards still came. Bubbling up. Blinding her. Escaping. Sliding down her cheeks.</p><p>In the moist blur, Petra saw Celestine, a cloth in her hand. The older veana leaned down and dabbed at Petra\u2019s tears, while Wen whispered soothingly, \u201cIt will be all right, my Pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d Brodan asked, his warm hand on her arm, his tone heavy with concern.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Petra shook her head, blinking to get rid of the new tears forming in her eyes. \u201cNo pain, just fear. I\u2019m scared, Brodan. I feel so completely out of control. This balas . . .\u201d She turned her head away and cried softly for a second or two. \u201cI\u2019m already a terrible mother and the child hasn\u2019t even been born yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>The new, though familiar, voice made Petra turn. Behind Brodan, standing in the doorway wearing only jeans and matching severe expressions, were her brothers. Big, tough, blond lion shifters, Sasha and Valentin had always been her closest allies and her biggest supporters. They made her laugh and protected her. She was so grateful to them\u2014and she couldn\u2019t wait to see them as uncles to her child.</p><p>\u201cIf this blood thing Brodan\u2019s cooking up doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ve got another plan,\u201d Sasha told her, a slight sneer on his full mouth.</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Valentin agreed with a punch of feline ferocity. \u201cWe love you too much to see this continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis plan of yours is to be our last resort only, boys,\u201d Wen said in her strongest maternal tone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Val said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that piece of shit male here,\u201d Brodan said tightly, watching the blood move through the tube toward Petra\u2019s waiting vein.</p><p>\u201cNone of us do,\u201d Sasha said with true venom.</p><p>Valentin growled. \u201cBut you know as well as we do that we\u2019re going to have to take some drastic measures if this doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Petra asked, her insides growing cold with confusion and worry as she gripped the edge of the mattress with her free hand. \u201cWhat drastic measures?\u201d She looked at each male in turn.</p><p>Wen turned back to Petra and put her hands on her daughter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cJust a backup plan, my Pets.\u201d</p><p>Inside Petra, anxiety mixed with confusion and a lack of control for one seriously potent cocktail. \u201cFor what?\u201d she demanded, looking from her brothers to her mother.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Brodan said gravely. \u201cFor this.\u201d His gaze met Petra\u2019s. \u201cYour vein just closed up. It won\u2019t even allow the blood inside.\u201d</p><p>Celestine cursed, and Wen squeezed Petra\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Brodan stripped off his gloves, then glanced over and nodded at Sasha and Val. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Petra cried out, trying to sit up.</p><p>But her mother held her down, whispering words of love, while her brothers released terrifying twin growls and rushed out of the room.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The party\u2019s over.</p><p>Or was it just beginning?</p><p>Synjon took off his shirt and draped it over the black leather piano bench. He loved to fuck, needed the release to keep his muscles content, and though he didn\u2019t allow anyone to touch him, undress him, or speak to him, he made sure that the females who spread their legs and bent over the polished black surface of his B\u00f6sendorfer came in ways, durations, and decibel levels they\u2019d never known existed.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to your bedroom or what?\u201d</p><p>The female who had spoken out of turn, the female he\u2019d chosen for tonight, stood near the glass doors that the Roman brothers had walked through only a few hours ago. Her arms were crossed over her chest, and she had one hip cocked in an I\u2019m-the-bloody-shit kind of way. Her small, strong body was encased in a simple black minidress that paired well with her short blond hair, nose ring, and dark eyes. Blond hair and dark eyes. It had become his routine shag. For some reason, his body refused to take any female who sported the combination of dark hair and blue eyes.</p><p>It was bloody irritating.</p><p>He gestured for her to approach him. \u201cCome, female.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cA little premature, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. Perhaps he\u2019d chosen wrong with this one. Perhaps he needed to fill her mouth with something.</p><p>\u201cI want to see where you sleep,\u201d she said, her tone close to defiant as she started walking toward him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep. And no one enters my bedroom.\u201d Or my bed. It was sacred space. As was the room that lay beyond. The one he\u2019d constructed for a very special, long-term guest he hoped would be arriving soon.</p><p>\u201cTurn around and put your hands on the piano,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Her eyes flashed and her nostrils flared as she drew nearer. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to look at me? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>With every look, every word she uttered, this female was growing more tiresome. In fact, Syn was wondering why he\u2019d chosen her in the first place. With all the willing and wet hopefuls, why had he gone for curt and derisive? Both were heavy with emotional undertones\u2014and he didn\u2019t do emotions. Only physical, animallike need. Hot, hard, release-filled fucking.</p><p>He regarded her with a lift of one dark brow. \u201cYour choice, female. And it\u2019s a very simple one. The piano or the door.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth twitched. \u201cYou\u2019re really something\u2014you know that?\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. Was that humor in her expression? He didn\u2019t think so. In fact, he was starting to believe this encounter was a grand mistake. He cocked his head. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out. My driver\u2019s downstairs. He\u2019ll make sure you get home without a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a driver, asshole.\u201d She grinned wide. \u201cI\u2019ve got wings.\u201d</p><p>Before Synjon could draw his next breath, two males rushed him from opposite sides of the room. Growling and snarling, they bodychecked him so bloody hard he lost his vision for a few seconds. What the hell . . . ?</p><p>Widening his stance, he shook his head, trying to clear his vision. He was a natural fighter and a seasoned killer, but over the past week, ever since Cruen had bled his emotions, his instincts had been slightly off. He was slower to react. And it showed now.</p><p>\u201cI want to kill him,\u201d he heard the female say.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d said one of the males.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said the other. \u201cBut we could hurt him a little.\u201d</p><p>Even without full use of his sight, Synjon felt the steady heat come up behind him. He whirled around and shoved his elbow into the neck of one of the males, followed by a fierce head butt to the face. He heard a whoosh of air, and the male\u2019s bloodscent rushed into his nostrils. Familiar. Not vampire.</p><p>But whether enemy or estranged ally he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Someone grabbed his arms, pinned them behind his back. Syn growled and slammed his head back, meeting flesh and bone.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d cried one of the males.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go!\u201d yelled another.</p><p>Cuffs were snapped around Syn\u2019s wrists and he was hit from behind by something hard, maybe metal. Not once, but twice. Then something smacked into his skull, and his vision went gray. He went down, knees, belly, head. Again he shook his head, willed his eyes to open and focus. His vision returned just as he was flipped over onto his back. He was about to shoot to his feet when one dirty, black boot clamped down on his windpipe while the other slammed him mercilessly in the groin.</p> <p>Stars glittered on his retinas as one of the males loomed over him and uttered tersely, \u201cDo you remember us, vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCats,\u201d Syn hissed through gritted teeth. \u201cFucking pussycats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Val and I are taking you back to where it all began.\u201d He pressed harder on Syn\u2019s throat. \u201cYou\u2019re going to feed our sister.\u201d</p><p>No air was getting through. He fought to keep his eyes open, his brain functioning.</p><p>\u201cAnd your cub.\u201d</p><p>The glass door opened and Synjon felt a blast of cold air move over him. Weight lifted off his airway, and he was shoved to his feet.</p><p>\u201cReady to go for a ride, asshole?\u201d the female said, moving out onto the terrace.</p><p>\u201cNot interested anymore, love,\u2019 Synjon rasped. \u201cNot sure if I ever was.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Synjon dropped down, and in a series of quick, powerful moves, he sent his foot into the gut of one male and his knee into the other.</p><p>The pussy brothers were bloody well kidding themselves. Even with the fucked-up vision and the slow reaction time, he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. He had a very important guest arriving soon. A guest who would beg him for mercy, and a quick death before he baked slowly in the sun.</p><p>A needle slammed into his neck then, cutting off all thought, all fantasy. Instantly, the room started spinning. Bloody bastards . . . Synjon braced for a fall, forced his fangs down and a growl from his throat.</p><p>The female on the terrace sneered at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she wasted her time on you.\u201d</p><p>Seconds before Synjon blacked out, he saw the blond female leap from the ledge of his penthouse balcony and shift into a glorious, massive, and highly pissed-off hawk.</p><p>3</p><p>With the sun warm on her skin, Petra circled the tree, then raced toward the stream. Thank the gods for her mother\u2019s suggestion to get some air, some exercise. It was how pregnant shifter females brought on their labor. Hours of sprinting through the Rain Forest. Granted, Petra was no shifter and she wasn\u2019t trying to bring on labor, but the running did something for her. Something miraculous. It released some of the intense and debilitating emotion that had been holding her hostage for a week.</p><p>When she reached the stream, she leaped to the other side and continued along the water\u2019s edge. As she ran, she spotted creatures moving, courting, and mating under the surface of the shallow water. It was a sight she\u2019d grown up with and was used to. A sight that meant a new year approached. New beginnings . . . new life.</p><p>Ever since she\u2019d woken up to the understanding that she lived in a rain forest with an entire species of shape-shifters, Petra had wanted to be like them. She\u2019d been somewhere around ten years old when she\u2019d realized she wasn\u2019t. Even the young who hadn\u2019t shifted yet could run like the wind and scent prey. It hadn\u2019t made her feel like an outcast exactly, but like she was missing something amazing.</p><p>And then, just seven months ago, everything had changed. When he came. He came and made her feel understood, not like a freak. He unleashed the truth, showed her what she was capable of if she embraced it, trained it\u2014fed it.</p><p>Her fanged nature.</p><p>And in some odd way, embracing her vampire had made her feel closer to her family, as though she had more in common with the shifters than she had ever thought possible.</p><p>Breaking into a sprint, she passed a bear shifter who was trying to climb a tree and get to a nest tucked into one of the branches. It growled playfully at her, then returned to its task. Petra found that the faster she moved, the less pain she experienced. It was as if the overwhelming feelings didn\u2019t have time to fully fuse to her insides.</p><p>And the balas liked it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how, but she could sense it. And moving so quickly provided one of only a handful of times when she\u2019d been able to connect with the little life growing inside her. If she could just give it nourishment now . . .</p><p>If she could just give it blood.</p><p>Bile rose in her throat as she picked up speed, leaving the stream behind and taking off across the flat land toward her lion shifter family\u2019s sprawling one-story compound. Somehow she would find a way to protect her balas, feed her balas, give her balas the loving and proper family it deserved.</p><p>Even if she had to spend the remainder of her swell running.</p><p>Just a foot over the property line, she nearly collided with a massive blond male.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Val,\u201d she said, jerking to a halt. \u201cYou could\u2019ve hurt the baby.\u201d</p><p>The blond male with shoulders as wide as the doorframe of their family house backed up a foot just to show he wasn\u2019t in her space. His dark eyes moved over her curiously, concerned. \u201cYou\u2019re sweating. Breathing heavy. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever I have to do to keep sane.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cMy poor Pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, Val?\u201d She jogged in place. She wanted to hold on to this moderately contented feeling for as long as possible. Maybe she could try drinking blood as she ran. Maybe the movement would curb her disgust.</p><p>\u201cI need you to come with me,\u201d Val said, his mane of blond hair escaping the tie at the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack home. I have something to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home. I don\u2019t want to stop, talk, look.\u201d She shook her head, pain rising within her, clenching her belly. \u201cThe speed makes me feel better. Or maybe it makes me feel nothing, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Tears choked in her throat. Goddamn it. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to come back, Val. I gotta go.\u201d She began to move past him.</p><p>He blocked her way. \u201cPets, wait.\u201d</p><p>She snarled at him. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have something for you,\u201d he insisted, his eyes shifting from her chin to her ear. \u201cSomething we think might help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing helps. Don\u2019t you get that? Except for this. Moving, sweating. It\u2019s just going to have to be pure survival mode until Little Fangs here is born.\u201d</p><p>He made a face. Disgusted or embarrassed, she couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cYou\u2019re not really going to name it that, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d Groaning, she took off again at a fast jog.</p><p>\u201cPets, wait. Please.\u201d In seconds, Val was at her side. But this time he was in his lion form. He kept pace with her, snarling, tossing his incredible mane, giving her the \u201ccat eyes\u201d that as a child always got him what he wanted.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t happening today.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Val,\u201d she called out. \u201cI appreciate your concern, but this is my problem to deal with.\u201d</p><p>She sped up, hoping he\u2019d get the message and take off for home, but he was clearly determined. With a massive roar, he shot out in front of her, and the minute she slowed to avoid crashing into him, dipped his head, pushing her off balance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGoddamn it, Val!\u201d she cried, stumbling, trying to right herself.</p><p>But the lion shifter knew exactly what he was doing. When one of her legs jacked up, he lowered and shoved his body underneath. As Petra straddled his back, instinct gripped her, and she fisted his mane in both her hands to keep herself steady as he rose to his full height.</p><p>Not waiting for a response or permission, he took off, barreling over the stretch of land at a shocking pace, kicking up dirt. She couldn\u2019t believe him. What was he trying to prove?</p> <p>She curved over him and leaned into the wind. \u201cI should bite you for that,\u201d she called near his right ear as they raced across the pride\u2019s lands. What the hell was Val thinking? What was so freaking important that he had to practically abduct her? And who else was in on it?</p><p>Her gut twisted. Why couldn\u2019t her family and her friends understand and accept that this was going to be her existence, her reality, for a little while? She knew they cared deeply for her. She knew they wanted more than anything to stop her suffering, and she loved them to death for it. But at some point they had to realize there was nothing to be done but to ride it out.</p><p>And speaking of riding it out . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are we doing here, Val?\u201d</p><p>The lion shifter had come to a dust-kicking halt outside the River House, the one-story cabin on stilts that bracketed the rushing water below. The structure had been built by Sasha, Valentin, and their father many years ago to use when the weather grew unbearably warm. Petra couldn\u2019t count the number of times she\u2019d stretched out in the shade underneath the house, in the water, or on the bank. It had been perfect and relaxing. Completely the opposite of now.</p> <p>Valentin quickly shifted into his male form, grabbed a pair of jeans from the stair railing, and pulled them on. \u201cCome inside, Pets.\u201d</p><p>Inside? This was crazy. What she wanted to do was turn around and run, keep running until she lost her breath. But she knew Val\u2014his stubbornness and that look on his face. He would just come after her again. Better to see what he had inside the house, appease him for a few minutes, and then take off.</p><p>The pain of hunger rushed through her as she followed Val up the short flight of steps. Maybe she could talk with Brodan later, see about the blood-as-she-ran idea. Granted, it was a long shot, but the balas\u2014</p><p>Her fangs dropped suddenly and saliva pooled in her mouth. The scent blasting into her nostrils as she walked through the front door of the cabin was not only familiar but despised. Chills broke out on her skin, but instead of wanting to run away, she had an irrepressible urge to run forward, deeper into the house, stalk the scent, and seize its owner.</p><p>A low hiss exited her lips. It wasn\u2019t possible. It couldn\u2019t be. How could Val have done this to her? He loved her, and yet he now tortured her.</p><p>Her mind screamed at her to turn around, get out, get as far from the scent and all the memories that surrounded it as possible. But her need, her hunger, the vampire veana inside her, refused to let her retreat.</p> <p>It wanted that scent.</p><p>Breathing heavily, she stumbled after Val, licking her lips as she passed familiar furnishings and the framed watercolors that she and her brothers had made when they were little.</p><p>With every step, the scent grew thicker, and she felt her fangs vibrate in her mouth as the hallway became increasingly dark. She followed her brother into the smallest bedroom, the one she normally used when they stayed in the house. The room where all sunlight was absent. The only illumination coming from the small lamp on her bedside table.</p><p>Even though she\u2019d scented blood the moment she walked into the house, familiar blood, she wasn\u2019t prepared for its origin\u2014for the massive paven who was sprawled out on the green-and-blue floral quilt atop the queen-size bed.</p><p>\u201cOh, my god,\u201d she rasped, reaching out to grip Val\u2019s arm, her gaze lifting to see both Sasha and Dani enter the room and head for the hand-carved teak headboard and tightly sealed window. \u201cWhy? What is this?\u201d</p><p>Sasha grinned. \u201cVampire. Freshly caught.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s insides recoiled. He was smiling? He thought this was funny? Her breathing became erratic, and her gaze shot to Dani. Thank gods her best friend remained sober. In fact the blond female looked pissed off.</p><p>\u201cHe is a total bastard, Pets,\u201d she said, her nostrils flaring, the action making her nose ring vibrate. \u201cAfter you\u2019re done with him, please rip that shit apart, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDone with what?\u201d Petra said, her voice high-pitched and panicked. Her fangs wanted out, down, and in. Hunger like she\u2019d never known surged in her blood. Her nails dug into Val\u2019s biceps. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your blood donor, Pets,\u201d Dani said, as though this were the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>And shit, maybe it was. Synjon Wise was the father of her child, and his blood had been the only blood she\u2019d ever been interested in tasting. But he was a monster. A killer. A male interested only in vengeance. A male with absolutely no soul, heart, empathy, or conscience. A male who\u2019d been forced to the dungeon floor a week ago, held down by four massive vampires, and drained of his bitter and dangerous emotions. She didn\u2019t want him in her precious world again. She didn\u2019t want him in her mouth or her bloodstream.</p><p>He was a toxic substance.</p><p>Her wide, manic gaze slid to the bed. Synjon was lying on top of the pretty, feminine blanket she\u2019d had since adolescence, unconscious, spread-eagled, clad only in a pair of dark blue denim jeans that hung just below his hipbones. He was leaner than she remembered, which made the continuous ripples of muscle on his arms, shoulders, and abdomen all the more obvious. His dark hair was cut short, his skin had remained a pale bronze, his cheekbones were prominent, and there was a light sprinkling of stubble around his full lips.</p><p>He was every bit as beautiful as she remembered.</p><p>Time rushed backward and claimed her. She\u2019d seen this male unconscious before, in pain and desperate, and had wanted more than anything to save him. Now, as she stared, as she started to shake, as saliva pooled in her mouth and her fangs begged to do what they were meant to do, all she wanted was to attack, bite, and pull every last drop of blood from his veins into hers.</p><p>Dani chuckled wryly from her spot beside the bed. \u201cNot to worry, boys. I think she likes her prezzie.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Synjon came awake to the scent of unfamiliar surroundings and the sound of a female\u2019s rage. Though his instincts were to jump to his feet and execute everyone in the room, everyone who held him hostage, he kept his eyes closed, his ears open, and his muscles flexed and ready. He would not be a prisoner. Not when he had to return home to Manhattan to welcome a prisoner of his own.</p><p>\u201cLike it?\u201d the female cried again, hunger, violence, and pain threading her tone. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this, Dani! I can\u2019t believe you brought him here!\u201d</p><p>Though Synjon felt no emotional connection to the female who spoke, he knew her voice instantly. He knew her body intimately.</p><p>In fact, he could see her with his eyes closed.</p><p>Black hair. Light crystalline blue eyes. Irresistible smile. Pink flush to her cheeks when she got excited.</p><p>It was an image his skin, cells, and muscles craved, yet wanted to forget, reject.</p><p>\u201cPetra, come on,\u201d came a male voice. \u201cHe\u2019s what you need.\u201d</p><p>A tremor went through Synjon. He knew that voice too. It belonged to one of his abductors, one of Petra\u2019s brothers. He\u2019d met them both many months ago in the Rain Forest community where they lived. Had battled with them inside their house as he\u2019d tried to find the female who\u2019d rescued him from the sun. This time, Synjon would make sure the bloody git and his lion brother paid for the cuffs and body slams with a little torture of his own. After he finished with his long-awaited guest, of course.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the opposite of what I need,\u201d Petra growled. \u201cShit, Sasha, what anyone needs. He\u2019s an empty, soulless, gutless bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Sasha returned. \u201cWhat the balas needs, then.\u201d</p><p>Balas.</p><p>Something about the word scratched at Synjon\u2019s insides, but he quickly shoved back the sensation. The truth in the male cats\u2019 words, the need Petra might have of him, meant nothing to the ultimate goal of vengeance that was nearly within his grasp. A vengeance that could finally be carried out without the inconvenient second-guessing and guilt that had once plagued him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you hesitating, Pets?\u201d It was the female hawk shifter again. Dani. Synjon knew he\u2019d failed on that account. How had he not seen through that blue-balled facade of his to what truly stood before him? What had tricked him?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear you want to tap that, Pets,\u201d Dani continued with an almost audible sneer. One of the males laughed, and the sneer quickly became a growl. \u201cShut up, Val.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just such a guy sometimes, Dani,\u201d he remarked with another low chuckle.</p><p>But Dani was all about Petra. \u201cI want you to take stock, Pets. You\u2019re losing your freaking mind. Your emotions are out of control. You can\u2019t eat or sleep.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cI mean, the vampire\u2019s right here for the taking. I say drain him dry and leave his shell in the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Petra said in a pained voice.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, I do,\u201d Dani returned. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t want to do it for yourself, then do it for the baby.\u201d</p><p>Balas.</p><p>The correction came swiftly to Syn\u2019s mind. He wondered why that would be.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll fight me,\u201d Petra said.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Dani returned. \u201cFight him back. You\u2019re ridiculously strong. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Is that like a pregnant vampire thing or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I don\u2019t know anything about being a veana in swell. Or being a veana who hasn\u2019t gone through Meta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever the cause, it\u2019s kick-ass and you need to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when he does wake up.\u201d The male spoke again. Petra\u2019s brother. Sasha. \u201cHe can\u2019t leave this room. It\u2019s morning now. Sun\u2019s bright and hot and ready to soak up some male vampire skin, so you have a good amount of time to get what you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Synjon kept his body ice-still. These shifters were in for a rude awakening if they believed a veana could hold a paven like him hostage.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Petra asked, her voice heavy with intensity, need, hunger.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to lock you both in the cabin,\u201d Dani said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, gods,\u201d Petra uttered. \u201cThis is insane.\u201d</p><p>Synjon\u2019s mouth twitched. He agreed with that assessment. Locked in. Did they not know what world he came from? What profession? The disaster he could create with just a twig and a firecracker? Petra\u2019s brothers had gotten lucky back at his flat in Manhattan. That wouldn\u2019t happen again.</p><p>\u201cBut if you need us, if you need anything,\u201d Dani continued, \u201cthere\u2019s a two-way radio in the bathroom. We\u2019ll be here in seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for this room,\u201d Sasha added, \u201cthere\u2019s sunlight all over the cabin. After you take what you need, leave him in here. He can\u2019t follow you. We\u2019ll be back to get you before the sun sets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me?\u201d Petra repeated, slightly panicked. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not staying here with him at night,\u201d Sasha said tightly. \u201cSoon as the sun goes down, he\u2019ll try to escape. Val and I will be here to make sure he doesn\u2019t. Although with what you\u2019ve become, I\u2019m pretty sure you could tame his vampire ass.\u201d</p><p>Synjon heard retreating footsteps, then Petra\u2019s voice outside the door. \u201cThis is crazy. We can\u2019t just take a member of the Eternal Breed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already did, Pets.\u201d</p><p>Synjon fought the instinct to crack a lid and see where he was and if anyone remained in the room. And he was glad he did. He heard a door close several feet away, then locks bolted into place, then after a few long moments, movement near the bed.</p><p>His entire body flared with warning.</p><p>The mattress dipped on his left side and the scent of something floral mixed with female sweat entered his nostrils. His cock stirred. He, however, did not. He felt a breeze move over his face, then warm breath and the tip of a nose against his neck.</p> <p>\u201cShould I tame your vampire ass, Synjon Wise?\u201d she whispered. \u201cOr just go straight for the jugular?\u201d</p><p>He moved with the speed and grace of a trained killer. He had her pinned beneath him in under five seconds. \u201cYou won\u2019t touch me, love. Unless I wish it.\u201d</p><p>Black hair spread out wild against the pillow, nostrils flared with contempt, arms trapped above her head and belly exposed, she stared murderously up at him. He\u2019d seen her only a week ago, in the dungeon of the mutore Erion. She\u2019d come to rescue her father, Cruen, soon to be caged and tortured, and had ended up hearing the terrible and undeniable truth about him. And she\u2019d felt Synjon\u2019s hatred, rage, contempt, and lust for vengeance. Then she\u2019d witnessed the Romans holding him down while her father took his emotions.</p><p>Syn\u2019s gaze moved over her. Taking in each feature, each change. She was physically extraordinary-looking. Far more beautiful, far more desirable than any of the other females he came in contact with. And the fact that she was in swell made her even more attractive. He wasn\u2019t sure why. He wasn\u2019t sure why his dick was so smitten, filling with blood, pressing against his zipper, trying to get at her.</p><p>Maybe his body was remembering their night together. Her mouth on his. His fangs inside her vein. Her skin smooth and hot under his palm. Her tight pussy squeezing his cock until his body refused the comfortable existence of control.</p><p>It was a memory he normally chose to ignore. But with her beneath him, with her scent wafting into his lungs, it couldn\u2019t be helped. Or stopped.</p><p>\u201cI was told you wouldn\u2019t come here even when you knew how bad off I was,\u201d she whispered, her eyes narrowed, her body shaking beneath his.</p><p>Syn\u2019s gaze rested on her upper lip and the tips of her fangs. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr how the life of this balas was in danger.\u201d</p><p>His gaze traveled down her neck and breasts to the rise of her belly.</p><p>\u201cYour balas,\u201d she added with a hiss.</p><p>That thing, that something strange he\u2019d felt before at the mention of the balas, moved through him once again. The physical sensation was almost like desire, but stronger. Without his consent, his hand reached for the base of her abdomen and remained there.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she said, a low growl ending the query as she shifted beneath him, trying to get free.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her because at that very moment, he felt something press against the center of his palm, then retreat. His brows drew together. What the bloody hell was that? He waited a few seconds for it to return, but when it didn\u2019t he moved his hand just a little to the right. His breath hitched, held in his lungs. He wanted it again. Whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d</p><p>Sudden, shocking pain accompanied her cry, and Synjon gasped, falling to the right, falling off her. For the second time in twenty-four hours, he saw stars. Foolish prat, he scolded himself, his cock screaming, heat shuddering in his groin. Paying more attention to the swell of this veana\u2019s belly than to planning your escape.</p><p>The breath completely yanked from his body, his balls on fire, Synjon coiled into himself and cursed. The pussy brothers and the hawk shifter were right; Petra had some serious strength. Far greater than any veana he\u2019d ever heard of or encountered. Was such a thing normal in swell? Or was she somehow different?</p><p>\u201cI would say sorry.\u201d She scooted off the bed. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a very good liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed, shaking off his pain, wondering if his dick was permanently scarred.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want you making any more babies, do we?\u201d</p><p>From his fetal position on the mattress, his gaze flipped up to find her. She stood just outside the door. In the hallway, where shafts of sunlight hit her neck and hair.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be held here,\u201d he told her through gritted teeth. \u201cBy you, your family. Even that hawk shifter who was only a few hours ago working her way into my bed.\u201d</p><p>Shock registered on her face. She paled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d he said evenly. Though he felt no emotion, he knew exactly how to extract it from others. Years of psych training in the military hadn\u2019t been bled out of him. \u201cYour small blond viper of a best mate, Dani?\u201d</p><p>Petra shook her head. \u201cShe was there helping my brothers. Helping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers came later, love.\u201d Recovered from the knee to the nuts now, Synjon pushed off the bed. He stood in the darkness, his eyes narrowed on the female who\u2019d nearly turned him into a eunuch. This was going to be far trickier than he had thought. Her strength was amazing, strange, and couldn\u2019t be matched. He would have to outwit her instead. An option that would take far more time and planning.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWhatever happened with Dani was just an act to get you off your guard, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she certainly fooled me. And I\u2019m not easily fooled.\u201d Synjon smiled coldly. \u201cMust\u2019ve been that black minidress, those come-shag-me heels, and the phrase \u2018Where would you like me?\u2019\u201d His gaze moved over Petra again. \u201cNo paven alive can refuse that.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s mouth thinned and she shook her head. \u201cYou really have no shame, no care, no feelings for anything, do you?\u201d</p><p>No. He did not.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis compliments of your father, love,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cNow, step aside.\u201d</p><p>Her expression changed to near amusement. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going? The sun\u2019s shining. It\u2019s day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still night in New York. I may get a bit singed on the departure, but nothing a few veanas can\u2019t take care of.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open and she just stared at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to step aside.\u201d His eyes locked with hers. \u201cI will only ask once.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall make you,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Petra took a breath, then released it as she moved into the very center of the doorway. \u201cMake me, Syn.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. It was a response he hadn\u2019t expected. It was illogical.</p><p>She continued, her tone filled with an almost feverish excitement. \u201cMake me get out of your way. I\u2019ve dreamed of it\u2014this clash\u2014and everything inside me is begging for it. I\u2019ve wanted to deny this new strength I possess. Or just not deal with it because I didn\u2019t understand its purpose, and shit, maybe it even frightened me a little. But I think it\u2019s the perfect time to see just how powerful I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe balas . . . ,\u201d he began slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t touch the balas.\u201d She grinned, her eyes flashing with heat. \u201cI won\u2019t allow it. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Again the strange sensation scratched at his insides, and again he forced it back. \u201cI will show no pity, love. As you know, it doesn\u2019t exist in me anymore.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, dropped into a fighting stance. \u201cTrust me, Syn. It never did.\u201d</p><p>He moved first. But Petra was only a second behind him. Fangs bared, blood surging in their veins, they collided in the center of the room: cold and lethal versus savage and ravenous.</p><p>4</p><p>Cruen stood where so many lesser beings had stood before him. Where he had called to them, pulled them into his reality, rejected them.</p><p>The Hollow of Shadows.</p><p>Under the spotlight of a full moon, Cruen wanted to sneer at his predicament. But the action and the emotion behind it would steal the minimal energy that remained inside him. And though he grew worse with each moment he breathed, he had to appear capable and highly functioning before Feeyan and the others. For now, for today, he would tell them his only issue was a glitch in his ability to flash, the reason most frustratingly undetermined. He remembered something similar happening to another member of the Order many years ago. He hoped at least seven of the ten members would recall it now.</p><p>The temperature around him dropped another five degrees, the cold gripping his bones, weakening them further. It was truly disgraceful. The once all-powerful, feared, and respected vampire reduced to this. Begging for entrance to the plane he had created. Begging for an audience before the table he used to rule. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn Synjon Wise for his trickery, his treachery. What was his reasoning for this? Why not keep him in Erion\u2019s dungeon? Why not just kill him outright?</p><p>An owl screeched overhead as Cruen walked toward the mouth of the cave. If he could just sit for a moment, find and collect his breath, save his strength. He wondered if Feeyan and the Order were ignoring him, his call. After all, they were a new, modern bunch now, and he had abandoned them for greater things. His self-serving agenda was common knowledge. And yet, even as he worked out the thought, he felt their almighty hand reaching for him, their strong and faithful energy wrap around him and pull. A weightless sensation moved through him as the Hollow of Shadows grew smaller and further away, while in his mind anger flared with the knowledge that even if he\u2019d wanted to, there was no turning back. Feeyan had the power now. She was great. She was the leader of the Order.</p><p>And he was only a shell of the paven he used to be.</p> <p>An even deeper, more bitter cold assaulted him as his feet hit compacted snow. At first Cruen was confused. Had the Order changed their reality\u2014his reality\u2014from sand to snow? Then, as Feeyan appeared at his side, tall and imperious, and the clouds parted before him to reveal several glorious white-capped mountains, he knew where he was and why.</p><p>\u201cIt is good of you to call, Cruen,\u201d Feeyan said, her eyes matching the snow that surrounded them, while her expression mirrored the cold. \u201cTo what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?\u201d</p><p>He matched her crisp tone. \u201cI was hoping for an audience with the Order.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cI am the Order.\u201d</p><p>It was like looking at himself only a few years ago. Ambitious, arrogant, secretive. He quite admired her in that moment. \u201cSo I\u2019m to have a private audience?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it best to start there,\u201d she said, studying him. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cruen hesitated, handpicking every word that was to come out of his mouth. His successor was a complex veana. Not unlike him, she went beyond the boundaries of the Order to further her agenda, seek power and alliances. He had counted on standing before the group of ten and stating his case, his concerns. Now, with just their leader, perhaps he needed to play this game a little differently.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d he began, the cold invading his bones, looking to weaken them further.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d she repeated disdainfully.</p><p>\u201cThe Eternal Breed,\u201d he said evenly, forcing calm, coolness into his expression. \u201cI come to you as a concerned Pureblood.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together in surprise, interest even. A small victory that gave Cruen the minute shot of mental adrenaline he needed to get attention, and action, for this lie he had conjured.</p> <p>\u201cA Pureblood looking for assistance,\u201d he added.</p><p>Her mouth curved into a dangerous, disbelieving smile. \u201cSince when do you need the Order\u2019s help for anything, Cruen? You are all-powerful, remember?\u201d</p><p>Yes. He remembered. And I will be back there again. As soon as I get to Synjon Wise. As soon as I dispose of this emotional disease inside me.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a personal issue,\u201d he said, his eyes locking with hers. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem for our kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat problem would that be? And why would you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps because I might be responsible for it.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent, her narrowed gaze moving over his face, searching his expression, his body language. Cruen knew the intimidation tactic she was using. It had been one of his favorites. He nearly grinned. She truly had been his best pupil.</p><p>\u201cResponsible how?\u201d she said at long last.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the most optimal route to Synjon Wise, this lie he was about to tell Feeyan. No doubt Celestine and Petra would be caught up in the coming madness. But he couldn\u2019t see any other way. He didn\u2019t have the power the job required.</p><p>\u201cIt all began when I was creating the Breeding Male,\u201d he said, his gaze shifting to the skiers on the mountainside. \u201cAs you know, I used not only the DNA of Pureblood vampires, but also that of demons\u2014\u201d</p><p>She hissed at his side. \u201cAnd animals. One sits on the Order. I must look at her every day. Despicable.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps, he wanted to snarl. But the \u201canimals\u201d and the demons had been the route to the Breeding Male they all revered so. He would agree that they were not on par with the vampire breed, but they were serviceable, respected for their blood and all that it offered.</p><p>He continued to stare out at the snow, imperiously, unfettered. He had never wanted to reveal this secret to the Order. Doing so meant his research would be open to others. With a heavy breath, he said, \u201cThe DNA samples were not from animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her voice was very low.</p><p>His lips tightened around his teeth. Perhaps this was a mistake. Perhaps he should\u2019ve come up with a different\u2014</p><p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>Cruen had no choice but to obey. His head came around fast and sharp, his vision momentarily blurred. In seconds, he caught her fearsome gaze, and knew his willing body had just revealed some of its weakness.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and she licked her lips, studying him. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t use animals,\u201d she said slowly, \u201chow do we have the mutore and Order member, Dillon?\u201d</p><p>The words, the revelation, hovered on the tip of his tongue. This was it. If he revealed them, their sheltered world, it was over. For them, and for him and his research. They would never grant him samples, test subjects, anything, ever again after this.</p><p>Feeyan was glaring at him with equal parts suspicion and gleeful curiosity. At his ear. Or lack thereof.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Cruen?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnimal bite?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>Synjon Wise.</p><p>Nearly debilitating shame drained Cruen of any scrap of concern he might have had for his relationship with the Rain Forest and its inhabitants. The paven who had tortured him, skillfully removing his ear before setting his skin to flame under the light of the sun, must be found. His emotions returned.</p><p>His life extinguished.</p><p>\u201cThere are shape-shifters in existence,\u201d he began, barely feeling the frigid air swirling around him. \u201cThey have a hidden world in the Rain Forest. They were once peaceful. Incapable of posing a threat to our kind.\u201d</p><p>Feeyan\u2019s eyes turned an emotionless stark white. For a second or two, she didn\u2019t speak. Then her fangs lowered and she spat out, \u201cAnd you kept this from us?\u201d</p><p>Of course he had. And he\u2019d have continued to do so if that hidden world didn\u2019t now contain Synjon Wise. \u201cI was trying to protect them. But they are no longer peaceful. They\u2019ve taken our own.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cTaken?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cPurebloods. A male, and a female in swell. The shifters keep them as prisoners.\u201d</p><p>Nostrils flared, Feeyan ingested this news. \u201cAbducting Pureblood vampires,\u201d she said thoughtfully. Deadly. She turned to face the mountain just as a group of thick gray clouds approached. \u201cWell, we cannot have that, can we? I rather prefer blood at mealtime, but I\u2019m willing to try a little raw meat in honor of the Eternal Breed.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Petra stood in a blinding-white patch of sunlight, panting, sweating, thrilled, hungry, irritated. Basically, too freaking close to being out of control for her liking.</p><p>Three feet away, taking up residence in the doorway of the dark bedroom, his stance cold and calculated, his sharp-angled face sporting a nasty burn near his left temple, was her adversary.</p><p>The one she\u2019d grabbed, clung to, pulled\u2014not to keep him out of the sun this time\u2014but to get him into it.</p><p>Her eyes moved over him, dark blue jeans that hung on narrow hips, wide, smooth, lean-muscled chest, broad shoulders, thick column of neck and a hard, set jaw. She lifted her gaze to connect with his iron stare. \u201cYou look a little afraid, Mr. Wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel fear, veana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. It\u2019s an emotion. I keep forgetting you\u2019re practically a machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am impressed, though,\u201d he said, the burn at his temple still smoking slightly.</p><p>\u201cMachines don\u2019t get impressed.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand to his temple, hissed as his fingers made tentative contact. \u201cAcknowledging skill, strength, and cunning in one\u2019s opponent is not an emotion, but an understanding, a reasoning of events.\u201d His brow lifted. \u201cDo you wonder why you\u2019re suddenly so powerful?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You, who wanted to know everything about your vampire self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore what?\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on her belly. \u201cBefore I had to survive, fight.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cNice battle scar, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my only one, I think.\u201d He took his hand from the burn. \u201cDay\u2019s still young and you look hungry.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth watered at his words, his suggestion. The struggle to keep him from bolting had only aggravated her hunger. Being near him now, scenting him, was torture on her system. And to think, just hours ago the thought of blood on her tongue, running down her throat, made her gag.</p><p>Of course, she hadn\u2019t been thinking about Synjon\u2019s blood then.</p><p>Her mouth twitched at both the irony of the situation and the emergence of her fangs.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d he said, leaning against the doorframe. \u201cYou wanted me here, Muscles. Now you have me. For a few hours at any rate.\u201d</p><p>A tidal wave of emotions, anger, and lust barreled through her. Needing his blood was one thing, but what he\u2019d just implied was another. She abandoned her sunlit patch and moved toward him. \u201cLet me make something very clear, Mr. Wise. I don\u2019t want you here.\u201d Confident in her strength, she came to stand within an inch of him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you at all.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but there was no true humor in his expression. \u201cYou\u2019re practically drooling as you stare at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth, let me see your fangs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>He pretended to be shocked. \u201cNot in front of the balas, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you care anything for the balas,\u201d she said through gritted teeth.</p> <p>A sudden gust of pain assaulted her then, and she shuddered and winced before reaching for the wall to steady herself. This was bad. This whole mess. He was right. The bastard. She was drooling. She wanted so desperately to control herself around him, but her body, and the balas inside her womb, knew what it wanted. And it would go to any lengths\u2014even the humiliation of its host\u2014to get it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d Syn said in a soft, calculated voice. \u201cYou want my blood? Take it.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flipped up to meet his. Just the words, the suggestion, the offer, pained her.</p><p>\u201cYou do want it?\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she glared at him, and her entire body shuddered with need. She hated the thought of blood in her mouth. But his blood . . . \u201cYes, I want it,\u201d she ground out. Shit, I crave it. I obsess over it. I lust for it.</p> <p>He leaned closer, whispered, \u201cWhy do you hesitate, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Mr. Wise, what I crave is toxic.\u201d Her top lip trembled. \u201cDespicable sludge. Poison.\u201d</p><p>Dark brows lifted above intrigued eyes. \u201cYou speak of my blood.\u201d</p><p>A grunt of sarcastic amusement came from her throat. \u201cThe paven\u2019s a genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with me, Petra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She recoiled. \u201cShit, no. Never!\u201d The thought made her sick. Or was it hunger and need raging inside her that twisted her empty belly? It was so hard to decipher what emotions coincided with what situations.</p> <p>\u201cThen why does it matter to you if my blood is moralistically toxic? It\u2019s not logical. If you need it, you take it.\u201d</p><p>Logic. Christ, logic had no place within her. Not now. Not this week surely. She couldn\u2019t reason that way. She drew on lust and pain and hunger and angst. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to take is you inside my body.\u201d</p><p>Syn\u2019s eyes shifted to her belly. \u201cToo late, love.\u201d</p><p>She hissed at him, and the balas moved and stretched against her skin. Automatically, she placed a hand there and started rubbing in slow, soothing circles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cOnly until the sun sets. Take it now while it\u2019s available to you.\u201d</p><p>Her fangs dropped completely, pressing against her lower lip. Gods, she hated this, hated her brothers and Dani for bringing him here, making her face him.</p><p>Want him.</p><p>This male who would\u2019ve killed her and her child if Cruen hadn\u2019t bled the desire out of him.</p> <p>She growled deep in her throat and gripped the wall tighter. No child should have a father like this one\u2014a father who didn\u2019t want them or care about them. After she brought this child into the world, after the madness inside her ceased to reign, she was going to make sure she gave her new little life a true family.</p><p>\u201cYour hesitation is foolish and a waste of time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe balas clearly wishes to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak of my child.\u201d She inhaled deeply, trying to control her hunger and a new wave of melancholy. \u201cIf it actually happens, this transaction of blood is between you and me. But first I want to know what it is you want.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted.</p><p>She sneered at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t work on empathy, Mr. Wise, or understanding or kindness, remember? So what is it you want?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared as he pulled in a deep breath. \u201cWhen the sun goes down . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let you leave?\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>His eyes filled with amusement and he laughed softly. \u201cEven with that glorious new strength you possess, you won\u2019t be able to stop me in the dark. But looking the other way, calling off the cats if they pose a problem.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat I will take.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, this paven before her. Someday her balas would ask about its father, and she would be forced to remember that Synjon Wise hadn\u2019t always been a heartless, emotionless shell. That in fact he\u2019d been generous and funny and irreverent and sexy as hell once upon a time. For the good of her balas, she would remember how close she\u2019d felt to him the night they\u2019d conceived. How he\u2019d asked her to come with him, promised to teach her, show her the world of the Eternal Breed.</p><p>And for the good of the balas, she would leave out the fact that he\u2019d wanted to kill not only Cruen but perhaps even Petra herself.</p><p>\u201cShall I make it easy on you, love?\u201d Syn said, cutting into her thoughts with the rusty blade of reality. \u201cOn the both of us?\u201d He brought his wrist to his lips, and with his eyes pinned to her, bit down. \u201cAfter all, I have guests coming at midnight.\u201d</p><p>The scent hit her like a tree branch to the face. Knocking her out, sending her to heaven. She could almost taste it on her tongue, luscious, sweet like nectar. And she was so thirsty.</p><p>She stared at his wrist. Thick, strong, and oozing that wondrous, yet toxic, blood. This would satiate her, calm her, feed her.</p><p>This would save her balas.</p><p>Never in her life had she wanted something as much as she wanted what flowed in slow, mouthwatering twin lines down his wrist.</p><p>She reached out, snatched his arm, and pulled it close. Fool or forager, she couldn\u2019t help herself. Her gaze narrowed on his forearm as her fangs dropped lower. Gods, she remembered how it felt to be bitten, to be drunk from. Sweet pain and intense pleasure. She didn\u2019t want to feel that again with him. She wanted no connection to this male who cared nothing for her and her child.</p><p>But unlike the paven himself, his blood was impossible to resist.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>When her fangs entered his vein, Synjon\u2019s breath caught in his throat. But when she began to suckle, taking his blood into her mouth, her fingernails digging into the back of his hand as she worked, he lost his breath completely.</p><p>He\u2019d fed others in the past, a simple, sometimes sensual contract. After all, it was the way of the vampire. But this . . . blood exiting his veins at a rapid pace, and what blood remained heading straight for his groin, making his cock stand at attention. Well, this was a problem.</p><p>One feed.</p><p>That was all he was giving her.</p><p>A soft, almost guttural groan escaped Petra\u2019s throat as she changed the angle of her draw, as she gripped him tighter. His wrist felt weak and wet, and irrepressible desire flooded him. Unfortunately for that moment, intense sexual desire hadn\u2019t been taken from his blood. Only his emotions, past and present. Only what Syn had allowed that piece of shite paven to take.</p><p>He sagged into the doorframe, his eyes drifting closed, the burn near his temple all but forgotten. This was trouble, what raged inside him. Perhaps more trouble than the desire to kill, to torture. He wanted to take her. Fuck her. Right now. Again. His fingers vibrated and his mouth filled with saliva. He saw it clearly playing out in his mind. He wanted to strip her naked, ease her to her hands and knees on the rug behind him. He wanted to look her over, see her round bottom lift toward him in anticipation\u2014see her juicy, pulsing sex. He wanted to position himself behind her, slide his cock to her entrance, then thrust deep, pressing against her womb as his hands gently cupped her belly.</p><p>The belly that housed, cradled, and protected the balas.</p><p>He pulled in air. This wasn\u2019t good. In fact, it was bloody madness. Considering the child inside Petra\u2019s womb as anything more than fact could ruin his plan. It was why he\u2019d stopped fighting midway through Cruen\u2019s bloodletting. He\u2019d seen a new path, a better way to exact his revenge.</p><p>And a bargaining chip in the form of a child could cost him that revenge.</p><p>A hiss escaped his lips and he opened his eyes to see her pull back from his vein, her lips delectably bloodstained. Just inches away, her gaze lifted to meet his and though Syn\u2019s instinct was to lean forward and clean his blood from her mouth, lap at the excess with his willing tongue, he held himself in check. Not just because any further intimacy between them would be foolish and would weaken his resolve, but because there was something glistening in her eyes that intrigued him. Concerned him.</p><p>Calm, calculated ice-blue fire.</p><p>\u201cThe balas likes your blood.\u201d Her tone was as cool as her stare, and in one swift movement she brought his hand to her belly. \u201cFeel. If you can.\u201d</p><p>The sensation lasted only a second\u2014from inside her body, through her skin and into his palm\u2014but Syn could not deny its impact.</p><p>Was that a shock of emotion?</p><p>From a small, satiated being?</p><p>He ripped his hand from Petra\u2019s belly and stated flatly, \u201cWe\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>Petra didn\u2019t move. In fact, she was so still, it was almost eerie. Then she grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Blood stained her teeth. \u201cI think we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>Euphoria had claimed Petra. She leaned back against the doorframe and sighed.</p><p>After months of insecurity and fear, and a week of utter insanity and raging hunger, she could finally breathe without pain and sadness, move without tears.</p><p>\u201cI want more,\u201d she uttered, her eyelids lifting to find Synjon several feet away, deep in the bedroom, nearly plunged in darkness except for his arm, the one that had just fed her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had enough,\u201d he said, his tone even but resolute.</p><p>Petra barely heard him. She couldn\u2019t stop staring at his wrist, illuminated by the sunshine at her back, and the gaping twin wounds that called to her like a lover. The anger and emotional pain had subsided, but now something new and strange had taken its place.</p><p>Possessiveness. Over his blood.</p><p>No.</p><p>My blood now.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it could be like that, taste like that,\u201d she said, sounding deliciously drugged even to her own ears. \u201cI must have more.\u201d</p><p>Synjon pulled his wrist from the light. \u201cGreedy veanas don\u2019t prosper, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd selfish paven must pay for their mistakes,\u201d she returned.</p><p>\u201cAre you calling your balas a mistake?\u201d</p><p>She grinned, feeling absolutely no anger. Only calm seas and ocean breezes. He was trying to bait her into rejecting him. And that may have worked a few minutes ago. But times had changed. She could never reject him now. Even with all she knew about him, all she\u2019d experienced. He had the blood. He had what she craved, the magic elixir that could keep her sane and satiated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head drowsily. \u201cNo, Mr. Wise. The only mistake I made was pulling you into that cave, saving your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn that we can agree,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Like the cat she\u2019d always wished she could be, Petra slid away from the doorway and stalked into the room. Her insides completely relaxed, she moved toward Syn until she could see him clearly, until her eyes adjusted to the dim light. He stood beside the bed, feet apart, arms at his sides, ready to spring, his eyes narrowed. She couldn\u2019t help herself. Her gaze followed the ridges of muscle in his abdomen up to both the hard planes of his chest and the well-sculpted breadth of his shoulders until she reached what truly interested her. What made her mouth water. What made a guttural moan of need escape her lips.</p> <p>His neck.</p><p>And the long, thick line of pulsing vein beneath.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me, Synjon,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou owe us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you the blood you require.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cTrue. You gave me blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her lips twitching into another satisfied smile.</p><p>\u201cYou will break our bargain, then?\u201d he asked, every muscle in his extraordinary body tensing.</p><p>\u201cMy loyalty is here.\u201d She stopped before him and placed her hand on her belly. \u201cWill always be here.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped and his nostrils flared. \u201cI suppose I cannot fault you for that.\u201d</p><p>His vein called to her. A siren song she could never refuse. Didn\u2019t want to refuse. Saliva filled her mouth in anticipation. She would feed again. Soon. \u201cUntil the balas is born, you will remain here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs your prisoner?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lifted to meet his. \u201cNo. As our food source.\u201d</p><p>Though his expression was as calm as the river outside, something flashed in his gaze. But it was gone in an instant. He shook his head slowly. \u201cI won\u2019t allow it, love. I cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Breaking into a broad grin, she turned and walked away, out of the room, down the hall, and into the sunlight, feeling\u2014for the first time in months\u2014fucking fantastic.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The moon was obstructed by heavy clouds as Phane landed on his perch on the roof of the warehouse in SoHo. It had taken several months, but he\u2019d built the thing himself. Not your ordinary two-by-two redwood block, the massive perch was erected out of steel and sported a feeding station, an all-weather leather nest, and a high-tech sound system. Nearly fifteen feet in the air, it overlooked the city, and the long, heated swimming pool that was Helo\u2019s sanctuary.</p><p>Still in his hawk form, Phane blinked, his beak twitching as he watched the water beast move back and forth along the brightly lit bottom. They had created a world for themselves here. He and Helo and Ly. An existence. Granted, it wasn\u2019t perfect, but at least it was on their terms, and that was all that mattered in the end.</p><p>As if his thoughts had summoned the lone wolf, the roof door burst open, and the large, shaggy gray male stalked out. His eyes trained on the water, he went directly for the pool, then when he reached the edge, tilted his head back and howled.</p> <p>The sound was purposeful, and caused Phane to screech in return, his feathers rustling. In seconds, he broke from his perch, and took off. He didn\u2019t bother circling, trying for a gentle landing. He dove low and quick, touching down a little too roughly near an unlit torch just as Helo emerged from the steaming water. They all shifted at once in the cold night air.</p><p>\u201cButton up, Beasts,\u201d Lycos said, grabbing a pair of jeans off one of the deck chairs and yanking them on. \u201cWe\u2019ve got company.\u201d</p><p>Helo followed suit, pulling on his own dark blue denim. \u201cIs that what your howl was about, Ly? Are we having a party tonight? I could use some female company, but that call of the wild you just released is supposed to be reserved for dire circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is dire,\u201d Lycos said. \u201cIn my opinion anyway.\u201d</p><p>Helo snorted.</p><p>\u201cAnd there will be females, yes,\u201d Lycos added with a smirk. \u201cBut they\u2019ll all be mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s the point of that?\u201d Helo said, turning to Phane as the door to the roof opened once again.</p><p>\u201cGotta love family,\u201d Dillon said, walking out onto the deck. The jaguar shifter and new Order member was followed by her mate, Gray, and most of the Roman clan. \u201cThey really know how to make a person feel loved,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d Helo said with a disappointed chuckle.</p><p>Snarling halfheartedly at the water beast, Gray pulled out a chair for Dillon to sit in. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. Later on tonight I\u2019ll make you feel real loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Lucian, who was the last to enter the rooftop oasis. \u201cLet\u2019s not start down that road. I might lose my dinner.\u201d</p><p>His mate, Bronwyn, welcomed him on the chaise where she was already seated, then cuddled up next to him. \u201cYou used to be such a romantic, Luca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Nicholas agreed with a wide grin as he stood behind his mate, Kate. \u201cSweet, romantic, lovable Luca.\u201d</p><p>While Kate bit her lip to keep from laughing, Lucian flashed his fangs at his older brother. \u201cYou. Shut it.\u201d Then he turned back to Bronwyn. \u201cAnd you, my beautiful raven-haired vixen,\u201d he said in a far gentler tone, nuzzling her neck. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you like all that sappy shit. When I know the truth. When I know exactly what you prefer.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in then and whispered something in Bron\u2019s ear. Instantly she gasped, her cheeks turning bright red. Bringing a hand to his mouth, she tried to silence him, but Lucian only growled playfully and nibbled at her fingers. Pulling her hand free, Bronwyn broke out into a fit of laughter.</p><p>Phane watched the entire display, his gut aching. He turned away from them and focused on Helo and Lycos. This was becoming too familiar. This jealousy, this growing need for a mate of his own. He wanted what his Roman brothers had. What his Beast brother, Erion, had. Shit, he would even go into Hell and remain if it meant he had a chance of finding someone like Hellen or Bron or Sara or Kate.</p><p>His gaze moved back to the family, to Dillon in particular. His half sister, the one who had also been headed for the Dumpster when Cruen had decided to rescue them, adopt them. Use them. She was eyeing her own mate, the Impure male Gray, but not with flirtatious abandon. Instead, the female mutore looked thoughtful, concerned even. Phane crossed his arms over his naked chest and waited for whatever was to come. Because clearly this wasn\u2019t a social call, no matter how much the couples were using it as one.</p><p>\u201cDillon?\u201d He said her name softly, but firmly.</p><p>She looked up, found his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked her, his voice carrying above the small crowd, snagging their attention.</p><p>When all conversation had ceased and all eyes were on D, she puffed out her cheeks and blew a weighty breath that caught in the cool night air.</p><p>\u201cWe have a slight problem,\u201d she began. \u201cUnfortunately or fortunately because of my illustrious and very unwanted position on the Order\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get it, baby,\u201d Gray said, giving her a smile and a squeeze on her shoulders, trying to ease her tension. \u201cYou have a love/hate thing going on with those Pureblood bastards.\u201d</p><p>She turned and glared at him. \u201cYeah, laugh it up. It should\u2019ve been you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue that,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMouth closed over here.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and turned back to the group. \u201cAnyway. The Order has learned about the shifter community where Sara\u2019s sister and her adopted family live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit . . . ,\u201d Helo muttered. The Order had only recently found out about the trip into Hell, and the origin of Erion\u2019s mutore side. What would their reaction be to another group who\u2019d had influence over their vampire blood?</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Phane asked, drawing closer.</p><p>\u201cFeeyan informed us,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she found out. But that\u2019s not the problem. Well, not the biggest part of the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Helo asked.</p><p>Lycos sneered. \u201cAre the big, blustering vampires scared of the wee animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Order can\u2019t see the shifters as a threat to the Eternal Breed,\u201d Phane said, wondering where this was all going. \u201cNot like the mutore were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre,\u201d Lycos corrected, his tone dripping with ire. \u201cMutore will never be accepted by the Purebloods even if one happens to be on the Order.\u201d</p><p>Dillon turned her gaze on him, but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cThe shifters have kept to themselves forever,\u201d Helo said, remaining close to the water. \u201cThey\u2019re peaceful beings. It was Cruen\u2019s interference that started this, taking their DNA, using it to make a more perfect specimen of vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow she knows where the mutore came from,\u201d Lycos said. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t a threat to their perfectly pure blood I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the blood,\u201d Dillon said at last. \u201cAt least not yet. Feeyan believes the shifters aren\u2019t so peaceful after all. In fact, she believes they\u2019re holding Pureblood vampires against their will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Petra?\u201d Phane said. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Seated beside Alexander, a very pregnant Sara nodded. \u201cOf course it is. Petra wants to be there. Her family\u201d\u2014she paused for a few seconds\u2014\u201cthe family she grew up with, at any rate, is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know this?\u201d Helo asked Dillon. \u201cDo they know the truth of the situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dillon took a deep breath, shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to know the connection between Petra and our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lycos asked coldly. \u201cWhat is there to hide besides her asshole of a father, and how he conned Celestine, a desperate veana, into screwing over her mate and fucking him instead?\u201d</p><p>A low growl rumbled in Alexander\u2019s throat, but Sara put her hand on his arm to quiet him. She looked at Lycos, her eyes steady, her voice clear. \u201cMy mother made a mistake, a grave mistake, going to Cruen for help. She\u2019s paying for it. We\u2019re all paying for it. But the Order isn\u2019t going to profit from it. Do you understand?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The female held the wolf shifter\u2019s narrowed gaze, her chin lifted. Sara was a tough female, and loyal above all else. She took no shit, and every male gathered around the pool thought twice when going head to head with her. Even Lycos. Growling, he nodded and turned away.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go to the Rain Forest,\u201d Nicholas said, breaking the tension with a call for action. \u201cWe need to speak with the shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we explain things to Petra,\u201d Helo suggested. \u201cShe can come here. At least for a while. Until the Order understands that she\u2019s not being held captive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProblem is, it\u2019s not just Petra,\u201d Nicholas said tightly.</p><p>Phane\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>It was Gray who spoke this time. \u201cIt seems one of our elite Purebloods was abducted from his home and taken there by shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Helo and Phane said at the same time.</p><p>Lycos growled. \u201cSyn, right?\u201d</p> <p>Lucian turned and glared at him. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>The wolf shifter rolled his eyes. \u201cYou three couldn\u2019t get that British bastard to go help poor little Petra, so a few of her loyal family members did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool it, Lycos,\u201d Alexander warned, his eyes dimming with irritation as he pulled his pregnant mate closer.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s Synjon,\u201d Dillon confirmed. \u201cAnd the Order is demanding his release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want from us?\u201d Lycos asked, his jaw twitching with tension.</p><p>\u201cYou know what they want,\u201d Phane said without looking at the male. \u201cWe\u2019re part shifter. We should go. The community might take it better coming from their own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not their own,\u201d Lycos said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is up your ass today, Ly?\u201d Helo asked with irritation. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Lycos said, pulling off his jeans. \u201cJust opting out of the visit to the homeland, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Once naked, the male shifted, his wolf springing forth easily. The powerful animal snarled at them all, his eyes snapping with irritation, his gray pelt bristling. Then he took off past them, disappearing inside the house.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need Ly. I\u2019ll go,\u201d Helo said, then turned to Phane. \u201cIt\u2019s a helluva lot warmer there, and I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing where we began. What about you, Phane?\u201d</p><p>Phane didn\u2019t say anything at first. He wasn\u2019t siding with Lycos, abandoning the whole mess, but he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted any part of where his cells originated. The idea filled him with unease. Then again, how could he refuse his family? Their call for help? And, truly, that\u2019s what the Romans were to him now.</p><p>Family.</p><p>He turned to Dillon, lifted one sharp eyebrow. \u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He listened to the water running as she showered.</p><p>Then waited when it shut off.</p><p>He listened closely for the sounds of cotton brushing wet, heated skin.</p><p>Then abandoned the bedroom when the door to the bathroom silently crept open to reveal five and a half feet of naked female.</p><p>Now, Synjon stood just a millimeter outside the patch of sunlight that had burned him not long ago, the patch Petra had once occupied, with his narrowed gaze taking in every bit of perfect flesh he could manage to see through the open doorway down the hall.</p><p>Unable to stop himself, he moved his gaze over her, pink and smooth and lush as she stood near the small bathroom window, gazing out, towel in hand. Her long legs gave way to a tight, round ass, and her beautiful belly was the perfect complement to large, heavy breasts with puckered, succulent, rosy nipples. Swell agreed with her. So did his blood. It was a good thing he had no emotional feeling\u2014a brilliant move by all parties involved\u2014or the sight before him, coupled with the recent memory of her fangs inside him, might have caused him to reconsider his plot to torture and kill her father.</p><p>And that long-held goal would be met at all costs.</p><p>She eased the towel between her legs and patted her inner thighs and her sex. His tongue felt dry in his mouth. He knew just where he could wet it.</p><p>Behind the zipper of his jeans, his cock was straining and pulsing, begging to get free\u2014to get at her.</p><p>Never going to happen, prat. You\u2019ve been there once before, remember? It\u2019s a terribly addictive place to be.</p><p>As soon as the sun sank, as soon as the sky turned from lavender to gray, he\u2019d be off, past the pussy brothers and that witch of a hawk shifter, and back to his penthouse balcony. An emotionless paven seated behind his white and black keys waiting for fate to find him.</p><p>\u201cAdmiring your handiwork or cursing it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up, caught that pale blue stare. \u201cNeither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She wrapped the towel around herself. \u201cIt would take an actual working heart to feel one or both of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you don\u2019t have a working heart either, right?\u201d</p><p>Decently covered by the long white towel, she left the bathroom and walked through the living area toward him. \u201cI may not have blood pumping through that particular muscle, but I have and give and show the true meaning of the word. Goodness, kindness, thoughtfulness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She came to stand in the patch of sunlight in the hall, her skin pink and glowing. \u201cWhat do you remember? Me pulling you into that cave? Feeding you? Taking care\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember the night we created the balas.\u201d The words weren\u2019t said in a soft, sentimental, romantic tone. It was only fact. Though he wasn\u2019t sure why he would bring up such a fact.</p><p>Petra\u2019s eyes were shuttered as she stared at him. Perhaps she didn\u2019t like it when he spoke of the child. Or perhaps it was about sex. The memory of the two of them together. He couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI also remember waking up to an empty tree house,\u201d he added. Once again, fact.</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly be looking for sympathy.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated in answering. Was he? He didn\u2019t think so. But there was something about the memory that poked and prodded at that dead muscle behind his ribs. \u201cI told you who I planned to kill and you ran away to warn him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course I did. He\u2019s my father.\u201d And with that, she walked past him into the bedroom.</p><p>He turned and watched her. Watched as she pulled out a drawer and dug through a stack of clothing.</p><p>\u201cHow do you call that paven, that monster, torturer, and wreaker of havoc, \u2018Father\u2019?\u201d he asked evenly.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what he\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you call me, then?\u201d</p><p>She froze, her hand deep within the drawer, her wrist covered in denim. For a moment she just stared straight ahead, breathed in and out.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you tell the balas I am?\u201d Syn continued, unemotional but oddly curious.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m a cock-up without feeling, but Cruen is a good and worthy parent? Is that what you\u2019re going to say, Petra?\u201d</p><p>Finally she released a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say. I don\u2019t know what Cruen is. I never got the chance to know.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder at him, her eyes stormy. \u201cBut I do know this: I won\u2019t let my child go through anguish and pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Syn asked, walking over to the dresser.</p><p>She grabbed a pair of jeans and a blue tank, then turned to face him. \u201cThe child won\u2019t even know about you, Syn.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together and he looked down, at her swell.</p><p>\u201cThis balas will have someone else to call Father. Someone who knows how to love. Someone who wants a family, wants . . . us.\u201d</p><p>His breath caught in his lungs and his eyes returned to hers.</p><p>\u201cFeeling something now?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure. He wasn\u2019t sure what was happening inside him. It seemed that even though his emotions were no longer there to access, his physical body was throwing off some serious sensations. His mind told him there was nothing here to care about, no anger, no sadness, no love. Her words were only that. Letters, syllables strewn together, her version of facts. But his hands weren\u2019t acting right. They were clenched into fists at his sides, and his gut was pulled in uncomfortably tight.</p><p>What was this? What was happening to him?</p><p>\u201cPets!\u201d</p><p>Both Synjon and Petra turned toward the door, expecting to find someone in the hall. But no one stood there.</p><p>\u201cPetra?\u201d called the female voice again.</p><p>They both went to the door, stared out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cCome pick up the two-way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d Syn said. But Petra was already out of the room, running down the hall and through the living area.</p><p>When she reached the bathroom, there were a few minor crashes before Synjon heard her speak.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, then paused a moment before explaining, \u201cI was taking a shower.\u201d There was another pause. Longer this time. \u201cNo, he\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. We\u2019re getting along splendidly and he never wants to leave\u2014\u201d She was cut off. Synjon stood in the doorway, straining to hear. Maybe there was something he could use later. Something about the brothers or the hawk female. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, her tone different, quiet now. \u201cWhy? Oh. Okay, fine. Yeah, I\u2019ll come. But I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>For several long seconds the only sound was the river trees gently scraping the exterior of the house. Synjon wondered if Petra was still listening on the two-way.</p><p>When a good minute had passed, he called out to her. \u201cProblem, love?\u201d</p><p>Supreme quiet met his query, then a sigh and, \u201cThe Romans are here.\u201d</p><p>Syn\u2019s skin hummed with tension. \u201cFor you or for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. But either way they\u2019re going to be leaving this place alone and unhappy.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she closed the bathroom door. Completely and forcefully this time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>6</p><p>\u201cYou drank from him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Dani called over her thickly feathered shoulder to Petra as they flew past a stand of teak that housed three of the Avian\u2019s twenty-two nesting grounds.</p><p>Avoiding her best friend\u2019s massive wings, Petra leaned forward and wrapped her arms around the hawk\u2019s neck. \u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I hope you drained him dry. I hope he could barely breathe. I hope he was coughing and sputtering and losing consciousness\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, Dani,\u201d she shouted over the wind. \u201cYou want him to suffer.\u201d</p><p>Dani glanced back, her hawk eyes flashing with ire. \u201cDid he tell you how close he came to having sex with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you told me, remember?\u201d Petra returned.</p><p>\u201cOf course, for me,\u201d Dani went on, \u201cit was all part of the act. We needed to get him alone, get him as vulnerable as possible. He\u2019s a total manwhore, and last night I made sure he chose me.\u201d</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t a subject Petra felt all that comfortable with. Especially a second time. And yet she couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself from asking, \u201cSo, if Sasha and Val were late or hadn\u2019t shown up, were you actually going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck him?\u201d Dani called back, sounding appalled before she actually snorted. \u201cHell to the no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like a fate worse than death, Dani. The guy\u2019s incredibly hot. And the things he can do . . .\u201d What the hell am I saying? She shook her head. It felt like someone else was running her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about his magic tongue,\u201d Dani shouted.</p><p>Heat flared in Petra\u2019s cheeks. \u201cYou can stop now.\u201d</p><p>Dani laughed. \u201cFine, then. His magic penis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Petra said, completely mortified now. \u201cI think we should play the quiet game. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d And just to send that message home, Dani dive-bombed into the forest, pulled up right before they would have hit the ground, and then started serpentining through the trees.</p><p>Petra gripped the hawk\u2019s feathers, her mouth dry as she panted with fear. \u201cThat was unnecessary,\u201d she called through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Dani called back. \u201cYou need your brain shaken up, reworked. You\u2019re talking about this guy being all hot and everything, and all I can think is he screwed my best friend, got her preggers, and couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d</p><p>Petra winced. Her best friend\u2019s words cut deep. As they were meant to. \u201cYou know my father took away his emotions. He couldn\u2019t feel a thing now even if he wanted to.\u201d</p><p>The hawk made an irritated sound. \u201cAre you seriously defending him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t. That would be insane. That would make her foolish and optimistic, and worse yet, a glutton for punishment.</p><p>\u201cYou totally are,\u201d Dani returned. \u201cPlease tell me that blood you took from him didn\u2019t shatter the reality of the here and now, and his major dickhood.\u201d</p> <p>Jeez. Sometimes Dani could be a major pain in the ass. \u201cRest assured I haven\u2019t suddenly become blind to reality. But his blood did calm me down. Made me able to think and feel, without pain and depression along for the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . I suppose I am glad of that.\u201d Dani was quiet for a moment. Then, \u201cYou think he\u2019ll try to escape?\u201d</p><p>Absofreakinglutely. \u201cHe tried once already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dani cried, dropping about eight feet, making Petra\u2019s gut fly up into her throat.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Dani! Pregnant back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She quickly leveled out.</p><p>\u201cHe got burned, okay? Stepped right into the sun, trying to get past me. Didn\u2019t work out very well. Skin started smoking and all that.\u201d</p><p>Dani snorted. \u201cNice. Wish I could\u2019ve seen that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere. Val and Sasha are standing guard inside the cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hope he doesn\u2019t go, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Then she sighed. \u201cOh, Dani, my love, he has the blood.\u201d</p><p>Dani\u2019s hawk made a screeching sound at that, then started circling the waterfall below and the gathering stones beside it. The stones that marked their borders, and that welcomed all outsiders to their world. \u201cAll right, vamp girl,\u201d she called back. \u201cBefore we land, I really need you to repeat after me.\u201d</p><p>Petra rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. Hate. Synjon. Wise.\u201d</p><p>Petra laughed. \u201cFine. Simple enough.\u201d She raised her voice to the wind. \u201cI hate Synjon Wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely convincing,\u201d Dani drawled. \u201cAnd this too: I will never let him touch me again.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s laughter petered out. Now that one wasn\u2019t so simple, and Petra didn\u2019t want to even look into why that might be. She\u2019d had enough worrisome admissions today.</p><p>Dani squawked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re hesitating. You shouldn\u2019t be hesitating. Hesitating will get you into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Dani. Look at me. I\u2019m already in trouble. Seven months\u2019 worth.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd I kinda have to touch him if I\u2019m taking his blood.\u201d</p><p>Dani glanced over one feathered shoulder. \u201cYeah, but he doesn\u2019t have to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook out! The tree!\u201d Petra called, pointing ahead. \u201cJeez. Come on, Dani, focus. Mom and baby don\u2019t have the ironclad shifter belly.\u201d</p><p>Smooth and easy, Dani banked around the massive tree, then came in for a landing just outside the rock wall of the gathering stones. Petra slid off her back, spotting her mother already seated beside Sara on several small, flat boulders in the center of the stones. Petra\u2019s blood sister. She still couldn\u2019t get used to that concept. Neither of them had noticed her yet. They were deep in conversation, and for one second Petra felt a splash of jealousy move through her. Sara already had one mother. She didn\u2019t need Petra\u2019s too.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bestie,\u201d Dani called out to her.</p><p>Petra stopped, realized she\u2019d been walking toward her mother and Sara, and glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>Dani\u2019s hawk eyes narrowed. \u201cYou never repeated that last bit.\u201d</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI will never let him touch me again,\u201d Dani urged.</p><p>Petra gave the hawk a quick grin. \u201cThanks for the ride, Bestie. I owe you.\u201d Then she made her way toward the gathering stones and the family she barely knew.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Phane couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the female hawk. He stood on the very top of the highest rock within the gathering stones and stared. Every member of his family that could handle sunlight\u2014except Ly, of course, who had once again refused to come\u2014was seated and waiting a few feet below him. Like Helo, Phane had also been curious about the Rain Forest and its creatures. After living all of his life among vampires, Phane had wanted to know about that other part of himself. The one that had never been discussed or revealed. But in all that time\u2014hell, even back at the house in SoHo\u2014he\u2019d never contemplated another being like himself.</p><p>He felt his hawk scratch inside his skin as he watched the female shift from avian form to human. In the air, gliding, swooping, touching down, she\u2019d been fucking magnificent. But on land, in her female form . . . Shit, he\u2019d never seen anything or anyone so hot. She was the perfect height, not too tall, not too short. Her body was a mix of athletic strength and dangerous, supple curves. Her blond hair was cut in a short and sexy style that accentuated her beautiful, sharp-as-shit face, and mysterious black eyes and a ripe mouth that she seemed to work well and often. But it was the piercing\u2014the small ring through her nose\u2014that made Phane\u2019s entire body erupt in possessive desire.</p><p>He wanted to lick it, run his fangs over it.</p><p>Maybe while she bit his neck.</p><p>His cock strained against the zipper of his jeans. Then went steel hard as before his very eyes the last shreds of hawk feathers disappeared and she was completely and totally nude. His obvious, lecherous gaze raked over her spectacular body just seconds before she slipped on a thin electric blue dress.</p><p>She\u2019d been naked. In front of anyone who cared to look\u2014and Phane was pretty damn sure there were many who wanted to look\u2014and she didn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>That was his kind of female.</p><p>Fuck, he might be in love with her already.</p><p>He thought about shifting into his hawk and gliding down to stand beside her. He needed to stake his claim, let her know he planned on mating with her. Not today. Not unless she agreed to it, of course. But soon.</p><p>Unfortunately, the dark-haired veana who looked so similar to Alexander\u2019s Sara stepped into the center of the stones at precisely that moment, drawing everyone\u2019s attention. Phane knew the female was in swell, but he hadn\u2019t realized how far along she was. Five, maybe six months. She looked good though, healthy, her face and eyes bright\u2014far better than when he had seen her last.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you all come?\u201d she asked the small crowd of Petra\u2019s mother, the Roman females, Helo, Phane, and Dillon.</p><p>The last was the first to speak. \u201cThis land, Petra, your existence\u2014it has all been a closely guarded secret for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry forever,\u201d said the hawk shifter female, who stood in the shadows of a massive boulder, just a few feet behind Petra.</p><p>Damn, she was tough. Phane liked tough.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dillon amended. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a secret no longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you speak of more than yourselves?\u201d asked Petra\u2019s mother, Wen, who sat beside Sara.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans?\u201d Wen asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cOur kind. Vampires.\u201d</p><p>Wen looked momentarily relieved. \u201cDidn\u2019t they already know? With Cruen as their leader . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe held this secret pretty damn close to the vest,\u201d Dillon explained. \u201cHe didn\u2019t share anything about you with the vampire community, and he told you nothing about us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo is that the only reason you\u2019re here?\u201d Petra asked. \u201cTo let us know about this development?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wish,\u201d Sara said tightly, her eyes locking with her half sister\u2019s. \u201cThey know Pureblood vampires are here. They think they\u2019re being held against their will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Dillon ran her hand over the smooth surface of the rock. \u201cAnd by this new species they\u2019ve just heard about. The head of the Order, Feeyan, is running on paranoia and nerves, if you get my meaning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not here against my will,\u201d Petra informed her, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to tell them that. Anytime they want to come here to the gathering rocks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to go to them, Petra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving the Rain Forest. Not until the balas is born.\u201d</p><p>Dillon sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them to come here. You don\u2019t want us\u2014the Order\u2014involved in your world. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>As the forest winds blew around them, Petra seemed to consider this. \u201cIf I go to them, tell them the truth, that I\u2019m a free and independent being and I wish to remain here, can you guarantee that they\u2019ll not only accept what I say but allow me to return?\u201d</p> <p>The wind died, and everything, everyone, within the gathering rocks grew still, eerily quiet as Dillon pondered this. The mutore female looked like she\u2019d rather be anywhere else, and dealing with something far less problematic.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything,\u201d she said finally, her tone unabashedly melancholy. \u201cNot when it comes to the Order.\u201d</p><p>Petra put her hands up in a defensive posture. \u201cThen I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>As the female hawk shifter broke from the shadows and came up alongside Petra in a blatant show of support, Phane dropped down from one rock to the next until he stood just inside the flat, grassy oval where the pair was.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the problem.\u201d It was Kate who spoke this time. Nicholas\u2019s mate had been pretty quiet lately, keeping to herself since her nephew, Ladd, had gone to the Underworld to live with his father, Erion, and his father\u2019s mate, Hellen. Everyone knew how hard the move had been on the veana, and it was good to hear her sharp, steady voice again. \u201cIf the Order comes here to see you, they\u2019re going to want to see and question the other vampire who\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s lips formed a thin line and her face paled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat other vampire?\u201d said the female hawk shifter with a sneer.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t skirt around this anymore,\u201d Kate continued. \u201cIs Synjon here, Petra?\u201d</p><p>Petra was silent, but Phane noticed her hands had gone to her belly. The hawk female\u2019s eyes narrowed on Kate. Damn, she was fierce. He wanted her eyes on him like that.</p><p>\u201cIs he here against his will?\u201d Kate asked, her gaze unmoving as she sought Petra\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer them, Pets,\u201d said the hawk shifter. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer to anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Petra couldn\u2019t be quelled. \u201cThe baby needs him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPets!\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s okay, Dani.\u201d With a slow exhale, she walked forward, toward Dillon and the small crowd seated on the rocks behind her.</p> <p>Dani. So that was the female shifter\u2019s name. Hot damn, Phane mused, wanting to try it out on his tongue but knowing he had to use only his mind for now.</p><p>Dani.</p><p>He liked it. He liked it a lot. And so did his hawk.</p><p>\u201cI sympathize with what you\u2019re saying, Petra,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cI know what Synjon\u2019s put you through, what a complete and total shithead he\u2019s been over the past week. I was the one who told Alex, Nicky, and Luca to get into that penthouse of his and talk some sense into him. But right now, I speak for the motherfucking Order\u2014not my favorite thing to do, mind you\u2014but there it is. They won\u2019t rest on this until they have the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, veana.\u201d It was Helo who spoke, his gaze on Petra, his voice calm. \u201cLet us speak to Synjon. If he\u2019s cool with being here, all he has to do is tell the Order that and we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Petra turned her attention to the water beast and sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s not cool with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Dillon muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou need to let him go, Petra,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen at least let Helo or Phane speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Kate turned to Sara. \u201cPlease talk to her. You\u2019re her family. Her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd say what?\u201d Sara asked, her tone very different from that of the rest of them. It was coarse and strained. \u201c\u2018Let your baby suffer, die because his emotionless father wants to go back to his fuckpad and party\u2019?\u201d Sara looked around at her family, who were all staring wide-eyed at her. \u201cIf Alexander was acting like this, if I needed his blood, and my baby was at risk, would any of you ask me to hand him over?\u201d</p><p>Kate fell silent. Dillon and Helo too.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s settled,\u201d said the hawk shifter. \u201cThe asshole isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Phane turned to regard her. Tough, tantalizing, she completely fascinated him, and he didn\u2019t want to leave. Syn was one lucky male. How could he get Dani the hawk shifter to take him \u201cagainst his will,\u201d show him the nest she was going to keep him in? Feed from him anytime she chose?</p><p>\u201cYou understand,\u201d Dillon said over Phane\u2019s pornographic daydream. \u201cIf he\u2019s not either released or telling the Order that he stays here of his own free will, the entire ruling vampire force might descend on your private world.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s jaw was tight and her eyes were strained. She glanced at her mother. The one who\u2019d raised her. Wanted her.</p><p>Wen gave her a broad smile. \u201cLet them come!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble shit,\u201d Dillon muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Dani called out. \u201cWe\u2019ll protect Petra and this child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would protect a vampire?\u201d Phane said, addressing her outright for the first time.</p><p>The female hawk shifter, the hot little blond bird with metal in her nose, turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cIncurring the wrath of the Eternal Order?\u201d he continued.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she moved her gaze up and down his body, pausing for only a second when she spied the bulge between his legs that he couldn\u2019t conceal, or refused to conceal\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure which. \u201cWe always protect our own, bloodsucker. And Petra\u2019s our family.\u201d</p><p>The bulge quickly upgraded to steel. \u201cYou may have to fight.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and the megawatt heat that smile put out nearly sent Phane to his knees. \u201cNothing I enjoy more than a good dirty fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a good clean fight,\u201d Phane corrected.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d With one last look in his direction, she turned back to the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate the warning,\u201d Wen said to them all. \u201cIf they come we\u2019ll deal with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Petra asked the older female. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bring a problem here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bringing the problem, my Pets,\u201d said the older female.</p><p>Petra turned then, her gaze resting on Dillon. \u201cIf you must tell them something, tell them the truth. A vampire balas needs his father\u2019s blood to survive. Let\u2019s see if they truly value the Eternal Breed or not.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Just two hours until sundown.</p><p>Two hours until he was back in New York. Where he belonged. Where Cruen\u2019s body would soon find shelter, pain, suffering, misery . . . then death, if he was a model prisoner.</p><p>Synjon continued to wear out the floorboards in the large, lightless cabin bedroom. The pussy brothers sat in the direct sunlight at a table in the living area just ten feet away, playing cards. Every so often, they\u2019d glance his way and remind him they didn\u2019t appreciate having to babysit his deadbeat vampire ass.</p><p>They were really getting on his nerves.</p><p>Before he flashed to the penthouse, he was going to flash directly in front of the pussy brothers and do some facial rearranging.</p><p>\u201cHuffing and puffing in there, bloodsucker?\u201d Sasha called, amusement lacing his tone. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t have emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s been faking it,\u201d Valentin said.</p><p>\u201cBet he\u2019s learned how to do that from all the women he\u2019s conned into his bed.\u201d</p><p>Synjon nearly rolled his eyes. These two were truly the feline equivalent of human teenage boys. And clearly Sasha was the instigator. The male would be first in line for the fangdown at sunset tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhen is Petra returning?\u201d Syn asked as he passed the open bedroom door. \u201cShe\u2019s been gone a bloody long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss her, do you?\u201d Sasha said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Syn returned evenly. \u201cOr it could be that I grow weary in the company of grown children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he just insulted us,\u201d Valentin said with mock injury.</p><p>\u201cHard to tell with that accent,\u201d replied Sasha. \u201cListen, bloodsucker, Petra\u2019ll be back when she\u2019s hungry.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill can\u2019t believe our little sister\u2019s a vampire,\u201d Val said, his tone now slightly melancholy.</p><p>\u201cMakes sense, though, doesn\u2019t it? Those games we used to play. She never attacked like an animal. And during snack time she always wrinkled her nose at our raw meat cakes and criticized us for our less than perfect table manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still does that,\u201d Val said. \u201cBut, shit, brother, I refuse to use a knife and fork. I was given canines for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear that.\u201d</p><p>Synjon stopped pacing. \u201cPerhaps you blokes can reminisce outside.\u201d</p><p>Sasha tipped his chair back so he could see Syn. \u201cNot sure we\u2019re ready to risk that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSun still shining, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard and hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not going anywhere, am I?\u201d Syn said before continuing his pacing.</p> <p>Val pressed his chair back too. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, bloodsucker. Sun, moon, dusk. We\u2019re going to make sure you stay here until our sister is done with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Sasha piped up. \u201cDon\u2019t wanna have to make the trip back into frozen New York City to pick up your pale ass again.\u201d</p><p>It was truly his grand shame. The pussy brothers catching him off guard, knocking him out, dragging him here. He\u2019d have to make sure that didn\u2019t get out, in the spy community, the military, or his home credenti. \u201cHow did you manage it?\u201d Syn asked. \u201cI\u2019m curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Breaking in your place and stealing you?\u201d Val grinned. \u201cDani\u2019s such a pisser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget Dani,\u201d Sasha remarked. \u201cIt was our skill and incredible brute strength.\u201d</p> <p>Synjon\u2019s nostrils flared at their idiocy. \u201cWhat drug did you use to get me to this hovel? That\u2019s all I want to know.\u201d</p><p>Both chairs dropped back into place with a crash, and Synjon couldn\u2019t see them anymore. \u201cDid he just call the playhouse that you and me and Dad built with our bare paws a hovel, Val?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he did.\u201d</p><p>Sasha growled softly. \u201cIf his blood wasn\u2019t needed inside our sister, I might have to spread it around the hovel right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make any messes, boys,\u201d Petra said, walking through the front door. \u201cI spent way too many years picking up after the two of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank Christ you\u2019re back,\u201d Synjon said, coming to stand in the bedroom doorway. \u201cThe pussy brothers here are trying out material for their comedy act. So far I\u2019d say it\u2019s a glorious fail.\u201d</p> <p>For one brief moment, Syn was sure her lips twitched with amusement. It reminded him of her smile. The happy one, the well-pleasured one. He saw it on the lids of his eyes when they were closed. That particular smile made her eyes light up, and glow with blue fire.</p><p>She eyed her brothers. \u201cYou can go.\u201d</p><p>Sasha raised a blond brow. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere. Sun\u2019s still high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll righty.\u201d Sasha kicked the chair back and stood.</p><p>Val too. \u201cSo, what happened? With the meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom will tell you,\u201d she said, her voice softer than before. \u201cShe\u2019s back at the house.\u201d She tilted her chin in the direction of the door. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Val walked past her.</p> <p>But Sasha hesitated in the hall, his eyes on Syn. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Synjon said overpolitely. \u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>There were grumblings of irritated comebacks, but Petra managed to shuffle her brothers out the front door. When she returned, Synjon was leaning against the doorframe, his back to the dark bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou were gone a long time.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThere was a lot to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDillon was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Order.\u201d Interesting. And quite possibly problematic.</p><p>Her eyes turned a crystal blue as she walked toward him. She licked her lips. \u201cShe and Gray and the Roman brothers\u2019 mates and even a few of the mutore wanted to make sure you were being well treated.\u201d</p><p>Even in jeans and a tank, she was unbelievably sexy. Or maybe it was because of the jeans and the tank. He tried to keep his gaze off her belly. It bothered him that her swell intensified his desire for her.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you tell them?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She stopped just a few inches from the doorway and inhaled rather obviously. \u201cThat I was doing my level best to locate and drain every bit of shitty attitude from your person.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. Couldn\u2019t stop himself. It wasn\u2019t just her swell that was making his cock twitch. It was her voice too, her attitude, the hunger in her expression. Bloody hell, he might not have emotions, but his body was on fire and ready to go.</p><p>All she had to do was say the word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t want to see me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold them no.\u201d She leaned in then, breathed in, and ran her nose along the ridge of his collarbone.</p><p>What the hell? Synjon\u2019s hands fisted around the doorframe. Do that again, little veana, and the next time you take my blood I\u2019ll be taking your cunt.</p><p>She spoke against the skin of his neck. \u201cI told them you were mine until the balas is born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t insist?\u201d he said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to fight a pregnant girl over her food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you stand so close, veana? You want my blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>She jerked back then, and speared him with her gaze. \u201cNot want, Mr. Wise. Need. Don\u2019t ever mistake the difference. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, his skin twitching with desire. He\u2019d never seen a female so famished before. He couldn\u2019t help himself. He leaned in and lapped at her upper lip with his tongue.</p><p>Again she jerked back. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a little of my blood on your lip.\u201d His brow lifted. \u201cI wanted it back.\u201d</p><p>She brought her hand up and swiped at her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again. You don\u2019t get to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because it excites you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt disgusts me,\u201d she said far too vehemently.</p><p>\u201cI very much doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t keep standing there, scenting her, his dick a pulsing stone behind his zipper. He turned and headed into the dimly lit bedroom.</p><p>To his surprise, she followed him. \u201cWhy? Because the rich, sexy, emotionless Synjon Wise has only to lay a finger on a female and she\u2019s panting and parting her thighs for him?\u201d</p><p>He turned around, shrugged. \u201cWell, it might require more than a finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never claimed to be anything but, love.\u201d</p><p>She clamped down on his chest and shoved him hard. He fell back on the bed, taking her with him in such a controlled way it was clear he hadn\u2019t been caught off guard.</p><p>Shocked by where she found herself, poised above him, straddling his waist, Petra glared down at him. \u201cHow many females have you taken to your bed since we were together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never take anyone to my bed.\u201d When her eyes lit with something far too soft, he amended the statement quickly. \u201cNow, if you\u2019re talking about a casual shag over the back of the couch, well, then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d She tried to get up, get off him.</p><p>But he held her ass tightly. \u201cNo, veana. That\u2019s normal, healthy fucking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Syn, that\u2019s just you. Screw \u2019em and leave \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>His fingers dug into her ass and his voice dropped without his permission. \u201cYou walked out on me. Let\u2019s not forget that.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw worked and she stumbled slightly over her words. \u201cI haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like I won\u2019t forget that you wanted to kill my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanted to?\u201d He started to laugh. \u201cIt may not have happened in that dungeon as I\u2019d planned. But it will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to stop it.\u201d</p><p>Her fangs dropped. \u201cI could kill you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh . . .\u201d He grinned. \u201cNo empty threats in front of the balas.\u201d</p><p>Practically growling, she swatted his hands away and climbed off him. \u201cIt\u2019s a promise. One I make to the balas. Protection from the evils of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we are both saying the same thing, Petra.\u201d He watched her turn and walk out of the room, his body screaming for her to come back, make him warm again. Maybe even make him feel again. \u201cBecause like it or not, love,\u201d he called after her, \u201caccept it or not\u2014grandfather Cruen is the evil of this world.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>\u201cThey remain in the Rain Forest?\u201d Cruen asked calmly, his gaze moving down the table, taking in the face of each member of the Eternal Order. \u201cWhy have they not been rescued?\u201d</p><p>There was no more mountaintop. No more snow, or Feeyan solo at his side. This time, Cruen stood before the ten, his feet ankle-deep in the very sand he had once conjured. Yes. Before the Order. Not behind the table where he\u2019d ruled for so long. The shame was not lost on him.</p><p>His jaw tightened. Gods, how had he fallen so far? How had he allowed a piece of British tripe to best him? Make him so weak and ineffective that he had been forced to piggyback to the Hollow of Shadows on one of his Pureblood guards?</p><p>A fact he would never allow the members of the Order to learn. To the ten, he was only here on Eternal Breed business. His concern for one of his brethren, and his desire to protect the pure blood. And perhaps even his need for redemption for not only keeping the shifter world a secret but using their DNA to enhance the vampire race.</p><p>\u201cThe Order has just returned from the Rain Forest,\u201d Feeyan informed him coldly. \u201cAll I have heard is that one of the Purebloods is not a prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd from whom have you heard this?\u201d Cruen asked. \u201cWho did you send?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d Dillon grinned from her seat, farthest down the table. \u201cHello, Daddy Dickest.\u201d</p><p>As the other Order members muttered under their breath, Cruen\u2019s gaze narrowed on the vampire and jaguar shifter he\u2019d adopted so long ago. The one who had run from him when she claimed one of his guards had touched her. Cruen had never been sure of what happened. But he was sure of Dillon\u2019s penchant for deceit, and for turning the other mutore against him. This time, however, she would not interfere with his plans. \u201cYou are one mongrel I wish I had left in the ditch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAwww,\u201d she said with heavy sarcasm, her head cocked to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re still such a sweet-talker.\u201d</p><p>Feeling his blood heat to a dangerous, energy-stealing level, Cruen ripped his gaze from the female and turned back to face Feeyan. \u201cWhat of the other Pureblood? Has he professed his wish to remain as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this any of your business?\u201d Dillon continued brusquely. \u201cWhy are you even here? Because we all know altruism is not your thing.\u201d</p> <p>His fangs started to descend. He should\u2019ve drowned her when he\u2019d had the chance. \u201cSo the Order is now being run by not only its newest member, but a mutore.\u201d He spoke to Feeyan, and liked the flash of embarrassment and unease he saw in her eyes. \u201cHow far we have fallen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s rich coming from you,\u201d Dillon snapped back. \u201cYou who created us.\u201d</p><p>This time, he did turn to look at her. \u201cMistakes are part of any experiment.\u201d</p><p>She hissed at him, pushed away the gentle, calming hand of the Order member beside her. \u201cCalling yourself a mistake, huh, Pops? How many species are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born a Pureblood, mongrel.\u201d He sneered, but inside, the weight of his physical and emotional exhaustion threatened to fell him. \u201cWhat I did to myself, how I used my own flesh, my own blood to test the DNA of other species, was for the good of our race, to better our race. My sacrifice makes me a hero. But your birth will always make you trash.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite enough,\u201d Feeyan interrupted smoothly.</p><p>\u201cLook how he speaks to a member of the Order,\u201d Dillon said hotly. \u201cYou know he doesn\u2019t give a shit about the Eternal Breed.\u201d Her eyes narrowed on Cruen. \u201cDo you have a personal reason for wanting us to infiltrate the Rain Forest shifters, Daddy Dipstick?\u201d</p><p>Growing weaker by the second, Cruen was doing his very best not to collapse, drop like a stone\u2014his backside into the sand. \u201cDo you have a personal reason for keeping the Order out, mongrel daughter?\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward on the table and grinned broadly. \u201cShall we talk daughters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Feeyan cried, standing, her hands outstretched.</p> <p>Cruen eyeballed Dillon with new interest. The mutore female clearly knew about his connection to Petra and the balas. She knew Petra was his daughter. But why wasn\u2019t she revealing it? Why wasn\u2019t she using it against him?</p><p>Why didn\u2019t she want the Order to know about the relationship?</p><p>\u201cSynjon Wise has not been in contact,\u201d Dillon told the others with forced calm.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Looming above them all, Feeyan turned to look at her. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s there. But we haven\u2019t been given access to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t been given?\u201d Cruen repeated with a painfully forced laugh. \u201cA Pureblood is being held captive and the Order remains silent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not captive,\u201d Dillon returned hotly. \u201cHe is there feeding his unborn balas.\u201d</p><p>Feeyan was silent for a moment, closing her eyes and muttering incantations under her breath. Exhausted, both mentally and physically, Cruen watched her. He knew this game. He\u2019d played it many times. Gathering silence, gathering attention, showing his power. He wondered why the new leader of the Order hadn\u2019t developed her own tricks of the trade.</p> <p>When she opened her eyes again, they were a stark and shocking white, and her voice boomed when she spoke. \u201cI want the Purebloods brought here, Dillon. If what you say is true, they need only claim their situation and I will return them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Dillon began, looking more nervous than Cruen had ever seen her, \u201cthe veana is late in her swell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlash does not impact swell in a Pureblood veana.\u201d Feeyan lifted her chin and added imperiously, \u201cBut that is not something you would know, is it?\u201d</p><p>Dillon\u2019s nostrils flared, and her jaw went tight, but she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou have twenty-four hours to bring them before me, or the Order will see this as a true Pureblood abduction, even an act of war by the shifter breed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I can help this situation along,\u201d Cruen offered. \u201cGo with Dillon to speak to the shifters.\u201d</p><p>Feeyan turned her attention on him.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Dillon said quickly before the leader could answer. \u201cI don\u2019t want him there. The shifters won\u2019t want him there. Not after he revealed them, betrayed them. I\u2019m trying to do this with diplomacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think your presence there will cause more pushback?\u201d Feeyan asked Cruen. \u201cBetter to let the Order handle things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Order,\u201d he began in a calm voice, \u201cspecifically one Order member, Dillon, tried to handle things and failed. I care about the Purebloods held hostage not only because they are Eternal Breed but because one of them carries my blood.\u201d</p><p>The world around him fell into utter silence. The Order members sat up straighter, all of their eyes on him as they waited for him to reveal more. For one moment it felt like old times to Cruen. He was all-powerful. Their leader. He captured their attention and respect, then used it to further his cause.</p><p>Perhaps he would have that again someday.</p><p>Feeyan didn\u2019t seem to possess it.</p><p>For now, though, he needed access, a valid reason, and a ride into the Rain Forest community.</p><p>His gaze connected only with Feeyan. \u201cThe Pureblood veana in swell happens to be my daughter.\u201d Through his emotional pain and physical exhaustion, he lifted his chin and smiled. \u201cI will make sure she and the paven held captive are returned.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Petra dove under the water and swam downriver a few yards. The sun was sinking, staining the sky a beautiful ripe mango color. Sasha and Valentin had arrived at the cabin a little while ago for their evening shift. Confident almost to the point of cocky, they\u2019d told Petra all was handled and she didn\u2019t need to return until morning.</p><p>For breakfast, they\u2019d added with sneers in Synjon\u2019s direction. A dig that Syn completely ignored.</p><p>Right before she\u2019d walked out the door, she\u2019d pulled Sasha aside and warned him that arrogance was a dangerous mind-set to be in with someone as experienced and cunning as Synjon Wise. But Sasha had only reminded her that he and Val had already bested the cunning Brit, and on the paven\u2019s home turf no less. Containing him would be far less complicated.</p><p>They were tying Syn up as she closed the door and headed for her parents\u2019 home.</p><p>A loud roar met her ears as she broke the surface of the water. Shifting from bear to male on the bank, Brodan gave her a grin, then dove in beside her. They\u2019d seen each other naked for years. It was just part of the shifter way. But there was something different about it now, and Petra wasn\u2019t sure why. Without making a big deal about it, she floated back a few inches, keeping space between them.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s blood boy?\u201d</p><p>His hair wet, and his eyes flashing in the dying rays of the sun, Brodan looked incredibly handsome.</p><p>\u201cBack at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tie him up?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSasha and Val took care of it.\u201d</p><p>Brodan\u2019s sharp eyes narrowed. \u201cI hate that you need him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she said, though the words weren\u2019t as quick to leave her tongue as they should\u2019ve been. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be much longer.\u201d</p><p>He splashed water on his face. \u201cIt should\u2019ve been me.\u201d</p><p>His words stilled her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve been the one to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrodan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. I get the biological connection.\u201d He took a deep breath and blew it out. \u201cI just wish . . . shit . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His eyes came up and locked on hers. \u201cI just wish it could\u2019ve been me.\u201d</p><p>Her insides tightened. It wasn\u2019t a surprise to hear, and in fact she\u2019d thought the same thing a million times over the past few months. Brodan would be an incredible father. Loyal and loving. Fun and generous with his time and attention.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, dropping his chin, giving her a soft look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that to make you feel uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m not.\u201d She gave him a small smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll be an incredible father. And mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo some lucky shifter female?\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cIs that where you\u2019re going, Pets? Because if you are, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to hear it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not where I was going.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted. \u201cInteresting.\u201d His eyes warmed. \u201cSo, have you decided what you\u2019re going to do after the baby is born? Where you want to be? And with whom?\u201d His eyes roamed her face. \u201cWhat would be best for the cub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire,\u201d came a male voice behind her.</p><p>Petra gasped, her gaze flying to the bank, her hands flying to her chest as she scrambled to cover herself. What the hell?</p><p>Backlit by the intense white moonlight was Synjon Wise. \u201cNot cub,\u201d he said. His arms were crossed over his chest, his broad, heavily muscled chest.</p><p>\u201cSyn\u2014,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYou remember my name, love,\u201d he remarked dryly. \u201cEven as you float around naked with the doctor here. Well, I suppose that\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you . . . ?\u201d She glanced past him to the house in the distance. Panic bubbled within her. \u201cWhere are they? Sasha and Val? What did you do to them?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI told you, as I told them, that I\u2019m expecting guests this evening.\u201d</p><p>Brodan, who had been farther away from the shore, was hauling ass out of the water, nearly in midshift.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Petra called out to him. \u201cBrodan, wait.\u201d</p><p>The male paused and looked back at her, gave her a quick growl.</p><p>She shook her head at him. \u201cNo. Please. I don\u2019t want anyone hurt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Synjon nodded, his tone and manner utterly controlled, as emotionless as always. \u201cShe\u2019s a wise one, Dr. Feelgood. The blood of a bear has always intrigued me.\u201d</p><p>Tearing his gaze from Petra, Brodan inched closer, growling with menace.</p><p>\u201cSyn,\u201d Petra said warningly. \u201cMy brothers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre fine. Just a bit tied up at the moment.\u201d He shrugged at the easy joke, then pulled in a breath. \u201cThey really are decent blokes. Protective of their family. I respect that. But the jokes, love, and all that male braying. Gets tedious.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t hurt. Only tied up. Relief spilled through Petra and she sank an inch farther under the water. It wasn\u2019t as though she was surprised. Somehow she\u2019d known he would find a way out of his captivity. Somehow she\u2019d known that even with that moment they\u2019d had that afternoon, his hand to her belly, feeling the movement of the balas beneath his palm\u2014even though she\u2019d swear she saw a hint of emotion, connection, in his eyes\u2014he wasn\u2019t tied to her . . . to their balas. Not even by the thinnest of strings.</p><p>She looked up, found his gaze, and held it tightly. \u201cSo, what is this? Your visit to the river\u2019s edge? You came to say good-bye?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. And for a split second he looked confused.</p><p>\u201cOr to interrupt two people enjoying a swim?\u201d Petra pushed, wishing he weren\u2019t so close and she wasn\u2019t so hungry.</p> <p>His brows lifted and he said with a streak of arrogance, \u201cI interrupted something, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brodan ground out, his eyes flashing with irritation, as he stood in the shallow end of the river halfway between Syn and Petra.</p><p>\u201cPlanning your future?\u201d Syn added, his eyes locked on Petra.</p><p>She shrugged, \u201cMaybe,\u201d the tops of her breasts surfacing at the water\u2019s edge.</p><p>An action that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by either male.</p><p>\u201cWith the good doctor here,\u201d Syn continued. \u201cHome every night for dinner. And you serving up a lovely raw steak.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cWhile you\u2019re secretly dying to drink his blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo secret required, Pets,\u201d Brodan said, though his gaze remained on Synjon. \u201cMy blood is yours. Always has been. And the cub\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire!\u201d Syn snapped. He glared at Brodan, his fangs descending.</p><p>Brodan froze and so did Petra. Only the sound of the river slapping against the rocks could be heard. Within a few seconds, Synjon\u2019s fangs retracted, along with any expression of anger.</p><p>It was almost as though it had never happened.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Petra said, shivers moving up her back and into her neck. Shivers that had nothing to do with the cooling night air.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Synjon found her gaze again, the mask of emotionless male back in place.</p><p>\u201cYour emotions . . .\u201d</p> <p>He stepped back. \u201cI have no emotions.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her mouth dry. \u201cI saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand, Syn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your swim,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cAnd a healthy fuck, if you\u2019re so inclined.\u201d</p><p>And with one last look in Petra\u2019s direction, he flashed from the riverbank.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Petra wasted no time in pulling her shaky body out of the river, yanking her clothes on, saying a hasty good-bye to Brodan, and rushing back to the cabin. She had to see it for herself. See that her brothers were safe and unharmed. Synjon\u2019s word meant so little to her now. He had no reason to keep her family in good health.</p><p>Especially if the ones in question had attacked him twice already.</p><p>She jogged up the steps, dashed into the silent house, and ran down the hall. \u201cSash? Val?\u201d she called, searching the hidey-holes of each bedroom. Finally, inside the small closet in the main bedroom, she found them. Both Sasha and Val were just as Syn had claimed: fine, tied up, with a bit of their pride squashed.</p><p>Petra made quick work of the gags and rope. But when they were free, both sat unmoving inside the closet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Pets,\u201d Sasha said mournfully.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Val grimaced. \u201cWe totally failed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d She gave Val a pat on the back. \u201cHe\u2019s a trained spy, in the military . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we took him down in his apartment,\u201d Valentin said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cBy surprise,\u201d Sasha amended. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fools. Arrogant asses. Didn\u2019t prepare. Not in any real way. Wise was right when he called us the pussy brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Val said.</p><p>Sasha tossed him a look.</p><p>Val shrugged. \u201cYeah, all right.\u201d</p><p>Petra heard the door to the cabin burst open, and seconds later Dani entered the dark bedroom. \u201cI was doing a moonlight flyby and saw that bastard by the river with you and Brodan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too late,\u201d Petra said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not.\u201d Valentin eyed Sasha as he pushed to his feet, then offered his hand to his brother. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix this. We\u2019re going back to his apartment, taking him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes,\u201d Sasha agreed, slapping Valentin\u2019s palm and jumping up. \u201cAnd this time, we\u2019re keeping him in the clinic, sedated. You can feed from him like that. Coma Vamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, drugs in Pet\u2019s blood would be real great for the cub, idiots,\u201d Dani said with a snort.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Sasha said, walking out of the closet. \u201cThen we\u2019ll knock him out the old-fashioned way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three!\u201d Val added. \u201cFour, five, six!\u201d</p><p>The brothers chuckled as they started for the door.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not at his apartment,\u201d Dani called after them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Petra began, turning her attention to the hawk female. \u201cHow would you\u2014 Oh, gods, Dani, you didn\u2019t fly into Manhattan. It\u2019s broad daylight there. You could\u2019ve been shot at.\u201d</p><p>Dani put her hands up. \u201cEase up, bestie. Didn\u2019t go to New York, though I\u2019m really starting to dig that place. It\u2019s all dressed up for the holiday they celebrate. The one with fir trees and snow and reindeer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDani,\u201d Petra said tightly. \u201cSynjon?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze locked on Petra and softened a hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave the Rain Forest, and neither has the vampire.\u201d</p><p>The words sank in, but their meaning didn\u2019t. Petra didn\u2019t understand. Syn was still here? Had he lost his ability to flash? No, that wasn\u2019t possible. She\u2019d seen him flash from the river.</p><p>\u201cYou know where he is, Dani?\u201d Sasha asked her.</p><p>The hawk shifter turned to the brother and shrugged. \u201cWhere he was headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t dive-bomb the bastard, scoop him up in your talons?\u201d</p><p>Dani\u2019s gaze returned to Petra. There was no typical bluster or hard-ass hawk attitude glistening in her eyes now. Only the solid intimacy of a best friend. \u201cTell me what you want. Personally I\u2019d like to forget he exists, but I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>What she wanted. Shit, that was a big and constantly changing question. Maybe it would be better if she could just forget he existed too. But that wasn\u2019t practical, was it? The effects of his blood were pure magic. She and the balas still needed him, so for now there was only one answer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d Val said before she could open her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Petra pointed at them and said in her most resolute, most authoritative voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not. This is my business, my blood to go after. I\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>His face tensing with unease, Sasha was first to object. \u201cPets\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason he hasn\u2019t left.\u201d She moved past them all and out the bedroom door. \u201cI need to find out what it is.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Nicholas Roman growled, stalking forward.</p><p>Alexander was right beside him. \u201cWhat the hell is he doing here?\u201d</p><p>Though feeling weaker and more emotionally lost than ever after such a jarring flash, Cruen stood his ground outside the gathering stones as the Roman brothers and two of the mutore came to stand before him. Nostrils flared, hands balled into fists, the four glanced back and forth between him and Dillon, who stood beside him.</p><p>\u201cMommy made me bring him,\u201d Dillon grumbled, then amended her statement with a shrug. \u201cHe told Feeyan about his connection to Petra.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas glared at Cruen, his lips forming a sneer. \u201cSo now you want to claim her? After all these years?\u201d</p><p>All I wish to claim is that British bastard who glued his emotions to my insides. All I want is my power back. Perhaps even my chair on the Order. But to the Roman brother he said smoothly, \u201cI have a right to know where my Pureblood daughter is. If she\u2019s being held here against her will.\u201d</p><p>Alexander chuckled bitterly. \u201cThe old paven\u2019s getting sentimental. How sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sweet I might lose a fang, right into his carotid,\u201d Helo added blackly.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Petra?\u201d Cruen asked, ignoring the males. \u201cWhere is my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter.\u201d The female lion shifter who\u2019d raised Petra from near infancy left the gathering stones and headed his way. \u201cShe\u2019s my daughter, Cruen. She wants to remain here, in her home, her homeland, around her family.\u201d</p><p>As the shifter closed in on him, Cruen recalled the day he\u2019d brought his and Celestine\u2019s infant here. In his time spent gathering blood samples in the Rain Forest, he\u2019d witnessed all manner of selflessness. Each faction helped the others, looked out for the others. It had actually started to irritate him. Such goodness was tiresome. But when Petra was born, when he\u2019d taken her from Cellie, he\u2019d known the perfect place to keep her safe while keeping his connection to more blood samples open.</p><p>Wen\u2019s eyes were fierce as she stared him down. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here, vampire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps Petra doesn\u2019t either,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time for her to learn about her own kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll make that decision, not you.\u201d</p><p>Cruen nodded. Yes, he\u2019d chosen well with this female. Protective, but in a quiet way. He\u2019d heard of her desire for a daughter, and her failure to produce one. She\u2019d been so grateful.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have some Frankenstein monster to create back in your lab?\u201d Helo asked him.</p><p>Cruen\u2019s gaze shifted, ran over the water beast, who had once called him father. \u201cI think I made enough monsters for one century.\u201d</p><p>Helo\u2019s expression darkened.</p><p>\u201cNow I come directly from the table of the Order,\u201d Cruen said in the calmest of voices. \u201cUnless you want Feeyan here in my stead, I suggest we get on with this.\u201d</p><p>Both Roman brothers turned to Dillon with an incredulous look.</p> <p>\u201cGahhhh, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this,\u201d Dillon rattled with a sigh, \u201cbut he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>The guard behind Cruen leaned in and spoke directly into his ear. \u201cShall I go with you or wait outside the stones, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Was he imagining things, or did he detect a thread of disrespect in the guard\u2019s tone? Cruen mused as he walked past the Romans, the mutore, and Wen, and into the circle of stones. The male had been with him for only a few months, and had always acted completely servile. Perhaps, with the circumstances being what they were, with his power nearly gone, he himself was projecting that feeling of insolence.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get started,\u201d Dillon said, following him.</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we wait for Petra?\u201d Cruen suggested, sitting down opposite the rest of the group. \u201cAnd the paven she holds hostage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s being held hostage,\u201d Alexander said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cSo you all keep saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly why Syn\u2019s here, Cruen,\u201d Lucian snarled, his body ready to spring. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you can\u2019t feel it, seeing as how you sucked down all his emotions a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>Cruen fought the urge to drop his fangs and hiss. Existing in a weakened state was acute misery, but being reminded of the act by Lucian Breeding Male Roman was a complete and total embarrassment.</p><p>This could not continue a second longer.</p><p>\u201cCease this game,\u201d he said with forced authority. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetra\u2019s not coming,\u201d Wen informed him.</p> <p>\u201cSyn either,\u201d Alex added.</p><p>Cruen\u2019s blood began to heat. He tried to stop it, knew it would steal his energy, and what little power remained inside him, but he couldn\u2019t. He whirled on Dillon, fangs bared. \u201cI suggest, Order Member Nine, that you take control of this situation. Unless you want the destruction of this lovely shifter world and every heartbeat in it on your conscience.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Home.</p><p>New York City.</p><p>Wraparound balcony with a view of the park.</p><p>That\u2019s where he\u2019d wanted to go, where he\u2019d aimed his flash. Where he should be. But something inside him had refused the call. Instead, he\u2019d ended up in the last place on earth he\u2019d ever expected to be again.</p><p>He bent and stepped inside the cave. It was dark, only the spent light of the moon illuminating the first five feet or so. As he moved inside, scented the familiar dank odor of the walls, he remembered the day he\u2019d been saved. He should\u2019ve died. Gone with Juliet into the sun. Instead, he\u2019d not only been rescued against his will, but had gone on to create life.</p><p>He felt no emotion with this memory. Not even a twinge at the thought of Juliet, her death, his grief. And yet, not long ago, standing beside the river, watching Petra and the bear shifter float naked below the water as they discussed the future of the balas, he\u2019d felt something.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten angry.</p><p>Or was it possessive?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know. Without past emotions to guide him, he couldn\u2019t decipher what was what. But he did know, did understand, that with that small, poignant surge came a reason to worry.</p><p>How was it possible? He\u2019d had every emotion bled from him. He\u2019d made sure of it. Bloody hell, after the Romans had held him down, made it clear what was about to happen, he\u2019d made sure it all left his body, went inside that mad vamp prat, and stuck like flypaper.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Or at least until it strangled the energy and sanity from him, then led him straight to Synjon for help.</p><p>He pushed away from the wet rock wall. He had to go. Now. No matter how his body seemed to wish him to remain, there was only destruction here. And truly, the only one who was meant to be destroyed in all of this was Cruen.</p><p>\u201cYou goddamn British bastard.\u201d</p><p>He whirled around, and instantly his skin tightened and his insides flared with heat. How the hell hadn\u2019t he sensed her? Scented her? What the bloody hell was going wrong inside him?</p><p>Standing directly in the mouth of the cave, backlit by the moon, Petra looked gorgeous and appetizing as she glared at him. \u201cHere. Of all places. Seriously?\u201d</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d said the same things to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not where I had intended to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where is that? On the balcony of your penthouse or pressing some idiotic female up against the piano?\u201d</p><p>His mind went rogue and conjured that image, but it wasn\u2019t some foolish chit whose hips he fisted as he moved behind her. In fact, in his mind it never was. \u201cYour feathered friend tell you about that?\u201d</p><p>Petra moved into the cave. \u201cEither that or you\u2019re just so grossly predictable.\u201d</p><p>He glanced past her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m alone.\u201d</p><p>Syn couldn\u2019t help but find that strange. After all that had happened, past and present, wasn\u2019t she worried about her safety around him? Even with her shocking strength, she was no match for him in the dark. And where was her little army? The pussy brothers and the hawk? Following her every movement, fighting to bring back her blood meal.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy would you think to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there in your head. This was anything but sentimental. You were spotted. By my feathered friend, no less.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cThe question is, why are you here? Still here. And at the site of the first of many mistakes on my part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean to force another emotion out of me, that\u2019s not the way to do it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. She dropped her arms and moved toward him. \u201cSo you admit it. You felt something back at the river?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Which, in truth, was probably an answer in and of itself.</p><p>\u201cBut how is that possible?\u201d she said, coming to stand before him, her belly nearly brushing the waistband of his jeans. \u201cI saw Cruen take all of your emotions. Did he leave something behind?\u201d</p><p>Impossible. Fuck, it had better be impossible. He knew what he was doing, had been meticulous in his actions on the floor of that dungeon. He\u2019d made sure every thread of emotion was gone from his mind and superglued elsewhere. He held her gaze. \u201cWhat happened by the river was nothing. A moment\u2019s irritation for your bear shifter.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t want it to be so. Perhaps you\u2019re looking for something that isn\u2019t there, will never be there.\u201d</p><p>Her face contorted into a mask of disbelief and then after a moment she broke out laughing. \u201cOh, Syn. What do you think I want? What do you think I\u2019m looking for? For you to care about me?\u201d She placed her hand on her belly. \u201cAbout us? Fall in love with us? Be bonded to us?\u201d</p><p>Her words sank deep into his gut, and they seemed to want to remain there. \u201cThat would be the logical desire for a female in swell, yes.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter died, and the light he\u2019d always seen glowing within her incredible pale blue eyes went out. There was nothing but emptiness. Not unlike his own, he imagined.</p><p>It bothered him.</p><p>In fact, he had an irresistible urge to take her in his arms, kiss her, tease her\u2014anything to bring that light back. It didn\u2019t have to be happiness or curiosity. Anger and hatred would do just as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019d be stupid enough to hope for such a thing?\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cBelieve that you\u2019re a worthy male, emotions intact or not?\u201d She stepped forward, got in his face, the curve of her belly now pressed against him. Her eyes locked with his. Dispassionate to detached. \u201cI think there\u2019s something happening inside you. Some kind of reaction to the baby.\u201d</p><p>The cool night air rushed into the cave, moved over Syn\u2019s naked chest. He wanted to deny it, her suggestion, but even as he attempted to summon the words, his hands itched to reach out and touch her swollen belly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you feeling right now?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes met hers. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop himself. The urge was the greatest he\u2019d ever felt. Yes. Felt. In seconds, before he could say a word or defend himself, his hands were on either side of her stomach. For a few long seconds, he held her, felt the firmness of the world that surrounded the growing life inside her. Was that how he\u2019d begun? How she\u2019d begun? It was bloody amazing to\u2014-</p><p>His fingers froze, his body too, and his skin started to heat up again. His mouth going dry with shock, his gaze dropped as under his hands he felt movement, a stirring. Then, almost in slow motion, he felt something small and hard press into his left palm. Petra must\u2019ve felt it too, as she groaned and shifted her position.</p><p>Inside him, his chest, his lungs, air seemed to hold, then expand, making him feel as though he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. His mind warned him this was dangerous, warned him to pull away and never touch this female again. But he couldn\u2019t. He just bloody well couldn\u2019t. His hands, fingers, skin, muscles . . . they all refused to move. It was as if his body was beyond his mind\u2019s control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked up, caught her staring at him.</p><p>\u201cI feel,\u201d he uttered.</p><p>Her nostrils flared. \u201cShould I say I\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p> <p>He slowly shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what should I say, Synjon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, veana.\u201d He grabbed her, gathered her in his arms, and kissed her hard on the mouth.</p><p>For one moment, she seemed to struggle internally, about pushing him away or giving in to what they couldn\u2019t seem to deny themselves. But before they took their next breath, the latter won. Her arms went around his neck and she kissed him back, followed him as he changed the angle, moaned with him when he parted her lips and stroked her tongue with his own.</p><p>His hands raked up her back and plunged into her hair. It felt like silk. Yes. He could feel it. Just as he could feel the warm, wet heat of her mouth, and the smooth skin of her neck, the curve of her belly, and the slight back-and-forth movement of her hips as she simulated what her body wanted from his.</p> <p>Could he touch her here? Have her here? On the cold, wet floor of this cave?</p><p>Fuck. This cave.</p><p>His hand swept around her side and palmed her breast through her tank and bra. He groaned with the feeling. She was so heavy, so warm, her nipple rising against his palm, begging to be touched, gently twisted, insistently suckled.</p><p>She whimpered, pressed herself closer into his hand. \u201cOh, yes. Gods, that feels good.\u201d</p><p>The cave filled with a new scent. Her scent. And he wanted to lap at the walls, taste her arousal in every drop of condensation.</p><p>He ripped his mouth from hers and dipped down into the curve of her neck. He suckled her vein, then kissed her hard and hungry. There were so many places on her body he wished to drink from. If she would allow it, he\u2019d start from the bottom and work his way up.</p> <p>Just to make the point that he wanted what pressed so eagerly against him, his hand left her breast and journeyed down to cup her sex.</p><p>He nearly lost his mind.</p><p>Hot, wet, and pulsing.</p><p>In one swift and impulsive move, he lowered his head and suckled her breast through the fabric of her tank, while slipping his hand inside the waistband of her jeans. He found her smooth pussy drenched in arousal and eased two fingers inside her.</p><p>She cried out. Froze for a full five seconds. Then, like a female possessed, started bucking against his hand. Back and forth her hips swayed as she moaned and groaned, as the walls of her sex squeezed around his fingers and released more blazing-hot cream.</p><p>What was he doing? What the bloody fuck was he doing? His cock was so rock hard inside his jeans, he thought it might burst. But he refused to release it, give in to what it craved. He couldn\u2019t take that from her again. Not now. Not yet. Here, in this cave, with the moon bathing her in its light, Synjon had only one thought, one goal. He wanted Petra to feel, release. He wanted her to come. Against his palm, his fingers. Against him. He wanted it like he wanted his next blood meal. As if he wouldn\u2019t survive without it.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t emotion.</p><p>This was pure physical desire.</p> <p>As he teased and nipped at her breast with his teeth, he found her swollen clit and circled the bud with his thumb. She was so hot, her breathing so labored as she writhed and whimpered against him.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, love,\u201d he uttered against her soaking-wet tank. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to feel your tight, hot pussy shake and quiver around my fingers.\u201d</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>\u201cI remember how it felt around my cock.\u201d</p><p>It happened in an instant. Total disconnect. It was as if the moon had extinguished her light and a cold wind blew through the cave. Neither was true, but the sudden gasp from Petra\u2019s throat, and the way she jerked out of his hold and backed up a few feet, made it feel true.</p><p>Stunned, Synjon stared at her, his fingers wet, his dick hard and pulsing as the moon illuminated her dark hair, making it seem as if she wore a halo.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, breathing hard. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI won\u2019t be that. Not that female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat female? What are you talking about?\u201d He was so physically amped up, he thought his head would explode. He needed blood.</p><p>He needed her.</p><p>\u201cOne of those many emotionless nothings you screw and send home.\u201d</p><p>Oh, bloody hell.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to be that.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re not, love. You could never be.</p><p>The words played hide-and-seek on his tongue. If he said them out loud he was admitting not only to her but to himself that he had an emotional bond, however slight, to her and the balas. And he couldn\u2019t afford that connection. Perhaps after he took care of Cruen. After the male paid for his innumerable sins. Maybe then. If she could forgive him . . . But right now, if he felt even the slightest bit of connection to them, they could become a bargaining chip. They could sway his choices, change his reactions.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t allow that.</p><p>He might not have his emotions anymore, but he had his memories. All that time mourning the loss of his female, thinking her dead, when in truth Cruen had taken her, caged her, called her the Breeding Female and forced her to feel pain and sexual misery until Lucian Roman could be brought in to service her.</p><p>Then holding her in his arms, watching the light leave her eyes as Cruen killed her a second time.</p><p>No. Nothing. Not even this female and her child could break his resolve for vengeance.</p><p>Petra stood several feet away, her arms wrapped around her chest, trembling. \u201cI deserve a male who loves me, wants me for more than just a shag.\u201d</p><p>His eyes found hers in the near darkness. \u201cThe doctor. The bear shifter.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI hope so. I think that would be best. He\u2019s always been there, offered himself. He wants to be our family. Me and the cub.\u201d</p><p>A cold stillness crept over Syn, and he couldn\u2019t stop himself. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to say no,\u201d she said, her voice tight and small. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to have an opinion about me and this child at all.\u201d</p><p>Despite the implacable resolve he\u2019d had a moment ago, he felt it again. Scratching inside him. So small, barely noticeable. But it was there. His connection to the balas. \u201cYou need my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll survive. Just as I have been. It won\u2019t be long now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe balas will be fed by me.\u201d</p><p>Her lip curled and her fangs dropped. \u201cDo you hear yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said with unmasked domination. \u201cUnfortunately I do.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Phane stood beside Helo, Nicky, and Lucian as Dillon and Alex continued their efforts to persuade Petra\u2019s mother to see reason. Well, the Order\u2019s reason. Clearly his mutore sister was hating her job right about now, wishing she was anywhere else. Having to do the Order\u2019s dirty work and having Cruen along for the ride sucked serious ass.</p><p>He turned to look at the ancient paven. For the most part Cruen had remained pretty quiet throughout the discussion. Like he was waiting for something. Phane couldn\u2019t help but wonder about the male he used to call father\u2014what did Cruen want now? What was he working on? What schemes, what manipulation?</p><p>After being held and tortured in Erion\u2019s dungeon by Syn, getting his ass kicked out of Hell, losing his place on the Order, one would think\u2014and hope\u2014that the mad vamp had learned his lesson about playing with the lives of others. But Phane knew him well enough to believe that no doubt the only thing he\u2019d learned was how to deceive better, cheat better, manipulate better.</p><p>\u201cThe Order is adamant about seeing Synjon,\u201d Dillon said, her tone clearly displaying her frustration.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t take him away from Petra and the baby,\u201d Wen said in an equally irritated voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only for a moment,\u201d Alex added calmly. \u201cThen they will return him.\u201d</p><p>Wen looked first at Alex, then at Dillon. \u201cYou can\u2019t guarantee that. You said so yourself.\u201d</p><p>Showing her irritation and frustration at the situation she had no choice but to facilitate, Dillon released a weighty breath. \u201cI understand how you\u2019re feeling. Wanting to protect your child.\u201d Dillon\u2019s eyes flickered in Cruen\u2019s direction, then returned to Wen. \u201cBut you will have a war here. They\u2019re not kidding or bluffing about that.\u201d</p><p>Wen shrugged. \u201cIf that\u2019s the price of keeping Petra and the child safe and satiated, then so be it.\u201d She looked down, thoughtful for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to go and see the faction leaders.\u201d</p><p>Another voice, a truly unwelcome voice, entered the conversation. \u201cLet me speak with Synjon and Petra.\u201d</p><p>It was Cruen. He straightened against the boulder at his back and continued, \u201cPerhaps the Order might forgo their battle plans if I assure them that both Purebloods are here of their own free will.\u201d His gaze rested on Wen, and he said in the gentlest of voices, \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>The female shifter\u2019s jaw twitched. No matter what had happened in the past, how Petra had come to be her daughter, it was crystal clear that the lion shifter felt nothing but hatred for the male now. In fact, Phane was pretty sure that if she had the chance, the female might challenge Cruen to a fistfight. Or a fang/canine fight. Phane grinned as that image flashed through his mind. Petra\u2019s lion of a mother seemed pretty damn tough.</p><p>\u201cNo one is seeing Synjon Wise,\u201d Wen said with complete and total rigidity. \u201cYou can tell your Order that.\u201d</p><p>Gone was the gentleness. Cruen\u2019s upper lip trembled into a sneer. \u201cSo he is here against his will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one had to. Who took him?\u201d He leaned forward and hissed. \u201cWho guards him?\u201d</p><p>Before Wen could answer, the sound of a large and pissed-off bird rent the air. Phane glanced up, as did the others. Coming in for a glorious moonlit landing was his sexy hawk shifter female. She carried two males on her back. And Phane\u2019s own hawk scratched at his insides in warning until he realized they were Petra\u2019s brothers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Both males leaped off her back the minute she touched down and came running toward them.

Instead, she stretched her wings and tossed her head, while remaining grounded.</p><p>\u201cWe screwed up,\u201d Sasha said breathlessly, not noticing their newest guest. \u201cWise got away, and Petra went after him.\u201d</p><p>Everyone within the gathering rocks turned to stare at him.

But Petra didn\u2019t want anyone following her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she can forget that request,\u201d Lucian said.</p> <p>\u201cYour daughter is very stubborn, Wen,\u201d Nicholas remarked dryly.</p><p>\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered with a worried look at her sons. \u201cYou should\u2019ve followed her anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDani took her,\u201d Val said. \u201cIt was impossible to track her movement at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re still in the Rain Forest,\u201d Helo said. \u201cThat\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be running after anyone,\u201d Wen said miserably. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant. Oh, my baby, my cub. I\u2019m going to find her.\u201d She started toward Dani, then glanced over her shoulder. \u201cWho\u2019s coming with me?\u201d</p><p>Alex and Nicholas were at her side in seconds.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll follow on foot,\u201d Sasha said, then quickly shifted into his lion form, as did Val.</p><p>\u201cWe could use another Avian,\u201d Dillon said as they reached Dani, who was waiting impatiently, fluttering her feathers. She gestured to Phane. \u201cTake me, Helo, and Lucian?\u201d</p><p>The hawk shifter instantly turned her sharp gaze on him.</p><p>Striding forward, Phane gave the female a quick wink, then stripped out of his clothes and shifted into his hawk.</p><p>As all three of his passengers climbed onto his back, Phane ventured a glance in the direction of the female shifter. Intrigued, she was checking him out, her bird eyes moving over him, from feather to head to beak, then finally to his eyes.</p><p>He cocked his head at her, letting her know he was ready to follow her lead. She narrowed her eyes at him, then gave a glorious screech, and with wings spread, kicked off into the starry sky.</p><p>Yes, she would belong to him someday, Phane thought, taking off after her, reveling in her strength, her soar, and her steely beauty.</p><p>Below, on the ground, no one had noticed that the gathering rocks were now silent and empty and Cruen was gone.</p> <p>9</p><p>She\u2019d allowed him to touch her.</p><p>No.</p><p>She\u2019d practically begged him to touch her.</p><p>As she stood in the mouth of the cave, staring at Synjon, trying not to follow the path of moonlight that washed over his naked chest and the hard waves of abdominal muscle, she realized that no matter what she told herself about him, what she knew to be true about him, she would never stop wanting him.</p><p>It was her curse. One she would take with her into any subsequent relationships. She just prayed that when her baby was born, the hunger she had for his blood would subside. Maybe with that need gone, there was a chance for love and desire with another.</p><p>With Brodan.</p><p>She looked up then, locked eyes with the male who tormented her in so many ways. She couldn\u2019t allow it. Couldn\u2019t let him stand there after he\u2019d touched her, called out for her climax, then declared that her balas would have only his blood. It wasn\u2019t fair. Or right.</p><p>\u201cTry again,\u201d she said.</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo flash home.\u201d She swallowed thickly. \u201cTry again to flash home.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened and he raised his chin. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy blood . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it,\u201d she said, tasting it even now as she spoke. \u201cBut the price is too high.\u201d</p><p>He moved toward her, long, hard, muscular limbs, ripped stomach muscles bunching, flexing. Again she swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t worry about the child now?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think it might be more dangerous for the child if you stay.\u201d</p><p>He came to stand before her. \u201cFor the child or for you?\u201d</p><p>The scent of him snaked into her nostrils. It was a poison aphrodisiac. It made her knees go rubbery and her mouth water. She licked her lips in the hope that even a drop of his blood still remained.</p><p>His voice dropped low, his eyes bored deep into her. \u201cHungry, love?\u201d</p><p>Petra felt her fangs descend. With just those words, she fell into a dangerous haze. Her brain felt slow and fuzzy and refused the information it knew as truth\u2014as a warning. She inched toward him, toward his neck. His scent beckoned her. Come. Bite. Drink.</p><p>Maybe just a mouthful? Something to ease the pain of a dry throat?</p><p>Suddenly Synjon\u2019s head came up, and his gaze darted past her. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he said warily.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d She shook her head, tried to clear it.</p><p>Synjon stalked past her, was out of the cave in seconds.</p><p>Still reeling, her belly growling with hunger, Petra followed him, followed his gaze to the sky. Oh, yes, that sound. Before she even saw it, she knew. She knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cHawks.\u201d The word came out on a growl of irritation.</p><p>\u201cYour friend,\u201d he said dryly, \u201cis becoming a pain in my arse.\u201d</p><p>Petra fought the urge to agree. She had to pull herself together, get her mind back to the reality of what was before her and beside her. \u201cShe\u2019s not alone. That\u2019s two sets of wings on the wind.\u201d</p><p>Syn turned to look at her. \u201cThe cavalry has been called. To rescue the princess from the evil pirate.\u201d</p><p>She hated the words even before they came out of her mouth. \u201cIf you want to leave here, you\u2019d better do it now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly, confidently. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about them. I\u2019m untouchable when I want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d I remember.</p><p>He shook his head at her, then reached out and grabbed her hand.</p><p>She snatched it back. \u201cGo, Syn. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>Above them the sky was filled with feathers and flight, but Synjon hardly noticed, or hardly cared. He reached out again, but this time he grabbed Petra around the waist. Within the blink of a hawk\u2019s eye, he had her flush against him, and they were gone in a flash.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The birds would\u2019ve been quicker.</p><p>But Cruen knew that even if they found Synjon and Petra, the two of them weren\u2019t going anywhere but back to their hideout. And that was exactly where Cruen was going to wait for them.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you know where we\u2019re going?\u201d he asked his guard as they trudged through the forest.</p><p>The male nodded. \u201cI received the information from a reliable source.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so, or you\u2019ll both be feeling my wrath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need assistance, sir?\u201d the guard asked him, concern darkening his gaze. \u201cYou look . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look what?\u201d Cruen ground out.</p><p>\u201cNothing, sir.\u201d</p><p>Although the male didn\u2019t know Cruen\u2019s history, or about his decline in magical power over the past several years, or how Synjon Wise had tricked him, trapped him inside a mental and physical nightmare, he did know about Cruen\u2019s inability to shift. He had been told that the problem stemmed from Cruen\u2019s DNA, the experiments he\u2019d conducted on himself in service of the Eternal Breed.</p><p>It was all the explanation a hired hand needed.</p><p>When Cruen\u2019s powers returned, he would no doubt have to dispose of the male. He couldn\u2019t risk having anything about this side trip leaked, to either his staff or the Order. But for now, he mused as they broke through the trees onto flat land, he needed all the help he could get in order to contain Synjon Wise.</p><p>\u201cHow much farther?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>The guard moved solidly beside him. \u201cJust across the plain and to the river.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>One moment Petra felt the cool darkness of night and the next she slammed down on a hard surface, dawn breaking all around her.</p><p>In the span of a breath, she was pulled out of the dawn\u2019s light and through an open door into a dark, sprawling penthouse.</p><p>The effect was utterly jarring, and she reached out to grab the one beside her to steady herself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, love,\u201d Synjon said, holding her close.</p><p>Panic ripped into her as she realized where she was, whom she was with, and what he\u2019d just done.</p><p>She pushed away from him, her eyes narrowing, her fangs dropping. \u201cHow could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I?\u201d He stood there in his opulent living room, wearing only the faded jeans he\u2019d come into the Rain Forest with, his expression completely at ease. \u201cDid you not do the very same thing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the balas,\u201d she nearly shouted at him. \u201cFor your blood, for the balas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is also for the balas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>His brow lifted and his voice dropped. \u201cPlease don\u2019t curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d This wasn\u2019t happening. She was not going to be kept here against her will. She headed for the open glass door, went out onto the balcony and stood directly in the rising sun. The cold air chilled her to the bone, so completely unlike the Rain Forest that she instantly started to shake.</p><p>\u201cTake me home,\u201d she said through chattering teeth. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Remaining in the shadows, Syn crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cCome back in here before you freeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I have is there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family, my friends, a male who cares about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about what you need?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head, hissed at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat you need is here, and you know it. Inside my veins. Red. Sweet. Hot.\u201d</p><p>Around her, the wind picked up, sending her hair one way, then the other. His words made her mouth fill with saliva and her fangs dropped farther. She hated her vampire self in that moment because it made her weak. To his words, to his offer, to the imagery he had just plastered on the canvas of her mind. Maybe even to the thread of possibility that had been lying dormant inside her since the night in her tree house.</p> <p>The night they\u2019d made the balas.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go,\u201d he called out, his eyes locking with hers. \u201cLook at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I want,\u201d she said, weakly now, her tongue running over the surface of her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hungry, Petra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo stay and feed from me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her chest tight with emotion\u2014something she\u2019d been relatively free of for the past twenty-four hours. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to struggle with the question. Even more so with a response. Finally he just shrugged. \u201cInstinctual reaction. My balas is inside you and my instincts call for me to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow clever\u2014and convenient.\u201d She wrapped her arms around herself, rubbed her exposed skin. \u201cAnd when did this new and exciting reaction kick in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhen, Synjon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I fed you, and perhaps even when the balas moved under my hand. All right, love? There it is.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. Even in the cold air, her entire body stilled.</p><p>He tossed his hands up and turned away, calling out, \u201cYes. I admit it. A connection was forged.\u201d He turned in a small circle, faced her again, his body still in shadow. \u201cNot emotional. That is an impossibility. But instinctual.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth started chattering again. \u201cYou sound like a shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps we all have animal in us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be your prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen be my guest.\u201d</p><p>This was madness. That she was even standing here, having a conversation about staying with him in his penthouse in the sky. If he wouldn\u2019t take her back in a flash, she should walk straight past him to the door. Leave. Leave him again.</p> <p>He moved to the very edge of the darkness. \u201cPlease come inside, Petra.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure, couldn\u2019t swear to it, but there might have been a brief glimmer of apprehension within his gaze. As if he\u2019d heard her thoughts, her plans. But was the apprehension for the balas alone?</p><p>Snow began to fall the moment she left the terrace. She walked back through the glass doors, closed them behind herself, then moved into the shadows with Syn.</p><p>Instantly, he threw something black and warm and soft around her shoulders. She wanted to melt into it. Into him. And she despised herself for all of it, for being so weak.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he said, his voice soft near her ear. \u201cStay until the balas is born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d she whispered as much to herself as to him.</p><p>\u201cI will give you my vein whenever you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo obliging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just realize my duty now.\u201d</p><p>Why was she doing this? Standing here, listening to him? \u201cMaybe it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sacrifice the balas\u2019s well-being for unnecessary pride.\u201d</p><p>She whirled on him, nostrils flared. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>He had the audacity to look confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo the manipulative route with me. I\u2019ve been caring for this child since its conception.\u201d</p><p>With a slow release of breath, he sat down on the arm of a rich brown buttery-looking leather couch. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>Still bristling, Petra stared at him. What the hell? An apology from Synjon Wise? Was the world coming to an end? Or did he truly have a change of heart? Had this connection he believed he had with the balas altered him somehow? And so much that he was willing to feed and keep her until it was born?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think about that. What to believe. What to hope for. She had so much anger and resentment inside her for him, for what he\u2019d done to her father in the dungeon of Erion\u2019s castle. Gods, what he still wanted to do to her father.</p><p>Her breath caught as, inside her womb, the balas moved, stretched, warned her that if she didn\u2019t give it what it required soon, things would return to normal.</p><p>And that normal had been pretty much a living hell.</p><p>She pulled the blanket closer around her, keeping out the chill and the strange notions of a male changed. But notions still managed to push through, their hopeful warmth poking at her to believe, to accept. \u201cThis would be only until the balas is born.\u201d</p><p>Syn nodded, his eyes flashing with momentary satisfaction. He\u2019d won.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cTo the Rain Forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the bear shifter.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed with melancholy. \u201cIf he\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>Synjon\u2019s gaze moved over her face. From lips to cheeks to eyes. \u201cOh, he\u2019ll have you, love. Who in their right mind could resist you?\u201d Then he stood and gestured for her to follow him. \u201cCome. I\u2019ll show you where you\u2019ll hang your hat.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>Synjon knew as he led her through the penthouse that what he\u2019d just proposed, what he\u2019d just done by stealing her away and offering her his home and his blood, was practically begging for trouble.</p><p>The one and only goal he\u2019d had was to bring Cruen here, and instead he\u2019d brought the paven\u2019s daughter.</p><p>Forget emotions. Clearly he was without intelligence as well.</p><p>When he reached the door of the spare bedroom, he stayed where he was and let her pass. \u201cYou should find everything you need here, except of course for clothing and personal things. But we\u2019ll get that tonight, yes?\u201d</p><p>She stared at the large, modern bed in the center of the room, with its steel frame and pale gray linens, then turned to look at him. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to the Rain Forest?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the shimmer of eagerness, of hopefulness, in her blue eyes. \u201cNo. We can get it all here in Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want you buying me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake, love,\u201d he replied, laughing at the absurdity, \u201cI have more money than I could spend in a thousand lifetimes. Don\u2019t put a meaning on it that\u2019s not there. I took you from your closet\u2014you\u2019ll need another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get me a closet, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d His gaze moved over her. \u201cWe\u2019ll go shopping tonight.\u201d</p><p>That shimmer of hopefulness changed to a glint of wickedness. \u201cI thought you had guests coming.\u201d</p><p>Guests.</p><p>Right.</p><p>He was expecting the usual suspects at midnight. And one special friend, if the paven had news to share. His gaze moved about the room. It looked so sparse. Cold, even. He hadn\u2019t noticed it before. Shite, he\u2019d been in here only once or twice since he moved in. Would such a dim, modern room displease her? Make her uncomfortable? Make her miss the rustic warmth of her home in the Rain Forest?</p><p>He would have to fix that.</p><p>That, and other things.</p><p>\u201cNo guests tonight, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what color do you fancy?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, looking as confused by his behavior as he was. \u201cYou mean, what\u2019s my favorite color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen. I like green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He cleared his throat, nodded in the direction of the bed. \u201cCall your family. They\u2019ll be worried.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were as wide as plates and her lips were parted as if she couldn\u2019t figure out what to say. She glanced over her shoulder at the phone, then back at him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>Join the bloody club, veana. He didn\u2019t know what had gotten into him, what was spurring this sudden need to make her comfortable, make her feel at home. He just knew he couldn\u2019t fight it.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest, Petra.\u201d He turned around to leave.</p><p>\u201cSo, what? You\u2019re not afraid I\u2019ll have them come and get me?\u201d she called after him.</p><p>Synjon\u2019s lips twitched. Saying anything more about favorite colors\u2014now that was a legitimate fear. But keeping Petra and the balas by his side? Not so much.</p><p>\u201cJust let me know when you\u2019re hungry, love,\u201d he called before closing the door and heading for his study.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cNow they\u2019re both gone!\u201d</p><p>After finding the caves empty, Phane and Dani had flown the party back to the lion shifter\u2019s land. While the Romans searched the river cabin, Phane, Helo, Dillon, and Wen returned to the family home.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard took her somewhere,\u201d Dani said, bursting through the front door. \u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d Phane asked, following her. \u201cHe\u2019s only wanted to get away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She charged into the first bedroom, nose lifted, eyes narrowed. \u201cWho can explain asshole?\u201d</p><p>Phane heard Helo chuckle from the room next door.</p><p>Once the house was searched, they all met up in the living area. Everyone except Wen. The older female had told them she was going to contact the faction leaders, let them know the situation. But Phane wondered if she truly just needed a moment alone. She\u2019d looked stricken after leaving the caves.</p><p>Hands on her hips, Dani surveyed them all expectantly. \u201cWell? What\u2019re we going to do? Where are we going to look first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should split up,\u201d Helo said. \u201cTake different sections of the forest.\u201d</p><p>Once again, the door opened and both the Romans and Petra\u2019s brothers entered the house.</p><p>\u201cNothing at the river cabin,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cBut Lucian stayed behind just in case they show up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dani nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d She turned to Sasha and Val. \u201cWhat about you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to search on foot,\u201d Sasha said. \u201cAsk every shifter we come across if they\u2019ve seen either one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the sky,\u201d Dani said. She glanced at Phane. \u201cI could use some help up there. You interested?\u201d</p> <p>Phane\u2019s hawk stirred. \u201cVery interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to buy time with the Order,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cCruen\u2019s disappeared. He wasn\u2019t in the caves with us. I lost track of him. That\u2019s not going to go over well. Especially if he\u2019s back, standing before Feeyan and telling her that two Purebloods are missing on shifter land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help with ground cover,\u201d Alex said, \u201cthen flash into Manhattan when it gets dark.

She looked disheveled, wide-eyed, but the fear in her expression had dimmed somewhat. \u201cShe\u2019s not here, not in the Rain Forest. She\u2019s with him. He took her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfuckingbelievable!\u201d Dani called out. She headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. I\u2019m going to kick some douchy vampire ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dani,\u201d Wen said, going after her. \u201cStop. She doesn\u2019t want us to come.\u201d</p><p>With a low growl, Dani turned to face Petra\u2019s mother. \u201cWen, that\u2019s the douchy vampire talking, not Pets.\u201d</p><p>The older female shook her head. \u201cI heard the truth in her voice. She\u2019s agreed to stay with him.\u201d</p><p>Dani shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Dani stared hard at the female. \u201cGoddamn it.\u201d She turned away, then back. \u201cWhy? Why would she be so freaking stupid? He\u2019s a jerk. He\u2019s a whore. He\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the blood,\u201d Phane said simply.</p><p>The female whirled on him, her eyes narrowed. She sidled up to him, her finger pointed in his face. The heat coming off of her was so damn intense, Phane nearly reached out to grab her. But Dillon\u2019s words stopped him.</p><p>\u201cThis changes everything, you know?\u201d The jaguar shifter sighed as she headed for the door. \u201cGod, I hate this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dani called after her, turning away from Phane. \u201cGo appease the vampire Order. But what about us? What about the shifters? One of ours has been taken now. From shifter land to bloodsucker territory. Maybe we\u2019re the ones who\u2019ll have to infiltrate to get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not yours,\u201d Phane said, watching her, admiring the passion in her. Her ferocity, her loyalty, made his hawk scratch and stir. \u201cShe\u2019s not shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is none of your business,\u201d she warned him. \u201cMy best friend is out there, pregnant and with a male who doesn\u2019t truly care for her. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s agreeing to this\u2014if it\u2019s really about blood or something far more problematic\u2014but I\u2019m sure as hell going to find out.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Petra woke feeling groggy, emotional, and hungry. She lay on top of the covers in the bed she had agreed to sleep in every night until the balas arrived.</p><p>She blinked and rolled to her other side. The room was dimly lit, but she could make out the dark gray walls, stark white molding, expensive leather chairs, antique dresser, and the door to her own private bath, well enough. She\u2019d already been in the bathroom. Massive stone shower, white towels everywhere, and a whirlpool tub. It was like a fancy hotel. Not that she\u2019d been in all that many fancy hotels during the months in New York, when she was looking for Cruen, but the one she had been in reminded her an awful lot of this one.</p><p>A wave of melancholy moved over her and she moaned against it, then took a deep breath into her lungs.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want that back. The intense, overwhelming wave of feeling. The pain. The tears she couldn\u2019t control no matter how hard she tried. She looked over at the closed door. Where was he? Her sexy prick of a blood donor. His bedroom? The living room? If she called to him, how fast would he be at her side?</p><p>She moaned again. Not from the emotional waves crashing through her this time, but from the foolishness of her thoughts. If she dared to attach romance or sensuality or connection to this agreement, she was basically inviting him to hurt her again. What she needed to keep in the forefront of her mind at all times was that he didn\u2019t want her in the way she deserved to be wanted.</p><p>It was as simple as that.</p><p>She sat up and swung her legs off the bed, wondered what time it was as she padded across the room and opened the door. There wasn\u2019t a clock in her room, and with all the shading to keep the sunlight out, not to mention the time difference, she was a bit turned around.</p><p>Silence greeted her as she headed down the hall and entered the living area. She couldn\u2019t help but look around at all the beautiful, yet starkly cold furnishings. Even with the warm light of three or four table lamps, the emotionless space felt dead. The walls, though painted a rich cocoa, were bare, except for one near the kitchen. On it were six gigantic slabs of pointed metal. They look like fangs, she thought.</p><p>She moved toward it, feeling both intrigued and intimidated by its audacity. Why this piece? she wondered, following it past the kitchen and down another hallway. When all the other walls lay bare, why such a blatant scream of ferocity? Looking closely, she saw that the final shard of metal was the color of caramel and longer than the others. She reached out to touch it, then hissed as her skin met the surface.</p><p>\u201cNot what you\u2019d expect, is it?\u201d Synjon said, coming up behind her.</p><p>Instantly, her body reacted to his nearness: fangs down, skin going tight, breath hitching in her lungs. Damn it. This was not a good start to her plan for keeping herself detached.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d she said, touching the metal again.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it\u2019d be cold. Metal is supposed to be cold.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in quick judgment. A cautionary moral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She turned around to face him, bracing herself for the heat of his stare, the strength of his presence. But he was no longer behind her. For a second, she wondered if he\u2019d been there at all. Then he called out to her from another room, \u201cHungry, love?\u201d</p><p>She followed his voice, past the hot caramel metal and down a dark hallway. Warm yellow light grew brighter and wider, and she seemed to step inside it, or through it, into a shockingly spacious bedroom suite.</p><p>Oh, gods, this was bad.</p><p>Petra desperately wanted to take in every inch, every color, fabric, chair, lamp, fireplace, and headboard, but her gaze refused to part with the six-foot-three-inch hard-bodied male who stood in the very center of it all.</p><p>Clearly he\u2019d just come from the shower. His black hair was wet and slicked back from his sharp-angled face, making his dark eyes and heavy mouth pop. A white towel was wrapped loosely around his hips, and a few remaining droplets of water glistened on his broad chest and ripped abdominals. It was probably the worst thing for a female trying to pretend she wasn\u2019t hungry for more than blood to see.</p><p>She swallowed the saliva that was pooling in her mouth. Pressed back on the tips of her fangs with her tongue as they started to descend.</p><p>His eyes flashed with heat. \u201cDo I have time to throw on some clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was out of her mouth before she could bite it back.</p><p>He grinned. Then brought his wrist to his mouth and bit down.</p><p>Just the action made her moan, made her knees soften, made her insides turn to liquid.</p><p>His eyes lifted to meet hers. \u201cApologies, love. Maybe you would\u2019ve liked to bite.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, it was as if Petra were two beings: the emotionally injured female who wanted so desperately to be cared for and loved but knew she\u2019d never find it here, and the hunter, the vampire, the starved veana in swell who wanted to drink the blood of this male until he begged her to stop.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d she said, her tone almost foreign to her own ears.</p><p>Dark brows lifted over darker eyes.</p><p>\u201cOn the bed,\u201d she continued. \u201cBack to the sheets.\u201d</p><p>Syn\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cIs this feeding time or something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why I\u2019m here,\u201d she said, moving toward him, stalking him like prey. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>When she stood before him, she took his wrist, cradled it in her hands. She brought it to her mouth and lapped at the blood. One slow stroke with her tongue across his skin. She heard his sharp intake of breath. Oh, gods, the taste was heavenly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I must lie down why?\u201d he asked in a guttural voice.</p><p>She looked up and grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDizzy?\u201d He chuckled, low and sensually. \u201cCrikey, veana. You underestimate my stamina if you think one feed from my wrist will render me heady.\u201d</p><p>Her grin widened. \u201cI\u2019m not just going to feed from your wrist.\u201d</p><p>His smile evaporated.</p><p>She pushed him back on the bed, upsetting his towel. He didn\u2019t seem to notice\u2014his eyes were locked on her. But Petra noticed. Her gaze flickered to the heavy muscle between his legs. It was surrounded by dark hair, pulsing with thick veins and standing straight up like steel, only the head still covered by the white cotton. Her fangs dropped low and she crawled onto the bed after him. Blood dripped from his wrist and she wanted it.</p><p>Gods help her, she wanted everything he had on display.</p><p>In her mouth, inside her sex.</p><p>She shook her head, tried to think clearly through her fog of feral desire. But it was useless. Hunger ruled every part of her. Only feeding would satiate her now.</p><p>She knelt beside him, took his wrist once again and thrust her fangs deep into his vein. She heard him curse, then moan, then curse again. Blood rushed into her mouth, cascaded like the most delectable waterfall down her throat. She gripped him tightly, suckled his skin, pulled and gorged like he was her lifeline, and goddamn it, maybe he was. Maybe that was exactly what he was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the hot metallic liquid moved down her throat, catching every inch of her insides, heating them, cooling them, her outside tingled with arousal. She remembered when he\u2019d drunk from her in the tree house. This was the same. The sensuality, the need to be close, the desire to feel him inside her as she thrust her fangs deep.</p><p>Was this how it was going to be every time she needed blood? Would she be able to curb this desire? Would she be able to remember who this male was? What he was? And gods, what he was not?</p><p>Feeling his vein close, Petra pulled her fangs out and lifted her head. She licked at his wound and watched it heal instantly. It never ceased to amaze her how the power of a Pureblood veana could heal a male.</p> <p>She lifted her head, found him watching her. His eyes were nearly black, and his own fangs were resting sharply against his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cDizzy yet?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot from the blood loss, love,\u201d he uttered darkly.</p><p>Her hunger barely satiated, Petra dropped his wrist and leaned in close. She wanted his neck. She loved that vein. The blood from that vein was always the sweetest.</p><p>Before she struck, she caught his gaze. It was threaded with desire. But unemotional desire. Detached lust.</p> <p>She hated it.</p><p>And yet her fangs and her belly and the balas all pushed her onward. They didn\u2019t need this male to have emotion or care. They just needed his blood.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t last, veana,\u201d he whispered suddenly.</p><p>Her lips parted, fangs completely descended, she nodded. \u201cI know. Until the balas is born\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not what I mean. I mean I won\u2019t last. Feeding you.\u201d A soft growl rumbled in his throat. \u201cI need to feed too, or I\u2019ll be an empty husk of shite in a few days.\u201d</p><p>Petra shivered at his words. Not with repulsion or irritation or dread, but with awareness. As if her body were separate from her mind. As if it knew on a very basic level what it was meant to do with a male vampire who requested blood.</p> <p>She\u2019d felt the beginnings of it in the tree house so many months ago.</p><p>Now it was a driving force.</p><p>\u201cI could take animal blood,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re vampire. How does animal blood sound to you?\u201d</p><p>She must\u2019ve made a face because he laughed and said, \u201cYes. Exactly. I will need a female\u2019s blood, Petra.\u201d</p><p>Her entire lower half went tight and tingly. How was it that just his words, a suggestion, a request, could send her body up in flames? It was so dangerous, how ready and willing her body was to give this male what he wanted. What he required.</p><p>\u201cYes, Synjon,\u201d she said, her breasts tightening at the very thought of his fangs inside her again. \u201cAfter I take my fill, you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>He exploded. \u201cBloody hell! Never!\u201d He jerked away from her, his eyes going completely black.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You just said . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not drinking from you.\u201d</p><p>It was ice water on a blazing fire, quick and painful. The heat inside her drained out, and she flashed him her fangs. \u201cSomething wrong with my blood, paven?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me with this?\u201d she hissed. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here, offering myself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are females available for the task,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be right\u2014\u201d</p><p>She reached out and slapped him across the face. Hard. Then gasped at her action\u2014her reaction. Stunned, shaking her head, nostrils flaring, she started to scramble off the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh, my gods,\u201d she muttered, embarrassed, sickened. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Petra.\u201d In one easy movement, Syn picked her up and placed her on top of him, her legs straddling his hips.</p><p>She refused to look at him. She was such an idiot. She got her feet under her and tried to get away again, but he held her backside firmly in his hands.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, veana. I cannot feed from you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my gods, this was torture. \u201cI know, okay? You\u2019ve already made that clear. So why are you keeping me here?\u201d She struggled to get free again, but his grip was like steel. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You want the vein in my neck, and bloody hell, I want you to take it.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d placed her on top of him, Petra realized that she wasn\u2019t just straddling his hips\u2014her sex was resting on his cock. His hard, nearly uncovered cock.</p><p>Heat surged into her lower half, and she squeezed the muscles in her pussy. She couldn\u2019t help herself. It was such a goddamn tease. She wanted him inside her. Deep. Like he\u2019d been before. Like she remembered. All the way to her womb. Until she lost her breath.</p><p>\u201cTake it, Petra,\u201d he commanded, his fingers gripping her tightly.</p><p>Her eyes found his and held.</p><p>\u201cDrain me.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cSo you can go find that female to feed from?\u201d she whispered. Christ, she sounded like a meek little mouse, not like a Pureblood vampire with razor-sharp fangs and impossible strength.</p><p>Synjon\u2019s eyes filled with heat, and he sat up quickly, catching her when she jerked backward. When they were face-to-face, he gripped her ass in his palms. \u201cI cannot feed from you,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, \u201cbecause it would take from the balas.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted to one side as if she hadn\u2019t heard him correctly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t steal blood from the balas.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. His eyes were so intelligent, hard, filled with passion, and she realized just what he was saying. And what it meant. He did truly care about her child. The idea equally worried and enchanted her, and before she knew what she was doing, she buried her hands in his hair, pulled his head back, and bit his neck. Hard.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groaned, gripping her, his fingers pressing into her lower back.</p><p>Blood poured into Petra\u2019s mouth, and she drank greedily. Gods, if she could just have his cock inside her while she fed. If he could pump slowly in and out as the blood ran down her throat.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t have that.</p><p>He cared about the balas, not about her.</p><p>His hands raked down her hips and cupped her ass, drawing a moan from her throat in between swallows. His cock pressed against the seam of her covered pussy, begging for access. And while she continued to drink, she ground herself against him until they were both breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cPetra,\u201d he uttered in the sexiest voice she\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>Her belly more than full, she eased her fangs out of his vein, then licked the wound until it closed. When she lifted her head and locked eyes with the paven who\u2019d just fed her, she nearly gasped. It wasn\u2019t the Synjon she\u2019d known in the past few days. This one with his curled lip and glowing eyes was still ultrasexual and sharp as a polished blade, but his expression also revealed vulnerability.</p><p>Vulnerability that he was attempting to mask.</p><p>But Petra could see it was there.</p><p>What did it mean? How was it possible? His emotions were gone. Vulnerability was the very root of emotion, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>And then, as if the expression behind his eyes weren\u2019t enough, he brought his hand between her legs and touched her. Lightly, gently, he ran his fingers up and down the seam of the jeans covering her pussy. She stared at him, knowing he felt just how hot and wet she was.</p><p>It was too much. The power he had, the desperation she felt. In that moment, with his hands on her body and his eyes claiming her soul, she knew she\u2019d do whatever he asked of her. Anything. Anything to continue to feel this way.</p><p>She pushed away from him, scrambled off the bed, and ran out of the room. Her body was on fire, her breasts ached, and juices ran from her cunt like honey from a jar. She knew she was acting irrationally, but she had to get away from him before she melted into a puddle.</p><p>She hurried down the hallway, through the living area and into her bedroom. Breathing heavily, her cheeks flaming from his blood, she slammed the door behind her and went into the bathroom. Thank gods it had a lock. She leaned forward and cranked on the water in the shower, then dropped back against the door and slipped her hand into the waistband of her jeans.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d followed her. She didn\u2019t care. All that mattered in that moment was coming, and coming hard. She pushed past her underwear, wished she could rip it off, and found her wet slit.</p><p>\u201cAhhh,\u201d she whispered, turning her head so her cheek rested against the cool wood. \u201cGods, yes.\u201d</p><p>She sent her other hand too, and while one opened her lips wide, the other circled her swollen clit. What she wouldn\u2019t give for Syn\u2019s long, rock-hard cock inside her right now.</p><p>Just the thought had her moaning, juices running down her thighs. She stopped the circle movement and started working the ridge of her clit, up and down until her mind went blank.</p><p>She heard something on the other side of the door. A knock or a scratch. She couldn\u2019t tell. She didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cGetting wet, Petra?\u201d</p><p>His voice. That sexy growl carried, even over the onslaught of the shower water hitting the tiles.</p><p>\u201cI scent you,\u201d he called. \u201cThrough the wood. Fuck, I followed you down the bloody hall like a dog in heat.\u201d</p><p>She pulled herself wider, flicked her clit so lightly she groaned with irritation at herself. What was she doing? Prolonging it? Drawing it out as he talked her through her climax?</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve gladly taken care of that problem, love. All you had to do was ask.\u201d</p><p>Panting, she pressed down on her clit.</p><p>\u201cAre your eyes closed, veana?\u201d</p><p>Moaning, she slipped the fingers that were holding her sex open deep into her pussy.</p><p>\u201cDo you see me on my knees before you?\u201d he called. \u201cDo you see my fangs descend? Do you see them bracket your swollen clit as I lick you? My strokes so quick, you lose your breath . . .\u201d</p><p>Light flashed on the backs of Petra\u2019s eyelids and she cried out.</p><p>\u201cDo you see my tongue sliding all the way down the ridge of your clit? Do you feel it thrusting up inside your cunt, fucking your drenched pussy until you come? All the way down my dry throat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Impaled on her fingers, her thumb pressing hard on her clit, Petra screamed. She didn\u2019t mean to. But the feeling, the shock to her system, the words, his voice, it all sent her rocketing out of her body and into the heavens. Convulsing, moaning, she pressed back against the door and just let the waves of climax roll over her.</p><p>11</p><p>Standing on the other side of the door, his hand wrapped around his cock, Synjon stroked himself in time to the breathy moans of Petra coming down from climax.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t what he wanted, how and where he wanted it, but hearing her, scenting her\u2014verbally fucking her\u2014had made him absolutely mad with desire.</p><p>He wanted.</p><p>Her.</p><p>In a way he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t quantify.</p> <p>Fuck, what was happening to him? he wondered as he let his head fall forward against the wood, his hand moving quicker now. Getting off was a purely physical act. No connection, no intense desire for anything more than a body to move against. And yet . . .</p><p>He groaned, feeling the early shocks of climax.</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d Petra called through the door.</p><p>His dick swelled just from her voice.</p><p>\u201cI scent you too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he muttered. She should know. She should know how physically insane she was making him.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me hungry.\u201d</p><p>Come leaked from the head of his cock. \u201cFor blood?\u201d he asked through a throaty groan.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell, woman . . .\u201d His strokes quickened.</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d she fairly whispered. \u201cIn my mouth.\u201d</p><p>That was all it took. Just that simple yet erotic admission for his body to shake and his dick to explode. He cursed and sucked in air as he stroked the come from his cock.</p><p>With the last few groans of release, he rubbed his forehead on the door. Back and forth. What were they doing? And what the hell had he allowed inside his home\u2014the very place he was supposed to be welcoming a captive?</p><p>\u201cSyn . . .\u201d</p> <p>Her voice was breathy and pained. Hunger raged within him, and he knew that if she opened the door he was going to pounce, thrust his fangs into her throat like he wanted to thrust his cock into her sex. Even now, the urge to knock down the wood that stood between them and take what his body felt belonged to it was dangerously strong.</p><p>He needed to get away from her for a while. Return to being the nonemotional bastard who cared about one thing and one thing only.</p><p>Vengeance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back when it\u2019s dark,\u201d he told her, pushing away from the door.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go shopping alone,\u201d she said. \u201cOr another night. Maybe you need to find blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. Couldn\u2019t hear anymore. Not about blood. Not right now.</p><p>\u201cJust be ready, love,\u201d he said, then left the room and closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The Order was not gathered at their long table in the reality of sand when Dillon found them. Instead, all nine were in a remote mountain credenti in Colorado. Teaching and preaching, Dillon called it. It was something the Order of old liked to do to keep track of the Pures and Impures inside the credenti walls. Some credentis really dug the visits, especially if they were Impure heavy. Sebastian, the Impure credenti member with the movie-star looks who\u2019d been chosen after all three of Gray\u2019s Impure Resistance buddies refused the position, was an interesting guy. He had a great backstory and worked well as a go-between with the Order, and Dillon was pretty sure Feeyan and the rest of them liked him a whole helluva lot better than they liked her.</p><p>And with what she was about to reveal, that moderate amount of dislike was about to get upgraded to full-blown loathing.</p><p>Seated in a large chair between two massive pine trees, Feeyan turned away from the ten or so credenti members and their discussion on cold-weather agriculture and looked up expectantly at Dillon.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she began imperiously, \u201cdo you have our Purebloods or is a war between the vampires and the shifters imminent?\u201d</p><p>The veana was ridiculously dramatic sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t have them.\u201d</p><p>Feeyan\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cSo a war then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No war.\u201d Dillon sighed. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer in the Rain Forest.\u201d</p><p>The leader of the Order looked surprised. Clearly, she hadn\u2019t expected this development at all. She leaned back in her chair, which was a little too much like a throne for Dillon\u2019s taste. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dillon stepped back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not pretend you don\u2019t have friends and family involved here.\u201d Her white eyes narrowed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be beyond your scope to lie to me to protect them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Dillon muttered. She really hated this job.</p><p>\u201cBring them before me,\u201d Feeyan commanded.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a veana who uses humor to convey her wishes?\u201d</p><p>Dillon had to bite her tongue against saying what the veana did look like to her. And it rhymed with \u201cwitch\u201d! \u201cI\u2019ll try, okay, but they\u2019re free Purebloods living outside the Rain Forest. If they don\u2019t want to come I can\u2019t make them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear me. Why can\u2019t you be more like Sebastian?\u201d Feeyan said, turning her gaze from Dillon and eyeing the handsome Impure male, who was speaking to a group of Impures near a large campground. \u201cWhy do I have to pull everything from you? Remind you what you are now? What you signed on for? It\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><p>Dillon\u2019s lip curled. You want to talk annoying, lady?</p><p>\u201cJust find a way and bring them,\u201d Feeyan said. \u201cNow, if there\u2019s nothing else . . .\u201d</p><p>Dillon didn\u2019t move. She wanted to. More than anything. But she was bound by their stupid Order code, and she had to report the newest problem in the shifter world.</p><p>\u201cCruen\u2019s still there,\u201d she said. \u201cSomewhere. In the Rain Forest. He took off, and we can\u2019t find him.\u201d</p><p>That bit of news brought the white-haired veana\u2019s attention right back. \u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Romans, the shifters, the mutore. You know, the whole lot. We all looked for him.\u201d</p><p>Feeyan didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. She seemed to be thinking, processing. Maybe even wondering how important Cruen\u2019s life was to her. Finally she released a heavy breath and said, \u201cTwelve hours. Tell your band of fools to find him or I will be going to the Rain Forest myself.\u201d</p><p>F.U.C.K.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s funny, Order Member Nine,\u201d Feeyan said evenly. \u201cI would say that Cruen\u2019s more committed to preserving the lives of vampires than you will ever be. But we know why that is, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Burn, Feeyan, Dillon thought with a mental eye roll. \u201cLook, I know you wish you could have the great and powerful bastard of the Eternal Breed back on the Order, but you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d And I\u2019m stuck with you. Dillon gave Feeyan a big old grin. \u201cI suggest you get used to it.\u201d</p><p>She flashed from the pine forest before Feeyan even had a chance to respond.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>When Syn had come to her room to pick her up for their evening shopping trip, Petra hadn\u2019t had a clue what to expect. Cab ride to a few places. Maybe a walk to the nearest department store. The last thing in the world she envisioned was a freshly showered, smartly dressed male at her door and a limousine waiting downstairs at the curb.</p><p>Still dressed in her wrinkled Rain Forest clothes, Petra sat in the back of the black stretch limo and glared at the male across from her. He was sitting casually on the black leather, legs bent and spread, like he owned the world.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised one dark eyebrow. It was a good look for him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She pointed to herself. \u201cLook at me.\u201d Then she pointed to him. \u201cNow look at you.\u201d</p><p>He did, then shrugged his powerful shoulders. Again, a really good look for him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the problem,\u201d he said.</p><p>You\u2019re gorgeous. That\u2019s the problem, Bub.</p><p>Utterly and completely and ridiculously gorgeous.</p><p>Again, she pointed to herself. \u201cI\u2019m in a grungy old outfit and you look like a freaking Calvin Klein model.\u201d</p><p>His lip curled. \u201cCalvin Klein? Really. That\u2019s almost as insulting as Abercrombie and Fitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cCome on now, love. I understand you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable in your clothing. We\u2019re about to remedy that.\u201d</p><p>As if to emphasize the point, the car came to a stop before a series of storefronts. When the door opened, Synjon got out, then offered her his hand.</p><p>\u201cCome along, darling.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand, let him help her out of the limo, but once they were on the sidewalk, she eased her fingers from his grasp and said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u2018Darling\u2019?\u201d He gave her a blank stare. \u201cI\u2019m British.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no excuse.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, pointed to where they were headed. As they walked, he leaned over and whispered in her ear. \u201cAfter the day we\u2019ve had, lovely Petra, our nearly dual climaxes separated by only a thin slab of wood, my referring to you as \u2018darling\u2019 shouldn\u2019t seem all that strange.\u201d</p><p>She continued to walk, but her eyes had gone wide and her face hot. She\u2019d really been hoping they weren\u2019t going to talk about the bathroom incident, that maybe they\u2019d even pretend it hadn\u2019t happened. After all, nothing had been said about it since.</p><p>Clearly, she wasn\u2019t that lucky.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked as he held the door of a very beautiful store open for her.</p><p>\u201cRosie Pope,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me look a little less like something that crawled out from under a rock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine. Something that would be acceptable standing next to Synjon Wise, International Male Model.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does it.\u201d He took her shoulders and turned her to face him. \u201cYou, my dear, are the most exquisite creature on this godforsaken planet. I drool every time I look at you. My cock is stiff as we speak. And yet, unfortunately for me, I\u2019ve made a vow to keep my twitching hands off of you.\u201d He grinned. \u201cFor tonight.\u201d</p><p>Petra just stared at him, her mouth open. She was pretty sure everyone in the very beautiful store had heard him. Stiff cocks to twitching hands. She just wanted to burrow into the floor.</p> <p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Wise.\u201d</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Syn greeted the pretty saleswoman with a polite but cool nod. \u201cTake care of her. Give her whatever she needs and fancies.\u201d</p><p>The woman fairly beamed. \u201cOf course, Mr. Wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in, say, an hour and a half?\u201d</p> <p>Petra turned to him. \u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something to take care of.\u201d His voice suddenly took on a rough, sexy timbre. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a male hanging around here helping you pick out knickers and the like, do you?\u201d</p><p>Petra heard a few feminine giggles behind her. \u201cWell, not a male who says \u2018knickers\u2019 with a straight face.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cCheers, love.\u201d</p><p>Along with every other set of female eyes in the place, Petra\u2019s watched him walk out the door and head for the limousine. She wondered where he was going. If he was going to meet someone. A female someone.</p><p>Oh, gods.</p> <p>There was no end to her ridiculousness. She needed some clothes. That was it. End of story.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we start with, Mrs. Wise? Undergarments? Casual day wear?\u201d The saleswoman grinned. \u201cOr should we go straight to the fun stuff? Evening gowns?\u201d</p><p>Petra was going to correct the woman. Tell her she wasn\u2019t a Mrs. Anything, but before she could utter a word, three women came forward with three of the most beautiful dresses she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>She sighed at the wondrous sight. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we start with the fun stuff.\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>\u201cDo we have a new plan, sir?\u201d</p><p>Cruen didn\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t even acknowledge the guard beside him as they moved through the forest by way of the river. His strength was waning, and he had to fight to keep hold of his mental state. It had taken all his reserves to keep himself hidden from the Romans, particularly Lucian Roman, as they searched the river cabin.</p><p>But one thing was certain, confirmed by the brothers as they worked out their next move. Synjon had taken Petra from the Rain Forest and brought her home to Manhattan.</p> <p>Back to New York City.</p><p>Cruen felt the frustration all the way inside his bones. This had been a pointless, fruitless trip. A waste of everything. And now the paven was on his home turf. Cruen knew he didn\u2019t have the strength to deal with Synjon there. Not with just the one guard. And the more vampire flesh he brought into this problem, the higher the body count would be later.</p><p>But what choice did he have? The Order would be of no help to him now. He must flash home, gather his small army, and attack. If he didn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t going to survive. Not in body or in mind. He could feel it. And he had to survive. For his work, his never-ending goal of bringing about the ultimate vampire. He had been so close. The power of the Devil, Abbadon, within his grasp. Now the male was dead by his daughter\u2019s hand, and Cruen had been stripped of the mediocre amount of magic he\u2019d had left.</p><p>No. He had no choice but to take on Synjon Wise anywhere he could get to him.</p><p>He heard a splash to his left, and then something darted out in front of him. His reaction time was slow, but his guard had already rounded the creature and had a blade to the young male\u2019s neck in under a second.</p><p>Pale brown hair was pulled back in a tie, and dark green eyes found and held Cruen\u2019s. The young male didn\u2019t appear frightened by what he saw. On the contrary. He seemed quite eager.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, shifter?\u201d Cruen asked. \u201cWhy do you jump upon us as though you wish to attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you,\u201d the male rasped, his tone high and excited. \u201cI thought I recognized you when you traveled the river earlier.\u201d</p><p>A small thread of unease moved through Cruen\u2019s already tired body.</p><p>The young male grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me?\u201d</p><p>Cruen inspected the male. \u201cNo. What is this? What game do you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took samples from my mother a long time ago.\u201d The male waited for that to sink in, then continued. \u201cI helped you, remember? I was very young. No more than three. You gave me a small dagger to play with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater shifter,\u201d Cruen uttered, his mind darting backward, all the way to the first set of shifter samples he\u2019d taken.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the young male happily. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Cruen motioned for his guard to drop the blade and step back. \u201cLooking for one of my kind.\u201d</p><p>The male nodded sagely. \u201cThe vampire male. Petra\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>The male shrugged. \u201cEveryone knows. But they\u2019ve left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cruen ground out. Clearly, it was time to go. There was no reason to remain here. Not to hike around aimlessly, or catch up on the past.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to,\u201d the male said as if hearing his thoughts. He stepped forward. \u201cMy family, my faction, would love to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould they?\u201d Cruen said with disinterest.</p><p>The male nodded. \u201cMy faction is also interested in science. In fact\u201d\u2014he lowered his voice\u2014\u201cwe believe we may have found a way to slow aging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Cruen said without much enthusiasm. \u201cBut unless you\u2019ve developed something that infuses the body with power, magic, or strength, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to take a rain check.\u201d</p><p>Cruen motioned the guard to leave. The male had claimed he couldn\u2019t flash inside the shifters\u2019 forest, so they needed to return to the gathering stones. He started to walk away, but the young male called after him.</p><p>\u201cWe have something! Something like what you describe!\u201d</p><p>Cruen stopped, turned around, his skin suddenly prickling with keen curiosity. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very new, and has a short shelf life, so to speak. But it has intense power.\u201d The male lifted his dark brows. \u201cInterested now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I am,\u201d Cruen said. \u201cTake me to see your family, shifter. A reunion is definitely in order.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Synjon stepped out of the limousine, glanced around, and righted his cuffs.</p><p>The plans he\u2019d made had taken only an hour, and though he didn\u2019t want to barrel in and interrupt the party, he had this unstoppable need to see Petra.</p><p>No. That wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>What he had was an unstoppable urge to know she and the balas were all right. He blamed it on instinct. Protecting his young and all that. Instinct was the best excuse he could come up with lately for the way he was acting, reacting. The alternative was simply inconceivable. Something about emotional attachment, falling in love, seeing a future.</p><p>The door made a quiet trilling sound as it opened. He hadn\u2019t noticed that before. He moved inside the store, looking for life. Looking for her. When he found neither, he felt a sudden punch of concern compress his gut. What would he do if she\u2019d been taken somehow? If her brothers or the Romans had come, to return her and the balas to the Rain Forest?</p><p>He moved deeper into the shop, heading toward the back, and was about to shout Petra\u2019s name when he saw her emerge from a dressing room. Someone followed her, but Syn took absolutely no notice of the other being. His breath had left his body, and inside his chest something squeezed. Something he\u2019d thought would never stir again.</p><p>Standing in the center of a veritable swimming pool of tissue-paper-lined bags was Petra. Her long, thick, straight dark hair framed her exquisite face, but it was her eyes that made his chest constrict once again. Lined with a thin smudge of coal, her ice-blue orbs popped with color and life, and when she looked up and caught him staring at her, she smiled.</p><p>Instinct, you ruddy bastard, he warned himself. Nothing more. Can\u2019t be anything more. You don\u2019t have it to give. You already gave it away to her father on that cold stone floor.</p><p>\u201cYou like?\u201d she said, her voice uneven, as if she were a little nervous.</p><p>His gaze traveled the length of her. The dress she had on was nearly the same color as her eyes and hugged every inch of her extraordinary body, including her swell. She looked like a fucking princess. He\u2019d never seen anything so beautiful, or so sexy, in his life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stunner, love,\u201d he said, walking toward her.</p><p>Her smile widened. \u201cWell, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d spent an hour on their evening plans, and yet all he wanted to do now was take her home and remove that dress. Slowly. Kissing every inch of skin that was revealed to his hungry gaze.</p><p>\u201cThey said I needed to wear a cocktail dress for tonight?\u201d She narrowed her eyes at him, but in a playful, sensual way that make his cock twitch.</p><p>Yes. Home, bed, naked, kisses, sounds good. And in that order, if you please.</p><p>\u201cThey even had shoes brought over from Barneys,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Mr. Wise?\u201d</p><p>Synjon first turned to the saleswoman, thanked her for her help, then addressed his driver, who had followed him in. \u201cTake care of the bill, then put the bags in the car, please, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, sir.\u201d</p><p>Petra also thanked the saleswoman, who made a beeline for the register, and then she continued her quest for information. \u201cCome on now,\u201d she urged, meeting Syn halfway. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose one could call it a gesture of goodwill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you call it?\u201d</p><p>A date.</p><p>He took her hand, laced his fingers through hers. \u201cYou look fucking incredible,\u201d he said, his eyes locking with hers. \u201cBreathtaking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her cheeks went pink at his compliment, but her expression grew uneasy. \u201cSyn . . . I don\u2019t know if this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said before she had a chance to continue thinking. \u201cI have a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>For most of her life, Petra had existed on flora and fauna, animals and sunsets, fresh, moist air and the entertainment of nights around a roaring fire, filled with laughter and tales of shifters gone long ago.</p><p>Tonight was a revelation.</p><p>A first.</p><p>And as she sat next to Synjon once again in the back of the limousine, she silently prayed it wouldn\u2019t be her last. She loved her life in the forest, never wanted to give it up completely, but this\u2014tonight . . . She was blown away. She was addicted. She had to have more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet,\u201d Syn remarked. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p> <p>All right? She grinned and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no dancing in the Rain Forest?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cNot this kind. Not costumes and leaps and women dancing on their toes to the most beautiful music in the world.\u201d</p><p>Clearly pleased with her assessment, Syn smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy it, Mr. Wise.\u201d She was pretty sure her eyes were two limpid pools of dreamy female. \u201cI\u2019m transformed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThen we must do it again.\u201d He reached down and removed her shoes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEase back on the seat, love.\u201d He brought her feet to his lap and began to rub the soles. \u201cJust a little massage.\u201d</p><p>She sighed at the instant relief she felt and let her head fall to the side against the leather before she uttered a breathy \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that females in swell appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did you hear that from?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up, though his fingers continued to work the bottoms of her feet. \u201cAlexander.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, I guess he would know.\u201d It was so odd to think that both she and her half sister were pregnant at the same time. And yet they hadn\u2019t spent a moment alone together. She wondered if that would change anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cIf you enjoyed the ballet\u201d\u2014he raked his hand up her calf, massaging deep into her muscle, making her feel so good she wanted to groan\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s so much more I can show you, introduce you to. There\u2019s the opera, Broadway. I believe Eels is playing at Webster Hall, and Swedish House Mafia\u2019s over at Barclays. There\u2019s also comedy, a few irritating Christmas shows I\u2019d force myself to watch if it pleased you, and if you appreciate art, I know a Pureblood veana and her twin brother who have a show opening this Friday in Brooklyn.\u201d</p> <p>Between the massage and all the suggestions of what they could do together in the coming nights on the island of Manhattan, Petra felt her rational brain slipping away. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to an art gallery.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid behind her knee, then slowly worked its way back down. Her sex clenched, wishing he would move that hand up between her legs instead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like their work, I think. Whimsical but dark. Fairy tales gone wrong.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in the glow from the red taillights of cars up ahead and internally swooned. He was so gorgeous. Dark hair and eyes, heavy lips and sharp cheekbones, all wrapped up in a perfectly cut charcoal gray suit.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about buying a few pieces for the house. I have all those empty walls. I could use an opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSyn.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at her, his dark brows lowered over those magnetic, impossible-to-read eyes.</p><p>She wanted to stay in the bubble of tonight. The clothes, the compliments, the tutus, and how his hand had reached out and taken hers when the lights in the theater dimmed, then hadn\u2019t released it until they went back on again. After all, she\u2019d spent months, as she searched for her father, fantasizing about just this kind of attention from this exact person.</p><p>But it was all just that. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>A fantasy?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, her tone gentle as she eased her feet and legs from his grasp. \u201cThis\u2014you and me\u2014it was supposed to be all about blood and the balas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re not enjoying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am enjoying it. That\u2019s kind of the problem.\u201d</p><p>His expression was utterly impassive as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t see a problem if you\u2019re enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because these experiences, dates and . . . et cetera . . . well, they don\u2019t mean anything to you.\u201d The words felt like jagged glass in her mouth. \u201cExcept maybe as a precursor to sex.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to argue or make things uncomfortable, because frankly I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that I\u2019m staying here, with you\u2014that the baby needs you. But I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>Yes, Petra. About? Can you say it? Actually get the words out without your head exploding from embarrassment?</p><p>He was staring at her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Here\u2019s what.\u201d She put a hand to her belly. \u201cWe\u2019ve already established that there\u2019s a bond that\u2019s been formed between you and Little Fangs here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to form one between you and me.\u201d</p><p>His expression remained impervious. \u201cBecause of the bear shifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBecause you have no feelings for me besides physical ones. That might\u2019ve been okay in the past. A fun night and nothing more. But I\u2019m about to become a mother. I\u2019m trying to build a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the bear shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez. Does it matter?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he reached down and retrieved her shoes, then slowly, sensually, placed them back on her feet like she was freaking Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cPetra?\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the sound of his voice. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>His gaze lifted, dark eyes under dark, imposing brows. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to name the balas Little Fangs, are you?\u201d he asked as they pulled up in front of his building. \u201cIt\u2019s bloody awful.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>The bear shifter.</p><p>Syn stood on the terrace in the bitter cold and tried to reason with himself. As the wind smacked him in the face, he tried not to think about Petra, about the night they\u2019d just shared, about Little Fangs, and about how right now she was probably in her room removing the goddamn dress he\u2019d fantasized about removing himself.</p><p>The bear shifter.</p><p>She\u2019d been in a real bloody hurry to get away from him after that speech in the car. He turned and leaned back against the stone balustrade. Seconds after entering the apartment, she\u2019d thanked him for a lovely evening and for the clothing, then left him standing like a complete knobhead in the hall.</p><p>The fucking bear shifter.</p><p>He was only interested in the balas? How could she think that after tonight? Was she truly going to make him say it out loud? Admit that something deep and disturbingly wonderful was happening between them?</p><p>He stared through the glass doors and into the apartment. The apartment he\u2019d purchased for only one reason. What the bloody hell was he doing? Out on the terrace pining for the daughter of his enemy? He should be preparing for Cruen, his arrival and his slow progression into pain-filled madness. Here . . . where Petra and the balas were staying . . .</p><p>Ahhhh . . . Bollocks! His mind swam. He was so ruddy conflicted. It had all been so clear before he\u2019d given Petra his blood. With every lick, every suck, every pint, he grew more and more weak with regard to the true goal of his existence.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>Not even for the balas.</p><p>The buzzer at the front door drew his attention.</p><p>Who the hell could that be at this hour? he wondered, heading inside and across the living area. Better not be the Romans, come to talk him out of keeping Petra here. Of course, those three pavens wouldn\u2019t be bothering with the door\u2014a flash to the terrace was more their style.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d came the loudest female voice Syn had ever heard. \u201cTime to party!\u201d</p><p>Standing outside in the hallway, some of them still exiting the elevator, were twenty or so of his most dedicated revelers from the past week. His gaze moved over them, males and females, all sharp and sexy and ready to take down another case of whatever he\u2019d purchased for tonight.</p><p>Problem was, he hadn\u2019t purchased a bloody thing. Not for them, at any rate. In fact, he\u2019d completely forgotten they existed.</p><p>He leaned against the doorjamb and shook his head. \u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>A male who Synjon knew had just come directly from his Broadway show moved to the front of the group. \u201cNot tonight? I thought it was every night, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a few hours.\u201d The woman beside him whined in an irritating baby voice. \u201cI came all the way in from Queens.\u201d</p><p>Synjon stared at the lot of them. Were these the same gits who had practically taken up residence in his apartment every night this week? How had he not noticed how bloody awful they were?</p><p>Another woman, dressed in some kind of leopard print costume, glanced past Syn. \u201cWell, look here. Someone gets to party with you. Who is she?\u201d</p><p>Something moved inside Syn at that moment. Clearly, Petra stood behind him, and he didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s eyes on her. Especially not those of the males in the crowd. He crossed his arms over his chest and stood directly in the doorway. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>The male snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s having a private party, y\u2019all. Let\u2019s blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Petra called out. \u201cI\u2019m only a friend. Come in. Please.\u201d</p><p>Syn turned to look at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Which in turn freed up a good amount of space for the group to push their way into his entry hall.</p><p>Letting the fools move past him, Syn just stared at Petra, who was wearing a set of black loungewear. Her breasts were pushed up, and she looked sexy as hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to curb the partying for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t for you, love,\u201d he lied.</p> <p>\u201cFine. For the balas, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I just don\u2019t feel like dealing with company tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes raked his body. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d</p><p>No, it didn\u2019t.</p><p>The elevator opened again behind him and more people poured into the penthouse.</p> <p>\u201cListen,\u201d she said, \u201cone of these very lovely one-night stands could be your blood donor. Have you thought of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d In fact, the thought repelled him.</p><p>\u201cWell, you should.\u201d She gave him a very tight-lipped smile before turning and walking away.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he called after her.</p><p>\u201cTo my room.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to go with her. Or take her to his room. They could lock the door and remain lost there for days. If he could just get rid of these tossers.</p> <p>Someone turned on his stereo, and music blared from the speakers. He heard the pop of champagne corks. Female voices called to him. But he didn\u2019t even spare the lively living room a glance. It was as though that world, that existence, didn\u2019t include him anymore. He followed Petra. Caught up with her just outside her bedroom.</p><p>Before he could say a word, she turned and leaned against the doorframe. She looked so beautiful. Long dark hair, lush pink lips. And how the fuck was he ever going to get over those eyes? The color and the sharpness and the heat.</p><p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m staying here,\u201d she said softly, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you should stop your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because once you leave, you won\u2019t be stopping yours? Is that what you\u2019re saying, Petra?\u201d</p><p>She released a breath and stepped inside her room. \u201cGood night, Syn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my life,\u201d he said just as she closed the door in his face.</p><p>Fucking bear shifter.</p><p>He turned back and headed down the hall again, completely uninterested in the thirsty crowd that awaited him.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Dillon had never been so thankful to have her mutore brothers near. Helo and Phane bracketed her as she sat at the dining table in Wen\u2019s home and faced the heads of each shifter faction. The ones who governed, counseled, and had divided up the Rain Forest lands long ago to accommodate each species of shifter. The Order\u2019s words\u2014no, Feeyan\u2019s commands\u2014lay heavily on her mind, and she was still pretty clueless as to how to keep the vampire world out of this one.</p><p>She\u2019d sent the Romans and Dani to take care of Syn and Petra, see if the pair would agree to a simple \u201chi and bye\u201d before the other nine. She prayed they would. It would be one less thing for her to deal with.</p><p>\u201cWhy would your Order want a war with us?\u201d said the Avian leader, a small, aged female with bark brown eyes and a pouf of gray hair on top of her head. \u201cWe\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a mix-up,\u201d Dillon explained. \u201cTwo vampires were here, and it was believed they were being held against their will.\u201d</p><p>The leader of the Mountain Beasts, which claimed as its members anything from bear to gorilla to fox, leaned forward on the table. The male looked very young\u2014Dillon would guess not even twenty\u2014but his emerald green eyes held intelligence beyond their years. \u201cYou speak of Petra. And the father of her cub.\u201d</p><p>Dillon nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re gone now,\u201d said the leader of the Plains, his golden cat eyes bright against his deep chocolate skin.</p><p>\u201cYes, but there\u2019s another who remains.\u201d Dillon glanced around the table. \u201cThis vampire was once here a long time ago. He was granted samples of your DNA. I think he\u2019s still here. Maybe he\u2019s hiding among your people, trying to get more samples out of them.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past him.\u201d</p><p>Both the Avian leader and the young Mountain leader looked over at Helo, then Phane, then back to Dillon. \u201cYou are all part shifter, aren\u2019t you?\u201d the male said.</p><p>Helo was the first to speak. \u201cWater. So, Mountain faction, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Phane glanced at the Avian leader. \u201cHawk.\u201d</p><p>The leader of the Plains continued to stare at Dillon. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaguar,\u201d she said simply. \u201cListen, back in our world we\u2019re not prized, not respected. In fact, we\u2019re pretty much thought of as trash.\u201d</p><p>All three leaders recoiled in shock.</p><p>\u201cTrash?\u201d said the Avian female, her bird eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cThis vampire who remains here is responsible for creating us.\u201d Dillon took a deep breath. \u201cHe took your DNA and mixed it with vampire DNA. He\u2019s kind of a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do such a thing?\u201d said the Plains leader.</p><p>\u201cAnd why did we know nothing about it?\u201d asked the Avian female. \u201cWe must go to our shifters and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cBut first we need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d asked the young Mountain leader male, his interest in her and her jaguar clearly visible in his amazing eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find him and bring him back to our leaders.\u201d Dillon looked at each faction leader in turn. \u201cUnharmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if all you are saying is true,\u201d said the Plains leader, \u201che should be exterminated.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Dillon sighed internally. I really hated my job. \u201cYes, he should,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut if Cruen isn\u2019t returned alive, the Order will come.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll bring war.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Damn right she was going to sleep through a party.</p><p>Petra finished brushing her teeth, then turned off the bathroom light and got into bed. She didn\u2019t pull up her covers right away, but instead began rubbing her belly in slow, gentle circles as outside her door the steady, almost rhythmic sounds of conversation were punctuated with the jarring shock of laughter and the heavy beat of a bass line. The baby was really active tonight, moving and pushing against certain internal organs. Petra grinned. Maybe this wasn\u2019t going to be as easy as she thought.</p><p>She was about to reach for the television remote, see what late-night programs were on, when the bass line ceased abruptly, and she heard the most beautiful sound rise above the din. She stilled, drew back against her pillow, and closed her eyes.</p><p>Someone was playing the piano out there, and whoever it was had some serious talent.</p><p>Petra took a deep breath and just focused on the music. As if the balas heard it too, the kicking inside her womb gentled, and a lovely calm moved over the entire room.</p><p>It had been a long time since she\u2019d felt like this. Calm, steady breaths in and out of her lungs as she relaxed, without a worry about the balas, where she was going to get blood she could actually keep down, or her emotional state.</p><p>Granted, this feeling of complete peace couldn\u2019t last. But that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t going to enjoy it while it was here.</p><p>Though the music eased her body, it unfortunately couldn\u2019t eradicate all thoughts from her mind. She wondered if Syn had spotted something he liked out there, something that would satiate his hunger, someone who could take the pinch of his fangs while granting him several pints of her blood.</p><p>A low growl broke from her throat, interrupting the Zen vibe she\u2019d had going on in her bedroom. Shit, if he was drinking from someone right now, it shouldn\u2019t bother her. The idea of his fangs penetrating another female\u2019s skin? Shouldn\u2019t bother her. The image of her blood flowing down his throat, feeding him, sustaining him? Or the sounds, the almost sexual groans of satisfaction when he was finished? Shouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>This time she groaned and rolled onto her side.</p><p>Goddamn it, no, it shouldn\u2019t bother her. After all, feeding would keep him healthy and stable for her and the baby. But . . . it did. It just did.</p><p>In that moment the piano music ended. Strangely and abruptly. Petra stilled, waiting for it to come back. What had happened? She missed the slow, emotional rhythms already. A scream jarred her and sent her gaze to the door. Was that a woman? Close by, loud chatter and the sounds of several pairs of shoes clicking across hardwood could be heard.</p><p>Without a thought, her mouth dry with concern, Petra got out of bed and grabbed her robe. She was just slipping her arm in the fuzzy sleeve, when the door burst open. The earsplitting sounds of about forty retreating partygoers spilled into the room, along with one very pissed-off female shifter.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be shitting me.\u201d</p><p>Petra stared at her best friend. \u201cDani?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you remember my name,\u201d she said, glancing around the room. \u201cThought the evil vampire douche bag might\u2019ve erased your memory along with your rational thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Petra asked, slipping her other arm into the remaining sleeve of her robe.</p><p>The hawk shifter walked into the bedroom and slammed the door. \u201cOh, you know, saving you from making mistake number freaking two, Pets.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>Lucian tossed him a cue, lifting one pale blond eyebrow. \u201cWe do this over pool, Brit Boy.\u201d</p><p>Synjon caught the stick easily, then rounded the table, which was positioned on the far side of his living area. \u201cDo what exactly, Frosty?\u201d</p><p>Lucian\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat the fuck did you just call me?\u201d</p><p>Synjon grabbed the chalk and said nothing. He was thinking about Petra, and all that was being discussed in that spare bedroom. He didn\u2019t like leaving her alone with the hawk shifter. That female hated him. With good reason, but still . . .</p><p>\u201cFrosty?\u201d Lucian repeated. He turned to Nicholas and Alexander, who were standing around the large billiard table with sticks of their own, waiting their turn. \u201cHey, boys. Did Brit Boy here just insult me?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t get emotional, Luca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Alex agreed. \u201cThat would be embarrassing for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Leaning over, Syn adjusted the shaft of his cue stick, aimed, and with an audible crack knocked the cue ball into the stripes and solids. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing,\u201d Lucian said, leaning over directly across from him, setting up his shot while inspecting Syn. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Syn\u2019s eyes flipped up. \u201cThere\u2019s no change. I\u2019m an emotionless bastard. My desires and plans are the same as they always were.\u201d Just waiting for Cruen to come to me, beg me to put him out of his misery. Except maybe that wasn\u2019t his first thought anymore. His gaze shifted toward the spare bedroom. They were taking forever.</p><p>\u201cYou want Cruen,\u201d Lucian said, then sent his cue into the ball, dropping a solid in the right side pocket. \u201cWe want Cruen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Syn glanced at the other two pavens. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat stupid piece-of-shit paven,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cAs usual, he\u2019s made a mess of things. This time in the shifter community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still there?\u201d Syn said before leaning down and sending a striped ball into the far left corner pocket.</p><p>\u201cStill?\u201d Nicholas said, his sharp eyes locking with Syn\u2019s. \u201cHow did you know he was there at all?\u201d</p><p>Bloody brilliant, Mr. Wise. Get your head out of your arse and think before you speak. \u201cPetra made a phone call home, remember? Now. Is he being hunted or made a guest?\u201d</p> <p>Though his gaze remained curious, Nicholas shrugged. \u201cNot sure. Helo, Phane, and Dillon are speaking with the leaders of the factions now, trying to persuade them to go on a little search and capture.\u201d</p><p>Syn didn\u2019t mind the search. It was the capture he was worried about. If the shifters, the Romans, the pussy brothers, or whoever caught Cruen, that would mean a different plan. One that utilized his past skills as a spy.</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d Synjon began. \u201cYou\u2019re here to ask for my help in tracking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alex said, his cue aloft, his focus no longer on the game. \u201cWe need you and Petra to go before the Order\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetra\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d The words were far too quick exiting his mouth. He\u2019d have to watch that.</p><p>All three Roman brothers stared at him, studied him.</p> <p>\u201cWe need you to tell them you were never held against your will,\u201d Nicholas said.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah,\u201d Lucian snorted, leaning over the table to try a difficult shot. He was the only one still in the game. \u201cUnless you want a war brought to the Rain Forest.\u201d</p><p>Synjon once again ventured a glance at the hallway leading to the spare bedroom. \u201cWhy would you think I\u2019d care about the Rain Forest and its occupants?\u201d</p><p>Alexander eyed him, the corners of his mouth kicking up. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe because that\u2019s the home of the pregnant veana you stole and brought here because you\u2019re feeling . . . ?\u201d</p><p>A curl of annoyance went through Syn, but he kept it in check, kept it hidden. For all the things they thought they knew or had noticed about him, they didn\u2019t know shit about what was going on inside him, or with him and Petra, or with him and the balas. Or how he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her, wanting her, wanting the balas, and how with each passing minute he grew more and more protective of them both.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Lucian said, after sending two balls into the left side pocket. \u201cYou gonna be a help? Or are you gonna be a total dickhead with no conscience?\u201d</p><p>Without even looking at the table, Synjon smacked his cue into the ball. But instead of hitting one of his own, he sent the eight ball into the far right pocket. \u201cThat\u2019s a knobhead with no conscience, Frosty.\u201d</p> <p>Luca grinned, broad and excited. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Brit Boy.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Cruen stared at the pale gray flesh and sneered. \u201cWhat do you call this exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCacuba,\u201d said the young water shifter. \u201cIt\u2019s a type of eel.\u201d</p><p>They sat in the low rock caves near a waterfall spring. Several water shifters swam or sunbathed on the rocks like mermaids, while Robes, the young water shifter, and his older sister, Nore, cut up pieces of what they claimed to be magic-infused flesh.</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you believe this gives one power?\u201d Cruen asked, wondering if he\u2019d made a grave mistake in remaining in the Rain Forest, expending his last shreds of mental and physical strength on a hope.</p><p>\u201cWe have used it,\u201d Nore said, her dark eyes wide with excitement. \u201cIn hunting. In our rituals.\u201d</p><p>Cruen took stock of his surroundings. He\u2019d been to this very spot many moons ago, had taken samples from this same species, and yet, as he turned back to the plate of rotting gray flesh that was to make him powerful again, he felt no delight in being here once again. If this was a mistake, if nothing came of it, how could he return to the gathering rocks? Have the strength to return? His guard hadn\u2019t been allowed to follow, and was waiting for him there. To flash him home, or to the table of the Order.</p><p>Flash him.</p><p>Oh, gods, the humiliation at his loss of power grew worse with every breath.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d urged Robes, pushing the plate closer to Cruen. \u201cYou will see.\u201d</p><p>He had fallen. Far and painfully. He grabbed the slimy eel flesh and stuffed it in his mouth. The taste was one of the most vile he\u2019d ever experienced, and instead of chewing, he swallowed it whole.</p><p>\u201cNow you will see,\u201d Nore said, clasping her hands together.</p><p>Yes, Cruen thought, but will I feel? Will I feel power racing through my veins, my blood? Will I be able to flash to the balcony of one Synjon Wise and force him to remove his emotions from my mind?</p><p>Or will I be walking back to the gathering stones, searching, praying to all who will listen that I don\u2019t lose my mind or my breath before I get there?</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Petra sat cross-legged on the bed, picking at the imaginary lint on the new sage green comforter Synjon had insisted on buying her. Across from her, a plush striped green pillow separating them, was Dani.</p><p>It was like old times.</p><p>Except for the digs.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one answer,\u201d Petra said in what she hoped was a firm voice, because Dani rarely responded to anything less.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Dani cocked her head to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re saying this is really about the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s about the baby.\u201d</p><p>The hawk shifter shook her head, disbelieving. \u201cYou need to do your repeats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDani\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, let me go over them with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSynjon Wise is a complete ass-cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, wait.\u201d Petra pointed at her and scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one.\u201d</p><p>Dani shrugged. \u201cWell, you know, they\u2019re all along the same lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Petra said, eyeing her closest friend in the world. \u201cI don\u2019t need to do any of that shit. I\u2019m a grown female with a balas on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And the father of that balas just happens to be the guy you\u2019ve always had a huge thing for. The guy who has whisked you off to his cocksure penthouse on top of the world, Pretty Woman\u2019d your ass, and once again tried to get up your skirt. Did I leave anything out?\u201d</p><p>Petra leaned back against her pillows\u2014her very pretty, very green pillows\u2014and grinned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dani\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, that motherfucker! What more did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe part you left out is me saying no to the up-your-skirt.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Petra shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t do that. I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not. But you\u2019re into that bastard. You may even be in love with him.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s chest tightened, and the air inside her lungs released in a rush, but she still managed to push out a pretty convincing response. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eye-rolling right now in case you can\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy plan is to come home after I have the baby and start a life and a family with Brodan.\u201d</p><p>Silence claimed the bedroom for a good ten seconds, and then Dani said, \u201cBrodan, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d That tightening in Petra\u2019s chest upgraded to a rusty, painful vise.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good male.\u201d</p><p>Petra nodded. \u201cHe totally is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Again Dani paused. Then, \u201cYeah, that\u2019ll never happen.\u201d</p><p>Petra broke out laughing. \u201cYou asshole, Dani.\u201d</p><p>Dani started laughing too.</p><p>\u201cI love you\u2014you know that?\u201d Petra said, climbing off the bed.</p><p>The hawk shifter followed suit. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Petra linked arms with her as they walked out the door and down the hall. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll take you to your launchpad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Dani gave her a warning look. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right I do.\u201d Petra gave her best friend a wry grin as they entered the living room.</p><p>First thing Petra noticed was that all three Roman brothers were gathered around the pool table talking. The second thing she noticed was that Synjon wasn\u2019t among them.</p><p>She pushed past Dani and eyed the brothers. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone,\u201d Alex said, placing his stick on the table.</p><p>Dani came to stand at her side. \u201cNo freaking way.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s gut twisted, and she looked from Alex back to Dani. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>Dani turned and gave her a mixture of a smirk and a sneer. \u201cYeah. You don\u2019t dig his ass at all.\u201d Shaking her head, she left Petra\u2019s side and walked toward the sliding glass door. \u201cThat selfish paven has done something unselfish, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Confused and growing slightly concerned, Petra turned to Alex, Nicholas, and Lucian. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas put his pool cue down next to Alex\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s going before the Order.\u201d</p><p>Petra gasped. It was as if her unbeating heart had suddenly dropped to her feet. \u201cWhat? Oh, my gods. Why?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo tell them the shifters are harmless,\u201d Lucian answered. \u201cAnd that he wasn\u2019t taken or held there against his will.\u201d</p><p>He was going to lie to the Order? \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stared at her strangely. Lucian shook his head and placed his cue on the table with the rest of them.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps he has some feeling after all, veana,\u201d he said, his Merlot eyes soft as they swept over her belly.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not possible,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>Alex smiled. \u201cWho\u2019s to say what\u2019s possible when it comes to matters of the heart? My mate is an Impure. We\u2019re about to welcome a balas I was once terrified to even contemplate.\u201d He raised one dark eyebrow. \u201cIs it all that hard to believe that even if our old emotions are stripped away, we can\u2019t grow new ones in their place?\u201d</p><p>Petra felt tears behind her eyes. Tears that had nothing to do with her swell or hunger or the strange, overwhelming, and debilitating problem she\u2019d been suffering from all week.</p><p>\u201cWe should get out of here,\u201d Lucian said to Nicholas. \u201cGrab Mr. Hallmark Card over there and let\u2019s motor. I want to see my veanas. Lucy\u2019s first fang is growing in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know if that\u2019s fang,\u201d Nicholas retorted, heading for the sliding glass door.</p><p>Outside, Dani snorted again. \u201cDon\u2019t fall for it, Pets. Not for Alex\u2019s pretty words or Wise\u2019s pretty face.\u201d Then she turned to the Roman brothers. \u201cI\u2019m assuming the three of you don\u2019t need a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cWe\u2019re all good, shifter.\u201d</p><p>Dani gave Petra one last grin before stripping down, shifting to her hawk, and taking off into the cold night air.</p><p>15</p><p>With the exception of the Impure, they were all as bloody arrogant and insufferable as they ever were.</p> <p>Syn stood front and center at their table, feet in the sand. It was so predictable. Couldn\u2019t they mix it up a bit? Change the climate, ditch the table?</p><p>\u201cSynjon Wise.\u201d It was Feeyan who addressed him first, because clearly she was now the leader in Cruen\u2019s stead. He wondered if the veana admired or despised the ex-leader. He imagined a little of both. \u201cWhat an unexpected pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no pleasure of mine,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cAnd how unexpected could it be? You demanded I come before you.\u201d</p><p>Her lip curled just a fraction. \u201cSo Dillon found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never lost.\u201d</p><p>She swept her arm down the table, indicating the others. \u201cAfter we heard news of your abduction and imprisonment we were quite concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe abduction or the imprisonment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Her flour white eyebrows lifted. \u201cThat is not the information I received.\u201d</p><p>Syn\u2019s gaze moved down the row of other Order members. They had to be getting tired of this act, this routine. The Impure male sure looked bored.</p><p>\u201cAnd who gave you this information, then?\u201d Syn asked, returning his attention to Feeyan.</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cThat is confidential.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed, laughed softly. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with Cruen again, aren\u2019t you? After all he\u2019s done. All he\u2019s guilty of. The lies and the manipulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour personal history colors your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe murdered my veana.\u201d He cut her off, but the words were no longer impassioned on his tongue. It was simply a fact. There was good in having his emotions bled, even if it kept him from the ability to love and care for others. \u201cHe stole her, kept her in a cage like an animal. Lucian Roman, too. These were Pureblood vampires. The ones you claim to care about, wish to fight an innocent group of shifters over.\u201d</p><p>Feeyan didn\u2019t like this line of conversation, and down the row of Order members there was a stirring, questions and chatter. Feeyan hissed at them, then tried to steer Syn in another direction. \u201cYou were instructed to bring the veana, Petra.\u201d</p><p>Where there had been little emotion before, there was a small tidal wave now. \u201cThe mother of my balas is resting, as she should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you may tell me,\u201d Feeyan said far too graciously. \u201cWere you or were you not held by the shifters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you consider them a threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar from it. They seem a right peaceful lot. The opposite of us.\u201d</p><p>She tossed him a death stare. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. You may go, Mr. Wise.\u201d</p><p>He grinned coldly. \u201cLovely. So you\u2019ll leave the Rain Forest and its inhabitants alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Synjon drew closer to the table, his eyes pinned on her frigid white orbs. The Order members around them started whispering. \u201cI just told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be out, you may have been freed, but there is another there who has not.\u201d</p><p>Shite. That bloody prat.</p><p>Syn eyed every member at that table, his tone ultraserious now. \u201cIf you allow Cruen to force you into a war with a peaceful tribe, you\u2019ll regret it. The Breed will regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one forces me, Mr. Wise,\u201d she practically snarled. \u201cI am the leader of the Order. I make the decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound as though you\u2019re trying to convince yourself of that fact.\u201d He cocked his head to one side. \u201cHaving a little trouble living up to the title?\u201d</p><p>As the whispering intensified, Feeyan pushed to her feet, her eyes boring a hole in his head, and waved a hand at him, sending him back to the Hollow. She wanted him gone. She wanted his words, ideas, concerns, and truths cut off and buried before the other Order members started developing minds of their own.</p><p>And before they realized their leader was not as secure in her position as she wanted them to believe.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Petra paced back and forth before the glass doors, feeling like an asinine teenager. The Order was purported to be cruel, vindictive, and unpredictable. Which would they be with Synjon?</p><p>She heard Dani\u2019s voice in her head. Her best friend\u2019s warning was a completely legitimate one. Worrying about, caring about, maybe even falling for Synjon Wise might be the greatest mistake of her life. But she couldn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>\u201cTearing up my rug, are you, love?\u201d</p><p>She gasped and whirled around to see Synjon standing in the frame of the sliding glass door, snow dusting his clothes. \u201cWhat did they say? What did you say?\u201d</p><p>He stepped inside and closed the door. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Fine,\u2019\u201d she repeated with mild irritation. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re giving me?\u201d</p><p>He brushed the already melting flakes from his jacket. \u201cYou look worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the shifters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. And the Rain Forest. Is the Order still threatening to go there and make trouble, or are they satisfied that you\u2019re no longer being held prisoner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d He walked past her over to the couch. \u201cThey have a new issue.\u201d</p><p>She followed him. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems there\u2019s a Pureblood paven still in the forest. His whereabouts are unaccounted for since he left the party he came there with.\u201d</p><p>Her gut twisted. \u201cCruen.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he went there for me, to make sure I was okay. Maybe he heard about how I was feeling this past week and . . .\u201d She stopped talking. Even as she said the words she didn\u2019t believe them. She wondered why he was really there. Whether he was once again trying to get something from the shifter community\u2014something more than their DNA this time.</p><p>She hung her head. Her father just continued to be a disappointment.</p><p>\u201cAnd for a moment I thought some of that manic pacing might be for me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes came up, swept over the gorgeous male vampire sitting with cool casualness on the leather sofa. \u201cYou can handle yourself, Mr. Wise.\u201d She itched to join him. Maybe snuggle up against his side while he whispered things in her ear. Dirty things. She mentally rolled her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any help or worry from anyone.\u201d</p><p>His gaze locked with her own. \u201cI told the Order I went and stayed in the Rain Forest of my own free will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She bit her tongue against asking him why. Who was that act of kindness for? What did he have to gain by helping the shifters?</p><p>\u201cAnd if Cruen doesn\u2019t fuck things up royally, you and the bear shifter can set up house without any fear of intrusion by the vicious and calculating vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicious and calculating.\u201d She grinned at him. \u201cAre we talking about the Order or yourself, Mr. Wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Order, of course. Why would I interfere in that budding romance?\u201d</p><p>A sudden pain shot through her abdomen and she gasped. She reached out for a nearby chair, curling in on herself.</p><p>Syn was off the couch and at her side in seconds. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He eased an arm around her waist. \u201cPetra?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, stared straight ahead and waited. When no other pain surfaced, she gingerly straightened. \u201cNothing. It\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Syn heaved a great sigh. \u201cBloody hell, veana. How long have you been on your feet tonight, wearing down my rug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It was just a little twinge.\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t listening. He scooped her up in his arms and carried her out of the living room.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, just kept going. Jaw tight, eyes trained forward, he took her into her bedroom and placed her gently on the bed. When she lay back against the pillows, he sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no more pain,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where was it?\u201d</p><p>What was he doing? Why was he acting so concerned when he didn\u2019t have the capacity or the ability to feel that emotion? Then she realized with a deep sense of melancholy that he did have ability, or the instinct. Not to care for her, but to care for the balas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pointed to the underside of her belly near her hipbones. \u201cHere. But it\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>Before she could even get that last part out, he had the edge of her black lace pajama top between his fingers. His dark eyes met hers. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted the material just a few inches, to the very top of her belly, then placed his warm hand on the spot where her pain had been and began to rub in slow, gentle circles. Mesmerized, entranced, confused, Petra watched his large, strong hand massaging her swollen belly. Would her child\u2019s hand look like this someday?</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>She lifted her gaze to his face. His stunningly handsome face. If she had a male balas, would he look like Syn? Would he have carved cheekbones and a full mouth? Deep, soulful eyes that pinned a female where she stood, then made her melt?</p><p>Her chest went tight and she bit at her lower lip. Would she really go through her life seeing Synjon Wise in every expression or movement her child made?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, his hand stalled, his eyes burning a hole through her. \u201cIs the pain back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not that kind of pain.</p><p>He looked relieved, then started again with the circles on her belly. \u201cThis all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels good.\u201d Too good. What was she supposed to do here? Stop him? Tell him that every time his hands were on her, she wanted them inside her as well?</p><p>\u201cLook, Petra.\u201d</p><p>The sudden youthful tone in his voice had her looking up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt follows me.\u201d The smile on his face stunned her. It was completely real, almost innocent.</p> <p>\u201cWhat follows you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe balas. It follows my hand.\u201d</p><p>She looked down, watched as he moved his palm slowly across the top of her belly and down. A soft moan escaped her lips as she felt the deep and intense movement within her womb.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said.</p><p>And there it was. Her child\u2019s head or elbow or foot following along behind Synjon\u2019s hand.</p><p>She pulled away from him, from his touch, from the idea that he might somehow have control of her little balas, and rolled to her side. \u201cI\u2019m really tired.\u201d</p><p>Syn didn\u2019t say anything, but his hand flexed.</p><p>\u201cYou know, from all that pacing.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at him. She couldn\u2019t. What had just happened here was the most intimate thing that she\u2019d ever experienced in her life, and she didn\u2019t know what to make of it.</p> <p>\u201cGood night, Syn,\u201d she said almost breathlessly.</p><p>He stood, hesitated for a moment, then walked to the door. \u201cI want to know if that pain comes back.\u201d</p><p>She curled into her pillow.</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Petra.\u201d</p><p>His tone, almost dark, worried her. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>This time, when he left, he didn\u2019t close the door all the way.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He felt.</p><p>Not just the keys beneath his fingers as he worked the B\u00f6sendorfer with Debussy, but something deeper, something that had nothing to do with instinct, when he got close to the balas.</p><p>How could that be possible? Instinct he was willing to accept, but an emotional connection?</p><p>Cruen had drained him absolutely. Syn had made sure of it\u2014then made sure all those emotions were permanently embedded in the asshole paven.</p><p>He played on. He played until he felt nothing at all. He played until the room grew cold and the snow outside accumulated against the glass doors leading to the terrace.</p><p>He played until he felt someone watching him.</p><p>His hands stilled over the keys and he glanced up. To his right, halfway between the hall to her bedroom and his piano, was the most beautiful swollen-bellied angel. Her hair loose and falling about the high white mounds of her breasts, barely encased by the black lace of her tank.</p><p>His mouth started to water. \u201cIs the pain back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the pain back, love?\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and blew it out, then began to play once again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out of bed.\u201d</p><p>She came to stand beside the piano bench, bringing her scent with her. It made his gut clench with hunger and thirst. \u201cYou were the one playing at the party.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her. \u201cYou heard me over that crowd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only thing I wanted to hear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was beautiful. It is beautiful. I had no idea you could play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe secret life of Synjon Wise,\u201d he muttered, then switched gears, his fingers dancing over the keys as he played the very same song he\u2019d played earlier that night. When he\u2019d wanted to block out the party, his hunger, and his ever-growing desire for the veana who stood just inches away.</p><p>When he stopped, Petra sighed. \u201cIncredible. I wish I could play like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cCome on now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean right away. But you can learn, start from the beginning.\u201d Then he added impetuously, foolishly, \u201cI could teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, but I\u2019m not sure I can fit on a piano bench in my condition. Where\u2019s the belly going to go?\u201d She laughed. \u201cOn top of the keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could give it a try, and if it\u2019s not comfortable, maybe after the balas is born . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said quickly. She was quiet for a moment, no doubt thinking about returning to the Rain Forest after the birth of Little Fangs. Or not returning.</p><p>It was a thought he refused to entertain.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been playing?\u201d She came around to stand behind him.</p><p>\u201cSince I was a balas of six years.\u201d He started playing something soft and a little sad. Seemed to suit the mood. \u201cTook to it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lessons?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot a one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. I wonder if Little Fangs will have\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly. \u201cSorry. I know you hate the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind it, really.\u201d He looked over his shoulder, found her gaze. \u201cAnd I hope so.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed tightly and her eyes shuttered.</p><p>Syn took his hands off the piano and turned around to face her. His hands went to her waist, his thumbs on her stomach. \u201cI hope the balas has something of me. Though it may seem impossible to see at this moment, with what I have become, there are traces of good within my blood.\u201d</p><p>She gazed down at him. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Petra.\u201d He leaned in and placed his head on her belly. It was so warm. She was so warm.</p><p>Her hands found his hair and tangled in the dark strands, the pads of her fingers massaging his scalp. Syn turned and nuzzled her belly. He gently lifted her tank and pressed a kiss to her skin, then dropped his head and kissed down the side of her swell, over her hipbone.</p><p>He growled, his nostrils flaring. \u201cI scent your heat, Petra,\u201d he whispered against her skin. \u201cI want it.\u201d</p><p>She shifted in his hands, her body and her breathing unsteady.</p><p>He lapped at her hipbone with his tongue, then started pulling down her pajama bottoms.</p><p>She moaned, her fingers digging deeper into his scalp as he eased the black silk down to her knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so thirsty, love.\u201d He gazed at the beautiful wet pussy that was nearly at eye level as he sat on his piano bench.</p><p>\u201cSyn . . .\u201d</p><p>The whisper of his name made his cock stir. \u201cI can\u2019t drink your blood, love. But I can lick your cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gods,\u201d she cried softly.</p><p>\u201cTell me yes, Petra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes. Yes.\u201d</p><p>As his head bent, his hands went around to cup her ass. With his first lick, his first taste, blood surged into his cock. He\u2019d never had anything on his tongue that compared to this, to her, and he realized in that moment that no matter how long he feasted at her spectacular cunt, he\u2019d never be satiated.</p><p>He wanted her for life.</p><p>Growling away the thought, he slipped one hand down the curve of her ass and up again, finding her wet sheath. Flicking his tongue lightly over her clit, he eased two fingers up inside her.</p><p>Her deep-throated groan matched his own.</p><p>Ruddy hell, she was so tight, so drenched in cream.</p><p>His dick begged to be let out, released, so it could find and capture and bury itself in the hot, fist-tight cage it desired so intensely. His emotions were gone, or so he\u2019d thought, but this . . . fuck, this connection he had with her\u2014this connection he\u2019d had since she\u2019d saved his sorry ass\u2014was never going to recede.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t think he wanted it to.</p><p>Her hips were moving now, swinging, bucking against his mouth. It was all Syn could do to keep his face planted in her sex, his tongue swirling on her clit and his fingers fucking her deep. The room no longer felt cold. In fact, it was blistering with heat and sweat, groans and heavy breathing, and Syn wanted to rip his clothes off and feel her skin to skin again.</p><p>His eyes closed as he pressed his tongue against her clit, moving his head up and down. On the backs of his eyelids he saw them, the two of them, in the strange, beautiful, tree house bathroom, his body over hers, her eyes on him, his cock thrust so deep he\u2019d nearly lost his mind.</p><p>She ripped her fingers from his hair then and gripped his shoulders for support. He could feel the heat gathering within her, her slick, honey walls clamping around his fingers as he pumped. She was going to climax. And when she did, he was going to drink her down.</p><p>Not her blood.</p><p>But her sweet come.</p><p>With a growl of hunger, he consumed her, his tongue moving through her wet slit, then circling. He eased a third finger inside her and started fucking her fast and deep. Her head fell back and she began to shake.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods, yes!\u201d she cried, her nails digging into the skin of his shoulders.</p><p>Syn left her ass and looped his arm around her waist to hold her in place. Then his lips covered her clit and while he suckled, while he coaxed the hot bud to swell against his tongue, his fingers thrust up into her cunt and remained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Petra gasped for air, her knees buckling.</p><p>Inside her sex, Syn flicked the pads of his fingers, hard and quick, back and forth, until he heard her cry out, felt the walls around him shudder and go slick. Then he pulled out of her and thrust his tongue inside.</p><p>She came hard, bucking and writhing, cream pouring out of her cunt and down Synjon\u2019s greedy throat.</p> <p>16</p><p>Petra felt boneless and worked over, and when Synjon picked her up in his arms for the second time that night and carried her off, she didn\u2019t argue or question. She just curled into his chest and breathed deeply of his amazing scent.</p><p>She wanted to chastise herself for allowing him to touch her, but she felt too weak, both in body and in spirit. Dani was a hundred percent right about her. She was falling in love with this paven, and if he wanted to touch her, kiss her, or rub her belly and watch their balas move against his palm, she would let him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if that made her weak or honest, but right then she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The air inside her room felt cold, and when he placed her back in bed, she thought very seriously about asking him to stay. Maybe curl up behind her, drape his arm over her belly, and fall asleep against the back of her neck.</p> <p>But his expression stopped her.</p><p>Or his lack of expression. Once again he looked utterly impassive, from his mouth to his eyes.</p><p>Had this meant nothing to him? she wondered. Was it physical desire only?</p><p>And then he did the strangest thing. He gathered the blanket at her feet and pulled it over her, all the way to her chin. The gesture was so odd for someone who had no emotion.</p><p>\u201cThe pain?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGone,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>His eyes softened with relief, and he leaned down and kissed her, a kiss so soft and gentle and sweet it nearly broke Petra\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he said, walking out of the room. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Again, he left the door ajar, and for the second time that night, Petra curled up with her pillow. This time she fell asleep within seconds.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Phane climbed the steps of the small mountain house he and Helo were going to stay in while they were in the Rain Forest. It had been chosen for them. Phane wasn\u2019t sure who had selected it, but it looked pretty damn good from the outside. It was centrally located and had a river for Helo to swim in, as well as easy access to the sky and a perch for Phane.</p><p>He pushed the door open and went inside. The place was a total pit, but he hardly cared. He was beat and hungry. They\u2019d been flying for hours, combing every inch of the Rain Forest looking for Cruen. Coming up with a whole lot of nothing. That bastard paven was slicker than a rattlesnake dipped in oil.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder at Dani, who had done the escorting-him-home bit, and who Phane was pretty sure wanted to be elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019ll try, but this place makes it hard, you know?\u201d He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s paradise.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened innocently. \u201cIt was the only free house we had available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched with amusement. He bet she liked making males squirm. It was one of the many reasons he found her so freaking hot.</p><p>\u201cSo, bird-slash\u2013blood boy,\u201d she said, moving past him and into the wreck of a living room, \u201chow long do you and your brother plan on staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s undetermined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fun for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Syn\u2019s information about the Order\u2019s potential threat, we don\u2019t want to leave the Rain Forest unprotected.\u201d</p><p>She looked up from the couch, which was missing two of its cushions and the one that remained had several gaping holes in it. \u201cUnprotected.\u201d She snorted. \u201cSo arrogant for one so pretty.\u201d</p><p>Pretty, eh? He wasn\u2019t sure if he liked that or not. He headed into one of the bedrooms. Dani followed him. If it was possible, the room was even worse than the living room. The floors were wrecked and damaged from water, and it looked as though at some point in time the entire contents of the Rain Forest had been blown through the broken window.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know where I\u2019m bunking down,\u201d he said, turning to face her. \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of it. Is it as nice as this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d She grinned and checked out the adjoining bathroom. \u201cYou have running water. \u2019Course, it\u2019s probably running brown this time of year, but who do you really have to shower for anyway?\u201d</p><p>How pissed would she be if he grabbed her, kissed her, and asked her how bad he smelled? He imagined pretty pissed, but the thought made him grin.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t live with the Avians, then?\u201d he asked, checking out the dirty broken window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nonconformist. I sorta do my own thing.\u201d</p><p>Shocker, Phane thought with a chuckle. \u201cDo you have a male?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . exactly how is that any of your business, vampire hawk?\u201d</p><p>He turned, his back to the window, and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m interested in you.\u201d</p><p>His honesty must\u2019ve stunned her. But only for a few seconds. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSo? Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a male?\u201d</p><p>She grinned wide and wicked, and Phane\u2019s chest tightened with desire. That is, until she said, \u201cI have many males.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened and soon Helo appeared in the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>Phane laughed. \u201cThank Dani. It\u2019s all her doing.\u201d</p><p>Helo turned to the female and glared. \u201cThanks, Dani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d she answered. \u201cTry not to stay too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHospitable, ain\u2019t she?\u201d Phane muttered to Helo, then followed Dani out of the bedroom and over to the front door. \u201cCome again soon,\u201d he said, leaning against the doorjamb.</p><p>She grinned wickedly at him as she passed. \u201cI always do, bloodsucker. I always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not just a vampire,\u201d he called to her back.</p><p>She turned around. \u201cOh, I know. Feathers and talons and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my!\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Her grin widened. \u201cAnd what does that make you exactly?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his eyebrows and lowered his voice. \u201cIntriguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire. Hawk. Hmmm . . . What else is in there I should know about? Human, maybe?\u201d She widened her eyes dramatically. \u201cGargoyle?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. He would have this female. Nothing and no one would get in his way. And if they tried, he\u2019d make sure to schedule a little blood taste test.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could show you sometime,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But right now I have plans.\u201d She started walking away, down to a patch of flat ground.</p><p>\u201cHot date?\u201d he called.</p><p>She stripped down, tossed her clothes into a tree, and shouted back, \u201cIs there any other kind?\u201d before she shifted into her hawk and spread her wings wide.</p><p>Phane watched her take off and sail into the air, his dick hardening with every beat of her incredible wings.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The alley stank of human food and human sex.</p><p>Two things that held absolutely no interest to Synjon.</p><p>\u201cHe still in the Rain Forest?\u201d</p><p>Adrian nodded, his fangs a quarter inch lower than they should be in primarily human territory, even in the late hours of the night.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know I\u2019m no longer there?\u201d</p><p>Again Adrian nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen why does he remain?\u201d Synjon asked the male who had his sister\u2019s eyes and burnt auburn hair. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he coming after me? And more important, as his very trusted guard, why aren\u2019t you assisting him?\u201d</p><p>Juliet\u2019s brother, the only other male on earth who wanted Cruen to suffer more than Synjon, glanced down the alley and sighed. \u201cHe was on his way out, on his way to you, when some water shifters stopped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater shifters?\u201d Synjon narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat did they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey remembered him. From when he was there collecting samples.\u201d Adrian laughed bitterly, his breath smoky in the frigid air. \u201cThey told him they had a power source of some kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Synjon demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo idea. They wouldn\u2019t let me go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back, Adrian. Find out what it is, if it works, how it works. I need him as weak and defenseless as possible.\u201d</p><p>The male nodded. \u201cIs the plan still the same? His next flash is to you.\u201d</p><p>A week ago, Syn would\u2019ve given the paven before him, the paven who had the same eyes as the female Cruen had stolen, then killed, a rapid-fire affirmative, but tonight he hesitated. And bloody hell, he despised that hesitation. He wanted Cruen. He wanted to torture and maim and make that bastard beg, but right now Petra was asleep in his house, the balas sleeping with her. Was he truly bringing Cruen into the new, almost blissful world he\u2019d just created?</p><p>\u201cSyn.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cThe room\u2019s ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Adrian reached out and the two clasped hands. \u201cJuliet will finally be avenged,\u201d he said with deep feeling.</p><p>A feeling that no longer existed within Synjon. \u201cYou\u2019d better get back.\u201d</p><p>The male nodded. \u201cLater, brother.\u201d</p><p>Adrian flashed from the alley, and Syn walked out, down a few side streets and onto Broadway, which was still sporting moderately heavy foot traffic, even at this hour. Christmas swag and lights shocked his senses at every turn as he moved through the crowds at a brisk pace. He could\u2019ve flashed home when Adrian flashed back to the Rain Forest, but he needed some air, some time to get his head together. His emotions about Juliet and her death were gone, but not his commitment to bringing the male who killed her to justice.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he stay the course on this? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was just rounding the corner of Forty-fourth Street when something caught his eye in a brightly lit window of one of the shops. He slowed and went to check it out. The toy store was closed, but the front window was lit and dressed for the holidays. A large toddler-size bear sat on a small leather bench in front of a child-size Steinway, its fuzzy paws placed on the keyboard to look as though it was playing.</p><p>Petra\u2019s incomplete query rolled through his mind. What would the balas inherit from him? His face? His sharpness? His hatred of his grandfather?</p><p>His gaze moved over the well-made instrument.</p> <p>Would the balas have his abilities at the piano?</p><p>That unwelcome, though now strikingly familiar something pinged inside him. His desires had expanded beyond the simple two of physical release and unemotionally executed vengeance. Now they included a female he should never touch again, and the growing life inside her, which might very well sport his eyes.</p><p>He pulled out his cell phone, barked a quick order to the male on the other end of the line, then leaned back against the shop door and waited.</p><p>17</p><p>Petra woke to the scent of blood and instantly curled around it, her fangs descending. No doubt she was still dreaming, but it was the kind of dream she appreciated. Syn\u2019s blood, Syn\u2019s thick, masculine wrist. Her fingers pressed into the skin of his arm just as her fangs rested on top of the pinprick holes that had already been prepared for her. She made a keening sound, then thrust herself deep into his vein.</p> <p>The moment the blood entered her mouth, she came awake. With a gulp and a sputter, she opened her eyes and pulled her fangs from Syn\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cOh, my gods, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She looked up, dazed and confused. Syn was propped up on a pillow beside her. She looked down at his wrist, then back up at him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were calling out in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalling out for what?\u201d Or for whom? she thought with a groggy sense of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cMe, love.\u201d</p><p>Her chest deflated. Great. Fabulous. Humiliating. It wasn\u2019t enough that she made her desire, her need for him known in the waking hours. Now she was begging for it while she slept.</p> <p>\u201cAnd my wrist. And my neck.\u201d His mouth twitched as he watched her cheeks grow hot. \u201cAnd my blood.\u201d</p><p>She made a groaning sound that was meant to convey how completely mortifying this was. But Syn just chuckled.</p><p>\u201cDrink, veana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m becoming an addict,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cJust as long as you keep coming to me for your fix.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes moved over her face. Why does he have to say shit like that? Petra wondered. It made her want him more than she already did. It made her want things, hope for things that were impossible when it came to this male.</p><p>Gods, this is going to end badly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bloodying your sheets, veana,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With a slight growl, she dropped her head and sank her fangs in him again. Instantly the blood flowed. Hot and sweet and plentiful, into her mouth. Each drop she consumed was better than the last. As she sucked like the greedy wench she was, took his life force into her own, she wondered how she would survive without this when she left.</p><p>How she would survive without him.</p><p>Above her, she heard him groan, hiss, and she realized she\u2019d gone a little deeper into his vein than she normally did. But that was how she was when she fed from him. Every millimeter tasted better, sweeter. Like liquid gold.</p><p>Finally, after several minutes of intense feeding, her belly was full, and she lifted her head and stared at the twin bite marks. With a quick inhale, she blew on them, slowly back and forth until they closed. Then she looked up. In the milky shadows of the moonlight streaming in behind her, she saw the strain on Synjon Wise\u2019s gorgeous face.</p><p>Her brows knit together as her gaze moved over him, assessing. His eyes were narrowed and dilated to black. His skin looked paler than usual, his cheekbones were more pronounced, and his lips held a bluish tinge.</p><p>\u201cAre you eating?\u201d Her eyes rose to meet his.</p><p>\u201cI ate the meal of a lifetime.\u201d A quick fire lit his black eyes. \u201cJust a few hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed, and her skin tightened over her bones. At the piano. Yes, she remembered too. So did her body. Especially the muscles between her legs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t concern yourself with me, veana,\u201d he said. \u201cI can take care of myself, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dropped to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what, love?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse. Why aren\u2019t you feeding from someone like you said you would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t had the chance.\u201d He eased his wrist from her grip and shifted to sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p>She spoke to his broad back. \u201cYou had a party here. Plenty of veins to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone that were available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. Hey.\u201d She touched his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter? Eh? Love.\u201d His tone was back to being unaffected, and she shivered. \u201cAll you need to be concerned about is feeding the balas.\u201d</p><p>She snatched her hand away. Cursed softly. \u201cI wish that was the case. Gods. I want to not care about you or your health or your eating habits, because frankly, you didn\u2019t give a shit about me when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would love to put your ridiculously handsome, yet overly pale face out of my head, because you put mine out of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Petra. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>Fuck him. Really. She moved around him, crawled onto his lap, grabbed his face. \u201cAnd I really want to pretend that the reason you won\u2019t take blood from another female has everything to do with me because, love, I want you to want only me. Desperately and forever. Until I leave you for another guy. No. Even after that. I want you to want me even when I\u2019m in his arms, moving under his body\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Syn crushed his mouth against hers, then ripped back. \u201cI told you to shut your bloody mouth, veana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when he\u2019s rocking our balas in his arms at night.\u201d</p><p>Syn stared at her, his nostrils flared, his fangs fully extended. \u201cFuck you, Petra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask, Syn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking.\u201d His arms went around her and he took her mouth so hard she was pretty sure she was going to have a bruise in the morning.</p><p>Petra moaned into his kiss, following him as he changed the angle, the suction, and uttered words and threats at her she couldn\u2019t make out. She didn\u2019t care. Let him be pissed. It was something. It was emotion. And if he didn\u2019t care, if the things she\u2019d just said to him meant nothing, he wouldn\u2019t be reacting this fiercely.</p><p>His hands raked up and down her back, gripping her one moment, releasing her the next. Her breasts were swelling, her nipples pressed hard against the lace fabric of her tank, and below her waist, between her legs, she was soaking wet.</p><p>Then suddenly he pulled away. His gaze searched her face like he wanted something from her, something out of her. Words, action . . . she didn\u2019t know what. But he was breathing heavy, too heavy. And behind his eyes, she saw something impossible break.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes widened and his lip curled. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and brushed her index finger over his lashes. It was a lone tear, and it quivered on the tip of her finger. She showed it to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this, then?\u201d</p><p>He stared at it and his brows slammed together. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSyn . . .\u201d</p><p>He lifted her and put her back on the bed. Every inch of him was tense as he walked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cSyn!\u201d she called again.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t answer her. He left the room. Left her feeling turned on, cold, and like a complete and total bitch for shoving his new and unexplained emotions in his face.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Power felt so good inside him. It belonged there. Running through his veins, making his blood expand. The only problem was it didn\u2019t last long enough.</p><p>Cruen eyed the small group of water shifters. \u201cTell me what you want for this.\u201d He held up the gray flesh. \u201cWhat is your currency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want your help,\u201d said the young shifter who\u2019d brought him to the secret waterfall in the first place.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of help?\u201d Cruen asked imperiously. Truthfully, he would pay almost anything for the magic surge in power, but he didn\u2019t want the shifters to know that. He didn\u2019t want them to know just how desperate he was.</p><p>\u201cWhat you took from us,\u201d said the male. \u201cThe DNA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cruen said warily.</p><p>\u201cYou mixed it with your own blood, right?\u201d</p><p>Where were these water beasts going with their questions? \u201cI conducted many experiments. Some were successful. Some were not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want your DNA. Vampire DNA.\u201d</p><p>Cruen couldn\u2019t quell the immediate expression of disgust. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to experiment too.\u201d The boy glanced around at the small party gathered. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see what kind of creatures we can grow from our DNA and yours. There are so many of us who lack power and strength. Our animals are weak by nature, which in turn makes us weak as shifters. We want what the lions have, the bears. We want that strength and the ability to fight our enemies and protect our own.\u201d</p><p>The boy, who may not have been a boy at all but a small, weak shifter adult, eyed him seriously. \u201cThis would be our secret, of course. The faction leaders would not approve.\u201d</p><p>Cruen stared long and hard at the male. He understood the shifters\u2019 desire to be more than what they were, but he wasn\u2019t sure he approved. They were the equivalent of an Impure in his mind, and he would not hand over pure blood or anything to make them stronger and more powerful. And yet these creatures had the magic flesh\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard about a hybrid who\u2019s here in the Rain Forest,\u201d said an older female to the boy\u2019s left. \u201cA water shifter like us\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHelo,\u201d Cruen supplied readily.</p><p>\u201cIs that his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t exactly like you.\u201d No. He wasn\u2019t. Cruen hesitated. Perhaps . . . yes, perhaps that would satisfy. Giving up Pureblood vampire DNA went against everything he stood for. But mutore . . . \u201cI could get you the water beast\u2019s DNA. In fact, I might be able to bring him to you.\u201d</p> <p>As all the other water shifters started talking at once, the young male\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYes, that would do well. He is part vampire. But would he come? Would he keep what we\u2019re trying to do a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Cruen waited for their faces to fall from disappointment and then added, \u201cBut with the right amount of flesh paid to me, I can make sure that after you\u2019re done with him, he doesn\u2019t have the ability to reveal anything to anyone ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The desire to feel nothing had been viciously stolen by the overpowering desire to feel everything.</p><p>With her.</p> <p>His hands spread wide on the glass, Syn stood at the doors leading to the terrace and stared out at the New York City skyline. It was ungodly late and snow was falling on the terrace floor in heavy flakes. What had he done? Stealing her away from the Rain Forest and her family? Thinking he could take care of her and the balas? Didn\u2019t he get it that existing was the only thing available to him? He hadn\u2019t been saved from the sun, from following Juliet, to have another chance at life and happiness.</p><p>He swiped at the condensation building on the glass. All he deserved was the chance to make things right, pay his toll for failing Juliet. And that toll was the complete and total destruction of Cruen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled on the glass. He hadn\u2019t heard Petra come up behind him. Shite, he was really losing it.</p><p>\u201cSyn.\u201d She paused. Then, \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Looking at her seemed to be the bloody problem. Why couldn\u2019t he just stand here and admire the snow and the view?</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, her tone softly impassioned.</p><p>Releasing a heavy breath, he turned, leaned back against the cold glass, and then, when he got a good look at her, wished he hadn\u2019t. Bollocks! Did she have to glow in the goddamn light of the snowflakes behind him? Did her eyes have to be so fucking blue and beautiful and haunting? Did her skin have to scream for his touch, his mouth?</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She looked everywhere but in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to be real honest here. And I hope you will be too.\u201d</p><p>Honest? Did she really want that from him? Did she even know what that meant when it came to the two of them?</p><p>His gaze moved all over her. Black silk and lace against ripe white skin and breasts that insisted on overflowing their confines every chance they got. His hands twitched at his sides. They wanted to be on her, inside her. Along with his cock, which was filling with blood this very second.</p><p>Fuck. What was happening to him? And how could he stop it? Curb it? Destroy it?</p><p>Or was that impossible now? Was it truly his destiny to want what he could never have?</p><p>Never have unless he gave up the very thing that kept him breathing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m angry at you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes snapped up, and this time her eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m angry at you for not caring. Because . . . well\u201d\u2014she shook her head\u2014\u201cbecause I care. About you. I haven\u2019t stopped, you know. And no matter how this rolls along, how insanely attracted we are to each other, it can\u2019t end well. Right? I mean, your need to kill my father is kind of a deal breaker for me. He\u2019s clearly not a good father or even a decent male. And maybe he should be contained in that vampire jail situation.\u201d Her eyes implored him. \u201cBut I can\u2019t sit by and watch or accept his death by your hand. You\u2019ve got to understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d It was why he\u2019d allowed his emotions to be stripped in the first place.</p><p>She chewed her lip. \u201cBut you don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>Gods, she just didn\u2019t get this, get him. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t care.\u201d He growled slightly. \u201cPetra. He murdered my female. Do you understand that? Right in front of my fucking eyes.\u201d He pushed away from the glass. \u201cHe destroyed a being. It\u2019s what he does. Hurts and kills and destroys to get what he wants. Now, that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that he fathered you. I\u2019m grateful.\u201d His gaze moved over her, over her belly, back to her eyes. \u201cShit, I\u2019m grateful to him for that. But it doesn\u2019t cancel out what he is\u2014what he continues to do.\u201d</p><p>She just stared at him, shaking slightly. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, hard. \u201cHe killed my life,\u201d he said again. \u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment to answer. \u201cStart a new one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Tears filled them. She turned and started toward her room. His chest tightened and he called after her.</p><p>\u201cBut I do know I want you! Only you!\u201d</p><p>She stopped, her hand reaching out for the wall.</p><p>Fuck, this is misery. \u201cAnd I know I can\u2019t bear to take another female\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>She stayed where she was, still giving him her back.</p><p>\u201cThe idea makes me feel bloody sick to my gut. Yes, Petra. Yes, love. I said \u2018feel.\u2019\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the bloody hell is going on. I should feel nothing. But with you, with the balas, I am something impossible.\u201d He pulled in a deep breath. Released it. \u201cTurn around, love.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Remember that word? You used it on me not more than five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Her head hung forward for a second. Then she sighed and turned back to face him.</p><p>He shook his head when he saw her expression. It was sadness, the sweetest, sexiest thing he\u2019d ever seen, and he wanted to flash to her and cover her mouth, pull moans from her sighs of frustration.</p><p>\u201cI never stopped wanting you,\u201d he said, knowing that the words coming out of his mouth were surely damning him. But who the bloody hell cared now? Either way, he didn\u2019t stand much of a chance in the happy-endings department. \u201cNever stopped thinking about you. Cursing you. You tell me what we\u2019re supposed to do now. I did my very best to keep this from happening.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went to her belly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a war raging inside me, love. Wanting you, wanting to destroy him. I can\u2019t let go of either one and survive.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the space between them as they just stared at each other. Syn was sure she was going to turn around at any moment and go back to her room. She should. She really should. But then her gaze flickered past him and narrowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder, saw what she was talking about, and laughed softly. \u201cFurther proof that I\u2019m losing the battle.\u201d</p><p>Completely captivated, she left the safety of the far wall and walked past him into the living room. He followed her with his eyes, watched as she ran her hand over the top of the small piano.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d Her head came up and her eyes locked with his.</p><p>\u201cI saw it in a shop window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put it next to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes and she ran at him, threw herself into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her against him. \u201cRight back at you, love.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were on his chest, her belly was tucked into him the way he liked it, and her eyes were searching his own. \u201cTake me to bed.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cFuck you?\u201d</p><p>She grinned back. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared, and he shook his head ever so slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have the strength to keep my fangs to myself, love.\u201d</p><p>She sighed with what sounded impossibly like relief. \u201cGood.\u201d Then she grabbed his hand and pulled him toward the bedroom.</p><p>18</p><p>Syn\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>That\u2019s where she\u2019d led them.</p><p>The last time she was in here, he was wearing only a towel. Now she wanted him in nothing at all.</p><p>The room was relatively dark when they entered. Except for one thing. One amazing thing. A round five-by-five skylight cut into the ceiling directly above the bed, the moon fairly overshadowed by the clouds that were raining down snowflakes, the tiny bits of erratic light scattering on the plush gray quilt. How had she not noticed that skylight before? Had it been daylight? Had it been closed, sealed up to keep the sun at bay?</p><p>Syn came up behind her and kissed her neck. She smiled, realizing he\u2019d already removed his shirt, and turned in his arms. Gods, he was beautiful. And terrifying. And breath-stealingly sexy. She ran her hands up his hard stomach to his chest, her fingers vibrating with the sensation of warm male skin. They were going to do this. Again. Syn inside her. Taking her, again.</p><p>Syn reached for the edges of her tank and slowly lifted the silk and lace over her head. At first, he just stared. His eyes flashing hunger as they roamed over her belly and breasts.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cBloody hell, veana.\u201d</p><p>And then he filled his hands with her, feeling the weight of her heavy breasts, squeezing, then releasing her to tug gently on her nipples.</p><p>Instantly heat and moisture pooled in Petra\u2019s sex. She drew air through her teeth, and her face became a mask of erotic desire. In her mind she imagined Syn leading her to the bed, pulling down her pajama bottoms, and sinking into the already soaking-wet heat of her cunt.</p><p>But instead, he made her nearly come where she stood.</p><p>His head dropped and, squeezing one sensitive mound, he took her hard pink nipple into his mouth. Petra cried out as he suckled. Never in her life had she felt anything so delicious. Cream leaked from her pussy and dripped down her thighs. His tongue continued to lap at her, but he brought his thumb up to meet it, and the two took turns. Tongue. Lash. Thumb. Flick.</p><p>Groaning, mumbling incoherently, Petra brought her hand to the waistband of her pajama bottoms and was all set to send it down and through her slit. Gods, he was making her insane. She had to. Had to touch herself. She couldn\u2019t wait. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Synjon growled against her wet nipple. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered. \u201cSyn . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said again, more firmly. \u201cYou will wait, love.\u201d</p> <p>Fine, she muttered to herself. But if she couldn\u2019t touch herself, she was going to fill her hand with him.</p><p>As he continued to drive her to madness with his tongue and fingers, she fumbled with the metal that kept his jeans resting on his sexy hipbones. It didn\u2019t take her long to get in, get down, find him. After all, he had already busted out of his boxers and was so rock hard that he pressed against the skin of his belly.</p><p>Petra wrapped her hand around his thick length and squeezed. Syn\u2019s teeth came down on her nipple, and they both sucked in air.</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell, yes,\u201d he muttered, switching to her other breast and nuzzling her nipple with his nose.</p><p>Petra loved the feeling of him in her hand as she stroked him. So hard, so smooth except for the pulsing veins beneath his skin. Her mouth watered, but not for his blood this time, and she released his cock and tried to maneuver him onto the bed. It was like trying to move a brick wall. He was completely absorbed by her top half.</p> <p>That is, until she whispered, \u201cI want you in my mouth, Syn. I want to taste you.\u201d</p><p>His head came up, and his eyes went hooded and dark. \u201cCrikey, veana. I may just come from your words alone.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cLie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me. Anything you say, love.\u201d He tore off his jeans and rocketed onto the bed before she even made it to the edge of the mattress.</p><p>Her gaze moved over him. Feet, to powerful thighs, to thick, blood-heavy cock, to waves of muscle, to a chest that begged for a female\u2019s sweaty cheek. Petra licked her lips. He was lying on his back, his hands behind his head. He looked like the ultimate bad boy. He looked exactly like what she wanted.</p><p>She eased her silk pajama bottoms down to her ankles, then stepped out of them. She knew he was watching her and she liked it that he was. She felt no shame in her body, in the swell of her belly. They\u2019d created this, together, and it felt so right to be with him.</p> <p>The glow from the skylight above, the dancing snowflakes, was a beautiful, moving spotlight on his body, and as Petra climbed onto the bed and cat-crawled toward him, she saw the glistening wetness of precome on the hard planes of his abdomen. Her mouth watered in anticipation. Just the thought of him inside her mouth, pumping, filling her, made her insides pulse and hum.</p><p>She was at his side in seconds, her hand wrapping around the base of his cock, her head lowered to take him into her mouth.</p><p>But first she had to taste him. Lick the wetness, the sensual tears, off the head. They were for her, after all.</p><p>With a moan of excitement, she swiped her tongue across him. Syn cursed blackly, and his hips jacked up. Salty. Creamy. Perfect. She growled and took him in her mouth, slowly, letting him slide himself in. He was thick and so hard, she wasn\u2019t sure she could accommodate him. But, gods, she wanted to try. She loved his taste, loved the way his hand now moved up and down her back, mimicking her rhythm as she sucked him.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so bloody good, veana,\u201d he muttered, his free hand fisting the sheets. \u201cToo good. Your mouth is like liquid fire, and your tongue . . . fuck, the way it\u2019s pressing against my shaft, I want to come right now. But fucking Christ, it\u2019s got to be in your pussy.\u201d</p><p>The insides of Petra\u2019s thighs were soaking wet as she worked him, as she moaned and squeezed and suckled.</p><p>Synjon cursed again, his back arching. \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming about your tight, hot pussy for months.\u201d</p><p>Her sex clenched with his erotic words, and she squeezed him tighter, took him deeper, wanted him at the back of her throat when he came.</p> <p>But Syn had other plans. He thrust into her; then when he pulled his ass back into the mattress, he managed to free his cock from her mouth. And once he was free, he moved so fast she didn\u2019t know where he\u2019d gone at first.</p><p>Suddenly his mouth was by her ear, his wet cock was on her back, and she was on her hands and knees. \u201cI want you to be comfortable, veana,\u201d he whispered, lapping at her sensitive lobe.</p><p>He spread the cheeks of her ass, and she gasped.</p><p>He made a sound of approval, and she felt his fingers at the opening to her sex. \u201cBecause I\u2019m going to take you so deep, you won\u2019t know where I begin and you end.\u201d</p><p>Oh, gods. \u201cSyn\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was all she managed to squeak out before he drove into her cunt and lightning flickered on the backs of her eyelids. For one moment he just held there, and Petra panted and groaned and smiled and thought that she\u2019d never been so happy in her entire life. He was claiming her. Maybe not with words, but with actions, and for now\u2014for right that minute\u2014it was all she needed to let go and come.</p><p>The climax rippled through her and she heard Syn curse. He gripped her hips tightly and remained deep inside her as she trembled and saw stars and creamed against his steely cock.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d she whispered, her head shifting from side to side as she tried to get her bearings. \u201cFuck me, Syn. Hard. Deep. Fast. It feels so good. You feel so good.\u201d</p><p>The sound their bodies made, the slap of his sex thrusting in and out of her wet core, was the ultimate music to Petra. The only thing she wanted to hear. For hours, days, months. Even after the balas . . . She gasped, her mind falling apart as her body took over. She cried out and swung her hips to meet him.</p><p>It was carnal.</p><p>There was no other word for it.</p><p>Hunger drove them, over and over and to the edge of madness and perfection, and when Syn coiled over her, resting his cheek on her back as he took both her breasts in his hands, Petra felt tears behind her eyes. They were one. Maybe it was a strange and immoral thought to have in the middle of a deep, mind-bending fuck, but she and Syn and balas were completely and totally one.</p><p>Tears rained down her cheeks, and as Syn pummeled her with deep thrusts and light tugs to her nipples, she came again. Heat and electric currents battered her cunt, and she turned wild, bucking and crying out as Synjon\u2019s thrusts turned manic. Hot seed surged into her sex, making them both so wet her pussy couldn\u2019t contain the onslaught. Seed and cream flooded her legs, and Synjon cursed and pulled out of her.</p><p>For a moment Petra wasn\u2019t sure what was happening, where he was going. If he was leaving her. Then he flipped her gently to her back, spread her thighs, and settled between them.</p><p>Her blurry gaze widened.</p><p>But Syn only grinned and lowered his head. When he touched her, when his hot, thick tongue made contact with her sensitive flesh, a moan of absolute ecstasy tore from her throat, and she fell back on the pillows. He was licking her. Not just her sex, but her lips and her thighs. Cleaning her, tasting her\u2014eating her. Gods, she was going to die from it.</p><p>\u201cDrink from me, Syn,\u201d she called out, her head thrashing from side to side against the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI am, love,\u201d he whispered, his breath tickling her skin. \u201cYour pussy just keeps quenching my unending thirst.\u201d</p><p>Her legs shook. \u201cNo. Not that,\u201d she muttered as she felt his teeth nibble at the lips of her sex.</p><p>\u201cHow about this, then, m\u2019dear, m\u2019darling?\u201d He plunged his tongue deep inside her cunt, then retreated.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d she gasped. \u201cNo, Syn. Gods, I love it, but no. My blood. Christ. Drink my blood.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, his body, his mouth, and his breath, coming quick against the entrance to her sex. \u201cPetra . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cI promise you. I swear. I know it.\u201d She came up on her elbows, locked eyes with him. \u201cI think this is how it\u2019s supposed to be, Syn. With . . . a couple.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, and though he kept his gaze on her, he ran his tongue up her slit.</p><p>She cried out.</p><p>\u201cMates, Petra?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes. \u201cBite me,\u201d she commanded. \u201cDrink from me.\u201d</p><p>He growled, his fangs dropping.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to feed from anyone else?\u201d she said with almost sexual menace.</p><p>\u201cFuck, no, love. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><p>She saw the struggle in his eyes, but the hunger was there too, and thank the gods it was the stronger of the two. He pulled back from her sex but remained between her legs. His hands rested on her hot core, while his head turned and his tongue flicked out to lap at the skin of her inner thigh. Petra watched him, her breath tightly caught in her lungs. She remembered how it felt to be bitten by him, but this time was so different\u2014this time hunger was caged in a haze of erotic compulsion.</p><p>She felt his fingers part her sex, felt the pad of his thumb move impossibly lightly down her lips.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Syn,\u201d she begged.</p><p>He nuzzled her skin, then scraped his fangs over the spot he wanted to bite.</p><p>Best. Feeling. Ever.</p><p>Her eyes slammed shut.</p><p>Except for maybe this feeling.</p><p>She fell back on the pillows, her mouth forming a small O as Syn\u2019s fangs pressed deeper and deeper into her flesh. And then he was drinking. Her blood. Taking it in big gulps as he followed the seam of her pussy with his thumb, all the way to the opening of her sex, clearly determined to make her come again. The most perfect shared ecstasy.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Alex watched his mate very closely as Dillon paced the floor of the library in his house in SoHo. The entire family was gathered: Romans, mutore, Impure Resistance, Celestine, and Wen. And Alex was worried that Sara\u2019s concern about Petra and the shifters was wearing on her. She was growing so close to her time, which made Alex all the more protective.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, my love?\u201d he whispered in her ear while Dillon went on about the heavy search of the Rain Forest and how there had been absolutely no sign of Cruen.</p><p>Sara turned to him, her blue eyes beautiful as always, but tired. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She touched his face. \u201cYou worry too much.\u201d</p><p>He growled lovingly at her. \u201cIt\u2019s never too much when it comes to you and our balas.\u201d</p><p>She leaned in and kissed him. \u201cWait until after it\u2019s born. There\u2019ll be plenty to worry about then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Do you foresee a problem?\u201d His gaze moved over her. \u201cShall I call for Leza?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cYou\u2019re losing it, honey.\u201d</p><p>Then she kissed him again, and Alex forgot all about his fears. Hell, he forgot his name. He reveled in the feel of her warm, soft mouth, and played with her tongue. He was about to wrap his arms around her and really start the tasting, when Dillon interrupted with a curse.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d she shouted. \u201cLovebirds! Trying to stop a war over here.\u201d</p><p>Alex eased back, but he didn\u2019t take his eyes off his mate\u2019s mouth. How was it possible that she tasted sweeter with every day that passed?</p><p>She grinned up at him. \u201cWe\u2019d better listen to Dillon. You can ravish me later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my god,\u201d Dillon groaned. \u201cGetting nauseated over here.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Sara turned back. \u201cSorry, D.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Alex said, curling his lip at the veana who was working his rug down to the fibers. \u201cOkay, D. If Cruen\u2019s so deeply hidden in the forest that even the shifters who live there can\u2019t find him, what can we do?\u201d</p><p>Dillon glanced around the room. \u201cThe Order will come and find him if we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the answer to the question I asked,\u201d Alex said, dropping his arm around his mate\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cFine. We have two options at this point. We can let the shifters deal with it on their own, and by \u2018it\u2019 I mean the Order coming into the forest, finding Cruen, and taking out anyone who gets in their way . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the other option?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>Phane sat forward and Helo too, but it was Lycos, who\u2019d just shown up in the doorway after basically being a ghost for the past few days, who spoke.</p> <p>\u201cShe wants us to stand with them and fight,\u201d he said. His eyes cut to Dillon. \u201cRight, sis? Protect and serve a race that\u2019s not our own? Well, you can count me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready had, brother dear. Already had.\u201d Dillon barely spared him a glance. She was looking at the Romans, Helo and Phane, even Celestine. \u201cI won\u2019t pretend, unlike others, that I\u2019m not connected to the shifters. That they\u2019re not a part of my blood. Maybe even more so than the vampire in me. And if they need my help, I\u2019m going to give it. You\u2019ll all have to make that decision too. But make it quick.\u201d She inhaled deeply. \u201cBecause I fear it\u2019s only a matter of time before Feeyan feels the pressure to carry out her rash threat, and lands at the gathering stones, her power ratcheted up to high.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He could worship at her temple forever.</p><p>His fangs pulled from her thigh, Syn licked and kissed the two pinprick holes until they started to close; then he rose above her. He felt like a new paven, impossibly strong, deeply possessive, achingly satisfied and . . . Bollocks, dare he say it? Happy?</p><p>He gazed down at her, black hair against the white pillow, cheeks and lips stained a deep pink, and those eyes . . . they killed him, stole his unbeating heart, reached inside his mind and emptied it of all thoughts but the ones that involved the two of them, naked.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She grinned and stretched around him. \u201cNever felt better in my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, veana, you know I can\u2019t resist a challenge. Not when it comes to you . . .\u201d He grinned. \u201cComing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d She wrapped her legs around his waist and locked her ankles just above his ass.</p><p>He went hard instantly.</p><p>She glanced down and grinned. \u201cWow. My blood\u2019s everywhere in you, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bloody magic, love,\u201d he growled. \u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I must be a witch.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cA sorceress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAble to cast spells on her enemies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her lovers.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOf which she will have too many to count. One for each day of the week\u2014\u201d</p><p>Petra stopped talking when she felt Syn go rigid around her. His gaze dropped.</p><p>\u201cSyn. What is it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes on her belly, he eased back, then thrust inside her hot, ready pussy. Petra gasped. Clung to him. Worried about him.</p><p>As her sex stretched to accommodate him, Syn\u2019s eyes locked on hers. \u201cNo other male will play father to my balas.\u201d</p><p>Petra swallowed tightly. \u201cSyn . . .\u201d</p><p>He eased out of her, then thrust back in possessively, making her gasp.</p><p>\u201cNo other male will linger above you. Waiting . . . just waiting for the chance . . .\u201d</p><p>He started moving inside her.</p><p>His eyes, their black heat, bored a hole straight through to her soul. \u201cNo other male will lick you, drink from you, fuck you, or make you scream.\u201d</p><p>She cried out as he pulled out of her, then slid all the way down to her sex and plunged his tongue into her cunt. For several mind-altering seconds he fucked her, speared her. Then just as quickly, he left, replaced his tongue with his cock again, and covered her mouth with his own.</p><p>Petra nearly climaxed right there.</p><p>She kissed him fiercely, tasting herself on his tongue. The combination of the two of them was shockingly heady, and she wanted more. She wanted everything. And Syn was determined to give it to her.</p><p>He tunneled under her body and lifted her hips. The harsh cry that escaped her lungs when he drew back and thrust into her rent the air around them. Slightly weak from a long night of lovemaking and Synjon\u2019s intense blood drain, Petra could only hold on and take whatever he had to give her.</p><p>Syn gripped her ass cheeks and pummeled her with stroke after honeyed stroke until she was breathing heavy, moaning his name, and ratcheting up her hips for one last thrust as she came. One loud, raspy scream tore from her throat, and Syn followed her, draining his hot, creamy seed inside her sex.</p><p>Coated in a very sexy layer of sweat, Synjon eased out of her and collapsed to the side. Before she could even release the breath hovering inside her lungs, he caught her up in his arms and pulled her ass to his groin. Petra sighed and melted into his chest. And just when she thought it couldn\u2019t get any better, any sweeter, he covered her\u2014her and their balas\u2014with the softest, thickest blanket in the world.</p><p>19</p><p>Petra woke to near blackness, and it took her a moment, and a good glance around, to realize where she was.</p><p>Syn\u2019s room.</p><p>Syn\u2019s bed.</p><p>And it had to be morning because the skylight overhead was sealed.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. She was alone, though the impression of Syn\u2019s body on the mattress remained. And, of course, his scent. It was everywhere. On the sheets, in the air, all over her naked body.</p><p>Swinging her legs over the side of the bed, she spotted the robe she\u2019d gotten on her shopping trip. It was laid out over the arms of an almond-colored leather chair against the wall. She smiled, knowing Syn had placed it there for her. In any other situation, at any other time, she would\u2019ve let her mind run wild with that gesture. The implications, the potential outcomes. The hopes. But she wasn\u2019t going to do that this time.</p><p>She got out of bed and scooped up the robe. She refused to ruin herself and the wonderful memories of the night before by overanalyzing. When reality settled in, whatever happened, happened. But right now she was going to live in bliss for however long that lasted.</p><p>After slipping the black silk robe on and tying the sash above her belly, she ventured out of the room. Clearly, it was full-on morning now, because every window was sealed and the house was lit by all things electric. As she walked down the hallway, past the teardrops of metal art on the wall, she wondered if Syn was even at home. It was so quiet. She also wondered what she was going to do today. She knew she needed to check in with her family and with Dani. The last thing she wanted was for them to worry about her and once again come to Manhattan to investigate.</p><p>Especially Dani. That female would force her to recite a virtual laundry list of affirmations about never sleeping with vampires named Synjon Wise and listening to genius best friends who were always right.</p><p>Petra laughed to herself at the thought, and didn\u2019t see Synjon until she was nearly on top of him.</p><p>Well, Synjon and a . . . pine tree?</p><p>\u201cMorning, darling,\u201d he said, plugging something into the outlet behind him. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Lights erupted inside the pine tree. \u201cOh!\u201d She looked from the tree to Synjon and back again. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>She stepped over a small pile of boxes, wrapped in beautiful silver-and-gold paper.</p><p>Synjon was looking at her like she had two heads. \u201cChristmas. Don\u2019t you know about that?\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. She\u2019d seen trees lit up when they were in the city. \u201cWe don\u2019t celebrate it in the Rain Forest, but I\u2019ve heard of it. Seen pictures. But\u201d\u2014she looked at him with a confused expression\u2014\u201cwhy are you doing it?\u201d</p><p>He gave her an almost boyish shrug. \u201cYou had a chance to shop for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It was great. I loved it.\u201d She still didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>He stood up, went over to her and ran his hands up her black-silk-covered arms. \u201cSexy. Crikey, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get enough of you, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack atcha,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cNow, tell me what this is, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I thought you should have the same chance for the balas.\u201d He gestured to the gifts. \u201cGo through them, see if there\u2019s anything you like.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the boxes. \u201cYou got things for the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just a few bits and bobbles.\u201d</p><p>Petra felt a huge lump form in her throat. \u201cYou picked out gifts for the baby.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. Gods, it wasn\u2019t even directed at him really. She was just unloading her surprise. This wasn\u2019t the Synjon Wise who\u2019d had his emotions drained and who had seemed completely impassive with regard to her and the balas growing inside her just a few days ago. And frankly, this wasn\u2019t the Synjon Wise from the Rain Forest tree house so many months ago either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned to look at him. This was a Synjon Wise she\u2019d never met before, but had fantasized about in the wee hours of the night when she\u2019d been on her own, looking for Cruen, scared, lonely. The real and open Synjon. The nurturer, the gentle, thoughtful, sensual, playful caretaker.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll come to pick up whatever you don\u2019t like,\u201d he continued, his eyes on her, studying her expression.</p><p>She heard him, knew what he was saying, and yet she found herself asking, \u201cWhen did you do this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Overcome with the moment, the gesture, the happiness inside her, she rose on her toes and wrapped her arms around his neck. Her eyes searched his. \u201cSanta, right?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, veana. Just a father.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, stilled, her gaze locked with his. Oh, gods. His words. This was bad. Or it could be bad. Even she hadn\u2019t gone there in her mind. She\u2019d wanted to. So badly. But she knew where it led. That impossible road. Damn it, why did he have to say that? Something so completely committed? When neither of them knew what the future held. When he was still determined to destroy her father.</p><p>\u201cPetra?\u201d His eyes searched her own. She wondered what he saw there. The truth, or a veana so in love that she was overcome by his thoughtfulness?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI bloody love it.\u201d</p><p>His face broke into a ridiculously gorgeous smile. \u201cI told you. No one claims this balas but me.\u201d</p><p>Right. The balas.</p><p>And what about her?</p> <p>Don\u2019t ruin it. Don\u2019t. For yourself. For him. For Little Fangs. Just don\u2019t. Because odds are you\u2019ll hear something in there you don\u2019t want to deal with right now.</p><p>Her gaze traveled the length of the beautiful pine tree. It smelled amazing. It smelled like family and memories, and a new couple sharing their first Christmas.</p><p>She wondered if it would be the same next year. Or if this was it, all she would get.</p><p>He broke from her grasp, leaned down, grabbed one of the presents, and held it out to her. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>If this was all she got, she was going to enjoy it without regrets.</p><p>She ripped off the paper, flung open the box, and squealed like a young female when she saw a tiny T-shirt with the words \u201cLittle Fangs\u201d printed on it.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He was nearly ready to return what should never have belonged to him in the first place. What had been forced on him. What had tried to take him down, make him so ineffectual and weak he might\u2019ve truly gone through with what the bloodletter had said.</p> <p>Begged Synjon Wise to remove his emotions.</p><p>But that was no longer the only option. The water shifter\u2019s flesh, though beyond vile to force down, was slowly rebuilding his power grid. Granted, each burst was short-lived, so he\u2019d been experimenting with stacking his feedings. Once every few hours, then once per hour, then every thirty minutes.</p><p>The water shifters had watched him carefully. Taking notes, asking questions, making sure that Cruen had the best and most aged flesh. He\u2019d even been experimenting with his flash. Short trips, and only at night because he knew the Romans and the mutores were searching for him. It took consuming flesh at nearly fifteen-minute intervals, but he could finally travel and return without feeling weakened by the effort.</p><p>Tonight, he was going to see his guard. Make sure the male had remained near the gathering stones. If he had, it would tell Cruen everything he needed to know about the guard\u2019s loyalty.</p><p>Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have to die after all.</p><p>Stuffing a good-size chunk of flesh into his mouth and another in his pocket, Cruen left the water shifters\u2019 haven and flashed to a stand of trees just a few yards from the gathering stones. Looking around, sniffing the air, he didn\u2019t see or sense the guard, and his anger flared to life, bringing forth visions of quick justice. But then he realized that the male would not remain out in the open. Not with the search for his master going on.</p><p>He hated to use his new power for anything other than taking down Wise, but he needed to meet with his guard first.</p><p>Checking for movement in the surrounding forest, and finding it quiet, he flashed to a wooded area at the back of the stones and waved his hand in a deep arc.</p><p>The guard\u2019s position, his hiding spot, was instantly revealed. And though Cruen felt a twinge of the old weakness stir within him, he moved steadily toward the male.</p><p>\u201cGood. You remain.\u201d</p><p>The male, who was just emptying his bladder, turned and nodded at Cruen. \u201cOf course, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nearly completed my business with the shifters and will soon be returning to the States.\u201d</p><p>The male eyed him a little too closely. \u201cAnd when will that be, sir?\u201d</p><p>Cruen sniffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t question me, male.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head, but his eyes remained fixed on Cruen. \u201cOf course, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I will tell you this, since you have been a loyal servant to me thus far. My strength has nearly returned, and I won\u2019t need your flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you want me to remain, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be using your abilities for something far more satisfying than a mere flash.\u201d His mouth curved upward, and his hand reached into his pocket and palmed the slimy flesh. \u201cBe ready, male. We will be traveling soon.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Syn had amassed his fortune by blowing up shit, protecting shit, rescuing shit, and keeping his nose out of shit that didn\u2019t concern him. He\u2019d been a ghost and an assassin. A lover and a bastard. A good Samaritan and a decent friend. But he believed that in all that time, all those years, he\u2019d never experienced a moment that was perfectly and utterly fun.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>He leaned back against the club chair and watched Petra go through all the toys and books, baubles and clothing again, her face glowing like a bloody candle. Who would\u2019ve thought that a soon-to-be-stack-of-firewood, some lights, and a few baby gifts would make a veana so happy?</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>He\u2019d done this. And he was right bloody proud of himself, he was.</p><p>\u201cAnything you don\u2019t like, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s all perfect. I don\u2019t know how you managed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be because I myself am perfect.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up, gave him a crooked smile. \u201cYeah, that must be it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not over yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez,\u201d She glanced around, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a pony or something stashed somewhere, do you?\u201d</p><p>Pony. Yes, all children liked to ride those small animals. He\u2019d have to buy a house upstate. Somewhere with a lot of land, stables.</p><p>\u201cSynjon.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cYes, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kidding. No one needs anything else here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you.\u201d Grinning like a bloody fool, he reached behind himself, under the chair and took out a final gift. \u201cHappy Christmas, Petra.\u201d</p><p>She took the small box from him, then found his gaze and shook her head. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already done way too much.\u201d Her shoulders slumped and she looked embarrassed. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have anything for you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her, put a hand on her belly. \u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>He watched her eyes turn color. From the palest of blue to a rich, brilliant sapphire. And within those beautiful orbs, Syn saw something that equally pleased and terrified him. Love. Petra was in love with him.</p><p>Something gripped his heart muscle and squeezed the ruddy shite out of it. He thought it was probably his conscience, but he\u2019d been under the impression it wasn\u2019t working. Petra loved him. They had a balas on the way. And he was still intent on Cruen\u2019s destruction. In this very fucking house, no less.</p><p>His mind hummed. Maybe Petra didn\u2019t have to know anything. Maybe he could keep the fact that Cruen resided and suffered and died under this roof to himself.</p><p>His lip curled.</p><p>Was he truly that cold?</p><p>Christ, he used to be. Now things were different. So different. Because of her and the balas. They\u2019d changed him somehow. They\u2019d forced new and compelling emotions out of him. He didn\u2019t know how that could be possible, but it was true.</p><p>She was still staring at him with unabashed affection.</p><p>He nodded at the box, commanded gently, \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to pull her out of the trance she was in, and she shook her head and tugged the red ribbon off the box. Her hands shook slightly as she pried off the top.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . ,\u201d she breathed, her fingers running over the small diamond key necklace. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay, Petra.\u201d</p><p>She looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat key. It\u2019s not a real key to the door, of course, but it means the same.\u201d Christ, he sounded like a rambling idiot. Which made him realize how desperately he wanted her to say yes. \u201cWill you think about it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her eyes filling with tears.</p><p>Synjon felt the first of many waves of excruciating pain wash over him. He started to get up, but Petra\u2019s hand on his arm stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shaking my head, Mr. Wise,\u201d she said, her mouth curving up into a brilliant smile, \u201cnot because I\u2019m declining your offer, but because I don\u2019t have to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell, veana. I nearly lost my mind there for a moment.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and touched his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m willing to give up the Rain Forest, my family, all I\u2019ve known for you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned broadly.</p><p>Her eyes remained serious. \u201cWhat will you give up for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. Everything,\u201d he said without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cWill you give up my father?\u201d</p><p>Synjon\u2019s smile died a quick, disastrous death, and his gut tightened painfully. What she was saying . . . Christ, what she was asking . . . She didn\u2019t know . . .</p><p>\u201cCan you do that?\u201d She swallowed, watching him carefully. \u201cIf you can\u2019t, please tell me now. I promise there\u2019ll be no hard feelings, no anger, no bitterness. I know how important the balas is to you, and I wouldn\u2019t keep him or her from you. But I need to know for me.\u201d She closed her eyes and took a quick breath, then opened them again. \u201cI want to be with you more than anything. But if this is something you truly can\u2019t let go of, you\u2019re going to have to let go of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Synjon stared into her eyes and searched for an answer.

And, bloody hell, into the arms of another male.</p> <p>\u201cYes, veana,\u201d he said without a blink, a breath, or a \u201cbut.\u201d \u201cI will give up my revenge.\u201d</p><p>For several seconds she just stared at him, her eyes searching his. Maybe she was wondering if she\u2019d heard him correctly, or if he was about to change his mind. But then her face broke into a smile so wide, so happy, so relieved, that his gut ached.</p><p>He was such a vile prat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>Almost giggling, Petra took the necklace from the box and handed it to him. \u201cWill you put it on me?\u201d</p> <p>His gaze dropped to the key. They key that meant a thousand things he couldn\u2019t say. The thousand things he wished and wanted for them. He undid the clasp and fastened it around her neck.</p><p>It was what he so desperately wanted. She was his. Because she wanted to stay. Because she cared for him. Because she might even love him.</p><p>Because she believed the lie he\u2019d just told her.</p><p>20</p><p>Feeyan didn\u2019t glare at Dillon. She didn\u2019t snarl or snip, make a rude comment about Beasts or mutores or gutter rats. She simply turned to the other Order members at the table and said, \u201cA Pureblood vampire is missing in the Rain Forest. Shall we go and find him?\u201d</p><p>Seated behind the table, Dillon stared straight ahead, not listening to the discussion around her. She was pretty sure the Impure would vote her way, but she wasn\u2019t about to try to convince anyone else. Feeyan was the leader of this brood, and like it or not\u2014agree with her or not\u2014the majority tended to side with her.</p> <p>Fear and ancient ways still ruled the Order. A more modern approach to governing a community wasn\u2019t about to suddenly take effect just because they now had a mutore and an Impure among them.</p><p>It would take time.</p><p>Feeyan rose from her chair and her voice boomed down the table toward Dillon. \u201cWill you lead the way, Order Member Nine? Or is this a trip we must take without you?\u201d</p><p>Dillon\u2019s jaw was so tight, she was afraid it might snap. She turned toward the veana and said in the steadiest voice she could muster, \u201cIf you choose Cruen over common sense, I will stand with the shifters.\u201d Then she turned back and faced forward again.</p><p>Around her the shocked and appalled prattle began.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>As the hot spray pummeled her back, Petra dropped her head and fingered the key around her neck. Even in the dim light of the shower, the diamond charm sparkled brilliantly. She couldn\u2019t believe what had happened this morning. The tree, the presents, the promises. It was perfect. And if there was one thing she knew didn\u2019t exist, it was perfection.</p><p>But when she was around Synjon, when he looked at her with an almost covetous glint in his eyes, she felt reality slip away. She wanted this. Him. Them.</p> <p>She just prayed he could keep his promise.</p><p>Deep in thought, she didn\u2019t hear Synjon slip into the shower or feel him curl behind her, until his arms were wrapped around her belly and his lips were pressed to her shoulder blade.</p><p>She gasped as he trailed a line of fiery kisses up her shoulder to her neck, pausing when he was close to her ear.</p><p>\u201cPlaying with your key,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYour mind elsewhere. Having second thoughts, love?\u201d</p><p>Even in the hot, steam-filled shower, she shivered. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>His hands drifted up, over her belly to cup her breasts. \u201cWhat about, then?\u201d</p><p>She sighed at the feel of his large, slightly rough palms. \u201cWell, this key,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not very practical.\u201d Her nostrils flared as he started gently pinching her nipples. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t unlock anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBollocks.\u201d He rolled his hips. His cock was like steel against her back. \u201cI think the bloody thing unlocks my heart.\u201d</p><p>She melted at his words. \u201cIsn\u2019t your heart as silent as mine, vampire?\u201d Gods, she wanted this, him. And she wanted his cock inside her again.</p><p>He chuckled softly, then eased her legs apart with his foot. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be opened. Allowed a little light and care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Syn,\u201d she said breathlessly, her skin tightening, tingling.</p><p>His hands moved from her breasts around to her back. As the shower rained down on both of them, he traced the line of her spine. \u201cDo you want me to be open to you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Petra breathed, anticipating the descent of his fingers as she let her hands rest on the wet walls in front of her.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want you to be open to me. Always.\u201d Synjon continued downward, moving through the crease in her bottom, flipping his wrist just in time to ease two fingers inside her.</p><p>Petra\u2019s groan of lust echoed throughout the stone shower.</p><p>He nipped at her shoulder. \u201cA little farther open if you will, love.\u201d</p><p>She arched her back.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm, there it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Syn.\u201d Her insides were tight and trembling. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant,\u201d he growled. \u201cBecause I need you, too, Petra, love.\u201d He slipped his fingers out, and she felt the head of his cock nudge against her sex. \u201cMore than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>He punctuated his words with one perfect thrust into her cunt. Crying out, Petra arched her back and circled her hips, trying to get his iron cock to hit every inch of her creaming walls.</p><p>She heard Syn hiss, then felt his arm move over her shoulder. The sudden and intoxicating scent of hot, rich blood encircled her and instantly her fangs dropped. As Syn moved inside her, his strokes slow and shockingly deep, Petra drove her fangs into his waiting vein.</p><p>All thoughts drifted out of her mind, never to be analyzed again, and she became one humming, raw thread of feeling. Behind her, Syn growled and hissed and continued to drive up into her with a perfect rhythm that was designed to send her screaming over the edge.</p><p>Blood cascaded into her mouth, slid down her throat, fusing with the sensations of impending climax. It was a smoking leaf to a vast forest of dry brush, and Syn\u2019s thrusts caught that fire and quickened. The sound of wet bodies slapping against each other filled the air, and Petra\u2019s legs started to lose their purchase. She dropped his arm and leaned against the shower wall as inside her trembling pussy, Synjon\u2019s cock swelled mercilessly.</p><p>Brilliant light burst inside her mind, and she slammed her hips back and came hard, moaning and whimpering, bucking and cursing, and wishing she could sustain the intensity of her climax for hours, days . . .</p><p>Syn gripped her ass and growled, the unearthly sound making the hairs on her arms stand up as he pounded ruthlessly into her.</p><p>And then Petra spread her legs even wider and leaned over, giving him full access. She heard him curse, felt him lightly slap her right cheek, and with four deep, driving thrusts, he came inside her.</p><p>Hot seed coated her walls, and she whimpered. She loved that feeling, loved having him impaled inside her.</p><p>For several long moments, neither of them moved. As the water turned cool, and Syn\u2019s fingers lightly brushed the skin of her back and buttocks, the only sound was heavy breathing diminishing into soft pants of satisfaction.</p><p>Exhaustion claimed her, and Petra barely noticed when Syn eased out of her, shut off the water, and wrapped her in a warm towel. She curled into him as he lifted her and carried her out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cSleepy, love?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cHmmmm,\u201d she answered, nodding her head against his chest, kissing his smooth, hard skin.</p><p>He chuckled as he placed her on the cool sheets. When he drew back to get the covers, Petra grabbed his arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d she whispered in a bleary tone.</p><p>The mattress dipped with his weight, and he moved in close behind her. \u201cNever.\u201d He pressed his body right up against hers and dropped a kiss to her shoulder. \u201cSleep now, m\u2019dear, m\u2019darling.\u201d</p><p>Smiling to herself, she snuggled into the curve of his body, loving his words, loving his heat, loving his closeness.</p><p>Gods.</p><p>Loving him.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Synjon strode into the diner and headed for the back booth. Leaving Petra, all warm and wet and soft in his bed, was the hardest thing he\u2019d ever done. And he wasn\u2019t even going to think about how he was lying to her in more than a few ways. Prat. He was just fecking worthless, truly. But once again, Adrian\u2019s text had drawn him out\u2014out of what was so perfect and happy, and toward something dusty and vile-smelling that he just couldn\u2019t seem to turn away from.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be gone long,\u201d he said, slipping into the red leather booth across from the badass, ginger-haired paven.</p><p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d Adrian said, glancing around the diner before turning his eyes on Syn. \u201cCruen\u2019s nearly ready to leave, and he\u2019s gaining strength.\u201d</p><p>A shot of unease moved through Syn\u2019s gut. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to find out.\u201d Syn leaned across the table, his voice low and calculating. \u201cWe can\u2019t have the old Cruen on our hands. Not until he\u2019s in chains and under lock and key\u2014and the heat of the midday sun.\u201d He said the words with such fury and conviction, he knew in that moment that letting go of his need for vengeance wouldn\u2019t be nearly as simple as a promise made to the veana he wanted.</p><p>\u201cProblem is,\u201d Adrian said, \u201che won\u2019t allow me to come with him. Whatever it is that\u2019s filling him with new strength comes from the water shifters there.\u201d He paused, thoughtful. \u201cI say we move now. I\u2019m ready. You\u2019re ready. Right?\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell, he\u2019d been ready for so long he couldn\u2019t remember what it felt like to be unburdened. Synjon stared at the paven before him. Juliet\u2019s brother wanted this, needed this. Shite, deserved this. It was decision time. If he could just make this happen without Petra finding out . . . But that wasn\u2019t possible, and he knew it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSyn?\u201d</p><p>Syn\u2019s eyes rose, locked with Adrian\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d asked the paven. \u201cAt first dark?\u201d</p> <p>A flash of Juliet\u2019s face moved across Syn\u2019s mind, and he winced. Her death, her murder, had to be avenged.</p><p>He gave the male a quick nod. His deal with the devil had been made a long time ago, his seat in Hell kept warm by just the idea of being the one who rid the world of that sodding bastard Cruen. It was time to end this\u2014end him\u2014once and for all.</p><p>21</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m set on onesies until the balas is in college.\u201d Under the cool, crisp light of the midday sun, Sara tossed Petra an overwhelmed expression. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>Petra couldn\u2019t help but laugh as they walked down the busy street toward Syn\u2019s apartment. \u201cNot sure about the onesies, but I have diapers to last until then. Or for a month, depending on how many times I have to change him or her per day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many times you have to change . . .\u201d Sara narrowed her eyes, but said playfully, \u201cCome on now. You know that\u2019s the dad\u2019s job, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiaper duty?\u201d Petra asked.</p><p>\u201cDealing with all the shit.\u201d Sara\u2019s face broke out in a wide grin.</p><p>Petra laughed again and sidestepped a mom and her stroller. When Sara had called this morning, Petra hadn\u2019t been all that sure if the veana\u2019s suggestion to do a little baby shopping was a good idea or not. For one thing, Petra had all those baby things that Syn had gotten her, but for another\u2014and maybe this was what concerned her the most\u2014she hadn\u2019t had any true interaction with her half sister since she\u2019d found out the truth about their mutual parent. She had no idea what to expect. Would the veana be outwardly friendly, but unable to mask a cool distrust behind her eyes? Of course, that worry couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth. Sara was welcoming and kind and funny, and cool in a good way. And damn if they didn\u2019t have several things in common besides their bellies.</p><p>The morning had been a mass of sunshine, but now gray clouds were starting to move in and it felt like snow was on the way. As they walked, and as the air grew colder and the holiday lights and decorations winked at them in their merry way, Petra felt a deep sense of connection move through her. And yet she didn\u2019t want there to be any confusion about other members of the family. Particularly Sara\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you called,\u201d Petra said as they came to Syn\u2019s building.</p> <p>Sara\u2019s smile was brilliant. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need you to know, I\u2019m just sort of coming to terms with where I came from and how. Being the offspring of blackmail, and all that.\u201d</p><p>The truth in her words, and no doubt the memory of learning that her mother, Celestine, had gone to Cruen, slept with Cruen, only to get her mate released from imprisonment and impending castration, made Sara\u2019s face fall a little.</p><p>\u201cPetra, you don\u2019t have to explain any of this to me,\u201d she said sadly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to. I want to have a relationship with you. I\u2019m just not ready to call anyone else mom. Don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>Sara nodded. \u201cI totally understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good.\u201d Petra nodded too and smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe we can bring Gray along next time?\u201d Sara\u2019s eyes, so similar to Petra\u2019s, widened with hope. \u201cI know he\u2019d love it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore baby shopping?\u201d</p><p>Sara laughed. \u201cTotally. He\u2019s about to be an uncle to two balas, after all. We\u2019ll make him try out toys and hold our breast pumps and carry stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of evil,\u201d Petra said with a slow grin. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>Still laughing, Sara embraced her. It was a nice feeling. All her life, she\u2019d had brothers\u2014and she completely adored them\u2014but this . . . this was something special, female . . . And she wanted it to last.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Petra said, \u201care you getting nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, for the birth?\u201d</p><p>Petra nodded.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d She shifted her bags to her other hand. \u201cBut I have Alexander. He\u2019s going to get me through it, deal with my cursing and my death grip on his hands during contractions.\u201d</p><p>Petra laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have Syn. Right?\u201d</p><p>Her laughter softened, then downgraded to a tight-lipped smile. \u201cYeah. I guess I do.\u201d</p><p>Above them the sun had been overtaken completely, and the world was suddenly plunged into a cold shade of gunmetal. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m happy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re worried something will screw up that happiness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>Snow started to fall as Sara dropped her packages and took Petra\u2019s hand. \u201cListen, I know this didn\u2019t happen right, and I heard all that you said about the past and the present and my mother, but I want you to know I care about you. I\u2019m here for you if you ever want to talk, or bitch.\u201d She grinned. \u201cOr just hang out. I really want us to be friends, and maybe someday\u201d\u2014she shrugged\u2014\u201csisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that too.\u201d Petra gave her a quick hug, then eased back and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Sara said with a smile of her own. She picked up her bags, gave a wave, then headed down the street.</p><p>Petra entered the building and seconds after she hit the elevator button realized she\u2019d forgotten to get a key from Synjon before she\u2019d left. Thankfully the concierge remembered her, took one look at her belly and all the packages, and supplied her with one.</p><p>The ride up to the penthouse was quick, and after she battled her packages to the door, she entered the apartment with a thankful sigh. It was dark and quiet, and after dropping the bags in the living room, she went to look for Syn. But the rest of the place was just as dark, just as quiet. Strange\u2014he hadn\u2019t said anything about going out when she\u2019d left this morning. And it was daytime.</p><p>Maybe he was downstairs at the gym, or maybe he knew about the tunnels below the city that Sara had told her about today, and was hanging out with the Roman brothers. He seemed to have a relationship with the very blond, sarcastic one, Lucian.</p><p>Gathering up her packages again, she headed into her room. She set them on the desk, glanced at the bed and thought about grabbing a nap. It was good for Syn to have some normal chill time with friends. She couldn\u2019t imagine he did that often. She looked for her robe, the soft, black silk one she liked to sleep in when she wasn\u2019t sleeping naked with Syn, but it wasn\u2019t where she\u2019d left it. Or thought she\u2019d left it.</p><p>Tossing her coat over the end of the bed, she left her room and headed for Syn\u2019s. No doubt she\u2019d left it in there, and maybe she would just take her nap in his bed instead of her own. She grinned as she entered his room, which still held the scent of their lovemaking from the night before. Yes, definitely in here. And when Syn came home, he could just strip and crawl under the covers with her.</p><p>Her body instantly went hot at the thought.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he does to you, girl,\u201d she mumbled as she entered his bathroom. She didn\u2019t bother with the light. Her robe wasn\u2019t on the hook beside the shower where she\u2019d expected to find it, and she was about to return to her room and just sleep in the buff, when her gaze fell on the walk-in closet. Hanging up there, next to his suits and sexy black shirts, jeans and robe, was her lovely piece of silk.</p><p>Had he put it here? With his own clothes?</p><p>She went over to it, but didn\u2019t pluck it off the hanger right away. Instead she fingered the charcoal gray sweater next to it. The fabric was so soft. She knew what this would look like on him, feel like on him, hard, unyielding muscle through soft cashmere.</p><p>She brushed the sleeve against her face and nearly moaned, but at that very moment, she heard a sound. Strange, unnerving, and coming from beyond the closet. Her instant thought was that it was the neighbors, but Syn didn\u2019t have any neighbors. Or an animal burrowing in the walls? But the sound wasn\u2019t animal-like at all. It was more of a metallic whine.</p><p>She let go of the sweater and ventured deeper into the closet. The sound was probably coming from outside. Maybe they were erecting another building close by or something. But when the sound came again, louder and stranger, her skin prickled with fear. At this point, she was really hoping it was an animal.</p><p>She moved her hand through a row of heavy coats and jackets, feeling for the back of the closet, or gods, an animal\u2019s sharp teeth. When her fingers touched wood, she shook her head at her silliness and sighed with relief.</p><p>Then the wood moved.</p><p>Petra gasped, her gut clenching terribly. Instead of being solid, it gave way. Like a door.</p><p>Her breath now coming in quick, shallow pants, she told herself to turn around and walk away. But the rational part of her brain refused the call, and her curiosity and instinct propelled her forward, almost maniacally compelling her to part the jackets and step inside.</p><p>Everything happened unbelievably fast after that. One moment she was amid waves of wool and leather, and the next she was being pulled inside a dimly lit room by a shocked and pissed-off Synjon Wise.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d she stuttered, looking from him to her surroundings. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>He growled, hissed, turned away from her, then turned back with a ferocious glare. She\u2019d never seen him so angry. \u201cBloody hell, veana. What are you doing here? How did you get into the apartment?\u201d</p><p>She gasped, her hand jerking up to cover her mouth. At first she thought her eyes were fooling her. Or that maybe she was actually napping and this was a nightmare. The room she stood in had no windows, but the ceiling had the same black covering that was on all the windows during the day, so she suspected the entire thing was glass. But it wasn\u2019t the ceiling that disturbed her or made her gut twist and ache. It was the contents of the room. Whips, knives, machines\u2014all things that were designed to torture, kill.</p><p>She whimpered against her shaking hand, her eyes moving over the scene again, back and forth. She didn\u2019t even have to ask. She knew who this room was meant for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the monster now, right, love?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him. Couldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow long has this been here?\u201d</p> <p>He exhaled loudly. \u201cThe room was already built when I bought the place. I customized it to my taste.\u201d</p><p>The shock was starting to wear off, and horrific, nightmarish reality was moving in, quick and painful. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetra . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still plan on using this, don\u2019t you?\u201d She turned from the living nightmare and finally looked up at him. He was the most gorgeous male in the world, and the most haunted. She shook her head at him. \u201cWith me and the balas here. Are you fucking out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou lied to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cThen I understand perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour emotions are definitely back, Syn. And they\u2019re just as sad and dated and misguided as they ever were.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t spare him or the room of torture another glance. She turned and walked through the open doorway, pushed back through the closet. She\u2019d been so right to be wary when all she wanted was to believe in him, believe that he could let this shit with Cruen go so they could build a family together.</p> <p>\u201cStop right there!\u201d he called, coming after her. \u201cWhere the devil do you think you are going, Petra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d she called back, hurrying out of his bedroom and down the hall.</p><p>\u201cOf course it fucking matters!\u201d he shouted after her.</p><p>She ignored the grinding pain in her gut, ignored the love she had in her unbeating heart. She would have to ignore it forever now. \u201cI\u2019m going home, Syn. Where I belong.\u201d</p><p>When she reached the entry hall, he was right beside her, his hand hitting the front door at the very moment hers curled around the knob. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and pushed at him, but it was like trying to move a slab of ten-feet-thick granite. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to say no to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a bloody family, Petra.\u201d</p><p>She froze. How dare he . . . How fucking dare he . . .</p> <p>She whirled on him, poked her finger in his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what that word means. You\u2019re an empty shell, Syn. No life. Nothing real. And that\u2019s been your choice from the beginning.\u201d Her jaw as tight as her resolve, she glared at him. \u201cNo matter what you think happened that day near the caves, I didn\u2019t save your life. Because you were already dead before I got there.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went wide and his lips parted, but nothing came out. And the second he took his hand off the door, Petra yanked it open.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no future for those who continue to live in the past. Good-bye, Syn.\u201d</p><p>A heavy sob threatened to burst from her chest, but she managed to hold back her tears until the elevator door closed and she was racing down to the lobby.</p><p>22</p><p>Syn stared down at the diamond key, glittering on the hardwood floor. When had she ripped it from her throat? When had she tossed it away so carelessly?</p><p>His gut tightened painfully and he groaned.</p><p>He was one to talk about careless. It was all he\u2019d been for months.</p><p>He leaned down and picked up the key. It fairly burned in his hand. The platinum and diamonds didn\u2019t want to belong to him. Not after they had been resting against someone, something so pure.</p><p>Fucking hell, what had he done?</p><p>His mind and gut screaming in unison now, he left the hall and stalked past the kitchen and the metal artwork on the walls to his bedroom. Her face. Shite, her eyes, when she\u2019d walked through the door into his ready torture chamber. He would never forget it. It was imprinted on his mind.</p><p>Utter horror.</p><p>Entering the closet, he pushed through the wool and leather and stumbled back into the room. He looked around, trying to take in everything as if for the first time. Witness it as she had witnessed it.</p><p>Fucking utter horror.</p><p>And it had been exactly what he\u2019d wanted. All he\u2019d wanted. The place where, he\u2019d been convinced, vengeance would finally be his.</p><p>He moved into the room and grabbed one of the blades from the wall. Three feet of deadly polished steel. He slashed it through the air, cursing, hating himself more than usual.</p><p>Cruen had killed his first love. Now Synjon was allowing the mad vampire to destroy his last.</p><p>Sighing with frustration, with confusion, with misery for the life and future he\u2019d just lost, he dropped onto the hard metal bench. He hated to admit it, but his need for revenge had started to wane the day he\u2019d been abducted by the pussy brothers, placed in a cabin by the river, and given the opportunity of a lifetime: to feed his veana and his balas.</p><p>He stared at the blade.</p><p>Out there, in his living room, under a sweet-smelling pine, were baby books, a tub shaped like a duck, two stuffed toy rabbits, and a shirt with the words \u201cLittle Fangs\u201d printed on it.</p><p>Syn\u2019s throat went scratchy and tight. Bullocks. He had been about to bring filth and hatred and sickness into this house, into that sweet and innocent perfection. And the very worst, he\u2019d lied to the veana he loved. The veana who had done nothing but save him. Over and over.</p><p>His gaze shifted from one implement of torture to the next. Cruen had no place here anymore. Maybe he never did.</p><p>Unfortunately, convincing Petra that he understood now, that he\u2019d changed, that he saw what was real and right, and acknowledging that \u201cdesperately sorry\u201d would never make up for what he\u2019d put her through, was going to be a nearly impossible task.</p><p>But impossible hadn\u2019t seemed to contain him lately. Not his emotions, and definitely not his capacity for love.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cI made ice cream,\u201d Dani said in a playful singsong voice that she reserved for very special occasions. Like breakups, and Battlestar Galactica marathons. She circled her bowl in front of Petra\u2019s nose. \u201cYou know you want some.\u201d</p><p>Sitting in a chair on the tree house porch, overlooking the Rain Forest under a dome of twilight sky, Petra gave the female hawk shifter a tight smile. It was blatantly forced, but Dani knew that was how things were right now.</p><p>Broken heart and all.</p><p>Dani dropped into the chair beside her and started going at it, her spoon deep in the center of the chocolate scoop. \u201cYou sure? It\u2019s the best I ever made.\u201d</p><p>The soft, warm breeze blew Petra\u2019s hair off her face. She\u2019d missed it here. She\u2019d been a fool to leave. She\u2019d just been a fool, period. \u201cSorry, bestie. Blood\u2019s my thing now.\u201d</p><p>Dani made a retching sound. \u201cWell, I ain\u2019t offering up that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Petra said with a soft laugh. \u201c\u2019Cause I hear yours is a little sour.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open in mock surprise. \u201cWho\u2019d you hear that from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, one of the many males you hang out with.\u201d</p><p>Dani pointed her spoon at Petra. \u201cNow I know you\u2019re lying because I don\u2019t let anyone bite me.\u201d She pretended to shiver. \u201cThat\u2019s so weird and gross. How do you do it?\u201d</p><p>A shock of memory barreled through Petra. Her fangs in Syn\u2019s vein, his fangs inside her. The most perfect meal in the world, and she could never have it again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do it,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Dani sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ll get over it, Pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And she really didn\u2019t. She\u2019d allowed herself to believe in him, and in them as a family. How did you just get over something like that? Everything you ever wanted, desired, dreamed of, there for the taking. Then ripped from you without even a warning, or some heavy-duty pain-killers.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Dani assured her, her ice cream momentarily forgotten. \u201cAnd, girlie, it wasn\u2019t meant to be. You know that.\u201d She tilted her head to the side, her eyes filled with empathy, anger, love. \u201cHis whole deal, his world, his purpose was wrapped up in destroying your father. Now, granted, your father sounds like a big old douche, but seriously, that romance was doomed from the start.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, Petra thought morosely. Probably. But even knowing that, admitting that, she wouldn\u2019t wish it away. The beautiful times with him had been the very best times of her life. They may have been wrapped up in something ugly, but they\u2019d been absolutely beautiful.</p><p>\u201cBrodan?\u201d</p><p>Dani\u2019s one-word shock bomb had Petra turning to glare at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Dani laughed at her expression. \u201cJust asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Dani? Now? Right now?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, Dani slid a massive spoonful of ice cream into her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m just saying. Don\u2019t waste too much time. Brodan\u2019s been in love with you forever. All you\u2019d have to do is say the word.\u201d</p><p>The only words Petra wanted to utter with the bear shifter were friendly, brotherly ones. \u201cBrodan deserves way better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing better than you, bestie.\u201d Dani granted her a wide grin, complete with chocolate-stained teeth.</p><p>Petra laughed in spite of herself. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty.\u201d</p><p>Dani started laughing too. They almost didn\u2019t hear a rustle down below, at the base of the tree house. Only when they quieted for a moment, listening, did they hear the sound.</p><p>\u201cWe have company,\u201d Dani said. They both jumped to their feet and raced to the porch railing. Leaning over it, they saw Sasha crawling up the rope ladder.</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez,\u201d Petra muttered, releasing a sigh of relief. \u201cIt\u2019s just my brother.\u201d</p><p>Dani eyed her. \u201cWho\u2019d you think it was? Or better yet, who\u2019d you hope it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ice cream\u2019s melting,\u201d Petra said.</p><p>\u201cNice. Very smooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to make my evasions quick and sweet-tasting.\u201d</p><p>Dani glanced down at Sasha, who was nearly at the balcony. \u201cI wondered when they\u2019d hear about this, you returning home and all, and come running. Or climbing.\u201d She snorted at her joke, and the moment Sasha swung his large body over the balcony, she attacked. \u201cWhat do you want, Whiskers? For fuck\u2019s sake, can\u2019t a girl and her best friend have some\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStand down, Dani. Christ,\u201d Sasha interrupted, his tone and his expression heavy with concern. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Dani asked, drawing back, instantly serious.</p><p>Petra stilled, wondering if her brother was talking about Syn, and maybe . . . Sara or her mate. But that impossible hope was quickly crushed with Sasha\u2019s next words.</p> <p>\u201cThe Order,\u201d he said, his eyes shuttered. \u201cThey\u2019re all at the gathering stones.\u201d</p><p>Petra felt a shock like electricity move through her. Forget her and forget Synjon\u2014the Order was looking for her father now. They believed him to have been abducted by the shifters. Held against his will. Something that Petra knew wasn\u2019t possible. Once again Cruen was up to something. What a mess this whole thing was. Synjon had wanted to be the one to abduct Cruen, and yet her father had run off with some underground water shifters and was now becoming a dangerous, threatening problem to Petra\u2019s family and friends.</p><p>Gods, why did she continue to care about that paven\u2019s well-being?</p><p>Why did something inside her still hope and wonder if he might love her? Or at the very least, care about her.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Dani said, already stripping out of her clothes. \u201cAre they looking for a fight over that geriatric vampire who went looking for trouble in our Rain Forest?\u201d</p> <p>Sasha nodded, but his eyes remained on Petra. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s give \u2019em one.\u201d</p><p>Shifting into her hawk, wings spread and flapping in the breeze, Dani screeched at the two of them to climb aboard. And when they did, she wasted no time in soaring into the sky, her eyes narrowed on the growing firelight in the distance.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The jaguar, the hawk, and the water beast stood between the shifters and the Order in the center of the gathering stones. The night was very dark, punctuated only by a brilliant full moon in the sky and a bonfire down below.</p><p>Dillon didn\u2019t know about Phane and Helo\u2014and who the hell knew where Lycos was hanging out these days\u2014but this wasn\u2019t about choosing between vampire and shifter. This was about right and wrong. Bully and innocent. And the Order had just crossed that line.</p> <p>For fucking Cruen.</p><p>\u201cWe are getting word that Cruen is staying with a group of water shifters,\u201d Dillon said, her eyes flickering toward the leader of the Water Faction.</p><p>The male knew that a small band of his kind had broken off, were experimenting on themselves with plants and animals, trying to gain power and strength. And it wasn\u2019t too far a stretch that Cruen would end up with such a pack.</p><p>\u201cProduce him so we may see for ourselves,\u201d said Feeyan, her white eyes shockingly bare in the light of the bonfire. She looked almost blind.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t come out for anyone,\u201d Dillon told her. \u201cThese shifters aren\u2019t following the rules of their land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re dealing with rogue shifters.\u201d Feeyan glanced behind her to the other Order members. \u201cEven worse than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Dillon should\u2019ve known her boss would see things that way, would spin them that way. She should\u2019ve anticipated. Now there did seem to be an actual threat.</p><p>\u201cWe ask you to step aside,\u201d Feeyan said, her stark gaze running over every faction leader, Petra\u2019s mother, and a few other shifter males, including the doctor. \u201cLet us find Cruen and deal with the ones who took him.\u201d</p> <p>Overhead, a hawk was coming in for a landing. Dillon barely gave it a glance. She knew who was arriving, and wondered if it would have any effect on the situation. She guessed not. Feeyan had something to prove. Dillon had noticed it ever since she\u2019d become the leader of the Order. And it had gotten worse as of late. It was evident in her actions, reactions, choices, even the way she continually looked to the other Order members for approval. From what Dillon had heard, Cruen had never given a shit about what the others thought or about gaining their respect. He did what he wanted, what he thought was right, and screw what anyone else said.</p><p>It made Dillon wonder if that was why Cruen remained important to Feeyan, and why the veana hadn\u2019t attempted to investigate the paven for any of his many crimes.</p><p>\u201cAnd if we don\u2019t step aside?\u201d Wen asked boldly.</p><p>Behind Feeyan, two of the more ancient members hissed. Looking pleased, she raised her hand to quell their ire. \u201cWe will have to wipe out this entire forest. Clean house, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>The leader of the Mountain Faction stepped forward, close to the fire, and growled. \u201cHow dare you come here and threaten us, our home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no threat, only an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloodsuckers will not dictate our actions or control our world!\u201d cried the leader of the Avians.</p><p>\u201cYou either give back who you took or we go in and find him ourselves.\u201d Feeyan beamed. \u201cYou see? Very simple.\u201d</p><p>Petra came running into the gathering stones, her brother and Dani flanking her. \u201cI\u2019m Cruen\u2019s daughter,\u201d she said in a loud, clear voice. She looked around, searching, and when she found Feeyan, she addressed her directly. Dillon had to hand it to the pregnant veana. She had some serious balls.</p><p>\u201cAnd a full-blood veana,\u201d she continued. \u201cLong ago, Cruen left me here. I was just an infant. He knows this species, has used them for experiments, and gave his only child to a pride of lions. They raised me beautifully. Clearly he trusts them, feels comfortable among them. If he wanted to leave, all he\u2019d have to do is flash. He\u2019s a powerful paven, is he not?\u201d</p><p>The skin around Feeyan\u2019s eyes twitched. \u201cAll Purebloods are powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Cruen is more so,\u201d Petra said, lifting her chin. \u201cDid you ever wonder why?\u201d</p><p>Behind Feeyan, the other members stood stock-still, listening intently.</p><p>\u201cHe dipped into many species,\u201d she continued. \u201cShifter, demon, gods know what else, all in the name of power. He wanted the ultimate vampire, and to do that he added the DNA of other powerful beings.\u201d She stepped forward. \u201cDo you really think he\u2019s worth a war?\u201d</p><p>Feeyan didn\u2019t speak at first. She seemed less confident, almost worried, as she stood there and regarded Petra. Dillon stared at her, wondering what she was thinking, how she was going to play this now that Cruen\u2019s daughter had proclaimed him able to leave this land anytime he wanted. If Feeyan fought that charge, she was basically saying that Purebloods were weak. If she didn\u2019t, she herself looked weak.</p><p>Behind her, several of the Order members started whispering. Dillon heard things like, \u201cWe look like fools\u201d and \u201cAre we truly negotiating with animals?\u201d and \u201cCruen would\u2019ve never let this go on.\u201d</p><p>Feeyan seemed to make a choice right there. Everything about her changed in an instant. Her demeanor, her stance, even the way she spoke. Clearly, she wasn\u2019t about to let the Order members see her as weak. Even if that might be the truth.</p><p>\u201cWe want access to the Rain Forest,\u201d she said finally. \u201cWe will find him ourselves. Question him about his activities ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t want to be found,\u201d Dillon said with a tight shrug.</p><p>Feeyan\u2019s lips twitched with humor. \u201cNo matter what his daughter says, no Pureblood vampire wants to live in this jungle. And after this day, none ever will.\u201d She turned to address the three Romans brothers and their mates, who had been silent and seething as they sat upon the rocks. \u201cIt sets a bad precedent,\u201d she continued authoritatively. \u201cThe Eternal Breed and . . . whatever these things are will not live together.\u201d</p><p>With one hand on her belly, Petra glared at the Order. \u201cYou can\u2019t control where we live.\u201d</p><p>A false smile on her face, Feeyan raised her hands above her head, then abruptly brought them down. Instantly, snow started to fall.</p><p>The shifters gasped and leaped to their feet, touched their heads and shoulders, wondering if they were being burned. Clearly, they had never seen snow before.</p><p>Feeyan eyed Petra. \u201cI can control everything, my dear. This\u2014what you see before you\u2014is just a whisper of my power.\u201d She turned to Wen and the faction leaders. \u201cI will search this forest, find my Pureblood. And I will do it either with your approval or with your blood on my fangs.\u201d</p><p>23</p><p>Synjon landed at the mouth of the caves, the caves where he\u2019d watched Juliet\u2019s body burn, where he\u2019d held and kissed Petra, where he\u2019d realized something had changed within him and that his dead emotions had somehow sprung up from the ashes and were growing once again.</p><p>The moon was a spotlight above him, bathing the interior of the cave in ghostly white for a good ten feet. Adrian waited for him inside. They were going to make the trek to the gathering stones, where Cruen was to meet up with his trusted guard. That was the plan anyway.</p><p>A whimper from inside the caves drew Syn forward, and he followed the dim light all the way to the back of the cave walls. He\u2019d been here twice in eight months, had witnessed his own mental collapse as well as the confusion and sexual desire and despair of the greatest kind. But never had he come upon something so impossible to resist as Cruen, unconscious and unchained.</p><p>He stared at the bloodied and bruised monster just inches away from his feet.</p><p>\u201cForget the stones,\u201d Adrian said to him with a dark grin. \u201cWe can take him to his final resting place right now.\u201d</p><p>The male looked bloody feral, Syn thought, a whisper of concern moving through him. Completely jacked up on adrenaline. \u201cHow did you manage this?\u201d</p><p>Adrian shrugged, his fangs hanging low, the points illuminated by the one thread of moonlight that had tracked deep inside the cave. \u201cDrugs. I stole them from the shifter doctor.\u201d Adrian grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s like some kind of animal tranquilizer.\u201d</p><p>Spreading like cancer through Syn\u2019s blood was the satisfaction of knowing that Cruen could be brought down. That he wasn\u2019t even close to his full strength. Containment could be so easy. He picked up the paven\u2019s legs while Adrian took his shoulders, and they carried him outside the cave.</p><p>\u201cI kept him inside,\u201d Adrian said, glancing around. \u201cCan\u2019t have the Avians flying overhead, seeing something strange that they feel they have to investigate, can we?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m taking him to the Order, Adrian.\u201d</p><p>At first the ginger-haired paven didn\u2019t react. His expression was blank as he stared at Synjon. Then he broke out in something like a low, sinister laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t hear you correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll go to Mondrar.\u201d</p> <p>A muted growl rent the warm night air. \u201cSyn.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he didn\u2019t blame the male for what was coming next. \u201cThat\u2019s where he belongs, Adrian, the vampire prison. That\u2019s where criminals belong.\u201d</p><p>Adrian released his grip on Cruen and the paven sank to the ground. He stalked toward Syn, his eyes narrowing with every step. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanged my mind, mate. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than your mind, I\u2019d say. I thought he belonged with you, tortured until his last breath.\u201d His eyes bored into Syn\u2019s and he uttered the one word he knew would not only slide the knife home but twist it good and painfully. \u201cJuliet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI loved her. So much.\u201d He shook his head, feeling the knife slide out again. \u201cBut she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Adrian hissed. \u201cAnd he did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s not enough for him to sit in a cell, breathe easy, and get three blood draws a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not,\u201d Syn agreed. \u201cBut his death means more now than it ever did. It means my life is over too. I have a mate and a balas on the way. They\u2019re his blood. He deserves punishment forever if I can manage it. But not by my hand anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat veana has changed you,\u201d Adrian said tersely. \u201cSoftened you into something you should be ashamed of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo shame, mate. Not for loving. When Cruen drained my emotions, I thought I was dead, lost forever. But Petra and the balas brought me back. I want to live a different life for them.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s lip curled. \u201cYou pick this female over my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Syn said without hesitation.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen such pain in the male\u2019s eyes before. And bloody hell if he didn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t make him pay,\u201d Adrian began, crouching in a fighting stance, \u201cmake him hurt, then I will.\u201d</p><p>Fighting Juliet\u2019s brother to save Cruen was the last thing Synjon would ever have wanted to do. But he did it. One full minute of jabs to the face, throat, and knees, his own fingers crushed on his right hand from being bent back, and one black eye that had made him see stars for a few seconds.</p><p>But then Cruen was up and against him, his head flopping forward as Synjon granted one last look at the bloodied paven on his knees before flashing away.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>The moon was bright above.</p><p>The Rain Forest hummed with the sounds of insects, and the night\u2019s heat still infused her skin.</p><p>But pelting her shoulders and the top of her head were sugar-light flakes of snow.</p><p>Petra glared at the leader of the Eternal Order. This veana who felt it was her right to flash into a world she knew nothing about and threaten its inhabitants. She hated that she came from such a line of bullies. Feeyan, her father . . . Granted, she knew there was good in the world of bloodsuckers. Her eyes flickered toward the stand of Roman brothers and their mates. They were ready to fight. Alongside the shifters, against their own ruling class. She just hated that they had to. The last thing she wanted was bloodshed.</p><p>Feeyan\u2019s gaze was now focused on the jaguar veana, the mutore Dillon, who was hell-bent on protecting the shifters. \u201cIf you fight for the wrong side, Order Member Nine, you cannot continue on the Order.\u201d</p><p>The female shrugged. \u201cBummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch insolence,\u201d Feeyan hissed.</p><p>\u201cAnd not so fast,\u201d Dillon continued, flakes of white coating her long eyelashes. \u201cEven though I\u2019d jump at the chance to escape your old-fashioned rule, you can\u2019t kick me off the Order without the approval of the others.\u201d</p><p>Feeyan looked smug, then slashed at the air with her hands. Instantly the snow was gone and sand was beneath everyone\u2019s feet. \u201cI need nothing. You don\u2019t seem to understand this, mutore.\u201d She started toward Dillon. \u201cOne who takes the position of leader of the Order, doesn\u2019t need anything or anyone to give permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about when someone is given the position because the real leader got canned?\u201d Dillon\u2019s eyes filled with amusement. \u201cThe leader everyone respects, maybe even wants back. The leader who truly acted without fear.\u201d</p><p>Once again, the Order members started to talk. For as much as their leader tried to display her power and bravado, they saw her weaknesses too.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve spoken enough for tonight,\u201d Feeyan said with brutal hatred.</p><p>She brought her hand up to Dillon\u2019s face and closed it quickly in a tight fist. Dillon\u2019s eyes went wide and she gripped her throat. She looked over at Gray, who was on his feet and snarling, and shook her head. She couldn\u2019t speak. Up came the Romans, and the shifters. Petra felt panic enter her gut. This was it. The first blow of battle. Once the Romans and the shifters rushed in, there was no going back.</p><p>A sudden shock of sound and light stole everyone\u2019s attention, including Feeyan\u2019s. Gray rushed in and grabbed Dillon, who touched her throat and gasped as her mute state ceased. But everyone else stood frozen.</p><p>Staring at what had just landed.</p><p>A battered and bruised Synjon Wise stalked forward with a groggy male in his grasp.</p><p>Petra could only gape, her breath caught in her lungs and her gut tight with tension. She didn\u2019t know what to think, what to do. The male she loved and the male who\u2019d given her life were headed straight into the center of the gathering stones.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your lost paven,\u201d Synjon said, his eyes hard and narrowed on Feeyan. \u201cBattered and bruised and showing off his pure blood.\u201d</p><p>Gasps and murmurs echoed in the cavernous space as Syn tossed the unconscious paven at the Order leader\u2019s feet.</p><p>Petra didn\u2019t know what made her do it. What made her cry out and rush\u2014not at Syn\u2014but at her father. Curled on the ground, he looked so old, so pathetic. This was her flesh and blood. The male who had given her life, given her to the best family in the world.</p><p>Her hands ran over his back, his neck. Someone who did all of that couldn\u2019t be completely evil. There had to be good somewhere in him, decency in him. She wanted so badly to know it. Not just for herself, but for her balas.</p><p>A hand crushed hers, and another gripped her shoulders. She managed only a squeak of shock and protest before Cruen jacked to his feet, yanked her up and slammed her back against his chest. Before anyone could move, he curled one hand around her neck.</p><p>24</p><p>Syn felt every bloody emotion on the planet run through him as he stared at Petra\u2019s face. Fury, fear, love, regret. They were all there and all shockingly intense. His hands twitched at his sides. His fangs dropped low and sharp. And a growl he\u2019d never heard before ripped from his throat.</p><p>Life was repeating itself. Only this time, he wasn\u2019t going to allow Cruen to take his heart and soul from him.</p><p>Around the gathering stones, everyone held their breath. Not only was Cruen slowly pressing Petra\u2019s windpipe, but his fangs were out and pointed at a spot on her temple that could shut her brain down in an instant.</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Syn said in a low, dangerous voice.</p><p>Saliva dripped from Cruen\u2019s fangs onto Petra\u2019s cheek. \u201cAnother female for you to mourn, Wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for you,\u201d Syn replied, trying not to look at Petra. Her fear, her sadness would weaken him. \u201cAs this one happens to be your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that is unfortunate. But power comes before all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially when you\u2019ve lost yours completely.\u201d</p><p>Cruen\u2019s gaze flickered in Feeyan\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Synjon said. \u201cThey know. They know you\u2019ve been hiding out here, eating the flesh of some ancient water beast to try and retrieve your power. Can you flash yet? Or are you still using your Pureblood guard?\u201d</p><p>Behind Feeyan, three Order members gasped.</p><p>Cruen growled and pressed his fang against Petra\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cDo it and I will rip your flesh from your bones in under a second,\u201d Syn promised blackly, inching forward.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll fucking eat it when he does,\u201d Dani said, jumping down from the high rock to stand beside him.</p><p>Petra cried out, flinching.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d From behind the Romans, an older female stood up. She was tall and lovely, and her eyes, so similar to Petra\u2019s, locked with Cruen\u2019s and she shook her head at him. \u201cThat is our daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCellie?\u201d Cruen\u2019s grip on Petra eased and his eyes softened as he stared at the female. \u201cCellie, you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go, Cruen.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t take her from me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCellie, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took her. From my birthing bed.\u201d Her voice broke with emotion. \u201cNot to protect her, but to forge an alliance with the shifters so you could use them.\u201d</p><p>Though his eyes remained soft upon her, he didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI could\u2019ve killed her and I didn\u2019t. I did that for you.\u201d</p><p>Petra whimpered, and Synjon\u2019s entire body erupted in flame. He acted without thought, but with a lifetime of military combat training to guide him. Flashing from his spot beside Dani, he landed directly behind Cruen and wrapped his own hand around the male\u2019s neck.</p><p>Cruen gasped, but he didn\u2019t let go of Petra.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Synjon whispered in his ear.</p><p>\u201cYou. Dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not what you want. Say it.\u201d</p><p>Cruen hissed. \u201cTake them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He could scent Petra, her fear, her sadness, and it made him insane. He pulled air into his lungs. \u201cIf I do, you will release her immediately following, or you\u2019re dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou must love my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Petra,\u201d Syn clarified. No male who treated his young like this could be called a father.</p><p>Still gripping the paven\u2019s throat, Syn lowered his head, so his temple was flush with Cruen\u2019s face and fangs.</p> <p>\u201cGo back on your word, and every Roman, mutore, and shifter in this place will take you down before you have a chance to pull your next breath.\u201d</p><p>The last word wasn\u2019t even out of Syn\u2019s mouth before Cruen\u2019s fangs thrust deep into his temple. As before, on the floor of Erion\u2019s dungeon, the blood drain was executed painfully, quickly, but this time Syn let go and gave in. As he opened his mind wide, to a world of past hurt and sadness and regret, emotions flooded his senses like a massive and unceasing ocean wave.</p><p>And then there was nothing. And everything. And Cruen was pulling out of his head, and he was back, standing in the gathering stones, scenting Petra, gripping Cruen, with his entire arsenal of baggage. All the hate and all the love.</p><p>And bloody hell, all the newfound strength.</p><p>Syn\u2019s fingers dug into the paven\u2019s throat. \u201cRelease. Her. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Cruen stood there for a moment, unmoving, no doubt thinking and plotting and planning. Could he use Petra another way? Could her death be of benefit? Or her life? And then suddenly, he opened his hand and freed her from his grasp.</p><p>\u201cGo, Petra,\u201d Syn commanded gently. \u201cGo to your family.\u201d</p><p>As Petra took off, holding her neck, stumbling forward, dizzy, into the arms of her mother, Cruen shouted at all of them, \u201cYou\u2019ll never contain me, and you know it. None of you are able to. Even with my power waning, I will always be the one to rule this Breed.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes frosty, yet the most controlled Syn had ever seen them, Feeyan moved forward. She began with an incantation, then slowly circled her arms around Cruen, wrapping him in some kind of invisible magical vise. She sighed, clucked her tongue. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed our back and forth, Cruen. Our sharing of knowledge and power. Even our battles. But you have shamed not only yourself but the entire Eternal Breed. Your daughter\u201d\u2014her lip curled\u2014\u201cforcing her to live with these creatures. Not knowing her true worth. A Pureblood veana.\u201d She leaned in, snarled as he struggled against her magical bonds. \u201cConsuming the flesh of . . .\u201d Her nostrils flared. \u201cYou have just insulted every Pureblood on the planet. In truth, I have stumbled somewhat in my governing of our kind as of late. Perhaps I was under the impression that I could not measure up to your way. It made me reckless and far too interested in proving myself to others. But I see now that your way wasn\u2019t in service of the Eternal Breed. It was in service of you.\u201d She glanced up at Syn, who was still holding Cruen by the throat. \u201cI will take him now. Deal with him in my own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Syn said, shaking his head. \u201cI escort him to Mondrar, walk him into the cell, make sure he\u2019s contained by the most powerful magic possible.\u201d</p><p>Feeyan titled her chin. \u201cYou do not have a choice in how the Order punishes\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter all that\u2019s just happened, I bloody well do.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Syn flashed himself and Cruen from the gathering stones, the Rain Forest, and the strange sadness in his beloved veana\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Seconds after Synjon flashed from the Rain Forest, the Order followed suit. Well, all but Dillon. She was still holding her throat, standing close to Gray, who looked like he wanted to put his fist through a fucking wall. In seconds, the sand disappeared, and all was back to normal within the gathering stones.</p><p>From his perch on the highest rock, Phane watched the shifter leaders attempt to find calm, understanding. But it was crystal clear to all, now that the Order knew about the Rain Forest and its inhabitants, that things would be very different from now on. They were no longer hidden, no longer safe.</p><p>His gaze cut to Dani. The hawk shifter female was comforting Petra, her arms wrapped around the veana as she shook with great sobs of grief. Below Phane, her mother by blood looked on, watched her daughter, then turned to look at Wen, who was embracing Dillon.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d Wen said to the jaguar female, who looked both shaken up and pissed off by what Feeyan had subjected her to.</p><p>The leader of the Mountain Faction approached Dillon as well. \u201cWe won\u2019t forget what you did for us. How you spoke up for us. Please know that you are all welcome here at any time. For those who have shifter blood, it would be our honor to introduce you to your kind.\u201d His eyes warmed. \u201cWe have jaguar in my faction. If you ever want to know them . . .\u201d</p> <p>The veana visibly winced as the male\u2019s voice trailed off. Like his half sister, Phane felt the strangeness of being in a place with others similar to himself. But truly, there was something here that called to him. To Helo as well. He shook his head. Foolish Lycos. The male was missing it all because he refused to get involved, refused to see this as an opportunity to know his history, know more about himself.</p><p>\u201cMy love?\u201d Alex called out, his voice suddenly fearful.</p><p>A sound, low and filled with pain, brought everyone\u2019s attention around to the large boulder where Sara had been sitting, waiting to see what would happen, waiting to be flashed home by Alexander if a fight truly broke out between the shifters and the Order.</p><p>Kate and Bronwyn were at her side. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the former asked, her tone deeply concerned.</p><p>\u201cSara?\u201d Dillon rushed over to her as well, her own concerns completely forgotten.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s female looked up, her eyes bright, her smile nervous. \u201cMy water broke.\u201d She turned to Alexander, who was trying to get past the small crows and the worried veanas. \u201cOur balas, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It was a miracle of sorts. The mood inside the gathering stones changed in an instant. From dark and dismal to hopeful and excited.</p><p>When Alex finally reached his mate\u2019s side, he scooped her up in his arms and barked at anyone who would listen, \u201cLeza needs to be contacted immediately.\u201d</p><p>Sara laughed and leaned in to kiss her mate\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s not coming this very second, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must also inform Evans,\u201d Alex continued, undaunted. \u201cHe must get the house ready. Get our room ready. Clean sheets, towels . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, someone\u2019s about to become a father,\u201d Nicholas said with a wide grin.</p><p>Getting in on the ribbing, Lucian snorted as he jumped down from his rock. \u201cAnd look at his face. He looks scared to death. You know Sara is the one who has to do all the work, right?\u201d</p><p>Alex growled. \u201cShut it, Luca.\u201d Then he turned to his mate and kissed her gently. \u201cHold on, my love. I\u2019m taking us home. All three of us.\u201d</p><p>25</p><p>Petra sat beside Sara on the bed and melted at the sight of the one-week-old little bundle wrapped in a soft yellow blanket, sleeping peacefully in his mother\u2019s arms. His lips kept pressing out into a cute little pout, as if he were dreaming about his first blood. \u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so too, but I may be partial.\u201d Sara looked up and smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you. I haven\u2019t heard from you in a few days, and after everything that went down at the gathering stones . . .\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes. The gathering stones, Petra mused. And the apartment, and the River House, the tree house, and the caves. She\u2019d been through much in the past few months. Revelations and disappointments. Hopes and fleeting happiness. But now it was time to take things slow and easy. Stop moving and build a life in one place for herself and her balas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Petra insisted, reaching out to touch the baby\u2019s soft head. She couldn\u2019t wait to experience this. Holding her sweet child in her arms. Such perfection. Such intimacy.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Sara said, her eyes warm. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me if I have to come by and see that for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better come by. Have Alex flash you and baby over. It\u2019s so beautiful in the Rain Forest now. So green and wet. We\u2019d love to have you stay.\u201d</p><p>Sara raised one dark eyebrow. \u201cWe? So, does that mean you and balas? Or is Brodan in the picture?\u201d</p><p>A sigh escaped Petra\u2019s lungs without her consent. \u201cLet\u2019s just say Brodan is going to be a kick-ass uncle.\u201d</p><p>Over the past week, the bear shifter had been around to see her at her parents\u2019 house several times. He\u2019d been his usual incredible self. Kind, caring, generous. And the list could go on and on. But the one thing he wasn\u2019t was the one thing Petra wanted more than anything.</p><p>Synjon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make a family for myself,\u201d she told Sara, but truly the words were also for herself. She had to keep telling herself that, reminding herself that she would get through this, and that everything would be fine.</p><p>\u201cYou told Brodan how you feel?\u201d Sara asked gently.</p><p>Petra nodded. \u201cI would never even try to care for a male when I am not yet remotely over the one who broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>Sara exhaled heavily and nodded. \u201cHave you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>Petra shook her head. After what had happened at the gathering stones, what he\u2019d done, sacrificed\u2014what she\u2019d experienced at the hands of her father\u2014she\u2019d thought she might. Hell, she\u2019d hoped he would try to contact her, come to the Rain Forest to see her. After all, they\u2019d both made mistakes and bad judgments and choices that were unfortunate and filled with regrets. But clearly he was done. Maybe those emotions that Cruen had forced back into his mind had tamped down any feelings he\u2019d had for her and the balas. After all, the loss of Juliet had been among them.</p><p>\u201cYou know he had the chance to kill Cruen and he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lost in thought for a moment, Petra startled. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking into doing undercover spy stuff again. Maybe a private firm. Maybe his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd I hear there are no more parties going on.\u201d</p><p>Petra couldn\u2019t help but laugh at that. \u201cMr. Respectability now, huh?\u201d</p><p>Sara shrugged. \u201cWell, let\u2019s not go overboard.\u201d She grinned. \u201cHe\u2019ll always be a bit of a scoundrel, not unlike my Alexander or the rest of the Romans, but what fun would it be if they weren\u2019t?\u201d She leaned down and kissed her balas. The little boy stretched his arms over his head and yawned, causing both females to laugh softly.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe I got the most perfect present for Christmas,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>\u201cHe is that,\u201d Petra agreed.</p><p>\u201cMy little Santa baby. And you\u2019re what . . . ? Valentine\u2019s Day Cupid?\u201d</p><p>Petra laughed. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>Sara\u2019s smile widened. \u201cSo close in age\u2014our kids will grow up together.\u201d Then she blushed and amended her words. \u201cOr could. If you wanted that . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d Petra said quickly. \u201cI want that.\u201d</p><p>Sara\u2019s smile broadened, and she reached for Petra\u2019s hand and squeezed it lightly.</p><p>Just then, Alex stuck his head in the door and called, \u201cHey, Petra. Dani\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. My ride.\u201d</p><p>She stood up just as Alex walked in and over to Sara. He touched his balas on the cheek, then leaned in to kiss his mate on the mouth. \u201cHow\u2019s the most beautiful mother in the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy,\u201d she whispered before he kissed her again.</p> <p>Petra just stood there and watched, like an idiot, like a voyeur. Like a veana who had no deeper wish than to have what her sister and Alex had. But that couldn\u2019t be her goal now. Maybe someday. Someday when she was settled.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, all,\u201d Petra said as she headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cCome again soon, okay?\u201d Sara called after her. \u201cSamuel wants to hang out with his auntie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>As she headed down the stairs and into the foyer, Petra heard the lively sounds of laughter and banter. It was nice. Warm. Homey. The family all together. She\u2019d hung out with them a bit earlier, talked, discussed the holidays. But now it was time to get back to her family. One of whom was waiting in the back garden.</p><p>Pacing the grounds in her hawk form, wings spread and ready, Dani cocked her head when she spotted Petra. \u201cReady to go home, bestie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, bestie.\u201d She climbed onto the hawk\u2019s back and wrapped her arms around Dani\u2019s neck. After a quick, affectionate squeeze, the shifter took off and sailed into the night sky.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>The cell he occupied was dark, dank, and cut off from everything and everyone.</p><p>Synjon Wise had insisted on it, the Romans and several of the Order members had also, and Feeyan had relented.</p><p>Cruen sneered.</p><p>That veana\u2019s weakness was growing more and more apparent.</p><p>Standing before the bars of his cage, Cruen waited for his next blood meal to be delivered. It was nearly time. His fangs were descending even now in anticipation. Granted, the guards never came into his cage to give it to him. Strict instructions from the Order. But someday he would manage to get one of them alone. It was all he would need.</p><p>That and his unflinching desire to take back what should never have been given away. Given to her.</p><p>Feeyan spoke of shame on the Eternal Breed. She was the true shame. A poor man\u2019s Cruen. A dull, fearful substitute who acted only when she needed to convince others she was powerful. No. A true leader of the Order acted selfishly. Without second-guessing. Without fear or pity.</p><p>Cruen sniffed the air. Yes, his blood was on the way. Perhaps this was the guard, this was the night. Or perhaps he would have to wait until tomorrow.</p><p>It was no matter. Someday soon he would be flashing free once again. Someday soon\u2014not only would he be back on the Order, but he would be ruling it.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Without Petra and the balas in his life, Syn knew misery times ten. No amount of work or money made up for the loss of them, and he couldn\u2019t wait another minute to beg for their return. But he knew he couldn\u2019t go straight to her, knew she would no doubt reject him outright.</p><p>So he had to go to the one being on earth she trusted above all others. Unfortunately, that being believed him to be the biggest knobhead prat in the world.</p><p>The shifters inside the cantina followed him as he walked toward the hawk female. She was sitting at a table by herself, having something that looked like a beer, frothy head and all. Her nose came up the second he was within scent range.</p><p>She shook her head, grinned wickedly. \u201cYou have some serious balls.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a chair and sat down across from her. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIron balls,\u201d she amended.</p><p>\u201cBloody right,\u201d he agreed, feeling many sets of eyes at his back. \u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>She gave him the death stare. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve her, bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>His agreeing with her seemed to irritate her more. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. I have a date with my drink here.\u201d Her head went down and she pretended to ignore him.</p><p>No problem, love. I\u2019ve got all night. Shite, I\u2019ve got forever, if that\u2019s what it takes.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever loved someone, Dani?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. Instead, she took a gigantic swallow of her beer, or whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever loved someone so much that the thought of them being gone from your life forever fills you with so much pain you can\u2019t even breathe?\u201d</p><p>Again, she didn\u2019t look at him, but her head tilted to one side like she was trying really hard not to go there with him. \u201cI know what happened to that female of yours who was killed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t mean Juliet.\u201d</p><p>This time the hawk shifter\u2019s head did come up, and her eyes connected with his. Around them, the sounds of laughter and chatter and glasses being filled seemed to mute.</p><p>\u201cI loved her,\u201d Syn said, his gut going tight. \u201cJuliet. I loved her very much. And I thought avenging her death would help me get rid of some of the guilt I felt. But I\u2019m talking about Petra now. And the balas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shit,\u201d Dani muttered softly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give up, give in to sadness and death over Juliet,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I want to live for Petra and my balas. I want to be a better paven. I care for nothing else but them.\u201d</p><p>Dani\u2019s sharp eyes bored into his skull, assessing him, reading him. \u201cWhy should I believe anything you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He pushed his chair back and stood up, held out his hand. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, glared at his waiting hand. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place.\u201d</p><p>Her lip curled. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ve been there before, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean, do I remember what a gigantic bastard I was to you? An unfeeling, uncaring bastard who wished he could block out everything and focus on the unending torture of the male who he believed had ended his life?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted. \u201cYeah, that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI apologize, Dani. I wasn\u2019t myself.\u201d</p><p>She may have grinned back. It was hard to tell with the hawk female. What she did do was stand up.</p><p>\u201cYou going to flash me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He gestured for her to come with him. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt a bit, shifter.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and followed him to the door. \u201cThis had better be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d Syn said. \u201cJust real and honest and true. For the first time in my life.\u201d</p><p>26</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for my transition so I can flash,\u201d Petra said as she leaned over Dani\u2019s back as best she could.</p><p>\u201cMy ride taking too long for you, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stomach\u2019s growing bigger every day, bestie, and this position is uncomfortable as hell.\u201d Petra laughed over the sound of the wind. The moonless night blanketed them in cool darkness, and though Dani\u2019s feathers kept her warm, they did not cushion her backside all that well. \u201cBut you know, you just sounded like Lucian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat whole family of males is weird,\u201d Dani called back.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re arrogant. Especially that hawk-vampire-combo male.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, Petra mused, the crisp shot of air rushing over her face. She\u2019d seen Dani checking out the mutore on more than a few occasions. \u201cPhane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that. What kind of name is Phane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Petra asked, spotting a broad set of lights in the distance.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s totally after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause you\u2019re a hot piece of tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeathered tail.\u201d</p><p>Petra laughed into the breeze as the lights grew closer. Dani had said there was a surprise for her and the baby at the end of this trip, and Petra couldn\u2019t help but feel excited. She hadn\u2019t had much fun or frivolity since she\u2019d found Synjon near the caves all those months ago.</p><p>But as they drew closer, and the light patterns became familiar, Petra realized just what city they were headed to. Her mouth went bone-dry and she gripped the hawk\u2019s feathers. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Dani?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hold on, baby girl,\u201d she called, racing ahead, her hawk looking around for aircraft as they entered the city\u2019s airspace.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Petra yelled over the sudden onslaught of wind and sound as they dove between two buildings. \u201cWe\u2019d better be headed for SoHo. Dani, goddamn it. You, of all people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill out, Pets,\u201d the bird called back.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t SoHo. Not even close. And when they landed easy and gentle, not on the sprawling balcony she\u2019d expected but on the building\u2019s roof, Petra was ready to kill her best friend.</p><p>She jumped off the hawk\u2019s back immediately and stuck her finger in the bird\u2019s face. \u201cUnbelievable. Have you lost your goddamn mind or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, listen,\u201d Dani began. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou hate him. You despise him. In fact, when I came back and told you about the room of torture, you wanted to fly to his place, pick him up in your talons, and drop him in the East River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo easy,\u201d she remarked, glancing toward the brightly lit building next door. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s a good swimmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDani!\u201d</p> <p>The hawk jerked her head back. \u201cOkay, fine. He was an asshole. When his emotions were stripped, he was without a conscience. He was a dog. No. I like dogs. He was a slug who deserved to be crushed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my gods, Dani!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now,\u201d she said quickly, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s chest tightened, and she pulled her coat closer around herself. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t be pissed.\u201d</p> <p>Something close to anxiety started in Petra\u2019s toes and began to move upward. \u201cOh, crap. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to me,\u201d Dani said, her hawk\u2019s eyes softening. \u201cWe talked.\u201d</p><p>Petra turned away in a huff. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>Petra jerked back. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because of anything that was done to him, getting his emotions back and all that, but because he wants to be different.\u201d She was quiet for a moment, then cocked her head. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p> <p>Sudden and irritatingly uncontrollable tears pricked Petra\u2019s eyes. She shook her head, the winter wind thrashing her hair about her face. \u201cHe conned you. With his dreamy eyes and his piano playing and his accent, and that body, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, babe. I\u2019ve never seen any of that. I\u2019m a shifter girl all the way.\u201d Her hawk winked. \u201cMy male\u2019s gotta have hair or feathers or scales. You get the picture.\u201d</p><p>Petra sighed deeply. Yes. She got the picture. About it all. Synjon had gone to Dani and told her that he wanted Petra and the balas. He\u2019d convinced the most impossible to convince creature on earth that he was all in.</p><p>Maybe . . .</p><p>Oh, goddamn it. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m just so fucking scared to believe . . .\u201d</p><p>The hawk lowered her head, nuzzled Petra\u2019s face with her beak. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now? What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back on.\u201d</p> <p>It was probably the most foolish move in the world, to believe, to hope. But it had come from Dani. The female who never believed in love. Inside Petra\u2019s womb, Little Fangs kicked and squirmed, and maybe nudged her forward and onto her friend\u2019s back.</p><p>In seconds they took off and then, a moment later, landed on the balcony below.</p><p>His balcony.</p><p>\u201cGo in, Pets,\u201d Dani urged. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>With shaking limbs, and fear gripping her heart, Petra climbed off Dani\u2019s back. Behind her, she heard the glass doors open. She took a deep breath and turned around.</p><p>If it was possible, Synjon Wise had grown even more handsome in the week and a half since she\u2019d seen him, and her fearful heart warmed without her consent. He was dressed all in black, his eyes impossibly dark, his mouth full and highly kissable, and his hair had that tousled look, like he\u2019d just gotten out of bed. He was truly the male of her dreams.</p><p>He looked up at Dani then, and nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, bloodsucker,\u201d she tossed back with a squawk. \u201cNow don\u2019t fuck it up again.\u201d</p><p>It was just like Dani not to wait for an answer. She spread her wings and leaped off the balcony. Leaving the two of them alone. Leaving Petra to a fate she prayed didn\u2019t once again lead to tears.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>As he led Petra into the house, Syn felt like a nervous young paven. He loved this veana so bloody much, wanted her so bloody much, he thought he\u2019d lose his mind over it. He needed her to see that, understand his heart and his hope through his actions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t have much of a choice. Dani tricked me.\u201d She stopped for a moment and glanced over at the tree. It was fully decorated now, sporting small white lights, and beneath it were all the things he wanted her to have, all the things he\u2019d found for the baby over the past week.</p><p>Her eyes cut to his piano, which stood to the left of the tree, then down to the child\u2019s piano he had not only tuned himself but polished as he did his own.</p><p>He heard her quick intake of breath, saw her shake her head, and reached for her hand. For a moment, he was sure she was going to pull away. But she didn\u2019t. Granted, she wasn\u2019t cuddling up to his side or anything, but she wasn\u2019t flinching at his touch either.</p><p>The realization made him breathe easier, made him hope.</p><p>\u201cI want to show you something,\u201d he said, leading her through the living room, past the kitchen and down the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed things,\u201d she said quietly, her gaze darting from left to right. \u201cNew artwork, different colors, furniture. Why?\u201d</p><p>His chest tightened.</p><p>\u201cYou know why, love,\u201d he said leading her into his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to go in here, Syn,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cDon\u2019t know if I want to revisit the . . .\u201d Her voice petered out as she entered the room. Her lips parted and she stared. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her, watch her as she took in the complete remodel of his bedroom\u2014what he wanted to be their bedroom. New furniture, softer fabric, colors he knew she loved. \u201cThe pillows you bought with Sara. I used them as inspiration.\u201d He eyed her. \u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>Her head fell forward. \u201cOh, Syn, does it matter if I like it? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you can possibly know, love.\u201d He squeezed her hand, then tugged it a little. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I really want you to see. Come.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Petra felt as though the unbeating heart inside her chest was expanding, preparing to burst, as Syn led her into the en suite bathroom, and toward the room beyond. It was truly the last place on earth she wanted to go. She hated what she\u2019d found here. How it had ruined everything. Ended what she\u2019d thought was a true hope for love, a family. Why would\u2014</p><p>Her thoughts ended abruptly.</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>Emotion caught in her throat. Fear and wonder and amazement. Tears blurred her vision, and she blinked to force them away, down her cheeks. She wanted to see clearly, take in what was before her with cool, detached eyes. But that was just an impossible hope.</p><p>It was too incredible.</p><p>Gone were the closet, the clothes, the leather and the wool. Gone was the room full of metal and hate and anger and vengeance. And in its place was a completely remodeled space. Pale yellow walls, fanciful artwork, bookcases and dressers, rugs and lamps, a rocker and a crib.</p><p>The most beautiful crib she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Petra bit her lip to keep from crying, from blubbering like a fool . . . or maybe just an emotional pregnant chick. But nothing was going to stop the tears from raining down her cheeks.</p><p>A baby\u2019s room.</p><p>Syn had turned a room meant for such darkness into a room of light and softness and innocence.</p><p>He released her hand. She\u2019d forgotten she was holding his, gripping it so tightly that she\u2019d probably bruised him. She watched him walk over to the rocker and sit down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Petra. For everything. For lying to you, lying to myself. For hurting you.\u201d His eyes locked with hers and implored her to listen. Really listen. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to live here. I know I don\u2019t deserve that. But I want you to understand that in my mind and in my heart, you and the balas have a home here.\u201d</p><p>Petra leaned against the doorframe and stared at him in that rocker. That sweet, happy rocker. And envisioned him holding Little Fangs in his arms. She couldn\u2019t believe it. Any of it. That he\u2019d gone to these lengths. Was it truly possible that one so hell-bent on revenge could find a new and infinitely more beautiful way to live out his life?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know. Gods, she didn\u2019t know. But she wanted to find out. So badly that she ached with it.</p><p>\u201cI may not be the male you believed could be your family, be the balas\u2019s father,\u201d he said, his dark eyes pinning her where she stood. \u201cBut in my mind, my heart, I am.\u201d</p><p>In her mind and heart, he was too. He\u2019d proved that on the night he\u2019d saved her, sacrificed himself and his need to claim vengeance, for her and the balas, at the gathering stones. And he\u2019d proved it with this incredible room.</p><p>\u201cYou fought for me, remember, love?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not even trying to hold back her tears anymore. And truly, what was the point? This was the male she loved, the father of her child. Her one wish had come true. Tears were more than appropriate. They were called for.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was ready to give up,\u201d he said, his eyes full of warmth and hope, \u201cyou fought for me. Now I\u2019m fighting for us, for you, for Little Fangs there. We\u2019re a family. I want us to be together always. I love you, Petra.\u201d</p><p>The words killed her. Not the part of her that had still believed in a future with this male, but the part that had wanted to give up, run away because she didn\u2019t want to be hurt again.</p><p>\u201cSyn . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rushing you, not asking you to decide anything or change anything. I just wanted you to see where I\u2019m at. What I\u2019m offering. Long term. Forever. And to know if you could possibly forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Inside her womb, the balas moved, pressing against her skin. Maybe it just wanted to stretch its little limbs. Or maybe, like her, it wanted to be closer to that voice. And to the paven it loved.</p><p>\u201cCruen\u2014,\u201d she began, hating herself for bringing that male\u2019s name into this room.</p><p>But Syn was quick to answer, and his tone was completely unfettered. \u201cLove, I\u2019m no longer concerned with chasing your father. I want to be a father.\u201d</p><p>That was it. She needed nothing more. Gods, nothing more than him.</p><p>Petra pushed away from the door, fairly leaped across the room and jumped into his lap. Instantly Syn\u2019s protective arms went around her and he groaned into her hair. Heat infused her. Love too. And then he started to rock. Back and forth. Back and forth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe my mate, love?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She tipped her chin up and stared into those dark, deeply emotional eyes and grinned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWed me under the tree house in the Rain Forest?\u201d He leaned in and kissed her mouth.</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He placed one hand on her belly, waited a moment, then said confidently, \u201cThe balas is happy.\u201d</p><p>Oh, gods. \u201cSo\u2019s his mother.\u201d</p><p>Synjon\u2019s eyes got big, and he said almost breathlessly, \u201cHis?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, her grin widening. \u201cJust a guess.\u201d</p> <p>This time, when Synjon dropped his head and kissed her, Petra could feel the emotions within him. They were warm and intense, and they infused her skin like bathwater. There were fear and happiness, concern and craving, but the emotion that spread the furthest, went the deepest, and heated his blood as he growled and groaned against her mouth, was love.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Phane had done his best to make the place livable. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have bothered. After all, he had the house in New York, a perch to kill for, and the whole extended-family thing. But there was just something about the Rain Forest, about the heat and the shifters\u2014and damn, he wanted to pursue Dani.</p><p>Sweat pouring off his body, he continued to scrub the exterior of the cabin. After what had gone down at the gathering stones, he wasn\u2019t sure what to expect with Dani and the others. They\u2019d offered to show him how the other half lived, so to speak, but was that real? Would they want him and Helo hanging around, reminding them of just how kind and giving the vampires were not?</p><p>He was just turning around to grab a bucket of clean water, when he spotted someone\u2014some thing\u2014stalking toward him in the brush.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d He knew that blond-gray coat and don\u2019t-fuck-with-me glare. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>The wolf shifted the moment he reached the porch of the cabin. Lycos glanced around, first at the cabin, then back at Phane. He looked uncomfortable as shit. \u201cCome to get you. The Romans said you were taking your sweet time getting back.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and they know why too, Phane thought. He wondered if Alex, Nicky, and Lucian had mentioned it. \u201cSorry you made the trip, brother. But I\u2019m staying.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cIf they let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere in sweat city?\u201d Ly sneered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always take sweat over snow.\u201d He wiped the beads on his face with his forearm. \u201cBesides, I want to get to know my other half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Avians.\u201d</p><p>Phane nodded, tried out some new material. \u201cThey have wolves here, you know? In the Mountain Faction.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, Ly looked past him into the house. \u201cWhere\u2019s Helo? I bet he hasn\u2019t lost his fucking mind today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen him since this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs he talking this talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean does he plan on staying, then yes.\u201d</p><p>Phane tilted his head, looked at the wolf shifter from a different angle. Something told him that Lycos was more than just irritated at the prospect of his remaining two brothers living full-time or part-time away from what he now called home. But Phane was out of sympathy. He loved Ly, and the male was absolutely family, but he\u2019d dropped the ball on this one. He\u2019d walked away from them too, when they\u2019d all needed him\u2014and that didn\u2019t come without consequences.</p><p>Phane leaned on the porch rail. It threatened to give way. Another goddamn Mr. Fix-it project coming up. \u201cAre you going to tell me just where the hell you\u2019ve been? What was so important when we could\u2019ve used your help? Another set of fists?\u201d</p><p>The wolf shifter looked past him, but his face was a mask of impassivity. \u201cLike I told you, I just don\u2019t want any part of this.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn bastard. \u201cWe needed family and you took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what family is anymore. You think it\u2019s here? You think you fit in with these assholes? It\u2019s just like New York or anywhere else, brother. You, me, Helo, we\u2019re all mutts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014fuck you!\u201d</p><p>Phane heard something crash inside the cabin. Then a female voice shriek, \u201cHey! Bloodsucking hawk shifter male, where the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>What the hell? He turned back to see Dani at his screen door. \u201cDid you just come from inside the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI flew in from the other direction. Your window was open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t sound like it,\u201d he said, eyeing her. She looked hot as hell. Nothing new. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother. The water beast.\u201d</p><p>His chest went tight at her expression. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s going on with Helo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose fucking rogue water shifters. They\u2019re losing their minds. I swear to gods, the faction leaders need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He yanked open the screen door. \u201cDani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She stepped out. \u201cHe\u2019s been taken by the water shifters. That group that helped the geriatric vampire asswipe, gave him the eel flesh. We need to go. Now. The Water Faction leader is calling a . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she noticed who stood near the far edge of the cabin.</p><p>Phane nodded at his mutore brother. \u201cThis is my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLycos?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Phane turned to face his brother. \u201cYou know each other?\u201d</p><p>Lycos just shrugged, didn\u2019t even glance at Dani.</p><p>Phane looked over his shoulder at the hawk shifter. \u201cHow do you know my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother?\u201d Dani looked from male to male, then broke out in laughter. \u201cWell, well, well. This is interesting, and maybe even a little awkward.
