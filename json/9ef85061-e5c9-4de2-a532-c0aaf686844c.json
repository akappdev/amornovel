Her hair is spread out across the pillow, spilling down her shoulder and across her neck. She\u2019s staring at her fingers as they move in circles over my hand. I\u2019ve known her almost two years now, and I\u2019ve never seen her this content. She\u2019s no longer solely carrying the weight that\u2019s been her life for the last two years, and it shows. It\u2019s almost as if the moment we said \u201cI do\u201d yesterday, the hardships and heartaches we faced as individuals were meshed, making our pasts lighter and easier to carry. From this point on I\u2019ll be able to do that for her. Should there be any more burdens I\u2019ll be able to carry them for her. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to do for this girl since the moment I first laid eyes on her.</p><p>She glances up at me and smiles, then laughs and buries her face in the pillow.</p><p>I lean over her and kiss her on the neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>She lifts her face off the pillow\u2014her cheeks a deeper shade of red. She shakes her head and laughs. \u201cUs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s only been twenty-four hours and I\u2019ve already lost count.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her scarlet cheek and laugh. \u201cI\u2019m done with counting, Lake. I\u2019ve had about all the countdowns I can handle for a lifetime.\u201d I wrap my arm around her waist and pull her on top of me. When she leans in to kiss me, her hair falls between us. I reach to the nightstand and grab her rubber band, then twist her hair into a knot behind her head and secure it. \u201cThere,\u201d I say, pulling her face back to mine. \u201cBetter.\u201d</p> <p>She was adamant about having the robes, but we haven\u2019t once used them. Her ugly shirt has been on the floor since I threw it there last night. Needless to say, this has been the best twenty-four hours of my life.</p><p>She kisses down my jaw and traces a trail with her lips up to my ear. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cNot for food.\u201d</p><p>She pulls back and grins. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got another twenty-four hours to go, you know. If you want to keep up with me you need to replenish your energy. Besides, we somehow missed lunch today.\u201d She rolls off me, reaches into the nightstand, and pulls out the room service menu.</p><p>\u201cNo burgers,\u201d I say.</p><p>She rolls her eyes and laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get over that.\u201d She scrolls the menu and points at it with her finger, holding it up. \u201cWhat about beef Wellington? I\u2019ve always wanted to try that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I say, inching closer to her. She picks up the phone to dial room service. The whole time she\u2019s on the phone I kiss up and down her back, forcing her to stifle her laughs as she tries to maintain her composure while ordering. When she hangs up the phone, she slides underneath me and pulls the covers over us.</p><p>\u201cYou have twenty minutes,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThink you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only need ten.\u201d</p><p>THE BEEF WELLINGTON did not disappoint. The only issue now is that we\u2019re too stuffed and too tired to move. We\u2019ve turned the TV on for the first time since I walked her over the threshold, so I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re due for at least a two-hour break.</p><p>Our legs are intertwined and her head is on my chest. I\u2019m running my fingers through her hair with one hand and stroking her wrist with the other. Somehow trivial things like lying in bed watching TV have become euphoric when we\u2019re tangled together like this.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d She pulls herself up onto her elbow and looks at me. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d She runs her hand across my chest, then rests it on top of my heart.</p><p>\u201cI do about twelve laps a day on the University track, plus one hundred sit-ups twice a day,\u201d I say. She arches an eyebrow, so I point to my stomach. \u201cWeren\u2019t you asking about my abs?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and playfully punches me. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t asking about your abs.\u201d She leans down and kisses me on the stomach. \u201cThey are nice, though.\u201d</p> <p>I stroke her cheek and pull her gaze back to mine. \u201cAsk me anything, babe.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and drops her elbow and lays her head back onto the pillow, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cDo you ever feel guilty?\u201d she says quietly. \u201cFor feeling this happy?\u201d</p><p>I scoot closer to her and lay my arm across her stomach. \u201cLake. Don\u2019t ever feel guilty. This is exactly what they\u2019d want for you.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and forces a smile. \u201cI know it\u2019s what they\u2019d want for me. I just . . . I don\u2019t know. If I could take back everything that happened, I would do it in a heartbeat if it meant I could have them back. But doing that would mean I never would have met you. So sometimes I feel guilty because I . . .\u201d</p><p>I press my fingers to her lips. \u201cShh,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t think like that, Lake. Don\u2019t think about what ifs.\u201d I lean in and kiss her on the forehead. \u201cBut I do know what you mean if that helps. It\u2019s counterproductive thinking about it, though. It is what it is.\u201d</p><p>She takes her hand in mine and intertwines our fingers, then brings them to her mouth and kisses the back of my hand. \u201cMy dad would have loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom would have loved you,\u201d I say.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cOne more thing about the past, then I\u2019ll stop bringing it up.\u201d She looks at me with a slightly evil grin on her face. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that bitch Vaughn dumped you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and releases her fingers from mine. She turns toward me on the bed and looks at me. I pull her hand to my mouth and kiss the inside of her palm.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you would have married her?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and roll my eyes. \u201cSeriously, Lake? Do you really want to talk about this right now?\u201d</p><p>She smiles sheepishly at me. \u201cI\u2019m just curious. We\u2019ve never really talked about the past before. Now that I know you aren\u2019t going anywhere, I feel more comfortable talking about it. Besides, there are a lot of things I want to know about you,\u201d she says. \u201cLike how it felt when she broke up with you like she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an odd thing to want to hear about on your honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs her shoulders. \u201cI just want to know everything about you. I\u2019ve already got your future, now I want to get to know your past. Besides,\u201d she grins. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of hours to kill before your energy is fully replenished. What else are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m too exhausted to move right now and as much as I can pretend I\u2019m not keeping count, nine times in twenty-four hours must be some sort of record. I roll over onto my stomach and prop a pillow under my chin, and then begin to tell her my story.</p><p>the breakup</p><p>\u201cGOODNIGHT, CAULDER.\u201d I flip off the light and hope he doesn\u2019t crawl out of bed again. It\u2019s our third night with it being just the two of us here. He was too scared to sleep by himself last night so I let him sleep with me. I\u2019m hoping it doesn\u2019t become a habit, but I would completely understand if it did.</p><p>I still can\u2019t wrap my head around all that\u2019s happened in the last two weeks, much less the decisions I\u2019ve made. I hope I\u2019m doing the right thing. I know my parents want us to be together, I just don\u2019t think they approve of my dropping my scholarship to make it happen.</p><p>Why do I keep referring to them in the present tense?</p><p>This is really going to be an adjustment. I make my way into my bedroom and drop onto the bed. I\u2019m too exhausted to even reach over and turn off the lamp. As soon as I close my eyes, there\u2019s a light tap on my bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cCaulder, you\u2019ll be fine. Go back to sleep,\u201d I say, somehow dragging myself off the bed again to coax him back to his room. He has successfully slept alone for seven years; I know he\u2019s capable of doing it again.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d The door opens and Vaughn walks in. I had no idea she was coming over tonight, but I\u2019m thankful she\u2019s here. She seems to know exactly when I need her the most. I walk to her and close the bedroom door, then wrap my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you were heading back to campus today.\u201d</p><p>She places her hands on my forearms and pushes back, giving me the most pitiful smile I\u2019ve ever seen. She walks over to my bed and sits, avoiding eye contact the entire time. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face sends a chill up the back of my neck. I\u2019ve never seen her look so distraught before. I immediately sit on the bed beside her and bring her hand to my mouth and kiss it. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You okay?\u201d I brush a loose strand of hair behind her ear just as the tears begin to fall. I wrap my arms around her and pull her to my chest. \u201cVaughn, what\u2019s wrong? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything. She continues to cry so I give her a moment. Sometimes girls just need to cry. When the tears finally begin to subside, she straightens back up and takes my hands, but still doesn\u2019t look me in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cWill . . .\u201d She pauses. The way she says my name, the tone of her voice . . . it sends panic straight to my heart. She looks up at me but can\u2019t hold her stare, so she turns away.</p><p>\u201cVaughn?\u201d I say hesitantly, hoping I\u2019m misreading her. I place my hand on her chin and pull her gaze back in my direction. The fear in my voice is clear when I speak. \u201cWhat are you doing, Vaughn?\u201d</p><p>She almost looks relieved that I seem to have caught on to her intentions. She shakes her head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Will. I\u2019m so sorry. I just can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her words hit me like a ton of bricks. This? She can\u2019t do this anymore? When did we become a this? I don\u2019t respond. What the hell do I say to that?</p><p>She senses the shock in my demeanor, so she squeezes my hands and whispers it again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I pull away and stand up, turning away from her. I run my hands through my hair and take a deep breath. The anger building inside me is suddenly coupled by tears that I have no intention of letting her see.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect any of this, Will. I\u2019m too young to be a mom. I\u2019m not ready for this kind of responsibility.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s really doing this. She\u2019s really breaking up with me. Two weeks after my parents die and she\u2019s breaking my heart all over again? Who does that? She\u2019s not thinking straight. It\u2019s just shock . . . that\u2019s all. I turn around and face her, not caring that she can see how much this is affecting me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this either,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re just scared.\u201d I sit back down on the bed beside her and pull her to me. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to be his mom, Vaughn. I\u2019m not asking you to be anything right now.\u201d I squeeze her tighter and press my lips against her forehead; an action that immediately causes her to start crying again. \u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d I whisper into her hair. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me. Not right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turns her head away from me. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do this now, I\u2019ll never be able to do it.\u201d</p><p>She stands up and tries to walk away, but I pull her back to me and wrap my arms around her waist, pressing my head against her stomach.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She runs her hands over my hair and down my neck, then bends forward and kisses the top of my head. \u201cI feel awful, Will,\u201d she whispers. \u201cAwful. But I\u2019m not about to live a life that I\u2019m not ready for, just because I feel sorry for you.\u201d</p> <p>I press my forehead against her shirt and close my eyes, soaking in her words.</p><p>She feels sorry for me?</p><p>I release my arms from around her and push against her stomach. She drops her hands and takes a step back. I stand up and walk to the bedroom door, holding it open, indicating she needs to leave. \u201cThe last thing I want is your pity,\u201d I say, looking her in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cWill, don\u2019t,\u201d she pleads. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d She\u2019s looking up at me with tears in her eyes. When she cries, her eyes turn a glossy, deep shade of blue. I used to tell her they were the exact same color as the ocean. Looking into her eyes right now almost makes me despise the ocean.</p><p>I turn away from her and grip both sides of the door, pressing my head against the wood. I close my eyes and try to hold it in. It feels like the pressure, the stress, the emotions that have been building up for the last two weeks\u2014it feels like I\u2019m about to explode.</p> <p>She gently places her hand on my shoulder in an attempt to console me. I shrug it off and turn around to face her again. \u201cTwo weeks, Vaughn!\u201d I yell. I realize how loud I\u2019m being, so I lower my voice and step closer to her. \u201cThey\u2019ve been dead for two weeks! How could you possibly be thinking about yourself right now?\u201d</p><p>She walks past me through the doorway, toward the living room. I follow her as she grabs her purse from the couch and walks to the front door. She opens the door and turns to face me before she leaves. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me for this one day, Will. I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it right now, but someday you\u2019ll know I\u2019m doing what\u2019s best for us.\u201d</p><p>She turns to leave and I yell after her, \u201cWhat\u2019s best for you, Vaughn! You\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for you!\u201d</p><p>As soon as the door closes behind her I break down. I rush back to my bedroom and slam the door, then turn around and punch it over and over, harder and harder. When I can\u2019t feel my hand anymore, I squeeze my eyes shut and press my forehead against the door. I\u2019ve had so much to process these past two weeks\u2014I don\u2019t know how to process this, too.</p><p>What the hell has happened to my life?</p><p>I eventually make my way back to the bed and sit with my elbows on my knees, head in my hands. My mom and dad are smiling at me from the confines of the glass frame on my nightstand, watching me unfold. Watching as the culmination of all that has happened these last two weeks slowly tears me apart.</p> <p>Why weren\u2019t they better prepared for something like this? Why would they risk leaving me with all of this responsibility? Their ill-preparedness has cost me my scholarship, the love of my life, and now, quite possibly, my entire future. I snatch the picture up and place my thumbs over their photograph. With all my force, I squeeze until the glass cracks between my fingertips. Once it\u2019s successfully shattered\u2014just like my life\u2014I rare back and throw it as hard as I can against the wall in front of me. The frame breaks in two when it meets the wall and shards of glass sprinkle the carpet.</p><p>I\u2019m reaching over to turn off my lamp when my bedroom door opens again.</p><p>\u201cJust leave, Vaughn. Please.\u201d</p><p>I look up and see Caulder standing in the doorway, crying. He looks terrified. It\u2019s the same look I\u2019ve seen so many times since the moment our parents died. It\u2019s the same look he had when I hugged him good-bye at the hospital and made him leave with my grandparents. It\u2019s the same look that rips my heart in two every time I see it.</p><p>It\u2019s a look that immediately brings me back down to earth.</p><p>I wipe my eyes and motion for him to come closer. When he does, I wrap my arms around him and pull him onto my lap, then hug him while he quietly cries into my shirt. I rock him back and forth and stroke his hair. I kiss him on the forehead and pull him closer.</p><p>\u201cWant to sleep with me again tonight, Buddy?\u201d</p><p>2.</p> <p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cWOW,\u201d LAKE SAYS in disbelief. \u201cwhat a selfish bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thank God for that,\u201d I say. I clasp my hands together behind my head and look up at the ceiling, mirroring Lake\u2019s position on the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how history almost repeated itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it. Vaughn broke up with me because she didn\u2019t want to be with me just because she felt sorry for me. You broke up with me because you thought I was with you because I felt sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break up with you,\u201d she says defensively.</p><p>I laugh and sit up on the bed. \u201cThe hell you didn\u2019t! Your exact words were, \u2018I don\u2019t care if it takes days, or weeks, or months.\u2019 That\u2019s a breakup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not. I was giving you time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime I didn\u2019t need.\u201d I lie back down on my pillow and face her again. \u201cIt sure felt like a breakup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she says, looking at me. \u201cSometimes two people need to fall apart to realize how much they need to fall back together.\u201d</p><p>I take her hand and rest it between us, then stroke the back of it with my thumb. \u201cLet\u2019s not fall apart again,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She looks me in the eyes. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s vulnerability in the way she looks at me in silence. Her eyes scroll over my face and her mouth is curled up into a slight grin. She doesn\u2019t speak, but she doesn\u2019t have to. I know in these moments, when it\u2019s just her and me and nothing else, that she truly, soul-deep loves me.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like the first time you saw me?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhat was it about me that made you want to ask me out? And tell me everything, even the bad thoughts.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any bad thoughts. Naughty thoughts, maybe. But not bad.\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cWell then tell me those, too.\u201d</p><p>the introduction</p><p>I HOLD THE phone to my ear with my shoulder and finish buttoning my shirt. \u201cI promise, Grandma,\u201d I say into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m leaving straight from work on Friday. We\u2019ll be there by five but right now we\u2019re running late, I need to go. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She says her good-byes and I hang up the phone. Caulder walks through the living room with his backpack slung across his shoulder and a green, plastic army helmet on his head. He\u2019s always trying to sneak random accessories to school. Last week when I dropped him off, he was out of the car before I even noticed he was wearing a holster.</p><p>I reach out and snatch the helmet off his head and toss it onto the couch. \u201cCaulder, go get in the car. I\u2019ve got to grab my stuff.\u201d</p><p>Caulder heads outside and I scramble to gather all the papers scattered across the bar. I was up past midnight grading. I\u2019ve only been teaching eight weeks now, but I\u2019m beginning to understand why there\u2019s a teacher shortage. I shove the stack of papers inside my binder, then shove it into my satchel and head outside.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I mutter as soon as I see the U-Haul backing up across the street. This is the third family to move into that house in less than a year. I\u2019m not in the mood to help people move again, especially after only four hours of sleep. I hope they\u2019ll be finished unloading by the time I get home today, or I\u2019ll feel obligated to help. I turn around and lock the door behind me, then quickly head for the car. When I open the car door, Caulder isn\u2019t inside. I groan and throw my stuff in the seat. He always picks the worst times to play hide-and-seek; we\u2019re already ten minutes late.</p><p>I glance in the backseat, hoping he\u2019s hiding in the floorboard again, but I catch sight of him in the street. He\u2019s laughing and playing with another little boy that looks about his age. This is a plus. Maybe having a neighbor to play with will get him out of my hair more often.</p><p>I start to call his name when the U-Haul catches my eye again. The girl driving can\u2019t be any older than me, yet she\u2019s confidently backing up the U-Haul without any help. I lean against my car door and decide to watch her attempt to navigate that thing around those gnomes. This should be interesting.</p><p>I\u2019m quickly proven wrong and she\u2019s parked in the driveway in no time flat. Rather than hop out to inspect her parking job, she kills the engine and rolls down her window, then props her leg up on the dash.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why these simple actions strike me as odd. Intriguing, even. She drums her fingers on the steering wheel, then reaches up and tugs at her hair, letting down her ponytail. Her hair spills down around her shoulders and she massages her scalp, shaking her hair out.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>Her gaze falls on the boys playing in the street between us, and I can\u2019t help but let my curiosity get the best of me. Is she his sister? His mom? She doesn\u2019t look old enough to have a child that age, but I\u2019m also at a visual disadvantage being all the way across the street. And why is she just sitting in the U-Haul?</p><p>I realize I\u2019ve been staring for several minutes when someone pulls up beside her in a Jeep.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t let it be a guy,\u201d I whisper aloud to myself, hoping it\u2019s not a boyfriend. Or worse, a husband.</p><p>Why would I even care? The last thing I need right now is a distraction. Especially someone who lives right across the street.</p><p>I breathe a surprising sigh of relief when the person who steps out of the Jeep isn\u2019t a man. She\u2019s an older woman, maybe her mother. The woman shuts her door and walks up to greet the landlord, who\u2019s standing in the entryway. Before I can talk myself out of it, I\u2019m walking toward their house. I suddenly have the urge to help people move today, after all. I cross the street, unable to take my eyes off the girl in the U-Haul. She\u2019s watching Caulder and the other little boy play, and hasn\u2019t once glanced in my direction. I don\u2019t know what it is about her that\u2019s pulling me in. That look on her face . . . she looks sad. And for some reason, I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>I\u2019m standing unnoticed on the passenger side of the U-Haul, staring at her through the window, practically in a trance. I\u2019m not staring because of the fact that she\u2019s attractive, which she is. It\u2019s that look in her eyes. The depth. I want to know what she\u2019s thinking.</p><p>No, I need to know what she\u2019s thinking.</p><p>She diverts her attention out her window and says something to the boys, then opens the door to get out. I suddenly realize I\u2019m about to look like an idiot just standing in her driveway, staring. I glance across the street at my house and contemplate how I can get back over there without her seeing me. Before I have a chance to make a move, Caulder and the other little boy run around the U-haul and smash into me, laughing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a zombie!\u201d Caulder yells after I grab hold of them by their shirts. The girl rounds the U-Haul and I can\u2019t help but laugh. She\u2019s got her head cocked to the side and she\u2019s walking stiff-legged after them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet \u2019em!\u201d I yell to her. They\u2019re trying to fight to get away so I strengthen my grip. I look back up at her and we lock eyes.</p><p>Wow. Those eyes. They\u2019re the most incredible shade of green I\u2019ve ever seen. I try to compare the color to something, but nothing comes to mind. It\u2019s so unique, it\u2019s like her eyes have just invented their own hue.</p><p>Studying her features, I conclude she can\u2019t be the boy\u2019s mom. She looks my age. At the least, maybe nineteen or twenty. I need to find out her name. If I know her name I can look up her Facebook page and at least see if she\u2019s single.</p><p>Christ. This is the last thing I need in my life right now. A crush.</p> <p>I feel like she knows what I\u2019m thinking, so I force myself to break our gaze. The boy takes my moment of distraction and uses it to his advantage. He breaks free and slices at me with an imaginary sword, so I look back up at the girl and mouth \u201chelp.\u201d</p><p>She yells \u201cbrains\u201d again and lunges forward, pretending to bite Caulder on top of the head. She tickles them until they melt onto the concrete driveway, then she stands back up and laughs. Her cheeks flush when she meets my gaze again and she contorts her mouth into an uncomfortable grimace, like she\u2019s suddenly embarrassed. Her unease disappears just as fast as it appeared and is replaced by a smile that suddenly makes me want to know every single minute detail about her.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Will,\u201d I say, extending my hand out to her. \u201cWe live across the street.\u201d She places her hand in mine. It\u2019s soft and cold, and the moment I wrap my fingers around hers, the physical contact sends a shockwave straight through me. I don\u2019t remember the last time a girl has had this kind of immediate effect on me. It must be my lack of sleep last night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Layken,\u201d she says, her uneasiness once again masking her smile. \u201cI guess I live . . . here.\u201d She glances at the house behind her, then back to me.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look too pleased about the fact that she lives \u201chere.\u201d That same look she had while sitting in the U-Haul consumes her features again and her eyes suddenly grow sadder. Why does that look affect me so much?</p> <p>\u201cWell, welcome to Ypsilanti,\u201d I say, wanting desperately to make that look go away. She looks down and it occurs to me that I\u2019m still awkwardly shaking her hand, so I quickly pull it away from hers and shove my hands in my jacket pockets. \u201cWhere are you guys moving here from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas?\u201d she says.</p><p>Why does she say it like a question? Did I just ask a stupid question? I did. I\u2019m making stupid small talk.</p><p>\u201cTexas, huh?\u201d I say. She nods her head, but doesn\u2019t come back with a response. I suddenly feel like an intrusive neighbor. I don\u2019t know what else to say without making it even more awkward, so I figure my best move at this point is to retreat. I bend over and grab Caulder by the feet, throwing him over my shoulder, then tell her I\u2019ve got to get him to school. \u201cThere\u2019s a cold front coming through tonight. You should try to get as much unloaded today as you can. It\u2019s supposed to last a few days, so if you guys need help unloading this afternoon, let me know. We\u2019ll be home around four.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSure, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Her words are laced with the slightest hint of a southern drawl. I didn\u2019t know how much I liked southern accents until now. I continue across the street and help Caulder into the car. While he\u2019s climbing inside, I glance back across the street. The little boy is stabbing her in the back and she lets out a fake cry and falls to her knees. Her playful interaction with him is just one more thing that intrigues me about her. After he jumps on her back, she glances up and catches me staring at her. I shut Caulder\u2019s door and walk to my side. Before I get in, I muster a smile and wave, then climb into the car with an overwhelming urge to punch myself.</p> <p>AS SOON AS the bell for third period rings, I open the lid to my coffee and pour two extra packets of sugar in. I\u2019m about to need it. There\u2019s something about some of the students in third period that rub me the wrong way. Especially Javier. That kid is such a jackass.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Mr. Cooper,\u201d Eddie says, taking her seat. She\u2019s as bubbly as ever. I\u2019ve never seen Eddie in a bad mood, come to think of it. I need to figure out her secret, since the coffee obviously isn\u2019t doing it for me today.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>She turns and kisses Gavin on the cheek, then settles into her desk. They\u2019ve been dating since right after I graduated. They\u2019re probably the only two people that don\u2019t annoy the hell out of me in here. Well, them and maybe Nick. Nick seems okay.</p><p>After the students are all seated, I instruct them to get out their books. The entire time I\u2019m giving my lecture on the elements of poetry, my mind keeps wandering to the new neighbor.</p><p>Layken.</p><p>I like that name.</p><p>AFTER SIX HOURS and only a few dozen thoughts of the new neighbor later, Caulder and I finally pull into the driveway. I shut my car door and open the back door to remove the box of papers. When I turn back around, Layken\u2019s little brother has appeared out of nowhere and he\u2019s standing right in front of me, staring silently. It seems as though he\u2019s waiting on an introduction. Several seconds pass without him moving a muscle or blinking. Are we in a standoff? I shift the box to my left arm and reach out my hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKel is name my,\u201d he says.</p><p>I stare at him blankly. Was that even English?</p><p>\u201cI can talk backwards,\u201d he says, explaining the clutter of words that just came out of his mouth. \u201cLike this. Backwards talk can I.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. Someone possibly weirder than Caulder? I didn\u2019t think it was possible.</p><p>\u201cKel . . . you meeting . . . nice . . . was . . . it well,\u201d I say, a little slower than when he does it. He grins, then runs across the street with Caulder. I glance at their house and see that the U-Haul is now parked in the street with the latch shut. I\u2019m disappointed they\u2019ve already unloaded it; I was actually looking forward to helping.</p><p>I spend the rest of the evening working overtime for free . . . another side effect of being a teacher. I decide after my shower to make a living room detour to glance across the street for about the tenth time, but I don\u2019t see her.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep looking out the window?\u201d Caulder asks from behind me.</p><p>His voice startles me and I snatch the living room curtain shut. I didn\u2019t realize he was sitting on the couch. I walk over to him and pull on his hand, then shove him toward the hallway. \u201cGo to bed,\u201d I say.</p><p>He spins around before he closes his bedroom door behind him. \u201cYou were looking out the window to see if you could see that girl, weren\u2019t you? Do you like Kel\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Caulder,\u201d I say, ignoring his question.</p><p>He grins and closes the door to his room. Before I head to my own bedroom, I walk to the window one more time. When I open the curtain, someone is standing in the window across the street with the curtains partially open. They suddenly snatch shut and I can\u2019t help but smile, wondering if she\u2019s just as curious about me as I am about her.</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S COLD, IT\u2019S cold, it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s cold,\u201d Caulder says, jogging in place while I unlock the car doors. I crank the engine and turn the heat up, then head back inside to get the rest of my things while Caulder waits in the car. When I open the door to head back outside, I stop in my tracks when I see Layken standing in her entryway. She bends down and gathers a handful of snow to inspect it, then quickly drops it. She stands up and steps outside, closing the door behind her. I shake my head, knowing exactly what\u2019s about to happen. It\u2019s snowing and she isn\u2019t even wearing a jacket over her pajama bottoms and shirt. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing, but she won\u2019t last long out here. She\u2019s not in Texas anymore. She begins to make her way to the driveway when my gaze falls on her feet.</p><p>Is she wearing house shoes? Seriously? Before I can even yell a warning, she\u2019s flat on her back.</p><p>Southerners. They just don\u2019t get it.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move at first. She lies still in the driveway, staring up at the sky. A rush of panic overcomes me, thinking she may be hurt, but then she begins to pull herself up. As much as I don\u2019t want to come off like a bumbling idiot again, I head across the street to make sure she doesn\u2019t need my help.</p><p>The look on her face when she pulls one of the gnomes out from beneath her makes me laugh. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s blaming the poor guy for her fall. She pulls her arm back to throw him when I stop her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea!\u201d I yell, making my way up her driveway. She tilts her head up and looks at me with a death grip on the gnome. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, still laughing. I can\u2019t help but laugh, she looks so pissed!</p><p>Her cheeks redden and she glances away. \u201cI\u2019ll feel a lot better after I bust this damn thing.\u201d</p><p>I take the gnome out of her hands when I reach her. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that, gnomes are good luck.\u201d I place the freshly injured gnome back in his spot before she destroys him completely.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, inspecting her shoulder. \u201cReal good luck.\u201d</p><p>I immediately feel guilty when I see the blood on her shirt. \u201cOh, my god, I\u2019m so sorry. I wouldn\u2019t have laughed if I knew you were hurt.\u201d I assist her up and get a better look at the amount of blood coming from her injury. \u201cYou need to get a bandage on that.\u201d</p><p>She looks back to her house and shakes her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have any clue where to find one at this point.\u201d</p><p>I glance at our house, knowing I have a full supply of bandages in the first-aid kit. I\u2019m hesitant to offer them, though, since I\u2019m already running late for work as it is.</p><p>I\u2019m looking at my house, struggling with my indecision, when all five of my senses are suddenly flooded. The slightest smell of vanilla that permeates the air around me . . . the sound of her accent when she speaks . . . the way her close proximity wakes up something inside me that\u2019s long been dormant. Holy hell. I\u2019m in trouble.</p><p>Work can wait.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to walk with me. There are some in our kitchen.\u201d I take my jacket off and wrap it around her shoulders, then help her across the street. I\u2019m sure she can walk on her own, but for some reason I don\u2019t want to let go of her arm. I like helping her. I like the way she feels leaning against me. It seems . . . right.</p><p>Once we\u2019re inside my house, she follows me through my living room as I head to the kitchen to find a bandage. I pull the first-aid kit out of the cabinet and remove a Band-Aid. When I glance back at her, she\u2019s looking at the pictures on our wall. The pictures of my mom and dad.</p><p>Please don\u2019t ask me about them. Please.</p><p>This is not a conversation I want to have right now. I quickly say something to deflect her attention away from the pictures. \u201cIt needs to be cleaned before you put the bandage on it.\u201d I roll up my sleeves and turn on the faucet, then wet the napkin. I catch myself taking my time when I know I should be in a hurry. For whatever reason, I just want to drag this time out with her. I don\u2019t know why I feel like my desire to know her better has suddenly turned into a need to know her better. I turn back around and she darts her eyes away from me when I look at her. I don\u2019t really understand her sudden embarrassed look, but it\u2019s cute as hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she says, reaching for the napkin. \u201cI can get it.\u201d</p><p>I hand her the napkin and reach for the bandage. It\u2019s awkwardly quiet as I fidget with the wrapper. For some reason, her presence makes the house seem eerily empty and quiet. I never notice the silence when I\u2019m alone, but the lack of conversation occurring right now is uncomfortably obvious. I think of something to say to fill the void.</p><p>\u201cSo, what were you doing outside in your pajamas at seven o\u2019clock in the morning? Are you guys still unloading?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and tosses the napkin into the trash can. \u201cCoffee,\u201d she says, matter-of-fact.</p> <p>\u201cOh. I guess you aren\u2019t a morning person.\u201d I\u2019m secretly hoping that\u2019s the case. She seems sort of pissy. I\u2019d like to blame it on her lack of caffeine, rather than on indifference toward me. I take a step closer to place the bandage on her shoulder. I briefly pause before touching her and take in a silent breath, preparing for the rush I seem to get every time I touch her. I put the bandage in place and pat it softly, securing the edges with pressure from my fingertips. Her skin prickles and she wraps her arms around herself, rubbing her forearms up and down.</p><p>I gave her chills. This is good.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d I say, giving it one last, unnecessary pat. \u201cGood as new.\u201d</p><p>She clears her throat. \u201cThanks,\u201d she says, standing up. \u201cAnd I am a morning person, after I get my coffee.\u201d</p><p>Coffee. She needs coffee. I\u2019ve got coffee.</p> <p>I quickly walk over to the counter where the remaining brew is still warm in the pot. I grab a cup out of the cabinet and fill it up for her, then set it on the counter in front of her. \u201cYou want cream or sugar?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and smiles at me. \u201cBlack is fine. Thanks,\u201d she says. I lean across the bar and watch as she brings the coffee to her lips. She blows softly into the cup before pressing her lips to the brim and sips, never taking her eyes off mine.</p><p>I\u2019ve never wanted to be a coffee cup so bad in my life.</p><p>Why do I have to go to work? I could stay here and watch her drink coffee all day. She\u2019s looking right at me, probably wondering what the hell I\u2019m doing staring at her so much. I straighten back up and look down at my watch. \u201cI need to go, my brother is waiting in the car and I\u2019ve got to get to work. I\u2019ll walk you back. You can keep the cup.\u201d</p><p>She looks down at the cup and reads it. I didn\u2019t even notice I gave her my father\u2019s cup. She runs her fingers across the letters and smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she says as she stands to leave. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got the whole walking erect thing down now.\u201d She walks through the living room and is opening the front door when I spot my jacket lying across the back of my couch. I reach over and grab it.</p><p>\u201cLayken, take this. It\u2019s cold out there.\u201d She tries to refuse but I shake my head and make her take my jacket. If she takes the jacket, she\u2019ll eventually have to bring it back, which is exactly what I\u2019m hoping will happen. She smiles and pulls my jacket over her shoulders, then she heads across the street.</p> <p>When I reach my car I turn to watch her make her way back to her house. I like the way she looks, engulfed by my jacket over her pajamas. Who knew pajamas and Darth Vader house shoes could be so damn sexy?</p><p>\u201cLayken!\u201d I yell. She turns around just before she reaches her front door. \u201cMay the force be with you!\u201d I laugh and hop in the car before she can say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long? I\u2019m f-f-f-freezing,\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say. \u201cLayken hurt herself.\u201d I back the car up and pull out onto the street.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cShe tried to walk on the frozen concrete in Darth Vader house shoes. She busted it and cut herself.\u201d</p><p>Caulder giggles. \u201cShe has Darth Vader house shoes?\u201d</p><p>I smile at him. \u201cI know, right?\u201d</p> <p>3.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cI LOVE HEARING this,\u201d she says, grinning next to me on the bed. \u201cSo you thought I was cute, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think you were cute. I thought you were absolutely beautiful,\u201d I correct her. I brush the hair out of her face and she leans into my hand and kisses my palm. \u201cWhat did you think about me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cI tried not to. I was attracted to you, but I had so much going on and we\u2019d been in Michigan all of five minutes when we met. Circumstances just kept bringing us back together, though. Every minute I was around you, I just fell harder and harder in crush with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn crush?\u201d I laugh.</p><p>She grins. \u201cI was so in crush with you, Will. Especially after you helped me with the bandage. And after our trip to the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to say we were both in crush after that trip.\u201d</p><p>crush</p><p>I ATTEMPT TO go over my lesson plans for the next week but I can\u2019t even concentrate. I try to pinpoint exactly what it is about her that completely consumes my mind, but I can\u2019t figure it out. After the incident with the bandage this morning, she was all that went through my head at work. I wish she would just do or say something stupid so this hold she has on me would break. It\u2019s weird.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been so consumed by the thought of someone in my entire life. This is the last thing I need right now, but somehow it\u2019s the only thing I want.</p><p>Caulder bursts through the front door, laughing. He slips his shoes off and walks across the living room shaking his head. \u201cThat Darth Vader girl asked me how to get to the grocery store,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to drive. She\u2019s so dumb.\u201d He walks to the refrigerator and opens it.</p><p>I stand up. \u201cIs she still out there?\u201d I rush to the front door and see her Jeep parked in the street. I quickly pull my shoes on, then run outside before she drives away. I\u2019m relieved when I see her fiddling with the GPS. It\u2019ll buy me some time.</p><p>I wonder if she would care if I went with her to the store.</p><p>Of course she would. That would be awkward.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d I say as I approach her car, then lean through the window.</p><p>She glances up at me, a smile hiding in the corners of her mouth. \u201cWhat\u2019s not a good idea?\u201d She begins to insert the GPS into its holder.</p><p>Shit. What\u2019s not a good idea? I didn\u2019t think this through. I say the first lie that pops into my head. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of construction going on right now. That thing will get you lost.\u201d</p><p>Just as she opens her mouth to respond, a car pulls up beside her and a woman leans over the seat and speaks to Layken through the window. This has got to be her mother; they\u2019re practically identical. Same accent and everything.</p><p>I continue to lean through the window, using her distraction as an opportunity to study her. Her hair is a deep brown, but not as dark as her mother\u2019s. Her nail polish is chipped. It looks like she picks at it, which somehow makes me like her even more. Vaughn never left the house unless her hair and nails were perfect.</p><p>Kel jumps out of the other car and invites Caulder, who is now standing next to me, over. Caulder asks if he can go, so I grab the handle of Layken\u2019s car door without worrying about possible consequences. The hell with it.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I reply to him. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a little while, Caulder. I\u2019m riding with Layken to the store.\u201d I open her door and climb inside without second-guessing my actions. She shoots me a look, but it seems more like an amused one than an irritated one. I take this as another good sign. \u201cI don\u2019t give very good verbal directions. Mind if I go with you?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and puts the car into gear, glancing at the seat belt I\u2019ve already fastened. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>The closest grocery store is only two blocks away. That\u2019s not nearly enough time with her, so I decide to take her the long way. It\u2019ll give me more of a chance to get to know her.</p><p>\u201cSo, Caulder is your little brother\u2019s name?\u201d she asks as she turns off our street. I like how she says Caulder\u2019s name, drawing out the Caul a little bit more than necessary.</p><p>\u201cOne and only. My parents tried to have another baby for years. They eventually had Caulder, when names like Will weren\u2019t that cool anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your name,\u201d she says. She smiles at me and her cheeks redden, then she quickly darts her eyes back to the road.</p><p>Her embarrassment makes me laugh. Was that a compliment? Did she just flirt with me? God, I hope so.</p><p>I instruct her to turn left. She flips the blinker on, then brings her hand up to her hair, running her fingers through it all the way down to the ends; an action that causes me to gulp. When both of her hands are on the steering wheel again, I reach over and brush her hair behind her shoulders, then pull back the collar of her shirt.</p><p>I look at her bandage, wanting her to believe this is the reason I\u2019m touching her, when really I just needed to feel her hair. When my fingers graze her skin, she flinches. It seems like I make her nervous. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s in a good way. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a new bandage soon,\u201d I say. I pull her shirt back up and pat it.</p><p>\u201cRemind me to grab some at the store,\u201d she says. She grips the steering wheel tightly and keeps her eyes focused on the road. She\u2019s probably not used to driving in the snow. I should have offered to drive.</p><p>The next few moments are quiet. I catch myself staring at her, deep in thought. I wonder how old she is. She doesn\u2019t look older than me, but it would suck if she is. Sometimes girls don\u2019t date guys that are younger than them. I should really find out more about her.</p><p>\u201cSo, Layken,\u201d I say casually. I place my hand on her headrest and glance behind me at all the boxes still in the back of the Jeep. \u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>She cocks an eyebrow at me, then turns her attention back to the road. \u201cUm, no. That\u2019s so clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Her unexpected response makes me laugh under my breath. She\u2019s feisty. I like that, but it still doesn\u2019t answer any of my questions. I glance to her CD player and lean forward. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll figure you out myself,\u201d I say as I hit eject. \u201cYou know, you can tell a lot about a person by their taste in music.\u201d I pull the CD out of the player and hold my breath as I prepare to read it. Please don\u2019t let her be into Nickelback. I would have to jump out of the car. When I read the handwritten label, I laugh. \u201cLayken\u2019s shit? Is shit descriptive here, or possessive?\u201d</p><p>She snatches the CD out of my hands and inserts it back into the player. \u201cI don\u2019t like Kel touching my shit, okay?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when it happens . . . the most beautiful sound in the world. Sure, the song is beautiful. All Avett Brothers songs are beautiful. But the sound I\u2019m hearing is the sound of commonality. The sound of similarity. The sound of my favorite band that I\u2019ve been listening to nonstop for two years . . . coming from her speakers.</p><p>What are the chances?</p><p>She immediately leans forward and turns down the volume. I unconsciously grab her hand to stop her. \u201cTurn it back up, I know this.\u201d</p><p>She smirks at me like there isn\u2019t a shred of truth to what I just said. \u201cOh, yeah? What\u2019s it called?\u201d she challenges. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Avett Brothers,\u201d I say. She arches her eyebrow and looks at me inquisitively as I explain the song. The fact that she apparently loves this band as much as I do stimulates a feeling deep in the pit of my stomach that I haven\u2019t felt in years.</p><p>Good lord, I\u2019ve got butterflies.</p><p>She glances down at my hand still clasped on top of hers. I pull my hand back and run it down my pants, hoping it didn\u2019t make her uncomfortable. I\u2019m almost positive she\u2019s blushing again, though. That\u2019s a good sign. That\u2019s a really good sign.</p><p>The entire rest of the way to the grocery store, she tells me all about her family. She mostly talks about the recent death of her father and her birthday gift from him. She continues talking about her father and everything her family has been through this year. It explains that distant look she gets in her eyes sometimes. I can\u2019t help but feel somewhat connected with her, knowing she can relate on some level with what I\u2019ve been through the last few years. I tense up at the thought of having to tell her about my parents right now.</p> <p>I can feel the conversation on her end coming to a close, so I point her in the actual direction of the grocery store, hoping it will deflect the parental subject before it becomes my turn to share. When we pull into the parking lot, I\u2019m both relieved and anxious. Relieved that I didn\u2019t have to explain my situation with Caulder to her, but anxious at the thought that I know the conversation is inevitable. I just don\u2019t want to scare her off yet.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she says. \u201cIs that the quickest way to the store? That drive took twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>I swing the door open and wink at her. \u201cNo, actually it\u2019s not.\u201d I step out of the car, impressed with myself. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been into a girl, I wasn\u2019t sure if I still had any game. She\u2019s got to realize I\u2019m flirting with her. I like her. She seems to like me, but she\u2019s not as forward as I am, so I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m definitely not one to play games, so I decide to just go with it. I grab her hand, tell her to run, and pull her faster toward the entrance. I do this partly because we\u2019re getting soaked, but mostly because I just wanted an excuse to grab her hand again.</p><p>When we get inside she\u2019s soaking wet and laughing. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve really heard her laugh. I like her laugh.</p><p>There\u2019s a strand of wet hair stuck to her cheek, so I reach up and wipe it away. As soon as my fingers touch her skin, her eyes lock with mine and she stops laughing.</p> <p>Damn, those eyes. I continue to stare at her, unable to look away. She\u2019s beautiful. So damn beautiful.</p><p>She breaks our stare and clears her throat. Her reaction is somewhat guarded, like I may have made her feel uncomfortable. She hands me the grocery list and grabs a cart. \u201cDoes it always snow in September?\u201d she asks.</p><p>We just had a seriously intense, slightly awkward moment . . . and she\u2019s asking me about the weather? I laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t last more than a few days, maybe a week. Most of the time the snow doesn\u2019t start until late October. You\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me. \u201cLucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a pretty rare cold front. You got here right in time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh. I assumed most of y\u2019all would hate the snow. Doesn\u2019t it snow here most of the year?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s official. The southern accent is my absolute favorite now. \u201cY\u2019all?\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says defensively.</p><p>I shake my head and smile. \u201cNothing. I\u2019ve just never heard anyone say \u2018y\u2019all\u2019 in real life before. It\u2019s cute. So southern belle.\u201d</p><p>She laughs at my comment. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. From now on I\u2019ll do like you Yankees and waste my breath by saying \u2018all you guys.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, nudging her shoulder. \u201cI like your accent, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>She blushes again, but doesn\u2019t look away. I look down at the grocery list and pretend to read it, but I can\u2019t help but notice she\u2019s staring at me. Intensely staring. Almost like she\u2019s trying to figure me out or something.</p><p>She eventually turns her head and I steer her in the direction of the foods on her list.</p> <p>\u201cLucky Charms?\u201d I say, eyeing her as she grabs three huge boxes of the cereal. \u201cIs that Kel\u2019s favorite?\u201d</p><p>She grins at me. \u201cNo, actually it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a Rice Krispies fan myself.\u201d I take the boxes of cereal from her and throw them into the cart.</p><p>\u201cRice Krispies are boring,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThe hell they are! Rice Krispies make Rice Krispies treats. What can your cereal do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky Charms have shooting star marshmallows in them. You get to make a wish every time you eat one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d I laugh. \u201cAnd what are you gonna wish for? You\u2019ve got three boxes, that\u2019s a lot of wishes.\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms across the handle of the cart and leans forward while she pushes it. She gets that same distant look in her eyes again. \u201cI\u2019d wish I could be back in Texas,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>The sadness in her answer makes me want to hug her. I don\u2019t know what it is about Michigan that makes her feel this way. I just have an overwhelming need to console her. \u201cWhat do you miss so much about Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she says. \u201cThe lack of snow, the lack of concrete, the lack of people, the lack of . . .\u201d She pauses. \u201cThe lack of unfamiliarity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I say it without even thinking. It\u2019s like I lose my filter when I\u2019m around her. She shoots me a look of confusion, almost as though she doesn\u2019t want to misinterpret my question.</p><p>\u201cYou miss your boyfriend?\u201d I clarify.</p><p>She smiles at me, erasing the troubled look that consumed her features just seconds ago. \u201cNo boyfriend,\u201d she says.</p><p>I smile back at her. Nice.</p><p>I DECIDE TO take her the quick route home. I would have taken her the long way again, just to spend more time with her, but I figure she actually needs to know how to get to the grocery store in the event I can\u2019t invite myself along on the next trip. When we pull into her driveway I hop out and make my way around to the rear of the Jeep. When she pops the hood, I pull it open and watch as she gathers her things together. It surprises me how disappointed I am that we\u2019re about to part ways again. I hate the thought that once these groceries are unloaded, I\u2019m going to have to go back home. I want to spend more time with her.</p><p>When she meets me at the back of the Jeep, she smiles and places her hand over her heart. \u201cWhy! I never would have been able to find the store without your help. Thank you so much for your hospitality, kind sir.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>My.</p><p>God.</p><p>That is the hottest damn southern impression I\u2019ve ever heard. And that smile. And that nervous laughter. Everything she does pierces my heart. It\u2019s all I can do to stop myself from grabbing her face and kissing the hell out of her right here and now. Looking down at her, watching her laugh . . . God, I\u2019ve never wanted to kiss a girl so bad in my entire life.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says nervously. She can obviously see the internal struggle behind my expression.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it, Will.</p><p>I ignore my better judgment and step forward. Her eyes remain locked on mine as I cup her chin with my free hand. My bold move causes a small gasp to pass between her lips, but she makes no move to pull away. Her skin is soft beneath my fingertips. I bet her lips are even softer.</p><p>My eyes scroll over her features, admiring their beautiful simplicity. She doesn\u2019t shy away. In fact, she looks a little bit hopeful, like she would welcome my lips on hers.</p><p>Don\u2019t kiss her. Don\u2019t do it. You\u2019ll screw this up, Will.</p><p>I attempt to silence the voice in my head, but it ultimately wins out. It\u2019s way too soon. And it\u2019s broad daylight. Her mother\u2019s home, for Christ\u2019s sake! What am I thinking?</p><p>I slide my hand around to the back of her neck, then kiss her on her forehead, instead. I take a step back and reluctantly drop my hand. I have to remind myself to breathe. Being this close to her is suffocating, but in the best way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute,\u201d I say, attempting to make light of the moment. I grab a few sacks out of the back of the Jeep and quickly head to the front door before she comes to her senses and punches me. I can\u2019t believe I just kissed her on the forehead! I\u2019ve only known the girl for two days!</p><p>I set the bags down and head back to the Jeep just as her mother makes her way outside.</p><p>I feel nothing but relieved over my decision not to kiss her when I realize we would have been interrupted. A humiliating thought.</p><p>I reach my hand out to introduce myself. \u201cYou must be Layken and Kel\u2019s mom. I\u2019m Will Cooper. We live across the street.\u201d</p><p>She smiles a welcoming smile. She seems nice; not intimidating at all. It\u2019s amazing how much Layken looks like her.</p><p>\u201cJulia Cohen,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re Caulder\u2019s older brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am. Older by twelve years.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me for a moment. \u201cSo that makes you . . . twenty-one?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure, because it happens so fast, but I could swear she glances behind me and winks at Layken. She returns her focus back in my direction and smiles again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad Kel and Lake were able to make friends so fast,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Julia releases my hand and turns toward the house, grabbing the sacks in the entryway.</p><p>Lake. She calls her Lake. I might like that even more than Layken. I reach in and grab the last two sacks out of the back of her Jeep.</p><p>\u201cLake, huh? I like that.\u201d I hand her the sacks and shut the back. \u201cSo, Lake,\u201d I say, leaning against her car. I fold my arms across my chest and take a deep breath. This part is always the hardest. The \u201casking out\u201d part.</p><p>\u201cCaulder and I are going to Detroit on Friday. We\u2019ll be gone until late Sunday, family stuff,\u201d I say. \u201cI was wondering if you had any plans for tomorrow night, before I go?\u201d</p><p>She grins at me, then makes a face like she\u2019s trying to stifle the grin. I wish she wouldn\u2019t do that. Her smile is breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to make me admit that I have absolutely no life here?\u201d she says.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a no, so I take it as a yes. \u201cGreat. It\u2019s a date then. I\u2019ll pick you up at seven-thirty.\u201d I immediately turn and head back to my house before she can object. I didn\u2019t officially ask her out. In fact, it was more like I just told her. But . . . she sure didn\u2019t object. That\u2019s a good sign. That\u2019s a really good sign.</p><p>4.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>LAKE PULLS HERSELF up onto her elbows and rests her chin in her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really enjoying this,\u201d I say.</p><p>She\u2019s smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever told you, but when you kissed me on the forehead that day it was the best kiss I\u2019d ever had. Up to that point, anyway,\u201d she says, falling back against her pillow.</p><p>I lean in and replicate the forehead kiss, except this time I don\u2019t stop there. I plant tiny pecks all the way down to the tip of her nose, then I pull back. \u201cMine, too,\u201d I say, looking into the eyes that I get to wake up to every morning for the rest of my life. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I\u2019ve got to be the luckiest man in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow I want to know all about our date.\u201d She puts her hands behind her head and relaxes, waiting for me to spill it.</p><p>I lie back on my pillow and think back to that day. The day that I fell for my wife.</p><p>the first date</p><p>I HAVEN\u2019T BEEN in this good a mood in over two years. I also haven\u2019t been this nervous about a girl in over two years. In fact, I haven\u2019t even been on a single date in two years. A double load, a full-time job and a child really interfere with the whole dating scene.</p> <p>There\u2019s half an hour left before Caulder and I have to leave for school, so I decide to do a little cleaning since I\u2019ll be with Lake tonight. I\u2019m hesitant to take her to Club N9NE on our first date. Slam poetry is so much a part of me; I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d take it if she didn\u2019t connect with it. Or worse, if she hated it.</p><p>Vaughn was never into it. She loved Club N9NE on any other night, just not slam night. Thursdays were usually the one night of the week we didn\u2019t spend together. I realize this moment is the first moment Vaughn has even crossed my mind since the moment I met Lake.</p><p>\u201cCaulder, go make sure your room\u2019s clean. Maya\u2019s watching you tonight,\u201d I say as he emerges from the hallway. He rolls his eyes and backtracks into the bedroom. \u201cClean is it,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>He\u2019s been talking backward since he met Kel a few days ago. I just ignore him half the time. It\u2019s too much to keep up with.</p><p>I take the overloaded bag out of the kitchen trash can and begin to head outside with it, but I pause at the hallway. Something about the picture of Caulder and me with our dad in the front yard catches my eye. I take a step forward and get a closer look. I\u2019ve never noticed it before this moment, probably because it actually has meaning now . . . but in the background right over my father\u2019s shoulder, you can see the gnome with the red hat from across the street. The same gnome Lake fell on and broke. The gnome is staring right at the camera with a smirk on his face, almost like he\u2019s posing.</p> <p>I glance at the rest of the pictures on the wall, recalling the moments they were all captured. I used to hate looking at these pictures. I hated the way it would make me feel and how much I would miss them when I looked into their eyes. It doesn\u2019t hurt as much anymore. Now when I look at them, I mostly recall the good memories.</p><p>Seeing their pictures brings the realization back to the forefront of my mind that Lake has no idea of the responsibilities I have in my life. I need to tell her tonight. It\u2019s better to get it out now, that way if she can\u2019t handle it, I won\u2019t be too far gone. It\u2019ll be a lot easier to be rejected by her tonight, before whatever it is I\u2019m feeling toward her becomes even more intense.</p><p>I close the lid to the trash can and pull it to the curb. When I near the end of the driveway, I see the back door to Lake\u2019s Jeep is open. She\u2019s leaning all the way across the seat, searching for something. When she finds what she\u2019s looking for, she climbs out of the backseat with a coffeepot in her hands. She\u2019s still wearing pajamas and her hair is piled on top of her head in a knot.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d I say, heading across the street toward her.</p><p>She jumps when she hears my voice, then spins around to face me and grins. \u201cWhat am I doing wrong this time?\u201d She shuts the door to the Jeep and walks toward me.</p><p>I point to the coffeepot. \u201cIf you drink too much coffee this early in the morning, you\u2019ll crash after lunch. Then you\u2019ll be too exhausted to go out with your hot date tonight.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs. Her smile is fleeting, though. She looks down at her pajamas, then runs her hands over her hair with a slight look of panic in her eyes. She\u2019s silently freaking out about the way she looks, so I ease her mind. \u201cYou look great,\u201d I assure her. \u201cBed hair looks really good on you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, then leans against her car. \u201cI know,\u201d she says confidently, looking down at her pajamas. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m wearing on our date tonight. You like?\u201d</p><p>I slowly look her up and down, then shake my head no. \u201cNot really,\u201d I say, eyeing her boots. \u201cI\u2019d prefer it if you wore the house shoes.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI\u2019ll do that, then. Seven-thirty, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod and smile back at her. We\u2019re about four feet apart, but the way her eyes are piercing into mine makes it feel like she\u2019s just inches away. She smiles at me with an unfamiliar sparkle in her eye. Unlike the last two days, she actually looks happy right now.</p><p>We continue to stare at each other, neither of us speaking . . . or walking away. There\u2019s a long silence, but it\u2019s not awkward. The way she\u2019s watching me this time seems more confident. More at ease.</p><p>More hopeful.</p><p>I decide to give in before the awkwardness does set in, so I take a couple of steps backward toward my house. \u201cI have to get to work,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p> <p>She lifts her hand and waves good-bye before turning toward her house. Not just a normal back-and-forth wave, either. It\u2019s a fingers up and down flirty wave.</p><p>Wow. Who knew a simple wave could be so damn hot?</p><p>\u201cLake?\u201d</p><p>She glances back at me, the corners of her mouth hinting at a smile. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I point to her pajamas. \u201cI really am digging this unwashed, straight-out-of-bed look. Just make sure you brush your teeth before I pick you up tonight, because I\u2019m gonna kiss you.\u201d I wink at her and turn back toward my house before she can respond.</p><p>\u201cGOOD MORNING, MRS. Alex,\u201d I say, careful not to sound too friendly. I have to watch every word that comes out of my mouth around this woman; she takes it all the wrong way. The inappropriate way. I walk past her desk and into the mailroom, then grab the contents from inside my box. When I exit the mailroom, she\u2019s already rushing toward me.</p><p>\u201cDid you get my note? I left you a sticky note.\u201d She glances down at the stack of papers I\u2019m holding.</p><p>I look at the papers in my hands and shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I just checked my box five seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Alex isn\u2019t known for her kind demeanor, except toward me. Her obvious favoritism has become a running joke among the staff. A joke that I\u2019m the butt of. She\u2019s at least twenty years older than me, not to mention married. However, it doesn\u2019t stop her from blatantly displaying her affection, which is why I only come to the mailroom once a week now.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wrote you a message. Your faculty advisor called and needs to schedule a meeting with you.\u201d She grabs the stack of papers out of my hands and spreads them out on her desk, looking for the note she wrote. \u201cHe said he needs to do your quarterly observation. I swear I put it right on top.\u201d</p><p>I reach forward and swipe the contents of my mailbox back into a stack. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m running late, so I\u2019ll look through it later. I\u2019ll let you know if I don\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and waves good-bye as I back away from her.</p><p>Oh, shit. It was a flirty wave. I\u2019ve got to quit coming in here.</p><p>\u201cHave a great day,\u201d I say, turning to leave as fast as I can. I\u2019m relieved when the door to the administration office closes behind me. I\u2019m really going to have to get someone else to check my mail from now on.</p><p>\u201cYou really need to stop leading her on like that,\u201d Gavin says. I look up and he\u2019s staring through the window at Mrs. Alex.</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cNothing has changed since high school, Gavin. It\u2019s even worse now that I\u2019m a teacher here.\u201d</p><p>Gavin looks past me and waves at Mrs. Alex through the window and smiles at her. \u201cShe\u2019s still watching you. Maybe you should flex your muscles; give her a little gun show. Or at least give her a nice view while you\u2019re walking away.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Mrs. Alex admiring me from behind makes me a little too uncomfortable, so I change the subject and walk toward my first-period class. \u201cYou and Eddie going to Club N9NE tonight? I haven\u2019t seen you guys there in a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Why? You doing one?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, not tonight,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there a little after eight, though. My sitter isn\u2019t available until seven-thirty, so we\u2019ll probably miss the sac.\u201d</p><p>He stops in his tracks just as we reach my classroom door. \u201cWe? Who\u2019s we? Does Will Cooper have a date?\u201d He cocks an eyebrow and waits for my reply.</p><p>I don\u2019t usually hang out with students outside of work, but Gavin and Eddie have been showing up at Club N9NE every now and then for a few months. We sometimes sit together, so I\u2019ve gotten to know them pretty well. When you\u2019re teaching at twenty-one years old, it\u2019s sort of difficult to completely cut off socialization with people who are practically your age.</p><p>\u201cSo? Who is she?\u201d he says. \u201cWho\u2019s the elusive girl that may just be the end to Will Cooper\u2019s dry spell?\u201d</p><p>I open the door to the classroom and lose the smile as I switch on teacher-mode. \u201cGet to class, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and salutes me, then heads down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cTHANKS AGAIN, MAYA,\u201d I say as I head through the living room. \u201cThere\u2019s cash on the table. I ordered pizza about fifteen minutes ago.\u201d I grab my keys and shove my wallet into my pocket. \u201cHe\u2019s been talking backward a lot so just ignore it. He\u2019ll talk frontward if he has anything important to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou paying me double?\u201d she says, falling onto the sofa with the remote in hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree to watch that other kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just the neighbor,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019ll go home soon. If he doesn\u2019t, then yeah . . . I guess I\u2019ll pay you extra.\u201d I\u2019ve turned to head outside when the boys make their way back into the house. Kel stops in the doorway and puts his hands on his hips, looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you my sister\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m thrown off by his directedness. \u201cUm, no. Just her friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told my mom you were taking her on a date. I thought only boyfriends took girls on dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I pause. \u201cSometimes boys take girls on dates to see if they want them to be their girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>I notice Caulder standing beside me, taking in the conversation as if he\u2019s just as curious. I wasn\u2019t prepared to have to explain the rules of dating right now.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like a test?\u201d Caulder asks. \u201cTo see if you want Layken to be your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and nod. \u201cYeah, I guess you could say that.\u201d</p><p>Kel laughs. \u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna like her. She burps a lot. And she\u2019s bossy. And she never lets me drink coffee, so she probably won\u2019t let you have any either. And she has really bad taste in music and sings way too loud and leaves her bras all over the house. It\u2019s gross.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThanks for the warning. You think it\u2019s too late to back out now?\u201d</p><p>Kel shakes his head, missing my sarcasm completely. \u201cNo, she\u2019s already dressed so you have to take her now.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, pretending to be annoyed. \u201cWell, it\u2019s just a few hours. Hopefully she won\u2019t burp a lot and boss me around and steal my coffee and sing to her really bad music and leave her bra in my car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or hopefully she will.</p><p>Kel walks past me into the house. \u201cGood luck,\u201d he says, his voice full of pity. I laugh and shut the door behind me. I\u2019m halfway to my car when Lake opens her front door and walks to the driveway.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d I yell to her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she yells back.</p> <p>I wait for her to walk to my car, but she doesn\u2019t. She looks ready. Why is she just standing there?</p><p>\u201cWell, come on then!\u201d I yell.</p><p>She still doesn\u2019t move. She folds her arms across her chest and stands still. I throw my hand up in defeat and laugh. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you would pick me up at seven-thirty,\u201d she yells. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for you to pick me up.\u201d</p><p>I grin and get in the car, then back up into her driveway. When I get out and open her door, I notice she\u2019s not wearing the house shoes. I was sort of hoping she was serious this morning. It\u2019s not quite dark yet, which is unfortunate since I can\u2019t stop staring at her. She curled her hair and put on just a touch of makeup. She\u2019s wearing jeans and a purple shirt that brings out the hue of her eyes, making them even harder to look away from. She looks . . . perfect.</p> <p>Once we\u2019re both in the car, I reach behind me and grab the bag out of the backseat. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to eat, so I made us grilled cheese.\u201d I hand her the sandwich and a drink. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019s not too upset that we aren\u2019t going out to eat. We just don\u2019t have time. I almost went to her house earlier to let her know we weren\u2019t, in case she didn\u2019t eat, but I decided to throw something together at the last minute instead. I sort of wanted to see how she\u2019d react to not being taken on a typical date. Maybe it\u2019s a little mean, but she\u2019s smiling, so she doesn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\u201cWow. This is a first.\u201d She puts her sandwich on her knee and twists open her soda. \u201cAnd where exactly are we going in such a hurry? It\u2019s obviously not a restaurant.\u201d</p><p>I take a bite of my sandwich and pull out of her driveway. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise. I know a lot more about you than you know about me, so tonight I want to show you what I\u2019m all about.\u201d</p><p>She grins at me. \u201cWell, I\u2019m intrigued,\u201d she says before she takes a bite of her sandwich.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved she doesn\u2019t press me further about where we\u2019re going. It would be sort of hard to explain that I\u2019m taking her to a club on a Thursday night to watch a bunch of people recite poetry. It doesn\u2019t sound near as appealing as it actually is. I\u2019d rather let her experience it for the first time in person without having preconceived notions.</p><p>When we finish our sandwiches, she puts the trash in the backseat and shifts in her seat so that she\u2019s facing me. She casually rests her head against the headrest. \u201cWhat are your parents like?\u201d</p> <p>I glance out my window, not wanting her to see the reluctance in my expression. It\u2019s the exact thing I was hoping she wouldn\u2019t ask about until the drive home, at least. I\u2019d hate for this to be the first thing we talk about. It would put a somber mood to the whole night. I take a deep breath and exhale, hoping I\u2019m not appearing as uncomfortable on the outside as I\u2019m feeling on the inside.</p><p>How the hell can I redirect this conversation?</p><p>I decide to play the game Caulder and I play sometimes on the drive to our grandparents. I hope she won\u2019t think it\u2019s too cheesy, but it\u2019ll pass the time and may even help me get to know her better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not big on small talk, Lake. We can figure all that out later. Let\u2019s make this drive interesting.\u201d I adjust myself in the seat and prepare to explain the rules to her. When I turn to look at her, she\u2019s staring at me with a repulsed look on her face.</p><p>What the hell did I say? I replay my last sentence in my head and realize how it sounded. I laugh when it dawns on me that she completely misconstrued what I just said. \u201cLake, no! I just meant let\u2019s talk about something besides what we\u2019re expected to talk about.\u201d</p><p>She expels a breath and laughs. \u201cGood,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI know a game we can play. It\u2019s called, \u2018would you rather.\u2019 Have you played it before?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, but I would rather you go first.\u201d</p> <p>I feel like if I use some of the ones Caulder and I have used it would be cheating, so I take a few seconds to think of a new one. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say when I come up with one. I clear my throat. \u201cOkay, would you rather spend the rest of your life with no arms; or would you rather spend the rest of your life with arms you couldn\u2019t control?\u201d</p><p>I remember when Caulder and I tried to get Vaughn to play this game on our way to Detroit once; she rolled her eyes and told us to grow up. I watch Lake, hoping for a different reaction, and she just stares at me straight-faced like she\u2019s actually contemplating an answer.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess I would rather spend the rest of my life with arms I couldn\u2019t control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Seriously?\u201d I laugh, glancing over at her. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t be controlling them! They could be flailing around and you\u2019d be constantly punching yourself in the face! Or worse, you might grab a knife and stab yourself!\u201d</p><p>She laughs. Damn, I love that laugh.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize there were right and wrong answers,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou suck at this. Your turn.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me, then furrows her brows, facing forward and leaning back into her seat. \u201cOkay, let me think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to have one ready!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Will! I barely heard of this game for the first time thirty seconds ago. Give me a second to think of one.\u201d</p><p>I reach over and squeeze her hand. \u201cI\u2019m teasing.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t my intention to keep holding on to her hand, but for some reason it feels right, so I don\u2019t let go. It\u2019s so natural, like we didn\u2019t even contemplate the move. I\u2019m still staring at our interlocked fingers when she continues with her turn, unfazed. I like how much she seems to be enjoying the game. I like how she seemed to prefer the grilled cheese sandwiches to a restaurant. I like girls who don\u2019t mind the simple things every now and then. I like that we\u2019re holding hands.</p><p>We play a few more rounds and the bizarre things she comes up with could give Caulder a run for his money. The half-hour drive to the club seems like it takes five minutes. I decide to ask one final question as we\u2019re pulling into the parking lot. I pull into a space and reach over with my left hand to kill the engine so that I don\u2019t have to move my right hand from hers. I glance over at her. \u201cLast one,\u201d I say. \u201cWould you rather be back in Texas right now? Or here?\u201d</p><p>She looks down at our fingers that are interlocked and grazes her thumb across my hand. Her reaction to my question isn\u2019t a negative one. In fact, it almost seems just the opposite when her lips crack a smile and she looks back up. Just when she opens her mouth to respond, her attention is pulled to the sign on the building behind me and her smile fades.</p><p>\u201cUh, Will?\u201d she says hesitantly. \u201cI don\u2019t dance.\u201d She pulls her hand from mine and begins to open her door, so I do the same.</p><p>\u201cUh, neither do I.\u201d</p><p>We both exit the vehicle, but the fact that she didn\u2019t answer that last question isn\u2019t lost on me. I grab her hand when we meet at the front of the car and I lead her inside. When we walk through the doors I make a quick scan of the room. I know a lot of the regulars here and I\u2019m hoping I can at least find a secluded area in order for us to have some privacy. I spot an empty booth in the back of the room and lead her in that direction. I want her to be able to get the full experience without the constant interruption of conversation from other people.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quieter back here,\u201d I say. She\u2019s looking around with curiosity in her eyes. She asks about the younger audience when she notices pretty quickly that this isn\u2019t a regular club-going crowd. She\u2019s observant.</p><p>\u201cWell, tonight it\u2019s not a club,\u201d I say. She scoots into the booth first and I slide in right next to her. \u201cIt\u2019s slam night. Every Thursday they shut the club down and people come here to compete in the slam.\u201d</p><p>She breaks her gaze from the table of kids and looks at me, the curiosity still present in her eyes. \u201cAnd what\u2019s a slam?\u201d</p><p>I pause for a second and smile at her. \u201cIt\u2019s poetry,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m all about.\u201d I wait for the laughter, but it doesn\u2019t come. She looks directly at me, almost like she didn\u2019t understand what I said.</p><p>I start to repeat myself when she interrupts. \u201cPoetry, huh?\u201d She continues to smile at me, but in a very endearing way. Almost like she\u2019s impressed. \u201cDo people write their own or do they get it from other authors?\u201d</p><p>I lean back in my seat and look at the stage. \u201cPeople get up there and pour their hearts out just using their words and the movement of their bodies. It\u2019s amazing. You aren\u2019t going to hear any Dickinson or Frost here.\u201d</p><p>When I look at her again, she actually looks intrigued. Poetry has always been such a huge part of my life; I was worried she wouldn\u2019t understand it. Not only does she understand it, she seems excited about it.</p><p>I explain the rules to her regarding the competition. She asks a lot of questions, which puts me even more at ease. When I\u2019ve explained everything to her, I decide to grab us drinks before the sac comes on stage.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll take some chocolate milk.\u201d</p><p>I expect her to laugh at her joke, but she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cChocolate milk? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith ice,\u201d she says, matter-of-fact.</p><p>\u201cOkay. One chocolate milk on the rocks coming right up.\u201d</p><p>I exit the booth and walk over to the bar to order our drinks, then turn around and lean against the bar and watch her. This feeling I get when I\u2019m with her . . . I\u2019ve missed it. I\u2019ve missed that feeling of feeling. Somehow, she\u2019s the first person in the last two years of my life who gives me any sense of hope about the future.</p><p>I realize as I\u2019m watching her that I\u2019ve made a huge mistake. I\u2019ve been comparing what her reaction to things might be based on what Vaughn\u2019s reactions were in the past. It\u2019s not fair to Lake to assume she would be turned off by the simplicity of the date or by the game we played on the drive here. It\u2019s not fair to Lake that I assume she wouldn\u2019t like poetry simply because Vaughn didn\u2019t. It\u2019s also unfair of me to assume she would push me away if she knew that I was Caulder\u2019s guardian.</p><p>This girl isn\u2019t anything like Vaughn.</p><p>This girl isn\u2019t anything like any girl I\u2019ve known. This girl is . . .</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s cute.\u201d Gavin\u2019s voice jerks me out of my thoughts. I look over at him and he\u2019s leaning against the bar next to me, watching me watch Lake. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d He turns around and orders two drinks from the waitress.</p><p>\u201cLayken,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd yeah. She is cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you guys been dating?\u201d he asks, turning back to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look down at my watch. \u201cGoing on forty-five minutes.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cShit. The way you were looking at her I would have guessed a hell of a lot longer. Where\u2019d you meet her?\u201d</p><p>The bartender hands me my change and the receipt for our drinks. I glance down at the receipt and laugh. It actually says, \u201cChocolate milk\u2014rocks.\u201d I fold the receipt and put it in my wallet.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d I say as I turn back to Gavin, \u201cshe\u2019s my new neighbor. Just moved in three days ago.\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head and looks back in her direction. \u201cYou better hope it works out. That could get really awkward, you know.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, I guess so. But I have a good feeling about her.\u201d</p><p>Before he walks away he points to the front of the room. \u201cEddie and I are over there. I\u2019ll try to keep her occupied so you two can have your privacy. If she sees you here with a girl, she\u2019ll be over there in a second trying to be her new best friend.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, because he\u2019s right. \u201cThanks.\u201d I grab our drinks and head back to the booth, relieved that I won\u2019t have to deal with introductions tonight. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that.</p><p>5.</p> <p>the honeymoon</p><p>LAKE SITS UP on the bed and glares at me. \u201cWhat the hell, Will? Gavin knew? He\u2019s known this whole time?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cHey, you and Eddie weren\u2019t the only ones keeping secrets.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head in disbelief. \u201cDoes Eddie know he knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Unlike some people, Gavin can keep a secret.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes and rolls back onto her pillow, dumbfounded. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he knew,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat did he say when I showed up in your poetry class?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I could go ahead and tell you all about that day, but that would mean I would be skipping over our first kiss. You don\u2019t want to hear about the rest of our date?\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>falling</p><p>\u201cWHAT\u2019S THE SAC?\u201d she says when I return with the drinks.</p><p>\u201cSacrifice. It\u2019s what they use to prepare the judges.\u201d I slide back into the booth but make it a point to scoot in closer this time. \u201cSomeone performs something that isn\u2019t part of the competition so the judges can calibrate their scoring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they can call on anyone? What if they had called on me?\u201d she asks. She looks terrified at the thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you should have had something ready,\u201d I tease.</p><p>She laughs, then puts one of her elbows on the table, turning toward me. She runs her hand through her hair, sending a slight scent of vanilla in my direction. She watches me for a moment, her smile spreading up to her eyes. I love this peaceful look about her right now.</p> <p>We\u2019re sitting so close together I can feel the heat of her body against mine, parts of us touching. Our thighs, her hip against mine, our hands just inches apart. Her gaze shifts from my eyes down to my lips and, for the first time tonight, I feel the first kiss pressure. There\u2019s something about her lips that makes me want to kiss them when she\u2019s in such close proximity. I remind myself that even though I\u2019m just \u201cWill\u201d tonight, I\u2019ve got at least one student who is more than likely intermittently spying on us.</p><p>The quiet moment between us causes her to blush and she looks back to the stage, almost as if she could sense that I was struggling with the desire to kiss her. I reach over and take her hand in mine and bring it under the table, placing it on my leg. I look down at it as I slowly stroke her fingers. I stroke up her wrist and want so bad to keep trailing up her arm, straight to her lips . . . but I don\u2019t. I circle back down to her fingertips, wishing more than anything that we weren\u2019t in public right now. I don\u2019t know what it is about her that completely enthralls me. I also don\u2019t know what it is with her that gets me to spout things I would normally be more reserved about.</p><p>\u201cLake?\u201d I continue tracing up and over her hand with my fingertips. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about you . . . but I like you.\u201d I interlock her fingers with mine and turn my attention toward the stage so she doesn\u2019t think I expect a response from her. I smile when I see her grab for her glass and quickly down her chocolate milk. She definitely feels it, too.</p><p>When the sac walks up to the stage, Lake\u2019s whole demeanor changes. It\u2019s almost as if she forgets I\u2019m even here. She leans forward attentively when the woman begins her piece and she doesn\u2019t remove her attention from the performer the entire time. I\u2019m so drawn to the emotion in Lake\u2019s expression that I can\u2019t take my eyes off her. As I watch her, I attempt to decipher the reason behind the intense connection I feel with her. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve spent that much time together. Hell, I hardly even know her. I still don\u2019t even know what her major is, what her middle name is, much less her birthday. Deep down, I know none of it matters. The only thing that matters right now is this moment, and this moment is definitely my sweet for the day.</p><p>As soon as the sac is finished with her poem, Lake pulls her hand from mine and wipes tears from her eyes. I put my arm around her and pull her to me. She accepts my embrace and rests her head against my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I ask. I rest my chin on top of her head and stroke her hair, taking in another wave of vanilla. I\u2019m beginning to love the smell of vanilla almost as much as southern accents.</p><p>\u201cThat was unbelievable,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Unbelievable. That was the exact word I used to describe it to my father the first time I saw it.</p><p>I fight the urge to lift her chin and pull her lips to mine, knowing I should wait until we\u2019re in private. The need is so overwhelming, though; my heart is at war with my conscience. I lean forward and press my lips against her forehead and close my eyes. It\u2019ll have to do for now.</p><p>We sit in the same embrace as several more poets perform. She laughs, she cries, she sighs, she aches, and she feels every single piece performed. By the time the final poet for round one comes onto the stage, it\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s too late. I was hoping to put everything out in the open between us before things became more serious. Little did I know it would happen this fast. I\u2019m too far-gone. There\u2019s no way I can stop myself from falling for this girl now.</p><p>I keep my attention on the stage, but I can\u2019t help but watch Lake out of the corner of my eye as she watches the performer prepare at the microphone. She\u2019s holding her breath again as he steps up to the microphone.</p><p>\u201cThis poem is called A Very Long Poem,\u201d the performer says.

She begins clapping with the rest of the crowd, completely engrossed in the atmosphere. When she finally relaxes against me again, I take her hand in mine. We\u2019ve been here close to two hours now and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s tired, based on the week she\u2019s had. Besides, I never stay for all of the performances, since I have work on Fridays.</p><p>I begin to stand up to lead her out of the booth when the emcee makes one last appeal for performers. She turns to me and I can see her thoughts written clearly across her face.</p><p>\u201cWill, you can\u2019t bring me here and not perform. Please do one? Please, please, please?\u201d</p><p>I had no intention of doing a poem tonight. At all. But oh, my God\u2014that look in her eyes. She\u2019s really going to make me do this, I can already tell. There\u2019s no way I can say no to those eyes. I lean my head against the back of the booth and laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Lake. Like I said, I don\u2019t really have anything new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo something old then,\u201d she suggests. \u201cOr do all these people make you nervous?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She has no idea how often I perform and how natural it feels to me now. It\u2019s almost as natural as breathing. I haven\u2019t been nervous about taking the stage since the first time I took it five years ago.</p><p>Until now, anyway.</p><p>I lean in closer and look her directly in the eyes. \u201cNot all of them. Just one of them.\u201d</p><p>Our faces are so incredibly close right now; it would be so easy to do it. Just a couple more inches and I could taste her. Her smile fades and she bites her bottom lip as her gaze slowly drops to my mouth again. I can tell by the look in her eyes that she wants me to kiss her just as much. The unfamiliar nerves that have occupied my stomach have now multiplied and I\u2019m quickly losing my self-control. As soon as I start to lean in, she clasps her hands under her chin and resumes her plea.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I had forgotten she even asked me to perform. I pull back and laugh. \u201cYou already are.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t pull her hands away from her chin and she\u2019s looking up at me with the most adorable expression. An expression I already know I\u2019ll never be able to say no to. \u201cAll right, all right,\u201d I say, easily giving in. \u201cBut I\u2019m warning you, you asked.\u201d</p><p>I pull my wallet out of my pocket and take the money out, holding it up in the air. \u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d</p><p>When the emcee recognizes me, I slide out of the booth and begin making my way to the stage. I\u2019m not prepared for this at all. Why did I not think she would ask me to perform? I should have written something new. I\u2019ll just do my \u201cgo-to\u201d piece about teaching. It\u2019s easy enough. Besides, I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve discussed my profession with her; this might be a fun way to do it.</p> <p>I reach the stage and adjust the microphone, then look out over the audience. When we lock eyes, she perches her elbows on the table and rests her chin in her hands. She waves her flirty wave at me as her smile spreads across her face. The way she looks at me sends a pang of guilt straight to my heart. She\u2019s looking at me right now in the same way that I\u2019ve been looking at her.</p><p>With hope.</p><p>It hits me with that look that I shouldn\u2019t waste this opportunity on a poem about my profession. This is my opportunity to put it all out there . . . to use my performance as a way to let her know who I really am. If her feelings for me are half what mine already are for her, then she deserves to know what she may be getting herself into.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of your piece tonight, Will?\u201d</p><p>Without breaking our gaze, I look straight into her eyes from up on the stage and reply, \u201cDeath.\u201d</p><p>The emcee exits the stage and I take a deep breath, preparing to say the words that will either make or break the possibility of a future with her.</p> <p>Death. The only thing inevitable in life.</p><p>People don\u2019t like to talk about death because</p><p>it makes them sad.</p><p>They don\u2019t want to imagine how life will go on without them,</p><p>all the people they love will briefly grieve</p><p>but continue to breathe.</p><p>They don\u2019t want to imagine how life will go on without them,</p><p>Their children will still grow</p> <p>Get married</p><p>Get old . . .</p><p>They don\u2019t want to imagine how life will continue to go on without them,</p><p>Their material things will be sold</p><p>Their medical files stamped \u201cclosed\u201d</p><p>Their name becoming a memory to everyone they know.</p><p>They don\u2019t want to imagine how life will go on without them, so instead of accepting it head-on, they avoid the subject altogether,</p><p>hoping and praying it will somehow . . .</p><p>pass them by.</p><p>Forget about them,</p><p>moving on to the next one in line.</p><p>No, they didn\u2019t want to imagine how life would continue to go on . . .</p><p>without them.</p><p>But death</p><p>didn\u2019t</p><p>forget.</p><p>Instead they were met head-on by death,</p><p>disguised as an eighteen-wheeler</p><p>behind a cloud of fog.</p><p>No.</p><p>Death didn\u2019t forget about them.</p><p>If they only had been prepared, accepted the inevitable, laid out their plans, understood that it wasn\u2019t just their lives at hand.</p><p>I may have legally been considered an adult at the age of nineteen, but I still felt very much</p><p>of just nineteen.</p><p>Unprepared</p><p>and overwhelmed</p><p>to suddenly have the entire life of a seven-year-old</p><p>In my realm.</p><p>Death. The only thing inevitable in life.</p><p>I TAKE A step away from the microphone, feeling even more nervous than when I began. I completely laid it all out there. My whole life, condensed into a one-minute poem.</p><p>When I step off the stage and make my way to our booth, she\u2019s wiping tears from her eyes with the back of her hand. I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019s thinking, so I walk slowly in order to give her a moment to absorb my words.</p><p>When I slide into the booth she looks sad, so I smile at her and try to break the tension. \u201cI warned you,\u201d I say as I reach for my drink. She doesn\u2019t respond, so I\u2019m not sure what to say at this point. I become uncomfortable, thinking maybe this wasn\u2019t the best way to go about telling her my life story. I guess I sort of put her on the spot, too. I certainly hope she doesn\u2019t feel like she has to tell me how sorry she feels for me. I hate pity more than anything.</p><p>Just when I start to regret my choice in performance, she reaches out and takes my free hand in hers. She touches me so gently\u2014it\u2019s like she\u2019s telling me what she\u2019s thinking without even speaking. I set my drink down on the table and turn to face her. When I look into her eyes, it\u2019s not pity I see at all.</p><p>She\u2019s still looking at me with hope in her eyes.</p><p>This girl just became privy to everything I\u2019ve been scared to tell her about my life. The death of my parents, the anger I held toward them, the amount of responsibility I now face, the fact that I\u2019m all Caulder has\u2014and she\u2019s still looking at me with hope in her tear-filled eyes. I reach to her face and wipe away a tear, then lightly trace my thumb across the wet trail running down her cheek. She places her hand on top of mine and slowly pulls it to her mouth. She presses her lips into the center of my palm without breaking her gaze from mine, causing my heart to catch in my throat. She just somehow managed to convey every single thought and emotion she\u2019s feeling through this one simple gesture.</p><p>I suddenly don\u2019t care where we are or who might be watching us. I have to kiss her. I have to.</p><p>I take her face in my hands and lean in closer, ignoring the part of my conscience that is screaming for me to wait. She closes her eyes, inviting me in. I hesitate, but as soon as I feel her breath fall on my lips, I can\u2019t hold back. I close the gap between us, lightly pressing my lips against her bottom lip. It\u2019s even softer than it looks. Somehow the background noise has completely faded and all I can hear is the sound of my own heartbeat, pulsating throughout my entire body. I slowly move my lips up to her top lip, but as soon as I feel her mouth begin to part, I reluctantly pull away. As much as I want to kiss her with everything I\u2019ve got, I\u2019m also vaguely aware that we\u2019re in public, and I\u2019ve got at least two students here tonight. I decide to save the better kiss for later, because if we do this right now, I know I won\u2019t want to stop.</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d I whisper, mustering up all the self-control I\u2019ve got. I stroke her cheek with my thumb and she smiles at me in understanding. Still holding her face in my hands, I close my eyes again and press my lips against her cheek. She sucks in a breath as I release my hold and slide my hands down her arms, trying to remember how to breathe again. I\u2019m unable to pull away from her, so I press my forehead against hers and open my eyes. It\u2019s in this moment that I know she\u2019s feeling exactly what I\u2019m feeling. I can see it in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she exhales.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>We hold each other\u2019s stare for a few more seconds. When the emcee begins announcing the qualifiers for round two I\u2019m quickly brought back to reality. There is no way I can sit here any longer without pulling her onto my lap and kissing the hell out of her. I figure in order to avoid that; my best course of action would be to just leave.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I whisper. I take her hand as we slide out of the booth and I lead her to the exit.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to stay?\u201d she says after we walk outside.</p><p>\u201cLake, you\u2019ve been moving and unpacking for days. You need sleep.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I say it, she yawns. \u201cSleep does sound good.\u201d</p><p>When we reach the car I open the door for her, but before she gets in, I wrap my arms around her and pull her to me. It\u2019s a movement that occurs so quickly, I don\u2019t even think about it beforehand. Why does she have that effect on me? It\u2019s like my conscience just goes out the window when she\u2019s around.</p><p>As much as I know I should let go before it gets awkward, I can\u2019t. She returns my embrace, then rests her head against my chest and sighs. We stand there, neither one of us speaking or moving, for several minutes. There\u2019s not a single kiss passed between us, not a single graze of my hand across her skin, not a single word spoken . . . yet somehow, this is the most intimate moment I\u2019ve ever shared with anyone.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to let go, but as soon as I look up and see Gavin and Eddie exiting the club, I pull back and motion for her to climb inside. Now is not the time for an Eddie introduction.</p><p>As we\u2019re pulling out of the parking lot, she leans her head against the window and sighs.</p><p>\u201cWill? Thank you for this.\u201d</p><p>I reach over and take her hand in mine. All I really want to do is thank her, but I don\u2019t respond. I had a lot of hope for tonight, but she far exceeded my expectations. She\u2019s exhausted and I can tell she\u2019s about to fall asleep. She closes her eyes and I drive home in silence and let her sleep.</p><p>When I pull into her driveway, I expect her to wake up, but she doesn\u2019t. I kill the engine and reach over to shake her awake, but the peacefulness in her features stops me. I watch her sleep as I try to sift through everything I\u2019ve been feeling. How can I possibly feel like I care about someone after only knowing her a matter of days?</p><p>I loved Vaughn, but I can honestly say we never connected this way. On this sort of emotional level, anyway. I can\u2019t remember feeling this way since . . . well, ever. It\u2019s new. It\u2019s scary. It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s nerve-racking. It\u2019s calming. It\u2019s every single emotion I\u2019ve ever felt balled up into an intense urge to grab hold of her and never let go.</p><p>I lean closer and press my lips against her forehead while she sleeps. \u201cThank you for this,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>When I walk around and open her door, she wakes up. I help her out of the car and we\u2019re both silent as we make our way to her front door, hand in hand. Before she goes inside, I pull her to me again. She rests her head against my chest and we resume the same embrace from outside the club. I can\u2019t help but wonder if this feels as natural to her as it does to me.</p><p>\u201cJust think,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be gone three whole days. That\u2019s the same length of time I\u2019ve known you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and squeeze her tighter. \u201cThis will be the longest three days of my life.\u201d We continue to hold on to each other, neither of us wanting to let go, because maybe we realize it really will be the longest three days of our lives. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I notice her glance toward the window like she\u2019s worried someone\u2019s watching us. As much as I want to give in to the insatiable need I have to kiss her, I give her a quick peck on the cheek, instead. I release her and slowly walk back to my car. When her fingers release from mine, her arm drops to her side and she smiles a smile that quickly causes me to regret not kissing her better. As soon as I\u2019m in my car, I conclude that there is absolutely no way I\u2019ll be able to sleep tonight if I don\u2019t rectify this.</p><p>I roll down my window. \u201cLake, I\u2019ve got a pretty long drive home. How about one for the road?\u201d</p><p>She laughs, then walks to my car and leans through the window. I slip my hand behind her head and pull her to me. The second our lips meet, I\u2019m a goner. She parts her lips and at first, our kiss is slow and sweet. She reaches through the window and runs her hands through my hair, pulling me closer, and it completely drives me insane. My mouth becomes more urgent against hers and for a brief second, I contemplate canceling my trip this weekend. Now that I\u2019ve finally tasted her, I know I won\u2019t be able to go three days without it. Her lips are everything I\u2019ve been imagining they would be. The door between us is pure torture. I want to pull her through the window and onto my lap.</p><p>We continue kissing until we get to a point where we both realize that either she needs to climb inside the car with me, or we need to come to a halt. We simultaneously slow down and eventually stop, but neither of us pulls away.</p> <p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I whisper against her lips. \u201cIt gets better every time.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and nods in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in three days. You be careful driving home tonight.\u201d She presses her lips against mine again, then pulls away.</p><p>I regretfully back out of the driveway and into my own, wishing more than anything I wasn\u2019t about to leave town for the next three days. When I exit my car she\u2019s making her way back up her driveway. I watch as she gathers her hair and pulls it up in a knot, securing it with a band while she nears her front door. Her hair looks good like that. It looked great down, too. As I\u2019m admiring the view, it dawns on me that I never even complimented her on how great she looked tonight.</p><p>\u201cLake!\u201d I yell. She turns around and I jog back across the street to her. \u201cI forgot to tell you something.\u201d I wrap my arms around her and whisper into her hair, \u201cYou look beautiful tonight.\u201d I kiss her on top of the head, then release her and walk back to my house. When I reach my door, I turn around and she\u2019s still standing in the same spot watching me. I smile at her and go inside, then immediately head straight for the window. When I pull back the curtain, I see her twirl back toward her house and practically skip inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Maya says.</p> <p>Her voice startles me and I snatch the curtain shut and turn around. \u201cNothing.\u201d I take my jacket off and step on the heel of my shoe to ease my foot out of it. \u201cThanks, Maya. You want to watch him again next Thursday?\u201d</p><p>She stands up and heads to the front door. \u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not watching that weird one again.\u201d She shuts the door behind her and I throw myself on the couch and sigh. This was by far the best date I\u2019ve ever been on, and I have a feeling they\u2019re only going to get better.</p><p>6.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>LAKE SMILES, THINKING back on how blissfully happy we both were after that date. \u201cI had never had a night like that in my life,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything about it was perfect, from beginning to end. Even the grilled cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything except the fact that I failed to mention my occupation.\u201d</p> <p>She frowns. \u201cWell, yeah. That part sucked.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cSucked is an understatement for how I felt in that hallway,\u201d I say. \u201cBut, we got through it. As tough as it was, look at us now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she says, pressing her fingers to my lips. \u201cDon\u2019t jump ahead. Start from where you left off. I want to know what you were thinking when you saw me in the hallway that day. My god, you were so pissed at me,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cPissed at you? Lake, you thought I was mad at you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs.</p><p>\u201cNo, babe. I was anything but pissed at you.\u201d</p><p>oh, shit</p><p>MY THREE-DAY WEEKEND. What can I say about my three-day weekend other than it was the longest, most treacherous three days of my entire life. I was distracted the entire time thinking about her. I could have kicked myself for not getting her phone number before I left; at least we could have texted. My grandfather apparently noticed the difference in my attention span during the course of the visit. Before we left their house last night, he pulled me aside and said, \u201cSo? Who is she?\u201d</p> <p>Of course I played dumb and denied having met someone. What would he think if he knew I went on one date with this girl, and she already had me in a stupor? He laughed when I denied it and he squeezed my shoulder. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet her,\u201d he said.</p><p>I usually dread Monday mornings, but there\u2019s a different air about today. Probably because I know I\u2019ll get to see her after work today. I slide the note under the windshield wiper of her Jeep, then head back across the street to my car. As soon as I place my fingers on the door handle, I have second thoughts. I\u2019m being way too forward. Who says, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you\u201d in a note after one date? The last thing I want to do is scare her off. I walk back to her Jeep and lift the wiper blade to remove the note from her windshield.</p><p>\u201cLeave it.\u201d</p><p>I spin around and Julia is standing in their entryway, holding a cup of coffee between her hands. I look down at the note, then back at the Jeep, then back at Julia, not really knowing what to say.</p><p>\u201cYou should leave it,\u201d she says, pointing to the note in my hand. \u201cShe\u2019ll like it.\u201d She smiles and heads back into the house, leaving me completely and utterly embarrassed in her driveway. I place the note back under the windshield wiper and make my way back across the street, hoping Julia is right.</p><p>\u201cI TOLD YOU last week he was coming,\u201d Mrs. Alex says in a defensive tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, you said he called about coming. You never told me it was today.\u201d</p><p>She turns to her computer and begins typing. \u201cWell, I\u2019m telling you now. He\u2019ll be here at eleven o\u2019clock to observe your fourth-period class.\u201d She reaches to her printer and removes a freshly printed form. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll have a new student in your next class. I just registered her this morning. Here\u2019s her information.\u201d She hands me the form and smiles. I roll my eyes and shove the form into my satchel, suddenly dreading the remainder of the day.</p><p>I walk in a hurry to third period considering I\u2019m already five minutes late. I look down at my watch and groan. An eleven o\u2019clock observation? That\u2019s just an hour from now. All I have scheduled for my classes today are section tests. I wasn\u2019t prepared to lecture at all, much less in front of my faculty advisor. I\u2019ll just have to use this period to prepare something last-minute.</p><p>God, could this day get any worse?</p><p>When I round the corner to Hall D, the day somehow gets one hundred percent better as soon as I lay eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cLake?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s got her hands in her hair, pulling it up into a knot again. She spins around and her eyes widen when she sees me. She pulls a sheet of paper from between her lips and smiles, then immediately wraps her arms around my neck.</p><p>\u201cWill! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I return her hug, but the sheet of paper that just flashed in front of my face has left my entire body feeling like an immobile solid block of concrete.</p><p>She\u2019s holding a schedule.</p><p>I suddenly can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>She\u2019s holding a class schedule.</p><p>This can\u2019t be good.</p><p>Mrs. Alex said something about enrolling a new student.</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>I immediately begin to internally panic. I wrap my fingers around her wrists and pull her arms away from my neck before someone sees us. Please let me be wrong. Please.</p><p>\u201cLake,\u201d I say, shaking my head\u2014trying to make sense of this. \u201cWhere . . . what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She lets out a frustrated sigh and thrusts the schedule into my chest. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find this stupid elective but I\u2019m lost,\u201d she whines. \u201cHelp me!\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. What the hell have I done?</p><p>I take a step back against the wall, attempting to give myself space to think. Space to breathe.</p><p>\u201cLake, no . . .\u201d I say. I hand her back the schedule without even looking at it. There\u2019s no need to look at it. I know exactly where her \u201cstupid elective\u201d is. I can\u2019t seem to process a coherent thought while looking at her, so I turn around and clasp my hands behind my head.</p><p>She\u2019s a student?</p><p>I\u2019m her teacher?</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>I close my eyes and think back to the past week. Who have I told? Who saw us together? Gavin. Shit. There\u2019s no telling who else may have been at Club N9NE. And Lake! She\u2019s about to figure this out any second. What if she thinks I was trying to hide this from her? She could go straight to administration and end my career.</p><p>As soon as the thought crosses my mind, she picks up her backpack and begins to storm off. I reach out and pull her to a stop. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s pissed and I hope her intentions aren\u2019t to report me.</p><p>She rolls her eyes and sighs. \u201cI get it, Will,\u201d she says. \u201cI get it. I\u2019ll leave you alone before your girlfriend sees us.\u201d She pulls her arm out of my grasp and turns away from me.</p><p>\u201cGirlfr\u2014no. No, Lake. I don\u2019t think you do get it.\u201d I wait for her to process what\u2019s happening. I would just come out and say it, but I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I could say it out loud if I wanted to.</p><p>The sound of footsteps closing in on us diverts her attention away from me. Javier suddenly rounds the corner and comes to a quick stop when he sees me in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cOh, man, I thought I was late,\u201d he says.</p><p>If Lake hasn\u2019t figured it all out by now, she\u2019s about to.</p><p>\u201cYou are late, Javier,\u201d I reply. I open the door to my classroom and wave him inside. \u201cJavi, I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes. Let the class know they have five minutes to review before the exam.\u201d I slowly close the door behind me and look down at the floor. I can\u2019t look at her. I don\u2019t think my heart can take what she\u2019s about to feel. There\u2019s a brief moment of silence before she quietly gasps. I raise my eyes to hers and the disappointment on her face tears my heart in two. She gets it now.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d she whispers painfully. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me . . .\u201d</p><p>Her voice is weak and she tilts her head slightly to the side, slowly shaking her head back and forth. She isn\u2019t angry. She\u2019s hurt. I\u2019d almost rather her be pissed right now than feel the way she\u2019s feeling. I look up at the ceiling and rub my hands over my face in an attempt not to punch the damn wall. How could I be so stupid? Why wasn\u2019t my profession the first thing I thought to share with her? Why did I not see this as a possibility? I continue to pace, hoping beyond all hope that I\u2019m the one not getting it. When I reach the lockers in front of me, I tap my head against them, silently cursing myself. I\u2019ve really screwed it up this time. For both of us. I drop my hands and reluctantly roll around to face her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did I not see this? You\u2019re still in high school?\u201d</p><p>She backs up to the wall behind her and leans against it for support. \u201cMe?\u201d she says in defense. \u201cHow did the fact that you\u2019re a teacher not come up? How are you a teacher? You\u2019re only twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>I realize I\u2019m going to have to answer a lot of her questions. My teaching situation isn\u2019t particularly normal, so I understand her confusion. But we can\u2019t do this here. Not right now.</p><p>\u201cLayken, listen.\u201d I realize when her name falls off my tongue that I didn\u2019t call her \u201cLake.\u201d I guess that\u2019s probably best at this point. \u201cThere has apparently been a huge misunderstanding between the two of us.\u201d I look away from her when I finish my sentence. An overwhelming feeling of guilt overcomes me when I look into her eyes, so I just don\u2019t. \u201cWe need to talk about this, but now is definitely not the right time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she whispers. It sounds like she\u2019s attempting not to cry. I couldn\u2019t take it if she cried.</p><p>The door to my classroom opens and Eddie walks out into the hall, looking directly at Lake. \u201cLayken, I was just coming to look for you,\u201d she says. \u201cI saved you a seat.\u201d She looks at me, then back at Lake, leaving no traces or hint that she\u2019s put two and two together. Good. That just leaves Gavin to contend with. \u201cOh, sorry, Mr. Cooper. I didn\u2019t know you were out here.\u201d</p><p>I stand straight and walk toward the classroom door. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Eddie. I was just going over Layken\u2019s schedule with her.\u201d I pull the door open wider and wait for Lake and Eddie to make their way into the room. I\u2019m thankful it\u2019s a test day. There\u2019s no way I would be able to lecture right now.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the hottie?\u201d Javier asks when Lake slides into her seat.</p><p>\u201cShut it, Javi!\u201d I snap. I am so not in the mood for his smart-ass comments right now. I reach over and grab the stack of tests.</p> <p>\u201cChill out, Mr. Cooper. I was paying her a compliment.\u201d He leans back in his chair and gives Lake a slow, full-body glance that makes my blood boil. \u201cShe\u2019s hot. Look at her.\u201d</p><p>I point to the classroom door. \u201cJavi, get out!\u201d</p><p>He snaps his focus back to me. \u201cMr. Cooper! Jeez! What\u2019s with the temp? Like I said, I was just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, get out! You will not disrespect women in my classroom!\u201d</p><p>He snatches his books off his desk. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go disrespect them in the hallway!\u201d</p><p>After the door shuts behind him, I cringe at my own behavior. I\u2019ve never lost my temper in a classroom before. I look back at the students and everyone is watching Lake, waiting on some sort of reaction from her. Everyone except Gavin. His eyes are burrowing a hole right through me. I give him a slight nod, letting him know that I acknowledge the fact that we obviously have a lot to discuss. For right now, though, it\u2019s back to the task at hand.</p> <p>\u201cClass, we have a new student. This is Layken Cohen,\u201d I say, quickly wanting to brush what just happened under the rug. \u201cReview is over. Put up your notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have her introduce herself?\u201d Eddie asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to that another time,\u201d I say, holding up the papers. \u201cTests.\u201d</p><p>I begin passing out the tests. When I reach Gavin\u2019s desk, he looks up at me inquisitively. \u201cLunch,\u201d I whisper, letting him know I\u2019ll explain everything then. He nods and takes his test, finally breaking eye contact.</p><p>When I pass out all but one of the tests, I reluctantly walk closer to her desk. \u201cLake,\u201d I say. I quickly clear my throat and correct myself. \u201cLayken, if you have something else to work on, feel free. The class is completing a chapter test.\u201d</p><p>She straightens up in her desk and looks down at her hands. \u201cI\u2019d rather just take the test,\u201d she says quietly. I place the paper on her desk, then make my way back to my seat.</p><p>I spend the rest of the hour grading papers from the first two classes. I occasionally catch myself peeking in her direction, trying hard not to stare. She just keeps erasing and rewriting answers over and over. I don\u2019t know why she chose to take the test; she hasn\u2019t been here for any of the lectures. I break my gaze from her paper and look up. Gavin is glaring at me again, so I dart my eyes down at my watch right when the dismissal bell rings. Everyone quickly files to the front of the room and places their papers on my desk.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you get your lunch switched?\u201d Eddie asks Lake.</p> <p>I watch as Eddie and Lake converse about her schedule and I\u2019m secretly relieved that Lake has already found a friend. I\u2019m not so sure I like that it\u2019s Eddie, though. I don\u2019t have a problem with Eddie. It\u2019s just that Gavin knows way too much now and I\u2019m not sure if he would tell Eddie or not. I hope not. I glance back down to my desk as soon as Eddie begins to walk away from Lake. Rather than exiting the classroom, she heads straight to my desk. I look up at her and she removes something from her purse. She shakes a few mints into her hand and lays them on my desk.</p><p>\u201cAltoids,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just making assumptions here, but I\u2019ve heard Altoids work wonders on hangovers.\u201d She pushes the mints toward me and walks away.</p><p>I stare at the mints, unnerved that she assumed I have a hangover. I must not be as good at hiding my emotions as I thought I was. I\u2019m disappointed in myself. Disappointed I lost my temper, disappointed I didn\u2019t use my head when it came to the whole situation with Lake, disappointed that I now have this huge dilemma facing me. I\u2019m still staring at the mints when Lake walks to the desk and places her paper on top of the pile.</p><p>\u201cIs my mood that obvious?\u201d I say rhetorically. She takes two of the mints and walks out of the room without saying a word. I sigh and lean back in the chair, kicking my feet up on the desk. This is by far the second-worst day of my life.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait that long, man.\u201d Gavin walks back into the room and closes the door behind him. He throws his backpack on the desk in front of me, then scoots it closer and climbs into it. \u201cWhat the hell, Will? What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and shrug my shoulders. I\u2019m not ready to talk about this right now, but I do owe him an explanation. I bring my feet down from the desk and rest my head in my hands, rubbing my temples with my fingers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughs incredulously. \u201cDidn\u2019t know? How the hell could you not know?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and sigh. He\u2019s right. How did we not know? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It just . . . it never came up,\u201d I say. \u201cI was out of town all weekend. We haven\u2019t spoken since our date Thursday. It just . . . somehow it never came up.\u201d I shake my head, sorting through my thoughts as they\u2019re flowing from my lips. I\u2019m a jumbled mess.</p><p>\u201cSo you just found out she\u2019s a student? Like, just now?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have sex with her, did you?\u201d</p><p>His question takes a moment to register. He takes my silence as an admission of guilt and he leans forward and whispers, \u201cYou had sex with her, didn\u2019t you? You\u2019re gonna get fired, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t have sex with her!\u201d I snap.</p><p>He continues to glare at me, attempting to analyze my demeanor. \u201cThen why are you so upset? If you didn\u2019t have sex with her, you can\u2019t really get in trouble. I doubt she\u2019ll report it if all you did was kiss her. Is that what you\u2019re worried about? That she\u2019ll report you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, because that\u2019s not at all what I\u2019m worried about. I could see in Lake\u2019s demeanor that the thought of reporting me never even crossed her mind. She was upset, but not with me.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I know she won\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d I run my hand across my forehead and sigh. I have no idea how to handle this. No idea. \u201cShit,\u201d I say, exasperated. \u201cI just need to think, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>I run my fingers through my hair and clasp my hands behind my head. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this confused and overwhelmed in my life. Everything I\u2019ve worked for could possibly be going to hell today simply because of my stupidity. I\u2019ve got three months left until graduation, and there\u2019s a good chance if this gets out, I\u2019ve just ruined my entire career.</p><p>What confuses me though is the fact that it\u2019s not my career that has me in a jumbled mess right now. It\u2019s her. These emotions are a direct result of her. The main reason why I\u2019m so upset right now is that it feels like I somehow just broke her heart.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Gavin says quietly. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>I look up at him, confused by his reaction. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He stands up and points to me. \u201cYou like her,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re so upset. You already fell for her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d He grabs his backpack and starts walking backward toward the door, shaking his head. I don\u2019t even bother denying it. He saw the way I was looking at her the other night.</p><p>When the classroom door opens and several students begin to file in, he walks back to my desk and whispers, \u201cEddie doesn\u2019t know anything. I didn\u2019t recognize anyone else at the slam, so don\u2019t worry about that part of it. You just need to figure out what you need to do.\u201d He turns toward the classroom door and exits . . . just as my faculty advisor enters.</p><p>Shit!</p><p>IF THERE\u2019S ONE thing I\u2019ve learned how to do well in my life, it\u2019s adapt.</p><p>I somehow made it through the observation unscathed and somehow made it to the end of last period without bashing my fists into a wall. Whether or not I\u2019ll make it through the rest of the day just knowing I\u2019m right across the street from her is still up in the air.</p><p>When Caulder and I pull into the driveway, she\u2019s sitting in her Jeep. She\u2019s got her arm over her eyes and it looks like she\u2019s crying.</p><p>\u201cCan I go to Kel\u2019s?\u201d Caulder asks when he climbs out of the car.</p><p>I nod. I leave my things in the car and shut my door, then slowly make my way across the street. When I reach the back of her car, I pause to gather my thoughts. I know what needs to be done, but knowing something and accepting it are two completely different things. I asked myself over and over today what my parents would have done in this situation. What would most people do in this situation? Of course, the answer is obviously to do the right thing. The responsible thing. I mean, we went on one date. Who would quit a job over one date?</p><p>This shouldn\u2019t be this hard. Why is this so hard?</p><p>I walk closer and lightly tap on her passenger window. She jerks up and flips the visor down and looks in the mirror, attempting to wipe away traces of her heartache. When the door unlocks, I open it and take a seat. I shut the door behind me and adjust the seat, then prop my foot on the dash. My gaze falls to the note that I left under her wiper this morning. It\u2019s unfolded, lying on her console. When I wrote the words, see you at four o\u2019clock, this isn\u2019t how I envisioned four o\u2019clock at all. I glance up at her and she\u2019s avoiding looking at me. Just seeing her causes my words to catch in my throat. I have no idea what to say. I have no idea where her head is right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d I finally ask.</p><p>She slowly turns toward me and pulls her leg up into the seat. She wraps her arms around it and rests her chin on top of her knee. I\u2019ve never wanted to be a knee so bad in my entire life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused as hell, Will. I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, I don\u2019t know what to think, either. God, I\u2019m such an asshole. How could I have let this happen? I sigh and look out the passenger window. I can\u2019t for the life of me hold my composure if I keep looking into those eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault,\u201d she says. \u201cIn order for there to be fault, there has to be some sort of conscious decision. You didn\u2019t know, Will.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know. But it\u2019s my own damn fault that I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, Lake,\u201d I say, turning to face her. \u201cI should have known. I\u2019m in an occupation that doesn\u2019t just require ethics inside the classroom; they apply to all aspects of my life. I wasn\u2019t aware because I wasn\u2019t doing my job. When you told me you were eighteen, I just assumed you were in college.\u201d</p><p>She looks away and whispers, \u201cI\u2019ve only been eighteen for two weeks.\u201d</p> <p>That sentence. If that sentence could have just been spoken a few days ago, this entire situation would have been avoided. Why the hell didn\u2019t I just ask her when her birthday was? I close my eyes and rest my head against the seat, preparing to explain my unique situation to her. I want her to have a better understanding of why this can\u2019t work between us.</p><p>\u201cI student teach,\u201d I say. \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter my parents died, I doubled up on all my classes. I have enough credits to graduate a semester early. Since the school was so shorthanded, they offered me a one-year contract. I have three months left of student teaching. After that I\u2019m under contract through June of next year.\u201d I look over at her and her eyes are closed. She\u2019s shaking her head ever so slightly like she doesn\u2019t comprehend what I\u2019m saying, or she just doesn\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>\u201cLake, I need this job. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been working toward for three years. We\u2019re broke. My parents left me with a mound of debt and now college tuition. I can\u2019t quit now.\u201d</p><p>She darts her eyes toward me, almost like I\u2019ve insulted her.</p> <p>\u201cWill, I understand. I\u2019d never ask you to jeopardize your career. You\u2019ve worked hard. It would be stupid if you threw that away for someone you\u2019ve only known for three days.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but I would. If you would just ask me to . . . I would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you would ask me that. I just want you to understand where I\u2019m coming from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to assume we even have anything worth risking.\u201d</p><p>She can deny it all she wants, but whatever it is that I\u2019m feeling, I know she\u2019s feeling it, too. I can see it in her eyes. \u201cWe both know it\u2019s more than that.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words leave my lips, I immediately regret them. This girl is my student. S-T-U-D-E-N-T! I\u2019ve got to get this through my head.</p><p>We\u2019re both silent. The lack of conversation only invites the emotions we\u2019ve been trying to suppress. She begins to cry, and despite the fact that my conscience is screaming at me, I can\u2019t help but console her. I pull her to me and she buries her face in my shirt. I want so bad to push the thought out of my head that this is the last time I\u2019m going to hold her like this\u2014but I know it\u2019s true. I know once we separate, it\u2019s over. There\u2019s no way I can continue to be around her with the way she consumes my every thought. I know, deep down, that this is good-bye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whisper into her hair. \u201cI wish there was something I could do to change things. I have to do this right for Caulder. I\u2019m not sure where we go from here, or how we\u2019ll transition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTransition?\u201d she says. She brings her eyes to meet mine and they\u2019re full of panic. \u201cBut\u2014what if you talk to the school? Tell them we didn\u2019t know. Ask them what our options are.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t realize it, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve been trying to figure out for the last five hours. I\u2019ve been thinking of any and all possible scenarios to change the outcome for us. There just isn\u2019t one.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Lake. It won\u2019t work. It can\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>She pulls apart from me when Kel and Caulder come out of her house. I reluctantly release my hold from around her, knowing it\u2019s the last time I\u2019ll hold her. This is more than likely the last time we\u2019ll have a conversation outside school. In order for me to do the right thing, I know that letting her go completely is the only way. I need to distance myself from her.</p><p>\u201cLayken?\u201d I say hesitantly. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I need to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes like she knows it\u2019s something bad. She doesn\u2019t respond, though. She just waits for me to continue.</p><p>\u201cI need you to go to administration tomorrow. I want you to withdraw from my class. I don\u2019t think we should be around each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she says, turning to face me. The hurt in her voice is exactly what I was afraid I would hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to do this because I want to avoid you. I\u2019m asking you this because what we have isn\u2019t appropriate. We have to separate ourselves.\u201d</p><p>The hurt in her eyes is replaced by a look of incredulity. \u201cNot appropriate?\u201d she says, disbelievingly. \u201cSeparate ourselves? You live across the street from me!\u201d</p><p>The hurt in her voice, the anger in her expression, the heartache in her eyes; it\u2019s too much. Seeing her hurt like this and not being able to console her is unbearable. If I don\u2019t get out of this car right now, my hands will be tangled in her hair and my lips will be meshed with hers in a matter of seconds. I swing open the door and get out.</p><p>I just need to breathe.</p><p>She opens her door, too, and looks at me over the hood of her car. \u201cWe\u2019re both mature enough to know what\u2019s appropriate, Will. You\u2019re the only person I know here. Please don\u2019t ask me to act like I don\u2019t even know you,\u201d she pleads.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lake. You aren\u2019t being fair. I can\u2019t do this. We can\u2019t just be friends. It\u2019s the only choice we have.\u201d</p><p>She has no idea how close I came to not being her friend just now. There\u2019s no possible way I can be around this girl and continue to do the right thing. I\u2019m not that strong.</p><p>She opens her car door and reaches inside to grab her things. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s either all or nothing, right? And since it obviously can\u2019t be all!\u201d She slams the door and walks toward her house. She stops short and kicks over the gnome with the broken red hat. \u201cYou\u2019ll be rid of me by third period tomorrow!\u201d She slams her front door, leaving me a heartbroken, emotional wreck in her driveway.</p><p>The last thing I wanted out of this was to upset her even more. I pound my fists against the top of her Jeep, pissed at myself for putting her in this situation to begin with. \u201cDammit!\u201d I yell. I spin and turn to head home, but instead come face to face with Kel and Caulder. They\u2019re both staring at me, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so mad at Layken?\u201d Kel asks. \u201cAre you not gonna be her boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I glance back to Lake\u2019s house and clasp my hands behind my head. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at her, Kel. I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m mad at myself.\u201d I drop my arms and turn back around to head home. They step apart as I pass between them. I hear them following me when I retrieve my things from my car. I\u2019m still being followed when I walk inside and set the box down on the bar, so I turn around and look at the boys.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say with a clear amount of annoyance. They both look at each other, then back at me.</p><p>\u201cUm. We just wanted to ask you something,\u201d Caulder says nervously. He slides into one of the bar stools and rests his chin in his hand. \u201cMaya said if Layken becomes your girlfriend and you marry her, me and Kel will be brothers of law.\u201d</p><p>Both boys are looking at me with hopeful expressions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s brothers-in-law, and Layken\u2019s not going to be my girlfriend,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>Kel steps around me and climbs into the other seat at the bar. \u201cShe burped too much, didn\u2019t she? Or did she leave her bra in your car? I bet she wouldn\u2019t let you have coffee, would she?\u201d</p><p>I force a fake smile and step toward the stack of papers. \u201cYou nailed it,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was the coffee. She\u2019s so stingy.\u201d</p><p>Kel shakes his head. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Caulder says. \u201cYou could try going on another date to see if you like her better. Me and Kel want to be brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLayken and I aren\u2019t going on another date. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d I glance at both of them with a serious expression. \u201cDrop it.\u201d I sit down and pull out my pen, then grab the test off the top and flip it over.</p><p>It\u2019s her test.</p><p>Of course it would be hers. I stare at it, wondering how in the hell this is going to get any easier. Just seeing her handwriting makes my pulse race. Makes my heart ache. I lightly trace her name with the tip of my finger. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the most beautiful handwriting I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>I flinch, having forgotten they were even standing here. I have got to stop thinking about her like this. She\u2019s a student. I slap her test facedown on the pile and stand up.</p><p>\u201cKel, do you like pizza?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo. I love pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ask your mom if you can chill with us tonight. We need a boy\u2019s night.\u201d</p><p>Kel jumps out of his chair and they both run toward the front door. I take a seat at the bar again and drop my head into my hands.</p><p>This entire day is definitely my suck.</p><p>I REST MY hand on the door to the administration office, almost second-guessing my entrance. I\u2019m not in the mood for Mrs. Alex today. Unfortunately, she sees me through the glass window and waves. Her flirty wave. I suck it up and reluctantly open the door.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Will,\u201d she says in her annoying singsong voice.</p><p>I know I was \u201cWill\u201d to her just a couple of years ago, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt her to extend me the courtesy that she extends to all the other teachers here. I don\u2019t bother arguing, though. \u201cMorning.\u201d I shove a form across the desk toward her. \u201cCan you have this signed by Mr. Murphy and fax it to my faculty advisor?\u201d</p><p>She takes the form and places it in a tray. \u201cAnything for you,\u201d she says and smiles. I give her a quick smile in return, then spin toward the exit, very conscious of my own ass this time.</p><p>\u201cOh, by the way,\u201d she calls after me. \u201cThat new student I registered yesterday just came by to drop your class. I guess she isn\u2019t a big fan of poetry. You\u2019ll need to sign the form I gave her before I can make it official. She\u2019s probably on her way to your classroom right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumble, exiting the office.</p><p>This is going to be impossible. It\u2019s not like I can just erase the fact that Lake exists. I\u2019ll more than likely see her at work on a daily basis, whether in passing . . . in the lunchroom . . . in the parking lot. I\u2019ll definitely see her at home every day considering her house is the first thing I see when I walk out my own front door. Or look out my window. Not that I\u2019ll be doing that.</p><p>Kel and Caulder are becoming inseparable, so I\u2019ll eventually have to interact with her regarding them. Trying to avoid her isn\u2019t going to work. Lake is absolutely right . . . it isn\u2019t going to work at all. I kept trying to tell myself over and over last night that what she said wasn\u2019t true, but it is. I wonder if the only other alternative would be to try and at least be her friend. We\u2019re obviously going to have to work through this situation somehow.</p><p>When I round the corner to my classroom, she\u2019s standing next to my door with the transfer form pressed against the wall, attempting to forge my name. My first instinct is to turn around and walk away, but I realize these are the exact types of situations we\u2019re going to have to learn to confront.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d I say, before she forges my name. If anyone could recognize my handwriting, it would be Mrs. Alex.</p><p>Lake spins around and looks at me. Her cheeks flush and she darts her eyes down to my shirt, embarrassed. I walk past her and unlock the door, then motion for her to enter the classroom. She walks to my desk and smacks her form down.</p><p>\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t here yet, I thought I\u2019d spare you the trouble,\u201d she says.</p><p>She must not have had her coffee today. I pick up the form and look it over. \u201cRussian Lit? That\u2019s what you chose?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cIt was either that or Botany.\u201d</p> <p>I pull my chair out and take a seat, preparing to sign the form. As soon as the tip of my pen meets the paper, it occurs to me that in a way, I\u2019m being incredibly selfish. She chose poetry as an elective before she even knew I would be teaching it. She chose poetry because she loves it. The fact that the thoughts I have about her make me uncomfortable is an extremely selfish reason to force her into Russian Literature for the rest of the year. I hesitate, then lay the pen back down on the paper.</p><p>\u201cI thought a lot last night . . . about what you said yesterday. It\u2019s not fair of me to ask you to transfer just because it makes me uneasy. We live a hundred yards apart; our brothers are becoming best friends. If anything, this class will be good for us, help us figure out how to navigate when we\u2019re around each other.\u201d I reach into my satchel and pull out the test she somehow made a perfect score on. \u201cBesides, you\u2019ll obviously breeze through.\u201d</p><p>She takes the test from my hands and looks down at it. \u201cI don\u2019t mind switching,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI understand where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d</p><p>I put the lid back on the pen and scoot my chair back. \u201cThanks, but it can only get easier from here, right?\u201d</p><p>She nods her head unconvincingly. \u201cRight,\u201d she says.</p><p>I know I\u2019m completely wrong. She could move back to Texas today and I would still feel too close to her. But once again, it\u2019s not my feelings that should matter at this point. It\u2019s hers. I\u2019ve screwed her life up enough in the past week; the last thing I want to do is shove Russian Lit on top of that. I crumple up her transfer form and chuck it toward the trash can. When it misses, she walks over and picks it up, then throws it in.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you third period, Mr. Cooper,\u201d she says as she exits the room.</p><p>The way she refers to me as \u201cMr. Cooper\u201d makes me scowl. I hate the fact that I\u2019m her teacher.</p><p>I\u2019d so much rather be her Will.</p><p>7.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>LAKE HASN\u2019T MOVED a muscle in the last fifteen minutes. She\u2019s been soaking in every word I\u2019ve said. Recalling the day we met and our first date was actually fun. Recalling the things that tore us apart is grueling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like talking about this anymore,\u201d I say. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s making you sad.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen and she turns her body toward me. \u201cWill, no. I love hearing your thoughts on everything that happened. I actually feel like it helps me understand a lot of your actions better. I don\u2019t know why I felt like you sort of blamed me.\u201d</p> <p>I kiss her softly on the lips. \u201cHow could I blame you, Lake? All I wanted was you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and rests her head on my forearm. \u201cI can\u2019t believe my mom told you to leave me that note,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cGod, Lake. That was so embarrassing. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cShe really liked you, you know. At first, I mean. She loved you in the end. It was the in-between where her feelings about you sort of waned.\u201d</p><p>I think about the day Julia found out, and how worried she must have been for Lake. To have everything going on in her life like she did, then have to watch your daughter deal with heartache? Unimaginable.</p><p>\u201cRemember when she found out you were my teacher?\u201d Lake says. \u201cThe look on your face when she was walking up the driveway toward you, it was awful. I was so afraid you would think I told her because I was mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so scared of her that day, Lake. She could be really intimidating when she wanted to be. Of course after we talked again later that night, I saw a more vulnerable side to her, but still. I was scared to death of her.\u201d</p><p>Lake jerks up on the bed and looks at me. \u201cWhat do you mean when y\u2019all talked again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater that night when she came back to my house. Did I never tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says abruptly, almost like I\u2019ve deceived her. \u201cWhy did she come back? What did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, let me start from the beginning. I want to tell you about the night before she found out,\u201d I say. \u201cI slammed a poem about you.\u201d</p><p>She perks up. \u201cNo way! How come you never told me?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI was hurt. It wasn\u2019t a positive piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear about it, anyway,\u201d she says.</p><p>this girl</p><p>I\u2019M HOPING THIS situation is like dieting, where they say day three is when the cravings start to subside. I really hope that\u2019s the case. The fact that she sits two feet from me in class makes my mind feel like a damn hurricane. It takes everything in me not to look at her during third period. In fact, I spend the entire time in my class trying not to look at her. I\u2019ve been fairly successful, which is good considering Gavin still watches me like a hawk. At least it felt like he was today, anyway. I\u2019ve never so looked forward to a weekend off in my life.</p><p>One. More. Day.</p><p>\u201cI might be a little late tonight, Maya. I\u2019m performing so I may stay until it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She plops down on the sofa with a carton of ice cream. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she says.</p><p>I grab my keys and head out the front door. No matter how hard I try not to, I glance across the street during my short walk to the car. I could swear I see her living room curtain snap shut. I stop and stare for a minute, but it doesn\u2019t move again.</p><p>I\u2019M ONE OF the first to arrive, so I take one of the seats toward the front of the room. I\u2019m hoping the energy from the crowd will distract me long enough to get out of this funk. I\u2019m almost embarrassed to admit it, but I feel more heartbroken over this entire situation with Lake than I did when Vaughn dumped me. I\u2019m sure a lot of that heartache was lost in the heartache from losing my parents, so maybe it just seems different for that reason. How could ending things with a girl who wasn\u2019t even my girlfriend to begin with possibly cause this much distress?</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Cooper,\u201d Gavin says. He and Eddie pull out their chairs and sit at the table with me. Unlike last week, I actually welcome their distraction tonight.</p><p>\u201cFor the last time, Gavin, call me Will. It\u2019s weird hearing you say that when we\u2019re not in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Will,\u201d Eddie says sarcastically. \u201cYou doing one tonight?\u201d</p><p>I had planned on performing, but seeing Gavin has me second-guessing my choice. I know most of the pieces I perform are metaphorical, but he\u2019ll see right through this one. Not that it matters; he already knows how I feel.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say to Eddie. \u201cI\u2019m doing a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d she says. \u201cDid you write it for that girl?\u201d She turns around and scans the room. \u201cWhere is she? I thought I saw you leaving with someone last week.\u201d She returns her focus to me. \u201cWas she your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Gavin and I immediately look at each other. He makes a face that tells me he didn\u2019t say anything to Eddie. I try to steady my expression when I respond.</p><p>\u201cJust a friend.\u201d</p><p>Eddie pushes her bottom lip out and pouts. \u201cFriend, huh? That sucks. We really need to hook you up with someone.\u201d She leans forward onto the table and puts her chin in her hands while studying me. \u201cGavin, who can we hook Will up with?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cWhy do you always think you have to hook everyone up? Not everyone feels the need to be in a relationship every second of their lives.\u201d He\u2019s obviously trying to squelch the subject and I appreciate him for that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t try to hook everyone up,\u201d she says. \u201cJust the people who clearly need it.\u201d She looks back at me. \u201cNo offense, Will. It\u2019s just\u2014you know. You never date. It might do you some good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Eddie,\u201d Gavin snaps.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Two people, Gavin! I\u2019ve mentioned finding dates for two people this week. That\u2019s not excessive. Besides, I think I may have figured out someone for Layken.\u201d</p><p>When Eddie says her name, I immediately shift in my chair. So does Gavin.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna try to get Nick to ask her out,\u201d she says, thinking aloud.</p><p>Before Gavin can respond, the sac is called to the stage. I\u2019m relieved the subject is off the table now, but I can\u2019t deny the twinge of jealousy that just made its way into my stomach.</p><p>What did I expect would be the outcome of all this? Of course she\u2019s going to date other people. She\u2019s got her entire senior year of school left; it would be crazy if she didn\u2019t date. But still, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be happy when she does.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d I say, excusing myself from the table. It\u2019s been five minutes and I already need a breather from Eddie.</p><p>When I return from the bathroom, the sac has already finished performing. As soon as I sit back down, the emcee calls me to the stage to perform first.</p><p>\u201cBreak a leg,\u201d Gavin says when I stand back up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s theater, Gavin,\u201d Eddie says, hitting him on the arm.</p><p>I ascend the steps and take my place in front of the microphone. I\u2019ve noticed in the past that if I concentrate and really put my emotions into writing, performing can actually be therapeutic. I really need to find some relief after all that\u2019s happened this week.</p><p>\u201cMy piece is called This Girl.\u201d I do my best to avoid Gavin\u2019s glare, but it\u2019s obvious by his expression that he knows the poem is about Lake as soon as the title passes my lips. I close my eyes and inhale a deep breath, then begin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I dreamt about this girl last night.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>This girl.</p><p>In my dream I was standing on the edge of a cliff</p> <p>Looking down over a vast, barren valley below</p><p>I wasn\u2019t wearing any shoes and the rocks were crumbling beneath my toes.</p><p>It would have been so easy to take a step back,</p><p>To move away from the ledge,</p><p>Away from a certain inevitable life that had somehow been determined for me</p> <p>a life that had somehow become my only option.</p><p>It had been my life for two years and I accepted that.</p><p>I had not embraced it,</p><p>But I had accepted it.</p><p>It was where I belonged.</p><p>As much as it didn\u2019t appeal to me, as much as I yearned for the rivers and mountains and trees,</p> <p>As much as I yearned to hear their songs . . .</p><p>To hear their . . . poetry?</p><p>It was apparent that what I yearned for</p><p>wasn\u2019t decided by me . . .</p><p>it was decided for me.</p><p>So . . . I did the only thing I could do.</p><p>The only thing I should do.</p><p>I prepared myself to embrace this life.</p> <p>I sucked it up and took a deep breath. I placed my hands on the edge of the cliff and began to lower myself onto the rocks protruding from the edge. I burrowed my fingers deep into the crevices and slowly began lowering myself down.</p><p>Down into the vast,</p><p>barren</p><p>valley</p><p>that had become</p><p>my</p><p>life.</p><p>But then . . .</p><p>Then this girl . . .</p><p>Holy hell, this girl . . .</p><p>She appeared out of nowhere, standing directly in front of me on the edge of that cliff. She looked down at me with her sad eyes that ran a million miles deep . . .</p><p>and she smiled at me.</p><p>This girl smiled at me.</p><p>A look that cut straight to my core and pierced through my heart like a million of Cupid\u2019s arrows,</p><p>One right on top of the other, on top of the other, on top of the other</p><p>Straight . . .</p><p>Into . . .</p><p>My heart . . .</p><p>Now this is the part of the dream where most girls would bend down and grab my hands, telling me not to go . . . not to do it. This is the part of the dream where most girls would grab my wrists and brace themselves with their feet as they pulled me up with every ounce of strength in their being. This is the part of the dream where most girls would scream at the top of their lungs for help, doing anything and everything they could to save me . . .</p><p>To rescue me</p><p>from that</p><p>vast,</p><p>barren</p><p>valley</p><p>But this girl.</p><p>This girl wasn\u2019t most girls.</p><p>This girl . . .</p><p>This girl did something even better.</p><p>First, she sat down on the edge of the cliff and kicked off her shoes and we both watched as they fell and fell and fell and continued to fall until they landed in a heap. One shoe right on top of the other in that vast, barren valley below.</p><p>Then she slid a rubber band off her wrist,</p><p>Reached behind her . . .</p><p>And pulled her hair</p><p>into a knot.</p><p>And then this girl</p><p>This girl . . .</p><p>She placed her hands right next to mine on the edge of that cliff and she slowly began to lower herself off of it. She poked her bare feet into whatever crevice she could find next to mine. She dug the fingers of her right hand into the cracks between the rocks, then placed her left hand</p><p>directly . . .</p><p>on top . . .</p><p>of mine.</p><p>She looked down at the vast, barren valley below us, then she looked back up at me and she smiled.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>She looked at me and smiled and said . . .</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>And I was.</p><p>I finally was.</p><p>I had never been more ready in my life.</p><p>Yeah . . .</p><p>This girl.</p><p>My mother would have loved this girl.</p><p>Too bad she was just a dream.</p><p>I CLOSE MY eyes and tune out the noise of the crowd while I wait for my lungs to find their rhythm again. When I descend the stage and take a seat back at the table, Eddie stands up, wiping tears from her eyes. She looks down at me and frowns.</p><p>\u201cWould it kill you to do something funny for once?\u201d She storms toward the bathroom, I\u2019m assuming to fix her makeup.</p><p>I look at Gavin and laugh, but he\u2019s staring back at me with his arms folded in front of him on the table. \u201cWill, I think I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPertaining to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he says. He gestures toward the stage, \u201cand your . . . situation.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward. \u201cWhat about my situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know someone,\u201d he says. \u201cShe works with my mom. She\u2019s your age, cute, in college.\u201d</p><p>I immediately shake my head. \u201cNo. No chance,\u201d I say, leaning back into the booth.</p><p>\u201cWill, you can\u2019t be with Layken. If your poem had anything to do with her, which I\u2019m thinking it had everything to do with her, then you need to find a way to get over this. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll end up screwing up your entire career over this girl. A girl you went on one date with. One!\u201d</p><p>I continue to shake my head at his reasoning. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a girlfriend, Gavin. I wasn\u2019t even looking for anything when I met Lake. I\u2019m fine with where I am right now; I definitely don\u2019t need to add even more female drama into the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be adding more drama. You\u2019ll be filling an obvious void in your life. You need to date. Eddie was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I right about?\u201d Eddie says, returning to her seat.</p><p>Gavin gestures toward me. \u201cAbout Will. He needs to date. Don\u2019t you think he and Taylor would hit it off?\u201d</p><p>Eddie perks up. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about her! Yes! Will, you\u2019re gonna love her,\u201d she says excitedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you guys set me up.\u201d I grab my jacket. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back home. See you guys in class tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Eddie and Gavin both stand. \u201cI\u2019ll get her number tomorrow,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cIs next Saturday night okay? You two could double date with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d I walk away without turning back or giving in.</p><p>8.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cOKAY,\u201d LAKE SAYS. \u201cTwo things. One. That poem was . . . heartbreakingly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like its subject,\u201d I say. I lean in to kiss her but she brings her hand up and pushes my face away.</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d she says, narrowing her eyes. \u201cGavin and Eddie tried to set you up with someone?\u201d She huffs and sits up on the bed. \u201cGood thing you didn\u2019t agree to it. I don\u2019t care how screwed up our situation was, there\u2019s no way I would have dated anyone else considering the way I felt about you.\u201d</p><p>I quickly change the subject before she realizes that, although I didn\u2019t agree to it, Eddie is pretty damn persistent.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now for Friday night,\u201d I say, successfully taking her mind off the date. \u201cYour mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, finding a comfortable spot next to me and throwing her leg over mine. \u201cMy mom.\u201d</p><p>secrets</p><p>\u201cPASTA AGAIN?\u201d CAULDER whines. He grabs his plate of food from the counter and takes it to the bar and sits.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, learn how to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Kel says. \u201cMy mom cooks a lot of vegetables and chicken. That\u2019s probably why I\u2019m so small, because I\u2019m malnouredish.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and correct him. \u201cIt\u2019s malnourished.\u201d</p><p>Kel rolls his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p><p>I grab my own bowl and fill it with pasta . . . again. We do have pasta at least three times a week, but there are only two of us. I don\u2019t see the point in making expensive meals when it\u2019s just me and a nine-year-old most of the time. I take a seat at the bar across from the two boys and fill all of our glasses with tea.</p><p>\u201cSuck and sweet time,\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s suck and sweet?\u201d Kel asks.</p><p>As soon as Caulder starts to explain, there\u2019s a knock at the front door. When I reach the door and open it, I\u2019m surprised to find Julia standing in the entryway. Her presence has definitely become more intimidating since the first day I met her; especially after this afternoon when she found out about me being a teacher.</p><p>She looks up at me straight faced, with her hands in the pockets of her scrub top.</p><p>\u201cOh. Hey,\u201d I say, trying not to appear as nervous as I am. \u201cKel just started eating. If you want, I\u2019ll send him home as soon as he\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she says. She glances over my shoulder at the boys, then looks back at me and lowers her voice to a whisper. \u201cI really wanted to talk to you if you have a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>She seems a little bit nervous, which just makes me ten times more nervous. \u201cSure.\u201d I step aside and motion for her to come in.</p><p>\u201cYou guys can eat in your room, Caulder. I need to talk to Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t said our suck and sweet for today,\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>\u201cDo them in your room. I\u2019ll tell you mine later.\u201d</p><p>The boys pick up their bowls and drinks and head to Caulder\u2019s room, closing the door behind them. When I turn back to Julia her mouth is curled up in a smile.</p><p>\u201cSuck and sweet?\u201d she says. \u201cIs that your way of getting him to tell you his good and bad for the day?\u201d</p><p>I smile and nod. \u201cWe started it about six months ago.\u201d I take a seat on the same couch as her. \u201cIt was his therapist\u2019s idea. Although the original version wasn\u2019t called suck and sweet. I sort of ad-libbed that part to make it sound more appealing to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet,\u201d she says. \u201cI should start doing that with Kel.\u201d</p><p>I give her a slight smile but don\u2019t respond. I\u2019m not really sure what she\u2019s doing here or what her intentions are, so I silently wait for her to continue. She takes a deep breath and focuses her gaze on the family picture hanging on the wall across from her.</p><p>\u201cYour parents?\u201d she says, pointing to the picture.</p><p>I relax into the couch and look up at the picture. \u201cYeah. My mom\u2019s name was Claire. My dad\u2019s name was Dimas. He was half Puerto Rican\u2014named after his maternal grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiles. \u201cThat explains your natural tan.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s trying to deflect for some reason. She continues to stare at the picture. \u201cDo you mind if I ask how they met?\u201d she says.</p><p>Just a few hours ago she was ready to rip my head off after finding out I\u2019m Lake\u2019s teacher; now she\u2019s trying to get to know me? Whatever\u2019s going on with her, I\u2019m in no position to question her, so I just go along with it.</p><p>\u201cThey met in college. Well, my mom was in college. My dad was actually a member of a band that played on her campus. He didn\u2019t go to college until a few years after they met. My mom was on a campus crew that would help set up their shows and they got to know each other. He asked her out and the rest is history. They married two years later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d they do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom was in human resources. Dad was a . . . he taught English.\u201d Just saying the word teacher in front of her makes me uncomfortable. \u201cNot the best-paying jobs but they were happy.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s what counts.\u201d</p><p>I nod in agreement. There\u2019s an awkward silence that follows while she slowly scans the pictures on the walls around us. I feel like she wants to bring up everything from earlier today, but maybe she doesn\u2019t know how. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen, Julia.\u201d I turn toward her on the couch. \u201cI really am sorry about what happened between Lake . . . between Layken and me. The position I\u2019ve put her in isn\u2019t fair to her and I feel terrible. It\u2019s completely my fault.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and reaches across the couch, then pats the top of my hand. \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t intentional, Will. What happened was an unfortunate misunderstanding; I know that. But . . .\u201d She sighs and shakes her head. \u201cAs much as I like you and think you\u2019re a great guy . . . it\u2019s just not right. She\u2019s never been in love before and it scares me when I think about the way she looked when she walked through that front door last Thursday night. I know she wants to do the right thing, but I also know she would do anything to get back to that moment. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen her that happy since before her father died.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her validate that Lake\u2019s feelings were just as intense as mine makes this whole thing even harder. I know she\u2019s only trying to make a point, but it\u2019s a point I\u2019d rather not hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is . . . this is in your hands, Will. I know she\u2019s not strong enough to deny her heart what it wants, so I need you to promise me that you will. You\u2019ve got more at stake here than she does. This isn\u2019t a fairy tale. This is reality. If you two end up following your hearts and not your heads, it\u2019ll end in disaster.\u201d</p> <p>I shift on the couch and attempt to think of a way to respond. Julia is obviously the type of person who can see through bullshit, so I know I need to be up front with her.</p><p>\u201cI like her, Julia. And in some odd way, I care about her. I know I\u2019ve only known her for a little over a week now, but . . . I do. I care about her. And that\u2019s exactly why you don\u2019t have anything to worry about. I want nothing more than to help Layken get past this\u2014whatever it is she\u2019s feeling. I know the only way to do that is to keep our relationship strictly professional from now on. And I promise you, I will.\u201d</p><p>I hear the words coming from my mouth, and I would like to admit that I\u2019m being one hundred percent honest with her. But if I\u2019m being one hundred percent honest with myself, I know I\u2019m not that strong. Which is why I have to keep my distance.</p><p>Julia rests her elbow against the back of the couch and lays her head on it. \u201cYou\u2019re a good person, Will. I hope one day she\u2019ll be lucky enough to find someone half as good as you. I just don\u2019t want her finding it yet, you know? And definitely not under these circumstances.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI don\u2019t want that for her right now, either,\u201d I say quietly. And that response is for certain the truth. If there\u2019s anything I know for sure, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t want to burden Lake with all of my responsibilities. She\u2019s young and, unlike me, she still has a chance at an untainted future. I don\u2019t want to be the one to take that from her.</p> <p>Julia leans back into the couch and looks at the picture of my parents again. I watch her while she stares at it. I can see now where Lake gets that distant gaze. I wonder if they were ever despondent before Lake\u2019s father passed away, or if it\u2019s a natural reaction after someone close to you dies. It makes me wonder if maybe I\u2019m just as despondent when I think about my own parents.</p><p>Julia\u2019s hand goes up to her cheek and she wipes at newly formed tears in her eyes. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s crying, but I instantly feel her sadness. It exudes from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like for you?\u201d she whispers, still staring at the picture.</p><p>I face forward again and look at their picture. \u201cWhat was what like?\u201d I ask. \u201cTheir death?\u201d</p><p>She nods, but doesn\u2019t look at me. I lean back and fold my arms across my chest, resting my head against the back of the couch again. \u201cIt was . . .\u201d I realize I\u2019ve never talked to anyone about what it was like for me. Other than the slam I\u2019ve performed about their death, I\u2019ve never spoken about it to a single person. \u201cIt was as if every single nightmare I\u2019ve ever had throughout my entire life became reality in that single instant.\u201d</p><p>She squeezes her eyes shut and clamps her hand over her mouth, quickly turning away.</p> <p>\u201cJulia?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s unable to control her tears now. I scoot closer to her on the couch and put my arm around her and pull her to me. I know she isn\u2019t crying because of what I said. She\u2019s crying because of something else entirely. There\u2019s something bigger going on here than just me and Lake. Something much bigger. I pull back and look at her.</p><p>\u201cJulia, tell me,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She pulls away and stands up, heading toward the door. \u201cI need to go,\u201d she says through her tears. She walks out the front door before I have a chance to stop her. When I make it outside, she\u2019s standing on my patio crying uncontrollably. I walk over to her, unsure of what to do. Unsure if I\u2019m in the position to do anything, even if I wanted to.</p><p>\u201cLook, Julia. Whatever this is, you need to talk about it. You don\u2019t have to tell me, but you need to talk about it. Do you want me to go get Layken?\u201d</p><p>She darts her eyes up to mine. \u201cNo!\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t. I don\u2019t want her to see me upset like this.\u201d</p><p>I place my hands on her shoulders. \u201cIs everything okay? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She breaks her gaze from mine, indicating I\u2019ve hit the nail on the head. She\u2019s not okay. She steps away from me and wipes her tears away with her shirt. She inhales a few deep breaths, attempting to stop more tears from flowing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready for them to know, Will. Not yet,\u201d she whispers. She hugs herself tightly and glances at her house. \u201cI just want them to have a chance to settle in. They\u2019ve been through so much already this year. I can\u2019t tell them yet. It\u2019ll break their souls.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t come out and say it, but I can hear it in her voice. She\u2019s sick.</p><p>I wrap my arms around her and hug her. I hug her for what she\u2019s going through, for what she\u2019s been through. I hug her for Lake, I hug her for Kel, and I hug her for Caulder and myself. I hug her because it\u2019s all I know to do.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything. I promise.\u201d I don\u2019t even know how to begin to put myself in her shoes in order to empathize. I can\u2019t imagine how hard this must be for her. To know that both of your children are possibly going to be left in the world without you? At least my parents didn\u2019t know what was about to happen to them before it happened. At least they didn\u2019t have to carry around the burden that Julia is carrying.</p><p>She finally pulls away and wipes at her eyes again. \u201cJust send Kel home when he\u2019s finished eating. I need to get to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you ever feel like talking about it . . .\u201d</p><p>She smiles, then turns and walks away. I\u2019m left standing in front of my house with the emptiest feeling in the world. Knowing what\u2019s about to become of Lake\u2019s life\u2014it makes me want to protect her even more. I\u2019ve been in her shoes before and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. I sure as hell don\u2019t wish it on the girl I\u2019m falling in love with.</p><p>9.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>LAKE SLIDES OFF the bed and walks to the bathroom, wiping her eyes. This is such a bad idea. This is exactly why I don\u2019t like bringing up the past.</p><p>\u201cLake,\u201d I say, following after her. She\u2019s looking into the bathroom mirror, dabbing a tissue to her eyes. I stand behind her and wrap my arms around her waist, resting my head on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. We don\u2019t have to talk about it anymore.\u201d</p><p>She looks at my reflection in the mirror. \u201cWill,\u201d she whispers. She turns around to face me and wraps her arms around my neck. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I had no idea. I didn\u2019t know you already knew she was sick.\u201d</p><p>I pull her to me. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really come out and say it, you know. We weren\u2019t even speaking at that point. Besides, I would have never betrayed your mom.\u201d</p><p>She laughs into my shirt, causing me to pull back and look at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, confused about why she\u2019s laughing through her tears.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d she says. \u201cI know how your promises to my mom work. We had to suffer the consequences of that last promise you made for an entire year.\u201d She throws her tissue into the trash can and grabs my hand, leading me back to the bed.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it suffering,\u201d I say, thinking back on last night. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m pretty sure it was worth all the waiting.\u201d</p><p>She places her hand between her cheek and the pillow and we turn toward each other. I run my fingers through her hair and tuck it behind her ears, then kiss her on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of suffering,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just wait until I see Gavin and Eddie again. I can\u2019t believe they tried to set you up.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hand away from her face and rest it on the bed between us. For some reason, I feel like I can\u2019t touch her when I\u2019m withholding truth. I break eye contact and roll onto my back. If she\u2019s going to bring this up to Eddie, I might as well get it all out in the open now. Otherwise, we\u2019ll all suffer.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . Lake?\u201d I say hesitantly. As soon as her name comes out of my mouth, she shakes her head and scoffs at me.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d she says, her words laced with disappointment. She\u2019s way too perceptive.</p><p>I don\u2019t respond.</p><p>My silence prompts her to jerk up and grab my jaw, forcing me to look at her.</p><p>\u201cYou went on a DATE?\u201d she says in disbelief.</p><p>I place my hand on her cheek in a heartening gesture, hoping my touch will soothe the words about to come out of my mouth. She jerks her face away from my hand and sits up on her knees, placing her hands on them.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>I laugh a nervous laugh, attempting to make light of the situation. \u201cLake, you know how forceful Eddie can be. I didn\u2019t want to go. Besides, it was just one date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one date?\u201d she says. \u201cAre you saying you can\u2019t develop feelings for someone after just one date?\u201d She spins around on the bed and stands up, dropping down into the desk chair beside the bed. She folds her arms across her chest, shaking her head again. \u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t kiss her.\u201d</p><p>I scoot toward her until I\u2019m sitting on the edge of the bed. I reach forward and take her hands in mine and look her in the eyes. \u201cI love you,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here. With you. Married to you. Who cares what happened on one silly date more than two years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou KISSED her?\u201d she says, jerking her hands back. She places her foot on the bed between my legs and pushes against it, rolling her and the chair several feet away from me.</p><p>\u201cShe kissed me,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cAnd it was . . . God, Lake. It was nothing like kissing you.\u201d</p><p>She glares at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, wiping the smirk off my face. \u201cNot funny. But seriously, you\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing. Besides, you agreed to go out with Nick that next week. Remember? What\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d she says, enunciating each word carefully. \u201cI didn\u2019t go on a date with him. I didn\u2019t kiss him. That\u2019s a pretty damn big difference.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lean forward and grab the arms of her chair and pull her back to me until she\u2019s flush against my legs.

I\u2019ve loved you since the second I laid eyes on you and I haven\u2019t stopped loving you for a second since. The entire time I was out with Taylor, all I was thinking about was you.\u201d</p><p>She crinkles up her nose. \u201cTaylor? I didn\u2019t need to know her name, Will. Now I\u2019ll have a distaste for Taylors for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I have distaste for Javiers and Nicks?\u201d I say. She grins, but quickly forces the smile away, still trying to punish me with her ineffective scowl.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re jealous, babe.\u201d I lean forward and softly press my lips to hers. She sighs a quiet, defeated sigh into my mouth and relents, parting her lips for me. I run my hands down her arms and to her waist, then pull her out of the chair and on top of me as I lean back onto the bed.</p> <p>I place one hand on the small of her back, pressing her against me, and my other hand I run through her hair, grabbing the back of her head. I kiss her hard as I roll her onto her back, proving to her she has absolutely nothing to be jealous of. As soon as I\u2019m on top of her, she places her hands on my cheeks and forces my face away from hers.</p><p>\u201cSo your lips touched someone else\u2019s lips? After our first kiss?\u201d</p><p>I fall back onto the bed beside her. \u201cLake, stop it. Stop thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Will.\u201d She turns to me and makes that damn pouty face she knows I can\u2019t refuse. \u201cI have to know details. In my head all I can picture is you taking some girl out on this perfect date and making her grilled cheese sandwiches and playing \u201cwould you rather\u201d with her and sharing seriously intense moments with her, then kissing the hell out of her at the end of the night.\u201d</p><p>Her description of our first date makes me laugh. I lean over and press my lips to her ear and whisper, \u201cIs that what I did to you? I kissed the hell out of you?\u201d</p> <p>She pulls her neck away and shoots me a glare, letting me know she isn\u2019t backing down until she gets her way. \u201cFine,\u201d I groan, pulling back. \u201cIf I tell you all about it will you promise to let me kiss the hell out of you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d she says.</p><p>the other date</p><p>WHEN THE DISMISSAL bell rings, Lake is the first out of the classroom again. The tension in the air between us is so thick, it\u2019s like she has to run outside just to breathe. I walk to my desk and take a seat while the rest of the students file out.</p><p>\u201cSaturday night. Seven o\u2019clock good for you?\u201d Gavin says. I look up at him and he\u2019s staring at me, waiting for a response.</p><p>\u201cGood for what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor Taylor. We\u2019re going on a double date and Eddie won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stares at me for a few seconds, finding it difficult to comprehend my answer. It was a pretty clear no, so I\u2019m not sure what the problem is.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cPuppy dog eyes only work on your girlfriend, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>He slumps his shoulders and lands in the desk in front of me. \u201cShe\u2019s not gonna let it go, Will. Once Eddie gets something in her head, it\u2019s way less painful to just go along with it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not going,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re the one who put this idea in her head. You should have to suffer the consequences, not me.\u201d</p><p>Gavin leans back in his chair and runs his hands over his face, defeated. As soon as I feel victorious, he shoots forward in his seat. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll tell.\u201d</p> <p>I lean back in my chair and glare at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell what?\u201d</p><p>He glances at the door, then back at me, ensuring our privacy. \u201cI\u2019ll go to Principal Murphy and I\u2019ll tell him you went out with a student. I\u2019m sorry it has to come to blackmail, Will, but you don\u2019t know Eddie when she gets an idea in her head. You have to do this for me.\u201d</p><p>Did he really just threaten to blackmail me?</p><p>I pick up my pen and pull my lesson plan in front of me, breaking eye contact with him. \u201cGavin, you won\u2019t tell,\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>He groans at my response, because he knows he would never stoop that low. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019d never tell. But don\u2019t you think you owe it to me for being so trustworthy?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just one date. One tiny favor. What difference can one date make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepending on who it\u2019s with, it can make a huge difference,\u201d I say. One date with Lake was enough to send my life into a tailspin.</p><p>\u201cIf it helps, you won\u2019t have to do much talking. Taylor and Eddie will completely monopolize the conversation. We can eat our steaks and grunt every few minutes and they\u2019ll be none the wiser. Then it\u2019ll be over. I swear.\u201d</p><p>I do owe him a favor. A huge favor. He\u2019s the only one who knows about my situation with Lake and he\u2019s never once given me flak about it. I don\u2019t know how Eddie can get her way when she\u2019s not even in the room, but I finally relent. I slap my pen down on the desk and sigh, giving him a stern look.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cUnder one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this to get back to Lake. Tell Eddie I\u2019ll go, but give her an excuse to keep her quiet. Tell her I\u2019m not supposed to be hanging out with you two after hours or something.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stands and gathers his things. \u201cThank you, Will,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver. And hey, you might even like Taylor. Keep an open mind.\u201d</p><p>I WALK INTO the restaurant and spot the three of them in a booth in the far corner. I take a deep breath, then grudgingly walk toward them. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going on a date. A date that\u2019s not with Lake, the only girl I want to be on a date with.</p><p>The girl I can\u2019t be on a date with.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s words, \u201ckeep an open mind,\u201d linger in my head. I\u2019ve been completely consumed by thoughts of Lake since I met her almost three weeks ago. I\u2019ve made the right choice by not continuing something that could ruin my career, but now I just need to figure out how to accept that choice and get her out of my head. Maybe Gavin\u2019s right. Maybe I do need to try to move on. It could be better for both of us this way.</p><p>When Gavin spots me, he waves and stands up, prompting Taylor to turn around. She\u2019s . . . cute. Really cute. Her hair is darker than Lake\u2019s and shorter, but it fits her well. She\u2019s not as tall as Lake, either. She\u2019s got a great smile; one of those that seems to be permanently affixed.</p><p>I reach the table and smile back at her. Might as well give this a shot.</p><p>\u201cWill, Taylor. Taylor, Will,\u201d Gavin says, gesturing between us. She smiles and stands up, then gives me a quick hug. General greetings pass around the table and we take our seats. It\u2019s odd sitting on the same side of the booth with her. I don\u2019t know if I should turn toward her or give my attention to Eddie and Gavin.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says. \u201cGavin says you\u2019re a teacher?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cStudent teacher. Until December graduation, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re graduating in December?\u201d she asks, taking a sip of her soda. \u201cHow? Isn\u2019t that a semester early?\u201d</p><p>The waitress walks up to the table and hands me a menu, interrupting the short conversation. \u201cWhat can I get you to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a sweet tea,\u201d I say. The waitress nods and walks away, then Eddie nudges Gavin and pushes his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSorry, guys, but . . . something just came up,\u201d Eddie says. Gavin stands up and pulls his wallet out of his pocket, throwing some cash down on the table.</p><p>\u201cThis should cover our drinks. You can take Taylor home, right?\u201d he says to me.</p><p>\u201cSomething came up, huh?\u201d I ask, glaring at both of them. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re doing this. I\u2019m so going to fail them.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Eddie says, taking Gavin\u2019s hand. \u201cSo sorry we can\u2019t stay. You two have fun.\u201d</p><p>And they\u2019re gone. Just like that.</p><p>Taylor laughs. \u201cWow. That wasn\u2019t obvious,\u201d she says.</p><p>I turn back to her and she\u2019s grinning, shaking her head. Now it really feels odd sitting in the same side of the booth with her. \u201cWell,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is . . .\u201d</p><p>We both say \u201cawkward\u201d at the same time, which causes us to laugh.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if . . .\u201d I point to the other side of the booth and she shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, please. I\u2019ve never been a same-side-of-the-booth girl. It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d I say, scooting into the seat across from her. The waitress brings my drink and takes our order. It gives us about thirty seconds of distraction before she walks away again, leaving us to fend for ourselves.</p><p>Taylor lifts her glass up, motioning to mine. \u201cTo awkward first dates,\u201d she says. I pick my glass up and clink it against hers.</p><p>\u201cSo, before all that,\u201d she says, waving her hand in the air. \u201cWe were talking about how you were graduating a semester early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah . . .\u201d I pause. I don\u2019t really feel like going into detail about the real reasons I\u2019m graduating early. I lean back in the booth and shrug. \u201cWhen I want something, I guess I just focus until I get it. Tunnel vision,\u201d I say.</p><p>She nods. \u201cImpressive. I\u2019ve still got a year left, but I\u2019m going into teaching, too. Primary. I like kids.\u201d</p><p>Our conversation begins to flow better. We talk about college for a while, then when the food comes we talk about that. Then when we run out of things to talk about, she brings up her family. I let her talk about them, but I don\u2019t divulge. By the time the bill comes, the conversation is far from awkward. I\u2019ve only thought about Lake ten times. Maybe fifteen.</p><p>Everything seems okay until we\u2019re in the car, backing out of the parking lot. Seeing her sitting in the passenger seat, staring out the window; it\u2019s reminiscent of just a few weeks ago when Lake was doing the exact same thing, in this exact same spot. But it doesn\u2019t feel anything like that. That night with Lake I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of her while we drove and she slept, her hand still locked with mine. I\u2019m not one to believe that there is only one person right for me in the world. But the tug and pull Lake has on me, even when she isn\u2019t in my presence, it makes it feel like she\u2019s the most right for me. As much as I think Taylor and I would hit it off on a second date, I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019ll ever be able to settle for anything less than what I feel for Lake.</p><p>We make more small talk and she directs me toward her house. When we pull up into the driveway, the awkwardness immediately sets in. I don\u2019t want to lead her on at all, but I also don\u2019t want her to think she did anything wrong to turn me off. She was great. The date was great. It\u2019s just that my date with Lake was so much more, and now I want nothing less.</p><p>I put the car in park and, as awkward as this is going to be, I offer to walk her to her door. When we reach the patio, she turns around and looks up at me with an inviting and welcoming look on her face. This is the point where I need to be honest with her. I don\u2019t want to get her hopes up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTaylor . . .\u201d I say. \u201cI had a really good ti\u2014\u201d Before I can finish my sentence, her lips are meshed with mine. She doesn\u2019t seem like the type to make such bold moves, so the kiss catches me completely off guard. She runs her hands through my hair and I\u2019m suddenly faced with the realization that I don\u2019t know what to do with my own hands. Do I touch her? Do I push her away? To be honest, the kiss isn\u2019t half bad and I catch myself closing my eyes, bringing my hand to her cheek. I know I shouldn\u2019t be making comparisons but I can\u2019t help it. This kiss is reminiscent of kissing Vaughn. It\u2019s not bad . . . pleasant even. But there isn\u2019t any emotion in it. No passion. Nothing like what I felt when I kissed Lake.</p><p>Lake.</p><p>I prepare to pull myself away from her when she finally pulls back herself. I\u2019m relieved I didn\u2019t have to be the one to push her away. She takes a step back and covers her mouth in embarrassment. \u201cWow,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m not usually that forward.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Really, Taylor. It was nice.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not lying; it was nice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just really . . . I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, still smiling uncomfortably. \u201cI just wanted to kiss you,\u201d she shrugs.</p><p>I rub the back of my neck and glance at her front door, then back at her. How am I going to say this?</p><p>She follows my gaze to her front door, then back to me and smiles. \u201cOh. You uh . . . You want to come inside?\u201d</p><p>Oh, god, oh, god. Why did I look at the door? She thinks I want to come inside now. Do I want to come inside? Shit. I don\u2019t want to come inside. I can\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about Taylor at all if I went inside.</p> <p>\u201cTaylor,\u201d I say. \u201cI need to be honest with you. I think you\u2019re great. I had a great time. If we did this a few months ago, I\u2019d be inside that house with you in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>She can see where I\u2019m headed, so she just nods. \u201cBut . . .\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone else. Someone recent that I can\u2019t seem to get past. I agreed to this date because I was hoping that maybe it would somehow help me get over her, but . . . it\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at the sky and drops her arms to her side. \u201cOh, god. I just kissed you. I thought you were feeling it, too, so I kissed you.\u201d She covers her face with her hands, embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, taking a step closer. \u201cNo, don\u2019t say that. I know this is clich\u00e9 and it\u2019s the last thing you want to hear, but . . . it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s completely me. Really. I think you\u2019re great and cute and I\u2019m glad you kissed me. Honestly, the timing just really sucks. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She hugs herself with her arms and looks down at the ground. \u201cIf it\u2019s just timing,\u201d she says quietly, \u201cwill you keep my number? In case the timing thing ever gets better?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>She nods, then looks up at me. \u201cOkay, then,\u201d she smiles. \u201cTo awkward first dates.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cTo awkward first dates,\u201d I say. She waves and heads inside. Once she\u2019s inside her house, I sigh and head back to my car. \u201cNever again, Gavin,\u201d I mutter. \u201cNever again.\u201d</p><p>10.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cEXCUSE ME FOR a second,\u201d Lake says. She pushes herself up and walks to the bathroom, then slams the door behind her.</p><p>She\u2019s mad? Seriously? Oh, hell no. I jump up and try to open the bathroom door, but it\u2019s locked from the inside. I knock. After several seconds, she swings it open and spins back around toward the shower without looking at me. She turns the shower knob until the water comes to life, then she slips off her shirt.</p><p>\u201cI just need a shower,\u201d she snaps.</p> <p>I lean against the doorframe and cross my arms. \u201cYou\u2019re mad. Why are you mad? Nothing happened. I never went out with her again.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and closes the lid to the toilet, then takes a seat on top of it. She slips off her socks one at a time and tosses them to the floor with a jerk of her wrist. \u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d she says, still avoiding eye contact.</p><p>\u201cLake?\u201d She doesn\u2019t look up at me. \u201cLake? Look at me,\u201d I demand.</p><p>She inhales a slow breath, then looks up at me through her lashes, her mouth puckered into a pout.</p><p>\u201cThree days ago you made a promise to me,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you remember what that promise was?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and stands up, unbuttoning her pants. \u201cOf course I remember, Will. It was three freaking days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you promise me you wouldn\u2019t do?\u201d</p><p>She walks to the mirror and pulls at her ponytail, letting her hair down. She doesn\u2019t respond. I take a step closer to her. \u201cWhat did you promise, Lake? What did we both promise each other the night before we got married?\u201d</p><p>She grabs her brush off the counter and vigorously combs at her hair. \u201cThat we would never carve pumpkins with each other,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cThat we would talk everything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you doing right now?\u201d</p><p>She slams the brush down on the counter and turns to me. \u201cWhat the hell do you want me to say, Will? Do you want me to admit that I\u2019m not perfect? That I\u2019m jealous? I know you said it didn\u2019t mean anything to you, but that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t mean something to me!\u201d She brushes past me and walks to my suitcase to grab her bottle of conditioner. I lean against the bathroom door again and watch her toss the contents of my suitcase onto the floor while she continues searching for more toiletries.</p><p>I don\u2019t give her a rebuttal; I have a feeling she isn\u2019t finished. Once she gets started like this, it\u2019s better if I don\u2019t interrupt her. She finds her razor and spins around, continuing her rant.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know you didn\u2019t kiss her first, but you didn\u2019t not kiss her. And you admitted you thought she was cute! And you even admitted that if it weren\u2019t for me, you probably would have asked her out again! I hate her, Will. She sounded really, really nice and I hate her for it. It feels like she\u2019s been your backup plan in case the two of us didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>She marches toward me again, but this last comment of hers really gets to me. My backup plan? I block her way into the bathroom and look down at her, attempting to calm her down before she says something she\u2019ll regret.</p><p>\u201cLake, you know how I felt about you back then. I never even thought about that girl again. I knew exactly who I wanted to be with. It was just a matter of when.\u201d</p><p>She drops her arms to her side. \u201cWell, that\u2019s nice that you had that reassurance, because I sure as hell didn\u2019t. I lived every single day feeling like I was going through hell while you were across the street, choosing everything and everyone over me. Not to mention all the while going on dates and kissing other girls while I sat home, watching my own mother die right before my eyes.\u201d</p><p>I step forward and grab her face with both hands. \u201cThat\u2019s. Not. Fair,\u201d I say through clenched teeth. She darts her eyes away from mine, aware of the low blow she delivered. She pulls away from my grasp and walks around me, back into the bathroom. She pushes open the shower curtain and adjusts the water again, letting her pride and stubbornness win.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re leaving it at that?\u201d I say loudly. She doesn\u2019t look up at me. I can sense when I need to step away from a situation, and this is one of those times. If I don\u2019t walk away, I\u2019ll say something I\u2019ll regret, too. I punch the door and storm out of the bathroom, then swing open the door to the hallway. I slam the hotel room door and pace back and forth, cursing under my breath. Each time I pass our hotel room, I pause and turn toward it, expecting her to open the door and apologize.</p><p>She never does.</p><p>She just got in the shower? How in the hell can she say something like that to me and just get in the damn shower without apologizing? God, she\u2019s so infuriating! I haven\u2019t been this mad at her since that night I thought she was kissing Javi.</p><p>I rest my back against our door and slide down to the floor, then take fistfuls of my hair into my hands. She can\u2019t seriously be mad about this. We weren\u2019t even dating! I try to justify her reasons for reacting the way she is, but I can\u2019t. She\u2019s acting like an immature high schooler.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d she says, her voice muffled by the door. She sounds close and I realize she\u2019s on the other side of the door at my level. The fact that she knew I was sitting on the floor in front of the door pisses me off even more. She knows me too well.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say sharply.</p><p>It\u2019s silent for a moment, then she sighs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said that,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>I lean my head against the door and close my eyes, taking in a long, deep breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . I know we don\u2019t believe in soulmates,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are so many people in this world that can be right for each other. If there weren\u2019t, then cheating would never be an issue. Everyone would find their one true love and life would be great\u2014relationships would be a piece of cake. But that\u2019s not how it is in reality, and I realize this. So . . . it just hurts, okay? It hurts me to know that there are other women out there in the world that could make you happy. I know it\u2019s immature and I was being petty and jealous, but . . . I just want to be your only one. I want to be your soulmate, even if I don\u2019t believe in them. I overreacted and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Will.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence on both ends, then I hear the bathroom door shut. I close my eyes and contemplate everything she said. I know exactly how she feels; I\u2019ve been prone to my own bouts of jealousy in the past when it comes to her. Back when I was her teacher and hearing her agree to that date with Nick, then later seeing Javi kiss her; I lost my mind both times. Hell, I beat the shit out of Javi, and Lake wasn\u2019t even my girlfriend at the time. Expecting her not to have a reaction when she finds out I kissed someone else in the midst of all our emotional turmoil makes me nothing but a hypocrite. She had a normal reaction just now, and I\u2019m treating her like this is her fault. She\u2019s probably in the shower right now, crying. All because of me.</p><p>I\u2019m such an asshole.</p><p>I jump up and slide the key card in, then open the door. I swing open the bathroom door and she\u2019s sitting on the edge of the shower, still in her pants and bra, crying into her hands. She looks up at me with the saddest eyes and guilt consumes me. I grab her hand and pull her up. She sucks in a breath like she\u2019s scared I\u2019m about to yell at her again, which only makes me feel worse. I slide my hands through her hair and grip the nape of her neck, then look her in the eyes. She can see in my expression that I\u2019m not here to fight.</p><p>I\u2019m here to make up.</p><p>\u201cWife,\u201d I say, staring straight into her eyes. \u201cThink what you want, but there isn\u2019t a single woman in this whole damn universe that I could ever love like I love you.\u201d</p><p>Our mouths collide so forcefully; she almost falls backward into the shower. I brace my hand against the shower wall with one arm, then pick her up around the waist with the other arm, lifting her over the lip of the tub. I shove her up against the wall, the water from the showerhead falling between us. We\u2019re both breathing heavily and I pull her as close against me as she can possibly get while her fingers tug and pull at my hair. My chest heaves with each breath I inhale as we frantically grab and pull and stroke every inch of each other within arm\u2019s reach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pull her bra up and over her head, then throw it behind me. My hand slides down to the small of her back, my fingers tracing a trail just inside the back of her jeans. She moans and arches her back, pressing herself harder against me. My fingers slowly slide around to the front of her jeans and I lower her zipper. Her pants are soaked, so it takes effort getting them off her, but I eventually do.</p><p>I slide my hand all the way up her thigh and I\u2019m met with nothing but smooth skin. I grin against her lips. \u201cCommando, huh?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t waste any time pulling my mouth back to hers. I\u2019ve been standing directly in the stream of water, so my clothes are soaked, making them more challenging to remove than hers were. Especially since she won\u2019t release me for a second longer than needed to pull off my shirt. Once my shirt is successfully gone, I lean back into her. She moans into my mouth when our bare skin collides, forcing me to immediately dispose of my pants as well. She grabs them out of my hand and tosses them over my shoulder, then pulls me against her. I reach down and grab her right leg behind the knee and I pull it up to my side.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cNow this is how I pictured our first shower together,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I take her bottom lip between my teeth, and I give her the best damn shower she\u2019s ever had.</p><p>\u201cHOLY CRAP,\u201d SHE says, falling onto the bed. \u201cThat was intense.\u201d</p><p>Her arms are relaxed above her head, her robe open just far enough to keep my imagination in check. I sit down beside her and stroke her cheek, then run my hand down her neck. She shivers against my touch. I bend over and press my lips to her collarbone. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about this spot,\u201d I say, teasing her neck. \u201cFrom here . . .\u201d I kiss up her collarbone until I get to the curve in her neck. \u201cTo here.\u201d I kiss back down again. \u201cIt drives me insane.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI can tell. You can\u2019t keep your mouth off it. Most guys prefer the ass or the boobs. Will Cooper prefers the neck.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, disagreeing with her while I continue running my lips across her incredibly smooth skin. \u201cNope,\u201d I say. \u201cWill Cooper prefers the whole Lake.\u201d</p> <p>I tug at the tie on her robe until it loosens between my fingertips. I slide my hand inside the robe and graze her stomach with my fingers. She squirms beneath my hand and laughs.</p><p>\u201cWill, you can\u2019t be serious. It hasn\u2019t even been three minutes.\u201d</p><p>I ignore her and kiss the chills that are breaking out on her shoulder. \u201cYou remember the first time I couldn\u2019t resist kissing your neck?\u201d I whisper against her skin.</p><p>the (first) mistake</p><p>IT\u2019S BEEN THREE weeks since Julia told me she was sick, but from watching Lake and listening to Kel on a daily basis, I know she still hasn\u2019t told them. I\u2019ve spoken to Julia a few times, but only in passing. She doesn\u2019t seem to want to bring it up again, so I give her that respect.</p><p>Having Lake in third period hasn\u2019t gotten any easier. I\u2019ve learned how to adapt and focus more on what I\u2019m teaching, but the fact that she\u2019s still just feet from me every day still has the same emotional impact. Every morning she comes to class, I try to watch for any hints or signs that Julia may have revealed everything to her, but every day is the same. She never raises her hand or speaks, and I make it a point never to call on her. I make it a point not to even look at her. It\u2019s been getting harder now that Nick seems to be marking his territory. I know it\u2019s none of my business, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if they\u2019re dating. I haven\u2019t seen him at her house but I\u2019ve noticed they sit together at lunch. She always seems to be in a good mood around him. Gavin would know, but as far as he knows I\u2019ve moved on, so I can\u2019t ask him. I really shouldn\u2019t even care . . . but I can\u2019t help it.</p> <p>I\u2019m running late when I get to class. When I walk in, the first thing I notice is Nick turned toward Lake. She\u2019s laughing again. She\u2019s always laughing at his stupid jokes. I like seeing her laugh, but I also hate that he\u2019s the reason she\u2019s laughing. It immediately puts me in a bad mood, so I decide to cancel the lecture I had planned and give a poetry writing assignment instead. After I lay out the rules and everyone begins on their assignment, I take a seat at my desk. I try to focus on completing a lesson plan, but I can\u2019t help but notice Lake hasn\u2019t written a single word. I know she doesn\u2019t have a problem with the material in class. In fact, she\u2019s had the best grades since the day she enrolled. Her lack of effort on this assignment makes me wonder if she has the same concentration problems during third period that I have.</p><p>I glance up from staring at the blank paper on her desk and she\u2019s staring right at me. My heart catches in my throat and the same emotional and physical responses I try so hard to squelch are suddenly consuming me again. It\u2019s the first eye contact we\u2019ve had in three weeks. I try to look away, but I can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t reveal any hint of emotion in her expression. I wait for her to look away, but instead she stares at me with the same intensity that I\u2019m sure I\u2019m returning in my own stare. This silent exchange between us causes my pulse to race just as fiercely as it did when I kissed her.</p><p>When the bell rings, I force myself out of my chair and walk to the door to hold it open. When everyone\u2019s gone, including Lake, I slam it shut.</p><p>What the hell am I thinking? That twenty seconds of whatever the hell that was negated my entire last three weeks of effort. I lean against the door and kick it out of frustration.</p><p>AS SOON AS I reach the parking lot after school, I see that the hood to Lake\u2019s Jeep is open. I look around, hoping someone else is around to assist her instead. I really don\u2019t need to be alone with her right now, especially after what happened in my classroom this morning. I\u2019m finding it harder and harder to resist the thought of her, and this current predicament has trouble written all over it.</p><p>Unfortunately, I\u2019m the only one around. I can\u2019t just leave her here stranded in a parking lot. I\u2019m sure it would be just as easy to turn around and head inside before she notices me. Someone else will help her eventually. Despite my hesitation, I keep walking forward. When I near her vehicle, she\u2019s bludgeoning the battery with a crowbar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d I say. I\u2019m hoping she doesn\u2019t bust through the battery before I reach her. She spins around and looks at me, eyeing me up and down, then returns her focus back under the hood like she never even saw me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made it clear that you don\u2019t think a lot of what I do is a very good idea,\u201d she says firmly. She\u2019s obviously not happy to see me, which is just more confirmation that I should turn around and walk away.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t.</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>I reluctantly walk closer and peer under the hood. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, it won\u2019t crank?\u201d I check the connections on the battery and inspect the alternator.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Will?\u201d She has an edgy, almost annoyed tone to her voice. I lift my head out from under the hood and look at her. Her features are hard. It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s put up an invisible wall between us, which is probably a good thing. She seems offended that I\u2019m even offering to help her.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d I break our stare and quickly turn my attention back to the battery cable. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with your Jeep,\u201d I say. I walk around to the door and attempt to turn the ignition. When it doesn\u2019t crank, I turn to exit the Jeep and she\u2019s standing right next to me. I\u2019m quickly reminded what it feels like to be in such close proximity to her. I hold my breath and fight back the urge to grab her by the waist and pull her into the Jeep with me.</p><p>\u201cI mean, why are you doing this? You\u2019ve made it pretty clear you don\u2019t want me to speak to you,\u201d she says.</p><p>Her obvious annoyance at my presence almost makes me regret having decided to help her after all. \u201cLayken, you\u2019re a student stranded in the parking lot. I\u2019m not going to get in my car and just drive away.\u201d As soon as the words escape my lips, I regret them. She draws her chin in and glances away, shocked at my impersonal words.</p><p>I sigh and get out of the car. \u201cLook, that\u2019s not how I meant it,\u201d I say as I reach back under the hood.</p><p>She steps closer to me and leans against the Jeep. I watch her out of the corner of my eye while I pretend to fidget with more wires. She tugs on her bottom lip with her teeth and stares at the ground, a saddened expression across her face. \u201cIt\u2019s just been really hard, Will,\u201d she says quietly. The softness in her voice now is even more painful to hear than the edginess. I inhale, afraid of what she\u2019s about to confess. She takes a deep breath like she\u2019s hesitating to finish her sentence, but continues anyway. \u201cIt was so easy for you to accept this and move past it. It hasn\u2019t been that easy for me. It\u2019s all I think about.\u201d</p><p>Her confession and the honesty in her voice cause me to wince. I grip the edge of the hood and turn toward her. She\u2019s looking down at her hands with a troubled expression on her face. \u201cYou think this is easy for me?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She glances at me and shrugs. \u201cWell, that\u2019s how you make it seem,\u201d she says.</p><p>Now would be the opportune moment to walk away. Walk away, Will.</p><p>\u201cLake, nothing about this has been easy,\u201d I whisper. I know beyond a doubt that I shouldn\u2019t be saying any of the things I\u2019ve been dying to say to her, but everything about her draws the truth out of me whether I want to share it or not. \u201cIt\u2019s a daily struggle for me to come to work, knowing this very job is what\u2019s keeping us apart.\u201d I turn away from the car and lean against it, next to her. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Caulder, I would have quit that first day I saw you in the hallway. I could have taken the year off . . . waited until you graduated to go back.\u201d I turn toward her and lower my voice. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve run every possible scenario through my mind. How do you think it makes me feel to know that I\u2019m the reason you\u2019re hurting? That I\u2019m the reason you\u2019re so sad?\u201d</p><p>I just said way too much. Way too much.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she stutters. \u201cI just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour battery is fine,\u201d I say as soon as I see Nick round the car next to us. \u201cLooks like it might be your alternator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar won\u2019t start?\u201d Nick says.</p><p>Layken looks at me wide-eyed, then turns around to face Nick. \u201cNo, Mr. Cooper thinks I need a new alternator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d Nick says as he glances under the hood. He looks back up at Lake. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride home if you need one.\u201d</p><p>As much as I\u2019d rather punch him than let him take her home, I know it\u2019s her only option right now because I sure as hell don\u2019t need to take her home.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great, Nick,\u201d I say. I shut the hood of the Jeep and walk away before I add to my long list of stupid decisions.</p><p>I SHOULD JUST pull the list of stupid decisions back out, because I\u2019m making another one right now.</p><p>We\u2019ve spent the last fifteen minutes frantically searching for Kel and Caulder. I\u2019d assumed they were at her house, she had assumed they were at mine. We finally found them passed out in the backseat of my car, where they still are. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, I\u2019m rummaging through my satchel, searching for the keys to her Jeep. I had my mechanic put a new alternator on it this afternoon, then stupidly invited her inside to give her the keys back. I say stupidly, because every ounce of my being doesn\u2019t want her to leave. My heart is pounding against my chest just being in her presence. I locate the keys and turn around to hand them to her. \u201cYour keys,\u201d I say, dropping them into her hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d she says, looking down at them. I\u2019m not sure what she expected me to hand her, but she seems disappointed that it\u2019s just her keys.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s running fine now,\u201d I say. \u201cYou should be able to drive it home tomorrow.\u201d I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll be the strong one right now and just leave. I can\u2019t bring myself to walk her back to the door, so I make my way back into the living room and sit on the couch. The conversation at her Jeep this afternoon lingers silent and thick in the air between us.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You fixed it?\u201d she says, following me into the living room.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t fix it. I know a guy who was able to put an alternator on it this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, you didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d she says. Rather than leave like we both know she should, she sits on the couch beside me. When her elbow grazes mine, I bring my hands up and clasp them behind my head. We can\u2019t even graze elbows without my wanting to reach over and kiss the hell out of her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, though. I\u2019ll pay you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You guys have helped me a lot with Caulder lately, it\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>She looks down at her hand and twirls the keys around. She runs her thumb over the Texas-shaped keychain and I can\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019d still rather be there right now.</p> <p>\u201cSo, can we finish our conversation from earlier?\u201d she says, still staring down at the keychain.</p><p>I already regret having said what I said at her Jeep today. I confessed way too much. I can\u2019t believe I told her I would have quit my job if it weren\u2019t for Caulder. I mean, it\u2019s the truth. As crazy and desperate as it sounds, I would have quit in a heartbeat. I\u2019m not so sure I still wouldn\u2019t if she would just ask me to.</p><p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you come up with a solution?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and looks up at me. \u201cWell, no,\u201d she says. She tosses her keys onto the coffee table and pulls her knee up, turning to face me on the couch. She sighs, almost as if she\u2019s afraid to ask me something. She runs her fingers over the throw pillow between us and traces the pattern without looking up at me. \u201cSuppose these feelings we have just get more . . . complex.\u201d She hesitates for a moment. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the idea of getting a GED.\u201d</p><p>Her plan is so absurd I almost have to hold back a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d I say, shooting a look in her direction. \u201cDon\u2019t even think like that. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re quitting school, Lake.\u201d</p><p>She tosses the pillow aside. \u201cIt was just an idea,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it was a dumb one.\u201d</p><p>Things grow quiet between us. The way she\u2019s turned toward me on the couch causes every muscle in my body to clench, even my jaw. I\u2019m trying so hard not to turn toward her, to take her in my arms. This entire situation isn\u2019t fair. If we were in any other circumstances, a relationship between us would be absolutely fine. Accepted. Normal. The only thing keeping us apart is a damn job title.</p><p>It\u2019s so hard having to hide how I feel about her when it\u2019s just the two of us. It would be so easy to just say \u201cTo hell with it,\u201d and do what I want to do. I know if I could just get past the moral aspect and the threat of getting caught, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat. I\u2019d take her in my arms and kiss her just like I\u2019ve been imagining for the past three weeks. I\u2019d kiss her mouth, I\u2019d kiss her cheek, I\u2019d kiss that line from her ear down to her shoulder that I can\u2019t stop staring at. She\u2019d let me, too. I know how hard this has been on her; I can see it in the way she carries herself now. She\u2019s depressed. I\u2019m almost tempted to make all of this easier on her and just act on my feelings. If neither of us says anything, no one would know. We could do this secretly until she graduated. If we were careful, we could even keep it from Julia and the boys.</p><p>I pop my knuckles behind my head in order to distract myself from pulling her mouth to mine. My heart is erratic just thinking about the possibility of kissing her again. I inhale through my nose and out my mouth, trying to physically calm myself before I do something stupid. Or smart. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s right or wrong when I\u2019m around her because what\u2019s wrong feels so right and what\u2019s right feels so wrong.</p><p>Her finger grazes across my neck and the unexpected touch causes me to flinch. She defensively holds up her finger to show me the shaving cream she just wiped off my neck. Without even thinking, I grab her hand to wipe it onto my shirt.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>As soon as my fingers touch hers, whatever conscious thoughts remained get wiped away right along with the shaving cream. My hand remains clasped on top of hers and she relaxes it onto my chest.</p><p>I\u2019ve reached the threshold of my willpower. My pulse is racing, my heart feels like it\u2019s about to explode. I can\u2019t let go of her hand and I can\u2019t stop looking into her eyes. In this moment, absolutely nothing is happening, but then again everything is happening. Every single second I silently look at her, holding on to her hand, erases days of willpower and determination I spent keeping my distance. Every ounce of energy I\u2019ve put into doing the right thing has all been in vain.</p> <p>\u201cWill?\u201d she whispers without breaking her gaze. The way my name flows from her lips makes my pulse go haywire. She strokes her thumb ever so slightly across my chest\u2014a movement she may not have even been aware of, but one that I feel all the way to my core. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil I graduate.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words come from her lips, I exhale and close my eyes. She just said what I\u2019ve wanted to hear from her for an entire month. I stroke my thumb across the back of her hand and sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s a long wait, Lake. A lot can happen in a year.\u201d</p><p>She scoots closer to me on the couch. She removes her hand from my chest and lightly touches my jaw with the tips of her fingers, pulling my gaze back to hers. I refuse to look into her eyes. I know if I do, I\u2019ll give in and kiss her. I slide my fingers down her hand with every intention of stopping at her wrist to pull her hand from my face. Instead, my fingers trail past her wrist and slowly graze up the length of her arm. I need to stop. I need to pull back, but my willpower and my heart are suddenly at war.</p><p>I pull my legs off the coffee table in front of me. I\u2019m hoping she pushes me away from her\u2014does what we both know one of us needs to do. When she doesn\u2019t, I find myself drawing in closer. I just want to put my arms around her and hold her. I want to hold her like I held her outside Club N9NE before all of this became out of our control. Before it became this overwhelming, convoluted mess.</p><p>Before I can stop myself or give myself time to think about it\u2014my lips meet her neck, and all hell breaks loose inside me. She wraps her arms around me and inhales a breath deep enough for the both of us. The feel and taste of her skin against my lips is enough to completely wipe away the rest of my conscience.</p><p>To hell with it.</p><p>I kiss across her collarbone, up her neck and to her jaw, then take her face in my hands and pull back to look her in the eyes. I need to know we\u2019re on the same page. I need to know that she wants this as bad as I do. That she needs this as bad as I do.</p><p>The sadness in her eyes that has consumed her for the past three weeks is nonexistent right now. There\u2019s hope in her eyes again, and I want nothing more than to somehow help her maintain whatever it is she\u2019s feeling right now. I slowly lean in and press my lips against hers. The sensation from the kiss both kills me and brings me back to life in the same breath. She quietly gasps, then parts her lips for me, taking a fist of my shirt in her hands, gently pulling me closer.</p><p>I kiss her.</p><p>I kiss her like it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever kissed her.</p><p>I kiss her like it\u2019s the last time I\u2019ll ever kiss her.</p><p>Her hands are around my neck\u2014my lips are caressing hers. Holding her in my arms right now feels like I\u2019m taking the first breath I\u2019ve taken since that moment I saw her standing in the hallway. Every moan from her mouth and every touch of her hands brings me back to life. Nothing and no one can come between us and this moment. Not Caulder, not my morals, not my job, not my school, not Julia.</p><p>Julia.</p><p>I clench my fists, fighting against the pull to release her when reality hits. The heaviness of the situation comes crashing back down on me like a ton of bricks, forcing itself into the forefront of my mind. Lake has no idea what\u2019s about to happen to her life, and I\u2019m allowing myself to complicate it even more? With every movement of my mouth against hers, I\u2019m pulling us further and further into a hole we aren\u2019t going to be able to crawl out of.</p><p>She runs her hands through my hair and begins to lower herself back onto the couch, pulling me with her. I know once our bodies are meshed together on this couch, neither one of us will be strong enough to stop.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this to her. There is so much more going on in her life than she\u2019s even aware of. What the hell am I thinking adding this kind of stress to that? I swore to Julia I wouldn\u2019t complicate Lake\u2019s life, and that\u2019s precisely what I\u2019m doing. I somehow find the strength to tear my lips apart from hers and pull away. When I do, we both gasp for air.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop,\u201d I say, breathless. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this.\u201d I squeeze my eyes shut and cover them with my forearm, giving myself a minute to regroup. I feel her inching closer to me. She pulls herself onto my lap and forces her lips onto mine again in a desperate plea to keep going. The second our lips meet, I instinctively wrap my arms around her and pull her closer. My conscience is literally screaming at me so loud, I pull her face to mine even harder in an attempt to squelch the internal voice. My mind is telling me to do one thing; my heart and my hands are begging me to do another. She grasps my shirt and slips it over my head, then returns her lips to my mouth where they belong.</p><p>In my mind I\u2019m pushing her away, but in reality I\u2019ve got one hand on her lower back, pulling her against me, and my other hand gripping the nape of her neck. She runs her hands over my chest and I have a huge urge to do the same to her. Just as I grasp the hem of her shirt, I clench my fists and release it. I\u2019ve already let it go way too far. I\u2019ve got to put an end to this before I can\u2019t. It\u2019s entirely my responsibility to make sure she doesn\u2019t get hurt again, and right now I\u2019m dropping the ball completely.</p><p>I push her off me and back onto the couch, then stand up. I\u2019ve got one chance to prove to her that this is bad. As good as it feels, it\u2019s wrong. So wrong.</p><p>\u201cLayken, get up!\u201d I demand, taking her hand. I\u2019m so incredibly flustered right now, I don\u2019t mean for my reaction to come off so harsh, but I don\u2019t know how else to react. I\u2019m so pissed at myself I want to scream, but I struggle with the attempt to calm my nerves. She stands up with a look of embarrassment and confusion across her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis\u2014this can\u2019t happen!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m your teacher now.

She doesn\u2019t need this right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Layken, but it\u2019s not right,\u201d I say as I pace the floor. \u201cThis isn\u2019t good for either of us. This isn\u2019t good for you.\u201d</p> <p>She glares at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for me,\u201d she snaps.</p><p>I\u2019ve really screwed this up. Royally. I need to fix it now. I need to end it now. For good. She can\u2019t leave here thinking this is going to happen again. I stop pacing and turn toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t wait for me. I won\u2019t let you give up what should be the best year of your life. I had to grow up way too fast; I\u2019m not taking that away from you, too. It wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d I inhale a breath and tell the biggest lie I\u2019ve ever told. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to wait for me, Layken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be giving anything up,\u201d she replies weakly.</p><p>The pain in her voice is too much, causing me to have an overwhelming urge to hug her again. I can\u2019t take these emotional swings anymore. One minute I\u2019m wanting to kiss the living hell out of her and take her in my arms and protect her from every tear that\u2019s about to come her way, then the next minute my conscience kicks in and I want to kick her out of my house. I\u2019ve hurt her so bad and she has no idea how much worse her life is about to get. Just knowing this makes me hate myself for what I just allowed to happen. Despise myself, even.</p> <p>I grab my shirt and pull it over my head, then move across the living room to the back of the couch. I take a deep breath, feeling slightly more in control the farther away I am from her. I grip the back of the couch and prepare an attempt to rectify a nonrectifiable situation. If I could just get her to understand where I\u2019m coming from, maybe she wouldn\u2019t take it so hard.</p><p>\u201cMy life is nothing but responsibilities. I\u2019m raising a child, for Christ\u2019s sake. I wouldn\u2019t be able to put your needs first. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to put them second.\u201d I raise my head and meet her eyes. \u201cYou deserve better than third.\u201d</p><p>She stands up and crosses the living room, kneeling on the couch in front of me. \u201cYour responsibilities should come before me, which is why I want to wait for you, Will. You\u2019re a good person. This thing about you that you think is your flaw\u2014it\u2019s the reason I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Whatever was left of my heart before those words left her mouth is in a million pieces now. I can\u2019t let her do this. I can\u2019t let her feel this way. The only thing I can do to make her stop loving me is to make her start hating me. I bring my hands up to meet her cheeks and I look her in the eyes, then I say the hardest words that I\u2019ll ever have to say. \u201cYou are not falling in love with me. You cannot fall in love with me.\u201d As soon as I see the tears welling in the corners of her eyes, I have to drop my hands and head toward the front door. I can\u2019t watch her cry. I don\u2019t want to see what I\u2019m doing to her right now.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened tonight\u2014\u201d I point to the couch. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen again. That won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>I open the front door and shut it behind me, then lean against the door and close my eyes. I rub my hands over my face and attempt to calm myself down. This is all my fault. I allowed her into my house, knowing how weak I am around her. I kissed her. I kissed her. I can\u2019t believe all of this just happened. Twenty minutes alone with her and I somehow screw her life up even more.</p> <p>Seeing her sitting on the couch just now, dumbfounded and heartbroken because of my actions and my words . . . I hate myself. Pretty sure Lake hates me now, too. I hope it was worth it. Somehow doing the right thing in this situation seems completely and utterly wrong.</p><p>I walk to the car and pull Caulder out. He wraps his arms around my neck without even waking up. Kel opens his eyes and looks around, confused.</p><p>\u201cYou guys fell asleep in the car. Go home and go to bed, okay?\u201d</p><p>He rubs his eyes and crawls out of the car, then makes his way across the street. When I walk back through the front door holding Caulder, Lake is still sitting on the couch, staring at the floor. As much as I want to grab her and tell her I\u2019m so, so sorry for this entire night, I realize she needs this to get past whatever it is going on between us. She needs to be angry at me. And Julia needs her to be focused this year. She can\u2019t have Lake wrapped up in us when it might be the last year she ever gets to spend with her mom.</p><p>\u201cKel woke up, he\u2019s walking home now. You should go, too,\u201d I say.</p><p>She snatches the keys off the table in front of her and turns to face me. She looks me straight in the eyes; tears streaming down her face. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d she says, her words like a bullet of truth straight through my heart. She walks out and slams the door behind her.</p><p>I take Caulder to his room and tuck him in, then walk to my bedroom. When I close the door behind me, I lean against it and close my eyes, then slide down the length of the door until I meet the floor. I press the heels of my palms against my eyes, holding back the tears.</p><p>God, this girl. This girl is the only girl I care about, and I just gave her every reason in the world to hate me.</p> <p>11.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M SO, SO sorry, Will,\u201d she whispers. She puts her hands over her face and covers her eyes. \u201cI feel horrible. Terrible. And selfish. I didn\u2019t know how hard it was for you, too. I just thought you kicked me out because I wasn\u2019t worth the risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLake, you didn\u2019t know what all was going through my mind. For all you knew I was just some jerk who kissed you, then kicked you out of my house. I never blamed you. And you were absolutely worth the risk. If it weren\u2019t for knowing what I knew about Julia, I would have never let you go.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her hands away from her face and turns to me. \u201cOh, my god, and those names. I never did apologize for that.\u201d She rolls on top of me and brings her face inches from mine. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I called you all those names the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d I shrug. \u201cI sort of deserved it.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit here and tell me that didn\u2019t piss you off. I mean, I called you thirty different names in front of the entire class!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t piss me off. I just said I deserved it.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cSo you were mad at me.\u201d She lies back down on her pillow. \u201cLet me hear it,\u201d she says.</p><p>regrets</p><p>I\u2019VE GONE AS slowly as possible. I\u2019ve called on each student, never rushed them, never even timed them. Usually they don\u2019t spit them out this fast. Of course, as soon as Gavin finishes his poem, there\u2019s still five minutes to spare. I have no choice but to call on her. I waited until last, hoping the bell would ring. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m trying to spare her from having to get up and speak after what happened between us last night, or if I\u2019m scared to death about what she might say. Either way, it\u2019s her turn and I have no choice but to call her up.</p><p>I clear my throat and attempt to say her name, but it comes out all mangled. She walks to the front of the room and leaves her poem on her desk. I know for a fact she didn\u2019t write a single word yesterday in class. And considering the events that transpired in my living room last night, I doubt she was in the right mindset to even write one. However, she appears unwavering and confident and has apparently memorized whatever it is she\u2019s about to perform. It sort of terrifies me.</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d she says before she begins.</p><p>Shit. What the hell could she possibly need to ask? She left so angry last night, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she outs me right here and now. Hell, she\u2019s probably about to ask me if I kick all my students out of my house after I make out with them. I nod, giving her the go-ahead for her question . . . but all I really want to do is run to the bathroom and puke.</p><p>\u201cIs there a time minimum?\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. She\u2019s actually asking a normal question. I breathe a sigh of relief and clear my throat. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Remember, there are no rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cOkay, then. My poem is called Mean.\u201d</p><p>The blood rushes from my head and pools in my heart as soon as the title flows from her mouth. She turns toward the room and begins.</p><p>According to the thesaurus . . .</p><p>and according to me . . .</p><p>there are over thirty different meanings and substitutions for the word</p><p>mean.</p><p>(SHE RAISES HER voice and yells the rest of the poem, causing me to flinch.)</p><p>Jackass, jerk, cruel, dickhead, unkind, harsh, wicked, hateful, heartless, vicious, virulent, unrelenting, tyrannical, malevolent, atrocious, bastard, barbarous, bitter, brutal, callous, degenerate, brutish, depraved, evil, fierce, hard, implacable, rancorous, pernicious, inhumane, monstrous, merciless, inexorable.</p><p>And my personal favorite\u2014asshole.</p><p>MY PULSE IS pounding almost as fast as the insults are flying out of her mouth. When the bell rings, I sit stunned as most of the students make their way past my desk. I can\u2019t believe she just did that!</p><p>\u201cThe date,\u201d I hear Eddie saying to her. The word \u201cdate\u201d snaps me back into the moment. \u201cYou said you\u2019d have to ask your mom?\u201d Eddie says. They\u2019re standing next to Lake\u2019s desk and Eddie has her back turned to me.</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d Lake says. She looks over Eddie\u2019s shoulder and directly at me. \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d she says. \u201cTell Nick I\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never had a problem with my temper before, but it\u2019s almost as if the day I met Lake, every single emotion I had was multiplied by a thousand. Happiness, hurt, anger, bitterness, love, jealousy. I\u2019m unable to control any of it when I\u2019m around her. The fact that she apparently had been asked out by Nick before our little incident last night somehow pisses me off even more. I glare at her, open my drawer, and shove my grade book inside it, then slam it shut. When Eddie spins around, startled at the noise, I quickly stand up and begin wiping the board.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Eddie says, her attention back to Lake now. \u201cOh, and we decided on Thursday so after Getty\u2019s we can go to the slam. We\u2019ve only got a few weeks, might as well get it out of the way. You want us to pick you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sure,\u201d Lake says.</p><p>Lake could have at least had the decency to agree to a date when she\u2019s not standing five feet from me. As much as I want her to be pissed at me, I never thought I\u2019d be pissed at her. But she seems intent on ensuring that that happens. Once Eddie leaves the classroom, I drop the eraser and turn back toward Lake. I fold my arms across my chest and watch as she gathers her things and heads toward the door, not once looking in my direction. Before she exits, I say something I regret before I even say it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLayken.\u201d</p><p>She pauses when she gets to the door, but doesn\u2019t turn around to face me.</p><p>\u201cYour mom works Thursday nights,\u201d I say. \u201cI always get a sitter for Thursdays since I go to the slams. Just send Kel over before you leave. You know, before your date.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t turn around. She doesn\u2019t yell. She doesn\u2019t throw anything at me. She simply walks out the door, leaving me feeling as though I\u2019m every single one of those names she just yelled in my classroom.</p> <p>After fourth period, I sit at my desk and stare at nothing at all, wondering what the hell has gotten into me. I usually go to the teachers\u2019 lounge for lunch, but I know I can\u2019t eat right now. My stomach is in knots thinking about the last two hours. Actually, the last twenty-four hours.</p><p>Why would I say that to her? I know her poem stirred something in me unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt. It was a mixture of embarrassment, anger, hurt, and heartache. But that wasn\u2019t enough for her\u2014she had to go and add jealousy on top of all that. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about today, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t handle jealousy well. At all.</p><p>I know I thought the best way to help her get over me was to make sure she hated me, but I just can\u2019t do it. If I want to keep my own sanity, I can\u2019t let her hate me. I can\u2019t let her love me, though, either. Shit! This is so screwed up. How the hell am I going to make this right?</p><p>WHEN I REACH their table in the lunchroom, she\u2019s not even joined in on the conversation taking place around her. She\u2019s staring down at her tray, oblivious to the world. Oblivious to me. Eddie and I both try to get her attention. When she finally snaps out of her trance and looks up at me, the color runs from her face. She slowly rises from the table and follows me to the classroom. When we\u2019re safely inside I close the door and walk past her to my desk.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d I say. My head is spinning and I have no idea what I even want to say to her. I know I want to apologize for the way I reacted earlier in class, but the words aren\u2019t coming. I\u2019m a grown man acting like a blubbering fourteen-year-old boy.</p> <p>\u201cThen talk,\u201d she snaps. She\u2019s standing across the room glaring at me. Her current attitude coupled with the fact that she just agreed to go out on a date with another guy right in front of me infuriates me. I know everything about our situation is my fault, but she\u2019s not doing anything to help it.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Lake!\u201d I spin away from her, frustrated. I run my hands through my hair and take a deep breath, then turn back to face her. \u201cI\u2019m not your enemy. Stop hating me.\u201d</p><p>I swear she chuckles under her breath right before her eyes fill with fury. \u201cStop hating you?\u201d she says, rushing toward me. \u201cMake up your freaking mind, Will! Last night, you told me to stop loving you, now you\u2019re telling me to stop hating you? You tell me you don\u2019t want me to wait on you, yet you act like an immature little boy when I agree to go out with Nick! You want me to act like I don\u2019t know you, but then you pull me out of the lunchroom in front of everyone! We\u2019ve got this whole fa\u00e7ade between us, like we\u2019re different people all the time, and it\u2019s exhausting! I never know when you\u2019re Will or Mr. Cooper and I really don\u2019t know when I\u2019m supposed to be Layken or Lake.\u201d</p><p>She throws herself into a chair and folds her arms across her chest, letting out a rush of frustrated breath. She\u2019s eyeing me sharply, waiting for me to say or do something. There isn\u2019t anything to say. I can\u2019t refute a single word she just said, because it\u2019s the truth. The fact that I haven\u2019t been able to keep my own feelings in check have done more damage to her than I ever imagined.</p><p>I slowly walk around her desk and sit in the seat behind her. I\u2019m exhausted. Emotionally, physically, mentally. I never imagined it would turn into this. If I had the slightest clue that the decision to keep my job over her would have this kind of effect on me, I would have picked her, despite whatever is going on with Julia. I should have picked her. I still should pick her.</p><p>I lean forward until I\u2019m close to her ear. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be this hard,\u201d I whisper. And that\u2019s the truth. Never in a million years did I think something as trivial as a first date could turn into something so incredibly complicated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said that to you earlier, about Thursday,\u201d I say. \u201cI was being sincere\u2014for the most part. I know you\u2019ll need someone to watch Kel and I did make the slam a required assignment. But I shouldn\u2019t have reacted like that. That\u2019s why I asked you to come here; I just needed to apologize. It won\u2019t happen again, I swear.\u201d</p> <p>I hear her sniff, which only means she\u2019s crying. Jesus. I keep making this worse for her when all I want to do is fix it. I lift my hand to stroke the back of her hair in reassurance when the door to my classroom opens. I immediately pull my hand back and stand up, a hasty move that reeks of guilt. Eddie is standing in the doorway to the classroom holding Lake\u2019s backpack. She glances at me, then we both simultaneously look at Lake. Turning her head away from Eddie and toward me, I finally see the tears streaming down Lake\u2019s cheeks. The tears I put there.</p><p>Eddie sets the backpack in a desk and holds her palms up, backing out of the doorway. \u201cMy bad. Continue,\u201d she says.</p><p>As soon as the door is closed behind her, I begin to panic. Whatever Eddie just witnessed, it obviously wasn\u2019t a conversation between a teacher and his student. I\u2019ve just added yet another shit-tastic thing to my list of screw-ups.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just great,\u201d I mumble. How the hell do I even begin to fix all of this?</p><p>Lake rises out of her seat and begins walking toward the door. \u201cLet it go, Will. If she asks me about it, I\u2019ll just tell her you were upset because I said asshole. And jackass. And dickhead. And bastar\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get your point,\u201d I say, interrupting her before she can finish her stream of insults. She picks up her backpack and reaches the door.</p><p>\u201cLayken?\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cI also want to say I\u2019m sorry . . . about last night.\u201d</p><p>She slowly turns toward me. The tears have stopped but the residual effects of her mood are still written across her face. \u201cAre you sorry it happened? Or sorry about the way you stopped it?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t really understand what the difference is. I shrug my shoulders. \u201cAll of it. It never should have happened.\u201d</p><p>She turns her back to me and opens the door. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>The insult cuts straight to my heart, right where she intended for it to hit.</p><p>As soon as the door closes behind her, I kick the desk over. \u201cShit!\u201d I yell, squeezing the tension out of my neck with my hands. I let out a steady stream of cusswords as I pace the classroom. Not only have I screwed this up even worse with Lake, I\u2019ve also screwed it up by making Eddie suspicious. I feel like I\u2019ve somehow made this entire situation ten times worse. God, what I wouldn\u2019t give for my father\u2019s advice right now.</p><p>MRS. ALEX AND her pointless questions once again make me late for third period. I don\u2019t really mind being late today, though. After the interaction in my classroom yesterday with Lake, I\u2019m still not ready to face her.</p><p>The hallways have cleared out and I\u2019m nearing my classroom when I pass by the windows that look out over the courtyard. I stop in my tracks and step closer to the window and I see Lake. She\u2019s sitting on one of the benches, looking down at her hands. I\u2019m a little confused, since she should be sitting in my classroom right now. She looks up at the sky and lets out a deep sigh, like she\u2019s trying not to cry. It\u2019s apparent that the last place she can be right now is two feet from me in a classroom. Seeing her out there, choosing the bitter Michigan air over my classroom, makes me hurt for her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s something else, huh?\u201d</p><p>I spin around and Eddie is standing behind me with her arms crossed, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, undoubtedly trying to recover from the fact that she just caught me staring at Lake.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d she says, walking past me toward the courtyard entry. \u201cAnd you agree with me, too.\u201d She walks out into the courtyard without turning back. When Lake looks up at her and smiles, I walk away.</p><p>It\u2019s not a big deal. Lake is a student skipping my class and I was looking at her. That\u2019s all. There wasn\u2019t anything happening there that Eddie could report. Despite my failed attempts at reassuring myself, I spend the rest of the day a nervous wreck.</p><p>12.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cLET ME GET this straight,\u201d Lake says, glaring at me. \u201cYou were being an idiot, staring at me through the courtyard window. Eddie sees you staring at me, which only piques her curiosity at this point. But then the next weekend in your living room when Eddie figured it all out, you get mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t mad at you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWill, you were pissed! You kicked me out of your house!\u201d</p><p>I roll over and think back to that night. \u201cI guess I did, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd on the worst day of my life at that.\u201d She rolls over on top of me and interlocks her fingers with mine, bringing them over my head. \u201cI think you owe me an apology. After all, I did clean your entire house that day.\u201d</p><p>I look her in the eyes and she\u2019s grinning. I know she\u2019s not upset, but I actually do want to give her a sincere apology. The way I acted at the end of that day was purely selfish, and I\u2019ve always regretted how I just kicked her out at one of the lowest points of her life. I bring my hands to her cheeks and pull her to the pillow next to me while we change positions. I lay her on her back and rest my head on my propped-up hand, stroking her face with my other hand. I run my fingers up her cheek, over her forehead, and down her nose until my fingers come to rest on her lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the way I treated you that night,\u201d I whisper, bringing my lips to hers. I kiss her slowly at first, but the sincerity in my apology is apparently quite attractive to her, because she pushes my arm away and pulls me to her, then whispers, \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT ARE YOU doing?\u201d I ask, waking up from a nap induced by pure exhaustion. Lake has her shirt on and is pulling her jeans up.</p><p>\u201cI need some fresh air. Wanna come?\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a really nice pool area and it doesn\u2019t close for another hour or so. We can sit on the patio and have coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d I roll out of bed and search for my clothes.</p><p>Once we\u2019re outside, the courtyard is empty, as is the pool, even though it\u2019s heated. There are several lounge chairs, but Lake takes a seat at a table with bench-style chairs so we can sit together. She curls up next to me and rests her head against my arm, holding her coffee cup between her hands.</p><p>\u201cI hope the boys are having fun,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou know they are. Grandpaul took them geocaching today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cKel loves that.\u201d She brings her coffee cup to her lips and sips from it. We watch the moon\u2019s reflection on the surface of the water, listening to the sounds of the night. It\u2019s peaceful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe had a pool back in Texas,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as big as this one, but it was nice. It gets so hot there that the water in the pool would feel like it was heated, even when it wasn\u2019t. I bet Texas water on its coldest day is still hotter than this heated pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a good swimmer?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I lived in that pool half the year.\u201d</p><p>I lean in and kiss her, distracting her from the fact that I\u2019m taking the coffee cup out of her hands. I slowly lean over her, hooking my arm underneath her knees. She\u2019s used to my public displays of affection, so she\u2019s none the wiser. As soon as she runs her hands through my hair, I lift her onto my lap and stand up, heading for the water. She pulls her lips from mine and darts her eyes to the pool, then back at me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, Will Cooper!\u201d</p><p>I laugh and keep walking toward the pool as she starts struggling to get out of my arms. When I reach the deep end of the pool, she\u2019s clinging to my neck for dear life.</p><p>\u201cIf I go, you go,\u201d she says.</p><p>I smile and kick off my shoes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I toss her into the water, I jump in after her. When she emerges, she swims toward me laughing. \u201cThese are my only clothes, you jerk!\u201d</p> <p>When she reaches me I wrap my arms around her and she pulls her legs up, wrapping them around my waist. She hooks her arms around my neck and I swim backward until my back meets the tile siding of the pool. I put one arm on the concrete ledge to hold us up and my other arm I secure around her waist, holding her against me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to throw this shirt away now. The chlorine probably just ruined it,\u201d she says.</p><p>I slide my hand underneath her shirt and up her back, then press my lips against the area of skin right below her ear. \u201cIf you throw this ugly shirt away, I\u2019m divorcing you.\u201d</p><p>She throws her head back and laughs. \u201cFinally! You love my ugly shirt!\u201d</p><p>I pull her against me so close that even the water can\u2019t pass between us. I bring my forehead to hers. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved this shirt, Lake. This is the shirt you were wearing the night I finally admitted to myself that I was in love with you.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her lip curls up into a grin. \u201cAnd what night was that?\u201d</p> <p>I tilt my head back until it rests against the concrete siding and look up to the sky. \u201cNot a good one.\u201d</p><p>She kisses me at the base of my throat. \u201cTell me anyway,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>i love her</p><p>\u201cCAULDER, ARE YOU sure Julia said it was okay for you to stay the night?\u201d He\u2019s rummaging through his dresser looking for socks while Kel loads a bag with their toys.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She said I can\u2019t come over tomorrow night because they\u2019re having family night, so I should spend the night tonight.\u201d</p><p>Family night? I wonder if that means Julia is finally telling Lake she\u2019s sick. A knot forms in my stomach and I instantly become nervous for her. \u201cI\u2019ll get your toothbrush, Caulder.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in the bathroom packing a bag for Caulder when I hear yelling coming from outside. I immediately run to the living room window and see Lake storming out of her house toward Eddie\u2019s car. I can\u2019t hear what she\u2019s saying, but it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s pissed. Her face is almost the same shade of red as the shirt she has on. She swings open Eddie\u2019s back door and turns around, still yelling.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see Julia.</p> <p>The look on her face makes my heart sink. Eddie\u2019s car pulls out of the driveway and Julia is left standing at the edge of the yard crying as she watches them pull away. As soon as the car is gone, I swing open the front door and run across the street.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay? Is she okay?\u201d I say when I reach her. Julia looks up at me and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Lake that I\u2019m sick?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer immediately. \u201cNo, I told you I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julia stares down the street, still shaking her head. \u201cI think she knows. I don\u2019t know how she found out but she knows. I should have told her sooner,\u201d she says, still crying.</p><p>The front door to my house slams shut and I spin around to see Kel and Caulder making their way out the front door. \u201cBoys! You guys are staying with me tonight instead. Go back inside,\u201d I yell. They roll their eyes and groan, and then head back into the house.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Will,\u201d Julia says. She turns to head back to her house and I follow after her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay with you until she gets back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI just want to be alone for a while.\u201d She walks inside and closes the door behind her.</p><p>I spend the next two hours debating whether to text Gavin. It\u2019s killing me not knowing if Lake is okay or not. I wait on the couch with the living room curtains wide open, watching for her return. It\u2019s after eleven o\u2019clock now, and I can\u2019t wait a second longer. I throw caution out the window and grab my phone to text Gavin.</p><p>Is Lake okay? Where are you guys? Is she spending the night with Eddie or coming home tonight?</p><p>I don\u2019t have to wait long before he replies.</p><p>Yes. Movies. No.</p><p>What the hell? Could he not elaborate a little?</p><p>How can she be okay? And why the hell would you guys take her to a movie when she\u2019s this upset?</p><p>Two minutes go by without a response, so I text him again.</p><p>Is she still crying? When are you guys bringing her home?</p><p>I wait a few more minutes without a response, then begin texting him again. Before I hit send, my phone rings.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say, almost desperately.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Will?\u201d Gavin yells into the phone. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a psycho boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she with you right now?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe movie just let out, she\u2019s in the restroom with Eddie. I came outside to call you because I think you might need a reminder that you\u2019re her teacher.\u201d</p><p>I grip my cell phone and shake it out of frustration, then put it back to my ear.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter right now. I saw her leaving after she found out about her mom\u2019s cancer. I just need to know that she\u2019s okay, Gavin. I\u2019m worried about her.\u201d</p><p>I get nothing but silence. Gavin doesn\u2019t respond, but I can hear background noise so I know we\u2019re still connected. \u201cGavin?\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cHer mom has cancer? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. Has Lake not told you guys why she was crying when she got in your car? Julia doesn\u2019t know how, but Layken somehow figured it out.\u201d</p><p>Gavin is silent again for a few more seconds, then he sighs heavily into the phone. \u201cWill,\u201d he says, his voice lower than before. \u201cLayken thinks her mom has a new boyfriend. She has no idea she has cancer.\u201d</p><p>I fall onto the couch, but it feels like my heart falls straight through the floor.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d Gavin says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I say. \u201cJust get her home, Gavin. She needs to talk to her mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>I SPEND THE next several minutes debating whether to go across the street and let Julia know that Layken has misunderstood everything. Unfortunately, by the time I decide to go talk to her, Eddie\u2019s car is pulling into their driveway. I watch as Lake gets out and walks to her front door. When she goes inside, I close my curtains and turn out the light. I wish more than anything I could be there for her right now. I know the heartache she\u2019s about to experience. The fact that I\u2019m a hundred yards away and not able to do a damn thing about it is the hardest thing of all.</p><p>I walk to Caulder\u2019s room and check on the boys. They\u2019re both passed out, so I turn the TV off and shut their door, then head to my room. I can already tell it\u2019s going to be a sleepless night. I can just imagine Lake crying herself to sleep. God, what I wouldn\u2019t give to be able to hold her right now. If I could just take all of this away from her, I would.</p><p>I\u2019m lying with my hands under my head, my eyes focused on nothing in particular. A tear rolls down to my temple and I wipe it away. I\u2019m torn up over the sadness I feel for this girl.</p><p>IT\u2019S HALF AN hour later when I hear a knock on the living room door. I immediately jump out of bed and run to the living room and swing the door open. She\u2019s standing on my patio, mascara streaked down her cheeks. She\u2019s wiping her eyes with her shirt and she looks up at me. All the things I\u2019ve been willing myself to do for the entire past month get shoved aside by the sheer sadness in her eyes. I put my arm around her and pull her inside, then shut the door behind her. I\u2019m positive she knows the truth about her mom at this point, but I still proceed with caution.</p><p>\u201cLake, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She tries to catch her breath, sucking in gasps of air between sobs. I can feel her melting, so I wrap my arms around her as she sinks to the floor. I sink with her, then pull her to me and let her cry. I rest my chin on top of her head and stroke her hair while she continues to cry for several minutes. I grasp the back of her shirt and bury my head in the crevice of her neck, fully aware of the fact that she came to me. She needed someone, and she came to me.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d I finally whisper.</p><p>She begins to sob, so I pull her closer. Between breaths, she says the words that I know are the hardest words she\u2019ll ever have to say. \u201cShe\u2019s dying, Will. She has cancer.\u201d</p><p>I know from experience that there are no words comforting enough to follow that. I squeeze her and give her what she needs. Silent reassurance. I pick her up and take her to my bedroom, then lay her on the bed and pull the covers over her. My doorbell rings, so I bend forward and kiss her on the forehead, then head back to the living room.</p><p>I already know it\u2019s Julia before I open the door. When I see her, she looks in just as bad shape as Lake does. \u201cIs she here?\u201d she says through her tears.</p><p>I nudge my head toward my bedroom. \u201cShe\u2019s lying down,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cCan you get her? She needs to come home so we can talk about this.\u201d</p><p>I glance back toward the hallway and sigh. I don\u2019t want her to go. I know how much she needs this time to absorb everything. I turn back to Julia and take the biggest risk I\u2019ve ever taken in my life.</p><p>\u201cLet her stay, Julia. She needs me right now.\u201d</p><p>Julia doesn\u2019t respond for a moment. The fact that I\u2019m disagreeing with her seems to throw her off for a moment. She shakes her head. \u201cI can\u2019t, Will. I can\u2019t let her stay the night here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in her shoes before. She needs time to absorb this, trust me. Just give her the night to calm down.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s shoulders fall and she looks down, unable to look at me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because she\u2019s angry with me for wanting Lake to stay, or heartbroken because she knows I\u2019m right. She nods, then turns and begins walking back toward her house. Her defeated demeanor makes me feel as though I just broke her heart. She thinks she\u2019s losing Lake to me and that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.</p><p>\u201cJulia, wait,\u201d I say, calling after her. She pauses in my front yard and turns to face me. When we make eye contact, she immediately shifts her gaze to the ground again and puts her hands on her hips. When I reach her, she still doesn\u2019t look at me. I\u2019m not sure what to say. I clear my throat, but have no idea what to say to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen, Julia,\u201d I say. \u201cI know how much your time with Lake means to you, I do. Believe me, I do. I want her to be there for you. The fact that she wants to be here right now instead doesn\u2019t mean anything. She just needs to process this. That\u2019s all. You won\u2019t lose her.\u201d</p><p>She runs her hands across her eyes, wiping away fresh tears. She kicks at the ground beneath her foot, giving herself a second to gather her thoughts. She eventually raises her head and looks me straight in the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I pause.</p><p>Am I?</p> <p>I sigh and clasp my hands behind my head, not sure what to say. \u201cI\u2019m trying so hard not to be,\u201d I say quietly, admitting it to myself for the first time.</p><p>When she hears my confession, she looks up at me, her expression stoic. \u201cTry harder, Will. I need her. I can\u2019t have her wrapped up in this whirlwind, forbidden romance. That\u2019s the last thing we need right now.\u201d Julia shakes her head then looks away again. Her disappointment stings. I\u2019ve let her down.</p><p>I take a step closer to her and look her in the eyes, making another promise that I pray to God I\u2019m strong enough to keep. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how I feel about her, okay? I don\u2019t want her consumed by what\u2019s going on between us any more than you do. She just needs a friend right now, that\u2019s all this is.\u201d</p><p>She hugs herself and looks past me at my house. \u201cI\u2019ll let her stay tonight,\u201d she finally says. \u201cBut only because I agree with you that she needs time to process everything.\u201d She shifts her gaze back to mine. The tears still fresh in her eyes, I can do nothing but nod in agreement. She returns my acknowledgment with her own nod, then turns to head home. \u201cYou better sleep on the couch,\u201d she says over her shoulder.</p><p>After Julia is back inside, I return to my own house and lock the front door. I walk into the bedroom but Lake doesn\u2019t acknowledge me. I slide into the bed behind her, placing one arm under her head and my other arm over her chest. I pull her to me and hold her while she cries herself to sleep.</p> <p>13.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>WE REMAIN RELAXED in the water, holding on to each other. She\u2019s resting her head on my shoulder, quiet and still. She presses her lips against my shoulder, opening them slightly, and she kisses me. I inhale as she grazes my shoulder with her lips, softly kissing along my collarbone, then up to my neck. When she reaches my jaw, she pulls back and looks at me. \u201cI love you, Will Cooper,\u201d she says with tears in her eyes. She leans in and presses her lips to mine. She tightens her grip around my waist with her legs and places her hands on the back of my head, filling me with slow, deep kisses. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever kissed me with such intensity and passion before. It\u2019s like she\u2019s somehow trying to show her gratitude through her kiss.</p><p>I let her. I let her thank me for a good five minutes.</p><p>When her lips finally separate from mine, she unwraps her legs from around me and grins. \u201cThat was for loving me like you do.\u201d</p><p>She kicks off the wall and floats on her back across the pool. When she reaches the other side, she props her elbows up behind her on the concrete ledge and smiles at me from across the pool. I\u2019m left breathless, wishing we were back in the hotel room already.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you like my shirt now,\u201d she says, still grinning mischievously.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>She releases her grip on the ledge and brings her hand to the top button of her shirt. \u201cBecause,\u201d she says in a sexy whisper. \u201cI\u2019m really tired of wearing it.\u201d She unbuttons the top button, revealing the outline of her bra. As many times as I\u2019ve seen that bra in the last twenty-four hours, it\u2019s a whole hell of a lot sexier right now.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. As much as I want that shirt off her, we\u2019re in the courtyard of a hotel. I look around nervously to make sure no one is out here. When I look back at her, the second button is unbuttoned and her fingers are already working on the third. She hasn\u2019t taken her eyes off mine.</p><p>\u201cLake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says innocently. The fourth button is undone now and she\u2019s working on the fifth.</p><p>I slowly shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>She slides the shirt halfway down her shoulders, revealing the entire bra now. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>I try to think of why it\u2019s not a good idea, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t think. All I want to do is help her finish getting the damn shirt off. I swim across the water and ease closer to her until our faces are just inches apart. Without taking my eyes off hers, I grasp the sleeves of her shirt and pull it the rest of the way down her arms, then yank it off completely. I throw the shirt onto the concrete patio, then lower my hands to the button on her jeans. She gasps. I lean in and whisper in her ear as I slide her zipper down. \u201cWhy stop there?\u201d</p><p>I thought I\u2019d called her bluff, but I should know better than that. She wraps one arm around my neck and helps me pull her jeans off with her other hand. I grab her thighs and pull her flush against me, then spin us around until I\u2019m against the ledge again. She braces her hands against the pool wall behind my head. I sink us both lower until our chins are barely above the surface of the water.</p><p>We\u2019re pressed firmly together; the only things separating us are my jeans and her underwear, and one of these items is about to go. I slide my thumb into her waistband at the hip and begin to inch her panties down. I pull them down just far enough. \u201cWhat now?\u201d I say, moving my hand farther down as I wait for her to call retreat.</p><p>She breathes heavily against my lips as her chin submerges and re-emerges against the waves of the water. Rather than call retreat, she closes her eyes, daring me to keep going.</p><p>She gasps when I unclasp her bra with my other hand and begin to slide it off her.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d she says against my lips. \u201cWhat if someone comes out here?\u201d She covers herself with her arms when the bra is completely off.</p><p>I throw it on the concrete in the spot next to her shirt and I smile at her. \u201cYou started this. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re about to call retreat now.\u201d I kiss her on the chin and trail a line across her jaw with my lips. She uncovers her chest and sinks lower into the water, then pulls me against her.</p><p>\u201cRetreat is no longer in my vocabulary,\u201d she says, finding the button on my pants.</p><p>\u201cYou two almost done here?\u201d someone says from behind us, causing Lake to abandon her current mission. She throws her arms around me and buries her head against my neck. I glance to the left and see a hotel employee standing just inside the gated entry, his hands on his hips. \u201cI\u2019ve got to lock up,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god\u201d she whispers. \u201cWhere the hell are my clothes?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cTold you it wasn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d I say against her ear.</p><p>I keep my arms wrapped tightly around her and look over at the man, who appears a bit too amused at our plight. \u201cUm. Could you throw me those?\u201d I say, pointing to Lake\u2019s shirt and bra, which are several feet away. She\u2019s got a death grip on my neck.</p><p>The hotel employee looks down at the clothes and chuckles, then looks back at Lake and smiles, almost as if I\u2019m not even here. He walks through the gate and over to the edge of the pool and tosses us the shirt, not taking his eyes off her the entire time. I wrap the shirt over her shoulders and he\u2019s still standing there, staring.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d I say to him. The guy finally takes his eyes off Lake long enough to witness my glare. He clearly reads the expression on my face and turns around to head back inside.</p><p>Lake slips her shirt back on while I retrieve her pants and swim them back to her. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence Mrs. Cooper,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHey, my plan was to stop at the shirt,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who had other ideas.\u201d</p><p>I let her hold on to me while I help her struggle back into her jeans. \u201cWell, if what just happened wasn\u2019t your intention, why did you lure me into the water to begin with?\u201d I say.</p><p>She laughs and shakes her head. \u201cI guess I just can\u2019t resist those abs.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her on the nose and swing her around onto my back, then carry her out of the pool. We leave a sopping wet trail the entire way back to our hotel room.</p><p>LAKE IS SPRAWLED across the bed on her stomach, wearing the robe I\u2019ve fallen in love with. I\u2019m stealing that robe before we leave here. She\u2019s flipping through the channels on the TV with the remote, so I crawl onto the bed next to her and take the remote from her hand.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d I say. I flip it to ESPN and she grabs the remote back from me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my honeymoon,\u201d she says. \u201cI should get to watch what I want.\u201d She turns her attention back to the TV.</p><p>\u201cYour honeymoon? What am I? An afterthought?\u201d</p><p>She continues to stare at the TV without responding. She glances at me, then back to the TV. After a few seconds, she shifts her gaze in my direction again and I\u2019m still staring at her. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d she teases. \u201cWere you talking?\u201d</p><p>I grab the remote from her and press the power button, then chuck it across the room. I grab her wrists and roll her onto her back, pinning her to the bed. \u201cMaybe you need to be reminded who wears the pants in this family.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cOh, believe me, I know you wear the pants, Will. You even wear them in the bathtub, remember?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and kiss her ear. \u201cIf I remember correctly, you wore clothes in the shower once, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnwillingly!\u201d She laughs.</p><p>insanity</p><p>AFTER I FINISH cooking breakfast for the boys, I walk to my bedroom and slip inside, shutting the door behind me. The last thing I need is for them to know Lake spent the night here last night.</p><p>I sit on the edge of the bed by her feet. If I were to sit any closer, I wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent myself from reaching over and touching her or hugging her or stroking her hair. It was torture holding her last night while trying to hold back the urge to kiss away her pain. Torture. Not that I didn\u2019t give her a light peck after I was sure she was asleep. I might have also told her I loved her after I kissed her hair.</p><p>Torture.</p><p>\u201cLake,\u201d I whisper. She doesn\u2019t move so I repeat her name. She rustles slightly, but doesn\u2019t open her eyes. She looks so peaceful and serene right now. If I were to wake her up, reality would just hit her again. I stand up and decide to let her have a few more moments of peace. Before I leave the room, I walk to the head of the bed and lightly kiss her on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cWHAT IF SHE loses weight?\u201d Kel says.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to lose weight,\u201d I say as I scoop a spoonful of eggs onto his plate. I walk back to the stove and set the pan down.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t think she\u2019s fat and you like to kiss her, then why don\u2019t you want her to be your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I spin around and face both of the boys. \u201cI like kissing her?\u201d I ask, afraid of his answer. He just nods and takes a bite of his food.</p><p>\u201cYou kissed her that night you took her on that test date. Lake says you didn\u2019t kiss her, but I saw you. She says you can get in a lot of trouble for kissing her and that I didn\u2019t see what I thought I saw.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe said that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Caulder nods. \u201cThat\u2019s what she told us. But Kel says he saw what he thought he saw and I believe him. Why would you get in trouble for kissing her, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t expecting the third degree this early in the morning. I\u2019m too tired to turn this into a life lesson, though. After everything that happened last night and having Lake next to me in my bed, I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t even get an hour of sleep.</p><p>\u201cListen, boys,\u201d I say, walking back to them. I place my hands on the bar and come face-to-face with them. \u201cSometimes, there are things in life that are out of our control. I can\u2019t be Lake\u2019s boyfriend and she can\u2019t be my girlfriend. We\u2019re not going to get married, and the two of you aren\u2019t going to be brothers. Enjoy the fact that you get to be best friends and neighbors.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it because you\u2019re a teacher?\u201d Caulder asks pointedly.</p><p>I drop my head in my hands. They\u2019re relentless. And intuitive.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, exasperated. \u201cYes. It\u2019s because I\u2019m a teacher. Teachers cannot ask their students to be their girlfriends and vice versa. So Lake isn\u2019t going to be my girlfriend. I\u2019m not going to be her boyfriend. We aren\u2019t going to get married. Ever. Now drop it.\u201d I walk back to the stove and place lids on all the pans to keep the food warm. I don\u2019t know when Lake will wake up, but I need to get these boys fed and out of this house before she walks out of my bedroom. How in hell would I explain to them that teachers and students can\u2019t date, but they can sleep in the same bed.</p><p>AFTER BREAKFAST COMES and goes and she\u2019s still asleep, I walk the boys over to Julia\u2019s. Kel and Caulder rush in, but I feel inclined to knock on the door so I lag behind. When Julia opens the door, she shields her eyes from the sun and looks away.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Did I wake you up?\u201d</p> <p>She steps aside to let me in and shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve even slept,\u201d she says. She walks back into the living room, so I follow and sit on the sofa. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cStill asleep. She hasn\u2019t come out of the bedroom since she got there last night.\u201d</p><p>Julia nods and leans back into the couch, then rubs her hands on her face. \u201cShe\u2019s scared, Will. She was so scared when I told her. I knew she would take it badly, but not like this. I wasn\u2019t expecting this reaction at all. I need her to be strong when we tell Kel, but I can\u2019t tell him when she\u2019s this emotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been seven months since her dad died, Julia. Losing a parent is hard, but the possibility of losing both of them at her age is incomprehensible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI guess you would know.\u201d</p><p>She still doesn\u2019t seem convinced that Lake\u2019s reaction is normal. Everyone reacts differently to devastating news. I didn\u2019t even cry right away when I found out my parents died, but that\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t the worst moment of my life.</p> <p>I was on my way to a game when I got the phone call. I was the emergency contact on their records. The person on the other line was telling me there was an accident and I needed to get to the hospital in Detroit. They wouldn\u2019t tell me anything, no matter how much I begged. I tried calling my parents cell phones several times but never got an answer. I called my grandparents to tell them about the accident, since they were just minutes from the hospital. That was one of the hardest phone calls I\u2019ve ever had to make.</p><p>I drove as fast as I could, holding my cell phone in my hand against the steering wheel, keeping a constant eye on it. All I could think of was Caulder. I just knew something terrible had happened and that my parents weren\u2019t answering their phones because they wanted to tell me in person.</p><p>When an hour passed and even my grandparents still hadn\u2019t called, I tried their phone for the fifth time. They weren\u2019t answering, either. I think it was after the sixth time I called them and they pushed it through to voicemail that I knew.</p><p>My parents. Caulder. All of them. They were all dead.</p><p>I pulled up to the emergency room and rushed inside. The first thing I saw was my grandmother doubled over in a chair, crying.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t crying. She was wailing. My grandfather had his back to me, but his shoulders were shaking. His entire body was shaking. I stood there and watched them for several minutes, wondering who these people were in front of me. These strong, independent people I had admired and respected and thought the world of. These people that could be broken by nothing.</p><p>Yet, here they were. Broken and weak. The only thing that can break the unbreakable is the unthinkable. I knew the moment I saw them alone in the waiting room that my worst fears were confirmed.</p><p>They were all dead.</p> <p>I turned around and I walked out. I didn\u2019t want to be in there. I had to go outside. I couldn\u2019t breathe. When I reached the grass across from the parking lot, I fell to my knees. I didn\u2019t cry. Instead, I became physically ill. Over and over, my stomach repelling the truth that I refused to believe. When there was nothing left in me, I fell backward onto the grass and stared up at the sky, the stars staring back at me. Millions of stars staring back at the whole world. A world where parents die and brothers die and nothing stops to respect that fact. The whole universe just goes and goes as if nothing has happened, even when one person\u2019s entire life is forced to a complete halt.</p><p>I closed my eyes and thought about him. It had been two weeks since I had spoken to him on the phone. I had promised him I\u2019d come up the next weekend to take him to his football game. That was the same weekend Vaughn begged me not to go. She said midterms were in two weeks and we needed to spend time together before then. So, I called Caulder and canceled my trip. That was the last time I had talked to him.</p><p>The last time I would ever talk to him.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d</p><p>I looked up after hearing my grandfather\u2019s voice and he was standing over me, looking down. \u201cWill, are you okay?\u201d he asked, wiping fresh tears from his defeated eyes. I hated seeing that look in his eyes.</p><p>I didn\u2019t move. I just lay there in the grass, looking up at him, not wanting him to say anything else. I didn\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>\u201cWill . . . they . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said quickly, not wanting to hear the words come out of his mouth.</p><p>He nodded and looked away. \u201cYour grandmother wants . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said louder.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should come . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>And I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to set foot back inside that hospital. Back inside the building that now housed the three of them. Lifeless.</p><p>\u201cWill, you need to come . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>My grandfather\u2014my poor grandfather just nodded and sighed. What else could he have done? What else could he have said? My entire life had just been ripped from me and I wasn\u2019t about to listen to reassurances from nurses or doctors or clergymen or even my grandparents. I didn\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>My grandfather hesitantly took a few steps away from me, leaving me alone in the grass. Before heading back inside, he turned around one last time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Caulder has been asking for you. He\u2019s scared. So when you\u2019re ready . . .\u201d</p><p>I immediately snapped my head in his direction. \u201cCaulder?\u201d I said. \u201cCaulder\u2019s not . . .\u201d</p><p>My grandfather immediately shook his head. \u201cNo, son. No. Caulder\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until those words came out of his mouth that everything hit me all at once. My chest swelled and the heat rose to my face, then my eyes. I pulled my hands to my forehead and I rolled onto my knees, my elbows buried in the grass, and I completely lost it. Sounds came from deep within me that I didn\u2019t even know I was capable of. I cried harder than I\u2019ve ever cried before\u2014harder than I\u2019ve cried since. I sat on the lawn of that hospital and I cried tears of joy, because Caulder was okay.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Julia asks, breaking me out of my trance.</p><p>I nod, trying to push back the memories of that day. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She readjusts her position on the couch and sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to have to raise Kel,\u201d she says. \u201cLake needs the chance to live her own life. I\u2019d never burden her like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d I say, speaking confidently from experience, \u201cit would burden her not to have him.\u201d Not having the choice to raise Kel would kill Lake. Just like it killed me when I thought I\u2019d lost Caulder. It would absolutely devastate her.</p><p>Julia doesn\u2019t respond, indicating I may have crossed my boundaries with that comment. We both sit quietly on the couch for a while. I feel like neither of us has anything else to say, so I stand up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the boys somewhere this afternoon. I\u2019ll make sure Layken wakes up before I go so you guys will have time to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, smiling a genuine smile at me. It feels good. I respect Julia\u2019s opinion and having her disappointed in me feels almost as bad as when Lake is disappointed in me.</p><p>I nod, then turn and leave. I make my way back inside the house and back into the bedroom where Lake is still sleeping. I ease onto the bed at her side and take a seat.</p><p>\u201cLake,\u201d I whisper, trying to wake her successfully this time.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move, so I pull the covers off her head. She groans and pulls them back up.</p><p>\u201cLake, wake up.\u201d</p><p>She kicks her legs, then throws the covers off. It\u2019s well past lunchtime and she acts like she could sleep twelve more hours. She opens her eyes and squints, then finds me sitting next to her. She\u2019s got mascara smeared underneath her eyes, some of which is still on my pillowcase. Her hair is in disarray. Her ponytail holder is on the sheet beside her. She looks like hell. A beautiful hell.</p><p>\u201cYou really aren\u2019t a morning person,\u201d I say.</p><p>She sits up on the bed. \u201cBathroom. Where\u2019s your bathroom?\u201d</p><p>I point to the bathroom across the hall and watch as she leaps off the bed and darts for the door. She\u2019s definitely awake now, but I can almost guarantee she needs coffee.</p><p>I go to the kitchen and make us both a cup. When she comes out of the bathroom I take a seat and place her coffee next to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, shocked. \u201cWell . . . your bed\u2019s really comfortable.\u201d</p><p>I smile and nudge her shoulder. \u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>We drink our coffee and she doesn\u2019t say anything else. I have no idea where her head is at, so I remain silent, allowing her to think. When we finish our coffee, I put the cups in the sink and tell her I\u2019m taking the boys to a matinee. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving in a few minutes. I\u2019ll probably take them to dinner afterward, so we\u2019ll be back around six. Should give you and your mom time to talk.\u201d</p><p>She frowns at me. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to talk? What if I want to go to a matinee?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward across the bar. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to watch a movie. You need to talk to your mom. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I grab my keys and jacket and head toward the front door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kicks back in her chair and folds her arms across her chest. \u201cI just woke up. The caffeine hasn\u2019t even kicked in yet. Can I stay here for a while?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s practically pouting, her bottom lip sticking out, pleading with me. I stare at her mouth a beat too long. I think she notices, because she pulls on her bottom lip with her teeth and her cheeks flush. I shake my head slightly, pulling my gaze away from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, snapping out of my trance. I walk over to her and kiss her on the forehead. \u201cBut not all day. You need to talk to her.\u201d I walk away, fully aware of the fact that the forehead kiss was probably crossing the line. However, the fact that she slept in my bed last night has already muddied the waters. The line isn\u2019t so black and white anymore. I\u2019m pretty sure gray just became my new favorite color.</p><p>IT\u2019S BEEN OVER five hours since I left with the boys, so Lake and Julia probably have had a chance to sort everything out. I tell Kel to stay the night with me to give them more time to adjust. I unlock the front door and follow the boys into the living room. We all come to a halt, not expecting to find Lake on my living room floor. There are dozens of white index cards sprawled out in front of her.</p> <p>What the hell is she doing?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Caulder says, verbalizing my exact thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAlphabetizing,\u201d she replies without looking up.</p><p>\u201cAlphabetizing what?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cEverything. First I did the movies, then I did the CDs. Caulder, I did the books in your room. I did a few of your games, but some of those started with numbers so I put the numbers first, then the titles.\u201d I point to the piles in front of me. \u201cThese are recipes. I found them on top of the fridge. I\u2019m alphabetizing them by category first; like beef, lamb, pork, poultry. Then behind the categories I\u2019m alphabetizing them by\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuys, go to Kel\u2019s. Let Julia know you\u2019re back,\u201d I say, without looking at them.</p><p>The boys don\u2019t move. They continue to stare at Lake. \u201cNow!\u201d I yell. They listen this time, opening the door and disappearing outside.</p><p>I slowly walk to the couch and sit down. I\u2019m afraid to say anything. Something is off. She seems so . . . chipper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the teacher,\u201d she says. She looks at me and winks. \u201cShould I put \u2018Baked Potato Soup\u2019 behind potato or soup?\u201d</p><p>What the hell? She\u2019s in denial. Intense denial.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I say. I\u2019m not returning her smile. I don\u2019t know what happened with her mom today, but whatever is going on with her needs to stop. She needs to confront this.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop, silly. I\u2019m halfway finished. If I stop now you won\u2019t know where to find . . .\u201d She picks up a random card off the floor. \u201cJerk Chicken?\u201d</p><p>I glance around the living room and notice the DVDs have all been arranged next to my television. I stand and slowly walk to the kitchen, eyeing the surroundings. Did she clean the damn baseboards? I knew I shouldn\u2019t have left her today. Good God, I bet she cleaned the entire house and never even went to talk to her mother. I walk to my bedroom and my bed is made. Not only is it made; it\u2019s perfect. I hesitate before opening my closet door, afraid of what I might find. My shoes have all been rearranged. My shirts have all been moved to the right side of the closet and my pants are on the left. The way they\u2019re hung, their colors move from light to dark.</p><p>She color-coded my closet? I\u2019m afraid to complete the inspection. There\u2019s no telling what all she did to this house. She probably left nothing untouched.</p><p>Shit. I rush to the bed and open the nightstand. I pull the book out and open it, but the receipt for her chocolate milk doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s been touched. I breathe a sigh of relief, glad she didn\u2019t see it, then put the book back where it was. How embarrassing would that have been?</p><p>I walk back into the living room, more aware of the spotless condition of my house than before. She\u2019s been a little too busy, which can only mean one thing. She\u2019s still avoiding her mother.</p><p>\u201cYou color-coded my closet?\u201d I say. I\u2019m glaring at her from the hallway entrance. She shrugs and smiles, like this is any other day.</p><p>\u201cWill, it wasn\u2019t that hard. You wear, like, three different color shirts.\u201d When she giggles, it makes me wince. She has to stop this. Her denial isn\u2019t good for her, and it certainly isn\u2019t going to be good for Kel when Julia tells him. I walk swiftly across the room and bend down to snatch up the cards. We\u2019re about to have a serious sit-down.</p><p>\u201cWill! Stop! That took me a long time!\u201d She begins to grab the cards as I pick them up. I realize we aren\u2019t getting anywhere, so I throw down the cards and try to pull her up off the floor. I need her to look me in the eyes and calm down.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p>She actually starts kicking at me. She\u2019s literally kicking me. She\u2019s acting like a damn child.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d she yells. \u201cI\u2019m . . . not . . . done!\u201d</p><p>I let go of her hands as she asked, and she falls back to the floor. I walk to the kitchen and grab an empty pitcher from under the sink and fill it up with water. I know I\u2019ll regret this, but she needs to snap out of it. I walk back to the living room and she doesn\u2019t even acknowledge me. I extend my arm and flip the pitcher upside down on top of her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d she screams. She throws her hands up in shock, then looks up at me with pure hatred. I realize once she lunges at me that perhaps this wasn\u2019t the best idea. Not enough water, maybe?</p><p>When she stands up and tries to hit me, I grab her arm and wrap it behind her back, then move behind her while I push her toward the bathroom. Once we\u2019re inside, I wrap my arms around her and forcefully pick her up. There\u2019s no other way to do it. She\u2019s doing her best to attack me and she\u2019s almost succeeding. I hold her against the wall of the shower with one arm and turn the water on with the other. As soon as the water splashes across her face, she gasps.</p><p>\u201cJerk! Jackass! Asshole!\u201d</p><p>I adjust the faucet and look her in the eyes. \u201cTake a shower, Layken! Take a damn shower!\u201d I release my hold and back away from her. When I shut the bathroom door, I hold the doorknob in case she tries to get out. Sure enough, she tries.</p><p>\u201cLet me out, Will! Now!\u201d She beats on the door and jiggles the knob.</p><p>\u201cLayken, I\u2019m not letting you out of the bathroom until you take off your clothes, get in the shower, wash your hair, and calm down.\u201d</p><p>I continue to hold the doorknob until I hear the shower curtain close a minute later. When I\u2019m confident she isn\u2019t going to try to get out again, I put my shoes on and walk across the street to grab her some extra clothes.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Julia asks as soon as she opens the door. She motions behind her to let me know Kel and Caulder can hear our conversation.</p><p>\u201cA little too okay,\u201d I whisper. \u201cShe\u2019s acting strange. Did you guys talk today?\u201d</p><p>Julia nods, but doesn\u2019t elaborate. It\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t want to risk being overheard by Kel. \u201cShe\u2019s in the shower. I came to get her a change of clothes,\u201d I say, skirting the subject.</p><p>Julia nods and steps aside, then walks toward the kitchen. \u201cYou can grab some out of her bedroom. Last door on the right,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of washing dishes.\u201d She returns to the sink and I hesitate, a little uncomfortable at the thought of going into Lake\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>I walk down the hallway and slowly open her door. When I do, it\u2019s not what I expect. I don\u2019t know if I thought it would be a typical teenager\u2019s bedroom, but I\u2019m pleasantly surprised that there aren\u2019t posters on the walls and black lights on the ceiling. It\u2019s surprisingly mature for an eighteen-year-old. I walk to her dresser and pull the top drawer open, removing a tank top. When I open the next drawer to look for pants, I\u2019m met with a drawer full of bras and panties. I feel somewhat guilty, knowing that she has no idea I\u2019m in her room right now. I tell myself to just grab a pair and shut the drawer, but I begin scrolling through all of the contents, imaging what they would look like on her.</p><p>Dammit, Will! I grab a pair on top and slam the drawer shut, then search until I find some pajama bottoms. When I shut the last drawer, the tank top falls out of my hands and lands on the floor. I bend over to pick it up and a barrette catches my eye. It looks like a child\u2019s hair barrette. I pick it up and hold it between my fingers, curious why she would keep something so old.</p><p>\u201cShe used to think it was magic,\u201d Julia says from the doorway. I whip my head around, startled by her voice.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d I say, holding up the barrette.</p><p>Julia nods, then walks into the bedroom and sits on the bed. \u201cWhen she was a little girl her dad walked in right after she had cut a huge chunk of her bangs off. She was crying, scared I would be mad at her, so he brushed some hair over and snapped the clip in place. He told her it was magic and that as long as she kept that clip in her hair, I wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, trying to imagine Lake with a chunk of her bangs missing. \u201cI guess you noticed?\u201d</p><p>Julia laughs. \u201cOh, it was so obvious. Horribly obvious. She cut a three-inch strip right out of the front of her hair. Her dad called to warn me and told me not to say anything. It was so hard. It took her hair months to grow back out and she looked ridiculous. But I couldn\u2019t say anything because every single day she woke up, the first thing she did was put that clip in her hair so I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say. \u201cShe was strong-willed even then, huh?\u201d</p><p>Julia smiles. \u201cYou have no idea. I\u2019ve never met a person with a more indomitable will in my life.\u201d</p><p>I bend down and put the clip back where I found it, then turn back to Julia. She\u2019s looking down at her hands, picking at her nails. She looks just like Lake right now, but somehow even sadder.</p><p>\u201cShe hates me right now, Will. She doesn\u2019t understand where I\u2019m coming from. She wants Kel, but I don\u2019t know if I can do that to her.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s my place to be giving her advice, but she seems to be soliciting it. I just know I\u2019ve been in Lake\u2019s shoes, and nothing could have stopped me from taking Caulder from my grandparents\u2019 house that night.</p><p>I tuck Lake\u2019s clothes underneath my arm and head to the door, then turn back toward Julia. \u201cMaybe you should try to understand where she\u2019s coming from. Kel is the only thing she\u2019ll have left. The only thing. And right now, she feels like you\u2019re trying to take that away from her, too.\u201d</p><p>Julia looks up at me. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to take him away from her. I just want her to be happy.\u201d</p><p>Happy?</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d I say. \u201cHer father just died. You\u2019re about to die. She\u2019s eighteen and she\u2019s facing a lifetime without the two people she loves the most. Nothing you can do will make her happy. Her world is being ripped out from under her and she has absolutely no control over it. The least you could do is let her have a little bit of say-so over the only thing she\u2019ll have left. Because I can tell you from experience . . . Caulder is the only thing that kept me going. Your taking Kel away from her because you think it\u2019ll improve her situation? It\u2019s the absolute worst thing you could do to either of them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fearing I\u2019ve overstepped my bounds again, I walk out of the bedroom and make my way back across the street.</p><p>I OPEN THE door to the bathroom and slip inside. I set the clothes and a towel down on the counter, then glance up to the mirror. It\u2019s mostly fogged over, but clear enough that I can see the shower in the reflection. There\u2019s a section a few inches wide where the wall should meet the shower curtain, but it\u2019s pulled slightly back. Lake\u2019s foot is propped up against the porcelain tub and she\u2019s shaving her legs. She\u2019s using my razor.</p><p>And my shower.</p><p>And her clothes are on the floor, next to my feet. Not on her. She\u2019s three feet from me without her clothes on.</p> <p>It\u2019s one of the worst days of her life and I\u2019m sitting here thinking about how she\u2019s not wearing anything. Ass-hole.</p><p>If I had any semblance of a decent conscious at all, I\u2019d have never allowed her into my house last night to begin with. Now I\u2019m watching the razor glide up her ankle, praying she\u2019s too upset to go home for at least one more night.</p><p>Just one more night. I\u2019m not ready to let her go.</p><p>I quietly back out of the bathroom and shut the door behind me. I head straight to the kitchen sink and splash water on my face.</p><p>I grip the edge of the counter and take a deep breath, preparing my earth-shattering apology for when she comes storming out of the bathroom. She\u2019s so pissed at me right now for yelling at her and throwing her into the shower. I don\u2019t blame her. I\u2019m sure there was an easier way I could have calmed her down.</p> <p>\u201cI need a towel!\u201d she yells from the bathroom. I walk to the edge of the hallway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the sink. So are your clothes.\u201d I go back to the living room and sit on the couch in a lame attempt to appear casual. Maybe if I don\u2019t seem so pissed anymore, she\u2019ll remain calm.</p><p>God, I can\u2019t stand the thought of her being mad at me for another day. The day she recited her poem in class was probably the hardest knock my heart has ever taken from a girl . . . and it happened in front of seventeen other students. I realize none of them knew I was her target, other than Gavin, but still. It felt like I\u2019d taken over thirty bullets straight to the heart with each insult that came out of her mouth.</p><p>The door to the bathroom begins to open and my attempt at casual goes out the window. I jump over the back of the couch, wanting nothing more than to hold her and apologize for everything I did tonight.</p><p>When she sees me rushing toward her, her eyes grow big and she backs up to the wall. I wrap my arms around her and squeeze her tight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lake. I\u2019m so sorry I did that. You were just losing it,\u201d I say in my best attempt to excuse my actions. Rather than try to hit me, she wraps her arms around my neck, causing my chest to tighten as I attempt to hold on to my willpower before it slips away from me again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI kinda sorta had a bad day.\u201d</p> <p>I want nothing more than to stifle her words with my mouth right now. I want to tell her how much I need her. How much I love her. How, no matter how bad things get for her, I\u2019ll be by her through every second of it.</p><p>But I don\u2019t. Because of Julia, I don\u2019t. I reluctantly pull back and place my arms on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re friends? You aren\u2019t gonna try to punch me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d she says with a forced smile. I can tell she wants to be my friend about as much as I want to be hers. I have to turn away from her and head down the hallway before the words \u201cI love you\u201d fall helplessly from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow was the matinee?\u201d she asks from behind me.</p><p>I can\u2019t make small talk. We need to get to the heart of why she\u2019s here, or I\u2019m going to forget she\u2019s not here for me.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to your mom?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cJeez. Deflect much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you talk to her? Please don\u2019t tell me you spent the entire day cleaning.\u201d I continue into the kitchen and grab two glasses. She takes a seat at the bar.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not the entire day. We talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . she has cancer.\u201d</p><p>Damn that indomitable will.</p><p>I roll my eyes at her stubbornness and walk to the refrigerator, removing the milk. When I begin to pour it into her glass, she turns away from the bar and flips her head over, then pulls the towel off her head. Her hair falls around her and she brushes at the tangles with her fingers. She smoothes out the strands, working her fingers through them delicately. What I wouldn\u2019t give to touch\u2014crap! I realize, just as she glances up, that I\u2019ve poured way too much milk. It\u2019s trickling down my hand and onto the counter. I quickly wipe it up with a hand towel.</p><p>Please tell me she didn\u2019t see that.</p><p>I grab the powdered chocolate out of the cabinet and a spoon, then stir some chocolate into her cup. \u201cWill she be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Probably not.\u201d</p><p>I should know better than to ask close-ended questions with her. But I haven\u2019t asked Julia any details and I\u2019m curious.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s getting treatment?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and looks incredibly annoyed. \u201cShe\u2019s dying, Will. Dying. She\u2019ll probably be dead within the year, maybe less than that. They\u2019re just doing chemo to keep her comfortable. While she dies. \u2019Cause she\u2019ll be dead. Because she\u2019s dying. There. Is that what you wanted to hear?\u201d</p><p>Her response sends a surge of guilt through me. I\u2019m doing the exact thing to her that I hated having done to me. Forcing her to talk about something she hasn\u2019t even accepted yet. I decide to drop it. She\u2019ll come to this on her own terms. I walk to the freezer and grab a handful of ice, then drop it into her cup, sliding it across the counter to her. \u201cOn the rocks.\u201d</p><p>She looks down at the chocolate milk and smiles. \u201cThanks,\u201d she says. She finishes her drink in silence.</p><p>When the glass is empty, she stands up from the bar and walks to the living room. She lies down on the floor and stretches her arms above her head.</p><p>\u201cTurn the lights off,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want to listen for a while.\u201d</p><p>I turn out the lights, then walk to where she is and lower myself onto the floor beside her. She\u2019s quiet, but the stress radiates from her.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me to raise Kel,\u201d she whispers. \u201cShe wants to give him to Brenda.\u201d</p><p>I inhale a deep breath, understanding completely where her pain is coming from. I reach out across the floor until I find her hand and I hold it, wanting more than anything for her to know she\u2019s not alone in this.</p><p>MY EYES SNAP open at the sound of Eddie\u2019s voice. I sit up on the floor, shocked that I even fell asleep, and see Lake watching Eddie walk out the door.</p><p>Shit! Shit, shit, shit! What the hell was Eddie doing in my house? Why would Lake even let her in? I\u2019m getting fired. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m done.</p><p>After the door closes behind Eddie, Lake turns around and sees me sitting up on the floor. She purses her lips and tries to smile, but she knows I\u2019m not happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was she doing here?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cVisiting,\u201d she mutters. \u201cChecking on me.\u201d</p><p>She has no idea what kind of jeopardy she just put my entire career in!</p><p>\u201cDammit, Layken!\u201d I push myself off the floor and throw my hands in the air, defeated. \u201cAre you trying to get me fired? Are you that selfish that you don\u2019t give a crap about anyone else\u2019s problems? Do you know what would happen if she let it get out that you spent the night here?\u201d</p><p>Lake\u2019s eyes dart down to the floor.</p><p>Oh, god. She knows. Eddie already knows.</p><p>I take a step closer to her and she glances up at me again. \u201cDoes she know you spent the night here?\u201d I demand. She looks down at her lap. \u201cLayken, what does she know?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look at me, which answers my question.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Layken. Go home.\u201d</p><p>She nods, then walks to the door. She slips her shoes on and pauses before she leaves, looking at me apologetically. I\u2019m standing in the middle of the living room with my hands clasped behind my head, watching her. As mad as I am right now, it hurts to let her go. I know she needs me, but there\u2019s so much we both need to process at this point. Besides, she needs to be home with her mother. Being here instead of at her own house isn\u2019t helping her confront her situation at all.</p><p>A tear rolls down her cheek and she quickly turns away.</p><p>\u201cLake,\u201d I say softly, dropping my hands to my sides. I can\u2019t let her leave with the added stress of my outburst lingering in her mind. I walk to the door where she\u2019s standing and reach down and touch her fingers, then take her hand in mine. She allows me to hold her hand, but she doesn\u2019t face me again. She keeps one hand on the front door and sniffs, her head still focused on the floor.</p><p>This girl. In love with the boy she can\u2019t have. Grieving the death of her father, only to find out she\u2019s about to grieve the death of the only adult left in her life? This girl who\u2019s being told she can\u2019t keep the only family member she has left? I squeeze her hand and rub my thumb over hers. She slowly turns to meet my eyes. Seeing the pain behind them and knowing that a lot of it is because of me reminds me of all the reasons I need to let her go.</p><p>Her mother.</p><p>My career.</p><p>Her reputation.</p><p>Mine and Caulder\u2019s future.</p><p>Her future.</p><p>Doing the right thing. The responsible thing.</p><p>Out of all the reasons I can come up with for her to go, there\u2019s only one reason I can come up with for her to stay. I love her. This one reason for her to stay is the only reason that derives from pure selfishness. If I continue whatever this is with her, it\u2019ll be completely selfish of me. I\u2019ll be putting everything I\u2019ve worked for and everyone I love at risk, just to fulfill my own desires.</p><p>I drop her hand. \u201cGo home, Layken. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>I turn around.</p><p>I walk away.</p><p>14.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>I\u2019M HOLDING HER hand now and I have no intentions of letting her walk out of my life again.</p><p>Lake can see the regret I have over that night, so she takes my face in her hands and smiles reassuringly at me. \u201cYou do realize you are the most selfless person I know, right?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cLake, I\u2019m not selfless. I put so much at risk every time I was around you, but I still couldn\u2019t control myself. It\u2019s like I couldn\u2019t breathe unless I was near you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not selfish. We were in love. Really in love. You warred with yourself to do the right thing and that says so much about your character. I respect you for that, Will Cooper.\u201d</p><p>I knew I married her for a reason. I grab the back of her neck and pull her forehead toward mine and kiss it.</p><p>She lays her head on my chest and wraps her arm around me. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s no way you could have been perfect the whole time we were forced apart,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hard to not love me, considering how irresistible I am.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and flip her off me and onto her back. \u201cYou got that right,\u201d I say, tickling her ribs. I try to straddle her and pin her down, but she squirms beneath me and somehow breaks free, scooting off the bed. I grab her wrist and she pulls back, yanking me forward. She turns and tries to break free but trips over the desk chair. I grab her waist just as she falls to the floor, then I slide on top of her and pin her wrists to the carpet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee how irresistible I am?\u201d She laughs. \u201cYou won\u2019t even let me off the butterflying bed without you!\u201d</p><p>My eyes drink in every inch of her from head to toe. \u201cMaybe if you\u2019d put on some clothes I\u2019d feel less inclined to attack you.\u201d</p><p>She pulls one of her hands from mine and reaches to the chair above her head where her robe landed earlier. \u201cFine,\u201d she says, yanking it off the chair. \u201cI\u2019ll wear this until we leave tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I grab the robe from her hands and toss it behind me. \u201cThe hell you will. I told you what you were allowed to wear on this honeymoon, and that robe wasn\u2019t on the list.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, everything that was on the list is sort of soaking wet, thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s only inconvenient for anyone who isn\u2019t me.\u201d As soon as I kiss her, she finds the one spot on my stomach that\u2019s ticklish and she attacks. I\u2019m immediately off her, trying to get away from her hands. I hop back onto the bed and she jumps on top of me. Once I realize she has me pinned to the bed, I immediately give up and let her win.</p><p>Who wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cFun should have been the fourth thing on my mom\u2019s list,\u201d she says, dropping herself beside me, breathless from the effort she spent trying to attack me. I cock my eyebrow, curious about what list she\u2019s referring to. She sees I\u2019m not following, so she elaborates. \u201cShe said there were three things every woman should look for in a man. Having fun with him wasn\u2019t on the list, but I think it should be.\u201d She sits up and scoots back to the headboard. \u201cTell me about a fun time. A happy time. I need a break from all the sad memories for a while.\u201d</p><p>I think back to the months after we first met, and struggle to come up with a positive one. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, Lake. There were happy moments, but not really happy times. There was so much heartache under the surface of that entire year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen tell me one of your happy moments.\u201d</p><p>carving pumpkins</p><p>IT\u2019S ALMOST FIVE, so after I unload the groceries I walk across the street to get Caulder. Julia and Lake need to talk, so I think I\u2019ll offer to take Kel for a while, too. Before I knock, I take a deep breath and prepare for whatever reaction Lake might have. I gave her detention today so I could talk to her and Eddie, then I just left her and Eddie a blubbering mess in my classroom. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s pissed at me right now but I felt like I needed to make a point, which is the only reason I did it. Whether or not Lake got my point, I guess I\u2019m about to find out.</p><p>When the door opens, I\u2019m shocked to see Caulder. \u201cHey, buddy. You answering doors here now?\u201d</p><p>He smiles and grabs my hand, pulling me inside. \u201cWe\u2019re carving pumpkins for Halloween. Come on, Julia bought one for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll carve mine another time. I just wanted to bring you home so they can have some family time.\u201d</p> <p>I look up to see the four of them sitting at the bar carving pumpkins. I know Lake hasn\u2019t had a chance to talk with Julia, since she had to have just gotten home, so I\u2019m a little confused at the serene family appearing in front of me.</p><p>Julia pulls out a chair and pats it, indicating she wants me to stay. \u201cSit down, Will. We\u2019re just carving pumpkins tonight. That\u2019s all we\u2019re doing. Just carving pumpkins.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s obvious from her tone that Lake must have told her she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it again. That doesn\u2019t surprise me. \u201cOkay, then. I guess we\u2019re carving pumpkins.\u201d I sit in the chair Julia pulled out for me, directly across from Lake. We glance at each other as I take my seat. Her expression is soft but not very telling. I don\u2019t know how she feels about what I said during detention today, but if her expression is any indication, she doesn\u2019t seem angry. She almost seems apologetic.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you so late getting home today, Layken?\u201d Kel asks. I glance away just as Lake snaps her head in his direction. I focus my attention on the pumpkin in front of me.</p><p>\u201cEddie and I had detention,\u201d she says matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cDetention? What were you in detention for?\u201d Julia asks.</p><p>I can feel the blood pooling in my cheeks.</p><p>Lie to her, Lake.</p> <p>\u201cWe skipped class last week, took a nap in the courtyard.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s my girl. I silently let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cLake, why would you do something like that? What class did you skip?\u201d Julia asks, obviously disappointed. Lake doesn\u2019t respond, which causes me to look up. She and Julia are both staring at me.</p><p>\u201cShe skipped my class!\u201d I laugh. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>Julia laughs and pats me on the back. \u201cI\u2019m buying you supper for that.\u201d</p><p>I WALK TO the door with Julia when the pizza arrives and take it from the delivery guy while she pays him. I set it on the counter and make the boys a plate.</p><p>\u201cI want to try this suck and sweet Kel keeps telling me about,\u201d Julia says after we all sit down. Lake looks up at her, confused about what \u201csuck and sweet\u201d is, but she doesn\u2019t ask for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cGood idea, I\u2019ll go first. Show you guys how it\u2019s done,\u201d I say. I take a sip of my drink and start with my suck.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Alex was my suck today,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mrs. Alex and why was she your suck?\u201d Julia asks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the secretary, and . . . let\u2019s just say she favors me. Today I had to go turn in my absentee reports. We always place them in our boxes before the end of the day and Mrs. Alex collects them all in order to enter them into the system. When I looked at my name on my box, there were two purple hearts doodled over the Os in my last name. Mrs. Alex is the only one who writes with purple ink.\u201d</p><p>Lake and Julia both burst out laughing. \u201cMrs. Alex has a crush on you?\u201d Lake says, laughing. \u201cShe\u2019s . . . old. And married!\u201d</p><p>I smile and nod, a little embarrassed. I try to turn my focus back to Julia, but seeing Lake finally laughing is captivating. It\u2019s amazing how one smile from her can shift the mood of my entire day. Lake sighs and leans back in her chair. \u201cSo are you supposed to say a \u2018sweet\u2019 now? Is that how this works?\u201d</p><p>I nod, unable to look away from her. Her smile meets her eyes, and even though I know she has a lot to deal with in the coming days, I feel a sense of relief just seeing her happiness break through, if only for a moment. The fact that she can still find something positive in her current situation reassures me that she\u2019ll be okay.</p><p>\u201cMy sweet?\u201d I say, staring directly at her. \u201cMy sweet is right now.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, it\u2019s just the two of us in the room. I don\u2019t hear or think about or acknowledge anyone else around us. She smiles at me and I smile back and neither of us breaks our stare. It\u2019s as if a silent truce occurs between us and all is suddenly right in our little two-person world.</p><p>Julia clears her throat and leans forward. \u201cOkay, I think we know how to play now,\u201d she says, interrupting our moment. I glance at Julia and she\u2019s looking at the boys. \u201cKel, you go next,\u201d Julia says, pretending not to have noticed my and Lake\u2019s little \u201cmoment.\u201d I watch Kel, forcing myself to avoid looking at Lake again. If I do, I won\u2019t be able to stop myself from jumping over the bar and kissing her.</p><p>\u201cMy suck is that I still can\u2019t think of what to be for Halloween,\u201d Kel says. \u201cMy sweet is that Will agreed to take us geocaching again this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you geocaching?\u201d This is the first I\u2019ve heard of it.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Kel says sarcastically. \u201cAww, gee, Will. That sounds like fun! I\u2019d love to go geocaching this weekend.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and look over at Caulder. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He nudges his head toward Kel. \u201cSame thing,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a copout,\u201d Julia says to Caulder. \u201cYou have to be original.\u201d</p><p>Caulder rolls his eyes. \u201cFine,\u201d he groans, setting down his pizza. \u201cMy suck today is that my best friend\u2019s suck is that he can\u2019t think of what he wants to be for Halloween. My sweet is that my best friend\u2019s sweet is that Will agreed to take us geocaching this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a smart-ass,\u201d I say to Caulder.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Julia says. \u201cMy sweet today is that we got to carve pumpkins together.\u201d She leans back in her chair and smiles at all of us. I glance at Lake and she\u2019s staring down at her hands, folded in front of her on the table. She\u2019s picking at her nail polish, something I noticed she does when she\u2019s stressed, just like Julia. I know she\u2019s thinking what I\u2019m thinking. That this is more than likely Julia\u2019s last time to carve pumpkins. Lake brings her hand to her eyes and it looks like she\u2019s trying to stop a tear from falling. I quickly turn to Julia to remove any focus from Lake.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your suck?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Julia continues to watch Lake when she responds. \u201cMy suck is the same as my sweet,\u201d Julia says quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re still carving pumpkins.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to understand that \u201ccarving pumpkins\u201d has taken on a whole new meaning. Lake immediately stands up and grabs empty plates off the bar, completely ignoring her mother\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cMy suck is that it\u2019s my night to do dishes,\u201d Lake says. She walks to the sink and turns on the water. Kel and Caulder begin discussing Halloween costumes again, so Julia and I help throw out a few ideas.</p><p>No one ever asks Lake what her sweet is.</p><p>15.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cI DID HAVE a sweet that night,\u201d she says. \u201cRemember the conversation we had when we took the trash out? When you told me about the first time you saw me?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cThat was my sweet. Having that moment with you. All the little moments I got with you were always my sweets.\u201d She kisses me on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cThat was my sweet, too,\u201d I say. \u201cThat and the intense stare you gave me while we were playing suck and sweet.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cIf you only knew what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>I cock my eyebrow at her. \u201cNaughty thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you said \u2018My sweet is right now,\u2019 \u201d I wanted to jump across the bar and ravish you,\u201d she says.</p><p>I laugh. I never would have thought we were both thinking the exact same thing. \u201cI wonder what your mom would have done if we had both attacked each other, right there on the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would have kicked your ass,\u201d she says. She rolls onto her side and faces the other direction. \u201cSpoon me,\u201d she says. I scoot closer to her and slide my arm underneath her head, wrapping my other arm tightly around her. She yawns a deep yawn into her pillow. \u201cTell me about The Lake. I want to know why you wrote it.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her hair and rest my head on her pillow. \u201cI wrote it the next night. After we had basagna with your mom,\u201d I say. \u201cWhen we all sat around the table that night and discussed how things with the boys were going to be handled during her treatments, I realized that you had done it. You were doing exactly what I wished my parents had done before they died. You were taking responsibility. You were preparing for the inevitable. You were facing death head-on, and you were doing it without fear.\u201d I put my leg over her legs and tuck her in closer to me. \u201cEvery time I was around you, you inspired me to write. And I didn\u2019t want to write about anything but you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tilts her head back toward me. \u201cThat was on the list,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. \u2018Does he inspire you?\u2019 is one of the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I inspire you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery single day,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I kiss her forehead. \u201cWell, like I said, you inspired me, too. I knew I already loved you long before then, but that night at dinner something just clicked inside me. It\u2019s like every time we were together, all was right with the world. I had assumed, just like your mom did, that staying apart would help you focus on her, but we were both wrong. I knew that the only way either of us could have been truly happy is if we were together. I wanted you to wait for me. I wanted you to wait for me so bad, but I didn\u2019t know how to tell you without crossing some sort of boundary.</p><p>\u201cThe next night at the slam when I saw you walk in, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from performing that piece so you would hear it. I knew it was wrong, but I wanted you to know how much I thought about you. How much I really did love you.\u201d</p><p>She rolls over and scowls at me. \u201cWhat do you mean when you saw me walk in? You said you didn\u2019t know I was there until you saw me leaving.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI lied.\u201d</p> <p>the lake</p><p>AS SOON AS I step up to the microphone, I see her. She walks through the doors and heads straight for a booth, never once looking up at the stage. My heart rate speeds up and beads of sweat form on my forehead, so I wipe them away with the palm of my hand. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from the heat of the spotlight or the onslaught of nerves that have just overcome me seeing her walk through the door. I can\u2019t perform this poem now. Not with her here. Why is she here? She said she wasn\u2019t coming tonight.</p><p>I take a step away from the microphone to gather my thoughts. Should I do it anyway? If I do it, she\u2019ll know exactly how I feel about her. That could be good. Maybe if I go ahead and do it I could gauge her reaction and know if asking her to wait for me is the right thing to do. I want her to wait for me. I want her to wait for me so bad. I don\u2019t want to think about her ever allowing anyone besides me to love her. She needs to know how I feel about her before I\u2019m too late.</p><p>I shake the tension out of my shoulders. I step up to the microphone, brush away my doubt, and say the words that will strip away everything but the truth.</p><p>I used to love the ocean.</p><p>Everything about her.</p> <p>Her coral reefs, her whitecaps, her roaring waves, the</p><p> rocks they lap, her pirate legends and mermaid tails,</p><p>Treasures lost and treasures held . . .</p><p>And ALL</p><p>Of her fish</p><p>In the sea.</p><p>Yes, I used to love the ocean,</p><p>Everything about her.</p> <p>The way she would sing me to sleep as I lay in my bed</p><p>then wake me with a force</p><p>That I soon came to dread.</p><p>Her fables, her lies, her misleading eyes,</p><p>I\u2019d drain her dry</p><p>If I cared enough to.</p><p>I used to love the ocean,</p><p>Everything about her.</p><p>Her coral reefs, her whitecaps, her roaring waves, the</p><p> rocks they lap, her pirate legends and mermaid tails,</p><p>treasures lost and treasures held.</p><p>And ALL</p><p>Of her fish</p><p>In the sea.</p><p>Well, if you\u2019ve ever tried navigating your sailboat</p><p>through her stormy seas, you would realize that</p><p>her whitecaps are your enemies. If you\u2019ve ever tried</p><p>swimming ashore when your leg gets a cramp and</p><p>you just had a huge meal of In-n-Out burgers that\u2019s</p><p>weighing you down, and her roaring waves are</p><p>knocking the wind out of you, filling your lungs with</p><p>water as you flail your arms, trying to get someone\u2019s</p><p> attention, but your friends</p><p>just</p><p>wave</p><p>back at you?</p><p>And if you\u2019ve ever grown up with dreams in your head</p><p> about life, and how one of these days you would pirate</p><p> your own ship and have your own crew and that all of</p><p> the mermaids</p><p>would love</p><p>Well, you would realize . . .</p><p>Like I eventually realized . . .</p><p>That all the good things about her?</p><p>All the beautiful?</p><p>It\u2019s not real.</p><p>It\u2019s fake.</p><p>So you keep your ocean,</p><p>I\u2019ll take the Lake.</p><p>I CLOSE MY eyes and exhale, not sure what to do next. Do I walk to the booth where she\u2019s sitting? Do I wait and let her come find me? I slowly back away from the microphone and walk toward the side stairs, taking them one by one, afraid of what, if anything, might happen next. I know I need to see her.</p><p>When I reach the back of the room, she isn\u2019t in the booth anymore. I walk toward the front of the club, toward the stage, in case she came to find me up here. She\u2019s nowhere. After looking around for several minutes, I see Eddie and Gavin sliding into the booth Lake was seated in just moments ago.</p><p>What are they doing here? Lake said none of them were coming. Thank God they\u2019re late, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted Gavin to hear that piece. I walk over to them and attempt to appear casual, but my entire body is nervous and tense.</p><p>\u201cHey, Will,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cYou want to sit with us?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot yet. Have you guys . . .\u201d I pause, not really wanting Gavin to give me one of his looks again when he finds out I\u2019m looking for Lake. \u201cHave you guys seen Layken?\u201d Gavin leans back in the booth and cocks an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie says with a grin on her face. \u201cShe said she was leaving. She was headed toward the back parking lot of the club, but I just found her purse right here,\u201d she says, holding up a purse. \u201cShe\u2019ll be back as soon as she realizes she doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>She left? I immediately turn and head toward the door without saying another word to either of them. If she stayed for the whole poem and just up and left, I must have pissed her off. Why did I not switch poems? Why didn\u2019t I think about how it would make her feel? I swing the door open and immediately round the corner toward the back parking lot. Frantic to catch her before she drives away, I find myself switching from a brisk walk, to a jog, then to a desperate sprint. I spot her Jeep, but she isn\u2019t inside it. I spin around searching for her, but I don\u2019t see her. I turn to walk back and check the club again and I hear her voice, coupled with someone else\u2019s. It sounds like a guy. My fists immediately clench, worried for her safety. I don\u2019t like the thought of her being out here alone with someone else, so I follow the sound of the voices until I see her.</p><p>Until I see them.</p><p>She\u2019s backed up against Javi\u2019s truck, her hands on his chest, his hands on her cheeks. Seeing his lips meshed with hers pulls a reaction from deep within me that I didn\u2019t even know I was capable of. The only thing running through my head at this point is how the hell to get this asshole off her. Of all the guys she could choose to help her move on from me, it sure as hell isn\u2019t going to be Javi.</p><p>Before I can even contemplate a more sane decision, my hands have hold of his shirt and I\u2019m pulling him away from her. When he trips and falls onto his back, I drop my knee onto his chest and punch him. As soon as my fist meets his jaw, I realize it took all of three seconds to throw away every single thing I\u2019ve worked for. There is no way I\u2019m getting out of this predicament with a job.</p><p>My split-second realization is enough distraction to allow Javi to regain his footing and deliver a punch right to my eye, sending me back to the ground before I can react. I press my hand against my eye and the feel warm blood seeping through my fingers. I hear Lake yelling for him to stop. Or she\u2019s yelling for me to stop. Or maybe both of us. I stand up and open my eyes just as Lake jumps in front of Javi. She\u2019s hurled forward when Javi hits her in the back with a blow that was obviously intended for me. She gasps and falls against me.</p><p>\u201cLake!\u201d I yell, rolling her onto her back. As soon as I confirm she\u2019s conscious, I\u2019m consumed by rage.</p><p>Vengeance.</p><p>Hatred.</p><p>I want to kill this asshole. I grab the door handle of the car nearest me and pull myself up. Javi is making his way toward Lake, apologizing. I don\u2019t give him time to make amends. I hit him with every ounce of force behind my fist and watch as he falls to the ground. I kneel and hit him again, this time for Lake. As soon as I pull my fist back to hit him again, Gavin jerks me off him, sending us both backward. Gavin has hold of both my arms from behind and is yelling for me to calm down. I yank my arms away from him and stand up, intent on getting Lake out of here, away from Javi. She\u2019s probably beyond pissed at me right now, but the feeling is pretty damn mutual.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting up, clutching her chest, attempting to take a breath. As much as I want to yell at her, I\u2019m immediately overcome by worry when I realize she\u2019s hurting. I just want to get her away from everyone. I take her hand and pull her up, then wrap my arm around her waist to help her walk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you home.\u201d</p><p>When we reach my car, I help her inside and shut her door, then walk around to my side of the car. Before I get in, I take several deep breaths in an attempt to calm myself down. I can\u2019t imagine what possessed her to allow him to kiss her after seeing me practically confess my love for her on stage. Does she not even give a shit anymore? I close my eyes and inhale through my nose, then open the door and climb in.</p><p>I pull out of the parking lot, unable to form a thought, much less a coherent sentence. My hands are shaking, my heart is about to beat out of my chest, I probably need stitches, and my career is now in jeopardy . . . but the only thing I can think about is the fact that she kissed him.</p><p>She kissed him.</p><p>The thought consumes me the entire drive. She hasn\u2019t said a single thing, so she has to be feeling pretty guilty right now. As soon as I feel the urge to turn to her and tell her exactly what I think of her actions tonight, I choose to get out of the car, instead. It\u2019s better for both of us if I get a breather. I can\u2019t keep this all in anymore. I pull the car over to the side of the road and punch the steering wheel. I can see her flinch out of the corner of my eye, but she says nothing. I swing the car door open and quickly get out before I say something I\u2019ll regret. I start walking in an attempt to clear my head. It doesn\u2019t help. When I\u2019m at least fifty yards away from the car, I bend down and pick up a handful of gravel, then throw it at nothing.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I yell. \u201cShit, shit, shit!\u201d I\u2019m not sure at this point what or why or who I\u2019m even mad at. Lake is in no way tied to me. She can date whoever she wants. She can kiss whoever she wants. The fact that I overreacted isn\u2019t her fault at all. I should never have performed that poem. I freaked her out. We were finally in a good spot and I went and screwed it all up.</p><p>Again.</p><p>I tilt my head up to the sky and close my eyes, allowing the cold flakes of snow to fall on my face. I can feel the tightness and pressure increasing near my eye. It hurts like hell. I hope Javi is hurting worse than I am.</p><p>Asshole.</p><p>I throw another rock, then walk back toward the car. We drive home with so much that needs to be said, but not a single word spoken.</p><p>WHEN WE GET to my house, I help her onto the couch, then walk to my kitchen and grab an ice pack out of the freezer. The tension between us has never been thicker, but I can\u2019t bring myself to talk to her about it. I don\u2019t want to know why she ran after I performed. I don\u2019t want to know why she ran to Javi of all people. I sure as hell don\u2019t want to know why she kissed him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes are closed when I reach the couch again. She looks so peaceful just lying there. I watch her for a moment, wishing I knew what the hell was going through her head, but I refuse to ask. I can carve pumpkins just as well as she can.</p><p>I kneel beside her and her eyes flick open. She looks at me with horror and reaches up to my eye. \u201cWill! Your eye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I say, shaking it off. She pulls her hand back and I lean forward and grasp the bottom edge of her shirt. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d I say, asking permission to lift her shirt. She shakes her head, so I pull the shirt up over her back. She\u2019s already got a bruise from where that asswipe punched her. I lay the icepack over her injury, then pull her shirt back down on top of it.</p><p>I walk to the front door and leave her on the couch as I make my way across the street to inform Julia. When I knock on the door, it takes her a while to finally answer. When she sees me standing there with blood on my face, she immediately gasps Lake\u2019s name.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay,\u201d I quickly say. \u201cThere was a fight at the club and she was hit in the back. She\u2019s on my couch.\u201d Before I can say anything else, Julia shoves past me and runs across the street. When I finally make my way back into my living room, she\u2019s holding Lake in her arms. Julia takes her hand and helps her up. I hold the door open as they both walk out. Lake doesn\u2019t even make eye contact with me when she leaves. I shut the door behind them, then head to the bathroom and begin cleaning my injury. When I\u2019ve got it bandaged up, I grab my phone and text Gavin.</p><p>If I come pick you up first thing in the morning, can you go with me to get Lake\u2019s Jeep and drive it back to Ypsi?</p><p>I hit send and sit down on the couch. I can\u2019t even wrap my mind around everything that\u2019s happened tonight. I feel like I\u2019m living someone else\u2019s dream. Someone else\u2019s nightmare.</p><p>How early?</p><p>Early. I have to be at the school by 7:30. Is 6:00 okay?</p> <p>I\u2019ll do it under one condition. If you don\u2019t get fired tomorrow, I\u2019m exempt from every single assignment for the rest of the year.</p><p>See you at six.</p><p>HE OPENS THE passenger door and climbs inside. Before I\u2019ve even backed out of his driveway, he lays into me.</p><p>\u201cYou realize you screwed up, right? Do you know who Javier\u2019s father is? If you even have a job to go back to today, you won\u2019t have it by this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but don\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell prompted you to kick a student\u2019s ass, Will?\u201d</p> <p>I sigh and pull onto the main road, keeping my eyes focused in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI know whatever happened had to do with Layken. But what the hell did Javi do? You were pummeling him like he was your punching bag. Please tell me it was self-defense so you at least have a chance at keeping your job. Was it self-defense?\u201d he asks, looking straight at me for an answer.</p><p>I shake my head no. He sighs, then leans forcefully back against his seat.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you take her home! Why the hell would you let her in your car alone in front of him? That\u2019s enough to get you fired without even kicking his ass. Why the hell did you kick his ass?\u201d</p><p>I look over at him. \u201cGavin, I screwed up. I realize this. You can shut the hell up now.\u201d</p><p>He nods and props his leg on the dash and doesn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>IT\u2019S THE FIRST time I\u2019ve ever made it into the office before Mrs. Alex. It\u2019s eerily quiet, and for a moment, I actually wish she were here. I walk around her desk toward Mr. Murphy\u2019s office. I glance inside and he\u2019s casually seated at his desk with the phone to his ear and his feet propped up. His face lights up when he sees me, but the illumination quickly fades when he sees the damage to my eye. He holds up a finger, so I take a few steps away from his door to give him some privacy.</p><p>I\u2019ve thought about this moment so many times before. The moment I would walk into Mr. Murphy\u2019s office and resign. Of course, I always imagined the end result would be my walking out of his office and into Lake\u2019s life.</p> <p>My fantasy is nothing like my current reality. Lake hates me right now and her feelings are warranted. I push her away every time she gets close to me, then every time she finally gets used to being without me, I do something to screw with her head even more. Why did I think performing that poem last night was a good idea? We were finally in a good spot. She was finally learning to balance all the negativity in her life, and I go and make it worse.</p><p>Again.</p><p>That\u2019s all I do is make things worse for her. That\u2019s probably the reason she turned to Javi. I\u2019d like to think she was just kissing him to make me jealous, but my biggest fear is that she was kissing him because she\u2019s completely moved on from me. It\u2019s my biggest fear, yet it\u2019s exactly what I know she needs.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cooper,\u201d Mr. Murphy says, walking past me. \u201cIs this something that can wait until I get back? I\u2019ve got an eight o\u2019clock meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d I stammer. \u201cWell, actually it\u2019s pretty important.\u201d</p><p>He stops next to the wall of mailboxes and pulls the contents of his box out. \u201cHow important? So important it can\u2019t wait until ten?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt can\u2019t wait,\u201d I say reluctantly. \u201cI, um . . . sort of got in a fight last night. With a student.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Murphy stops sorting his mail and darts his head toward me. \u201cSort of? You did or you didn\u2019t, Mr. Cooper. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid,\u201d I reply. \u201cDefinitely did.\u201d</p><p>He turns to face me full on and leans his back against the row of mailboxes behind him. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier Cruz.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, then rubs the back of his neck while he thinks. \u201cI\u2019ll have Mrs. Alex set up an appointment with his father at ten. In the meantime, I suggest you find someone to fill in for you,\u201d he says. \u201cBe back here at ten.\u201d He walks over to Mrs. Alex\u2019s desk and writes something down. I nod, not at all surprised by his guarded reaction. I pick my satchel up and walk toward the office exit.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cooper?\u201d he calls out.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere there any other students involved? Anyone who can give an accurate account of what happened?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. I really don\u2019t want to get her involved, but it doesn\u2019t seem like I\u2019m going to have a choice. \u201cYes. Layken Cohen,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIs this Javier\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d he asks, writing down Layken\u2019s name.</p><p>The question causes me to wince, but from the looks of them last night I\u2019d say it\u2019s a very legitimate question. \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d I exit the office, hoping they don\u2019t bring Lake and Javi in at ten. I don\u2019t know if I can keep it together in the same room with both of them.</p><p>I\u2019M SEATED AT the table, waiting for the conference to begin. Luckily, Mr. Murphy met with Javier privately, not wanting us to have to interact. I\u2019m supposed to meet with Mr. Murphy as soon as the conference with Javier\u2019s father is over. I\u2019m not really that eager to share my version of events, since I\u2019m obviously the one in the wrong here. The fact that Mr. Murphy brought in a member of campus police doesn\u2019t do anything to ease my apprehension. I\u2019m not sure what the legal ramifications are of what occurred last night and if Javier is planning on pressing charges, but I guess I deserve whatever result my actions bring about.</p><p>The door opens and Lake walks into the room. I literally have to force myself not to look at her. I can\u2019t help the emotional reaction I have to her, and I\u2019m afraid everyone in the room will see it. I keep my gaze focused on the table in front of me.</p><p>\u201cMs. Cohen, please take a seat,\u201d Mr. Murphy says. Lake takes a step forward and slides into the seat next to me. I clench my fists, fighting the tension between us that seems to have only increased since last night.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mr. Cruz, Javier\u2019s father,\u201d says Mr. Murphy. \u201cThis is Officer Venturelli,\u201d he says, motioning to both men. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know why you\u2019re here. It is our understanding that there was an incident involving Mr. Cooper that occurred off of school grounds,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would appreciate it if you could tell us your version of events.\u201d</p><p>I glance toward Lake just as she turns her head toward me. Her eyes search mine for guidance, so I nod, silently encouraging her to tell the truth. I could never let her lie for me. She turns back to Mr. Murphy. The exchange we just shared was no more than three seconds, but the look of concern for me in her eyes was undeniable.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t hate me. She\u2019s worried for me.</p><p>She clears her throat and adjusts herself in her seat. She places her hands on the table in front of her and begins picking at her nail polish when she speaks. \u201cThere was a misunderstanding between me and Javier,\u201d she says. \u201cMr. Cooper showed up and pulled him off me.\u201d</p><p>I can feel the heat in my face when the lies start coming out of her mouth. Why is she lying for me? Did I not make it clear that I wanted her to tell the truth about last night? I tap my knee against hers when she pauses. She glances up at me, but before I can tell her to tell the truth, Mr. Murphy interrupts.</p><p>\u201cCan you start at the beginning, please, Ms. Cohen? We need to be clear on the entire sequence of events. Where were you and what were all of you doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in Detroit at a poetry slam. It\u2019s part of a required assignment for Mr. Cooper\u2019s class. I arrived early before the other students. Something happened and I felt uncomfortable and had to leave, so I left just a few minutes after I arrived, which is when I ran into Javier outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened that made you uncomfortable?\u201d Officer Venturelli asks her. She flicks her gaze in my direction, but only for a moment. She looks back at Officer Venturelli and shrugs. \u201cMaybe uncomfortable isn\u2019t the right word,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cOne of the performers . . .\u201d She pauses and takes a deep breath. Before she continues, she touches her knee to mine and doesn\u2019t retract it, causing me to swallow a lump in my throat. The move is deliberate, and it confuses the hell out of me. \u201cI was just really moved by one of the pieces performed last night. It meant a lot to me,\u201d she whispers. \u201cSo much that I just wanted to leave, before I got too emotional.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and put my elbows on the table, then rest my face in the palms of my hands. I can\u2019t believe she just said those words, and she said them just for my benefit. Knowing that she\u2019s trying to tell me how my poem made her feel is making this too much to bear. I have the overwhelming urge to pull her up out of her chair and kiss her in front of everyone, then scream my resignation at the top of my lungs.</p><p>\u201cMy Jeep was parked behind the venue and on my way outside, I ran into Javier. He offered to walk me to my car. I needed to use his phone, so we were standing by his truck while it was charging. We were talking about the weather and . . .\u201d her voice grows quiet and she shifts uncomfortably in her seat.</p><p>\u201cMs. Cohen, is this something you would rather tell me in private?\u201d Mr. Murphy asks.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she says. \u201cI was . . . I was asking him about the weather and he just started kissing me. I told him no and tried to push him away, but he wouldn\u2019t stop kissing me. I didn\u2019t know what to do. He had me pinned against his truck, and I guess that\u2019s when Mr. Cooper saw what was happening and he pulled him off me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have a grip on the edge of the table that is so tight, I don\u2019t even notice until Lake taps my leg and glances down at my hands. I release the table from my grasp and close my eyes, breathing slow and steady. Her confession should give me nothing but relief, knowing that my bout of jealousy will now be played off as if I were protecting her. However, I\u2019m anything but relieved. I\u2019m furious. Javier is lucky his ass isn\u2019t in here, because there would have been an extremely detailed reenactment of last night right in this office.</p><p>Lake continues sharing her version of the story, but I don\u2019t hear another word of it. I do my best to hold it together until everyone\u2019s dismissed, but it\u2019s the hardest five minutes I\u2019ve ever had to contain myself. As soon as they dismiss her, Mr. Cruz and Officer Venturelli follow her out the door. I stand up in my seat and let out a breath. I pace back and forth under the intense gaze of Mr. Murphy. I\u2019m not able to speak yet due to the rage coursing through me, so I continue to pace and he continues to silently watch me.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cooper,\u201d he says calmly, \u201cdo you have anything else to add or is her version accurate?\u201d</p><p>I pause and look at him. \u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t accurate,\u201d I say, \u201cbut unfortunately it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill,\u201d Mr. Murphy says. \u201cYou did the right thing. Quit being so hard on yourself. Javier was completely out of line and if you weren\u2019t there to stop him, there\u2019s no telling what would have happened to that girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he being expelled?\u201d I ask, stopping to grip the back of the chair.</p><p>Mr. Murphy stands and walks to the door where Officer Venturelli is outside speaking with Mr. Cruz. He closes the door and turns toward me. \u201cWe can\u2019t expel him. He\u2019s claiming it was a misunderstanding and he thought she wanted him to kiss her. We\u2019ll suspend him for a few days for the fight, but that\u2019s the extent of his punishment.\u201d</p><p>I nod, very aware that what I\u2019m about to do is the only answer at this point. There\u2019s no way I can ever be in the same room with Javier again and not have it end badly.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d like to resign,\u201d I say evenly.</p> <p>16.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cYOU WILLINGLY RESIGNED?\u201d Lake asks, dumbfounded. \u201cI thought it was a mutual agreement. They would have let you keep your job, Will. Why the hell did you resign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLake, there\u2019s no way I could have continued teaching there. I\u2019d reached my breaking point. I was going to get fired one of two ways if I hadn\u2019t resigned that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s true. They would have fired me the first day Javier returned to school because I would have kicked his ass the moment I laid eyes on him. That, or they would have fired me because one more second in a room with you and I would have jumped you, but in a completely different way.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cYeah. The tension was intense. We would have lost control eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually? We lost control that same day,\u201d I say, reminding her of our incident in the laundry room.</p><p>She frowns and closes her eyes, then sighs a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNothing. It\u2019s just hard thinking about that night. It really hurt,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I kiss her lightly on the forehead. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>laundry room</p><p>I SOMEHOW MADE it to the end of the workday without getting suspended, fired, or arrested. I\u2019d say being transferred to Detroit to finish out my student teaching is one of the best outcomes I could have anticipated.</p> <p>I pull into the driveway and the boys are helping Lake and Julia with groceries. I haven\u2019t even made it out of the car yet when Caulder meets me at the door, beaming with excitement.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d he says, grabbing my hand. \u201cWait till you see this!\u201d</p><p>I walk across the street with him and grab the rest of the sacks and take them inside. When I set them down, I notice the contents aren\u2019t groceries. It looks like sewing supplies.</p><p>\u201cGuess what we\u2019re going to be for Halloween?\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia\u2019s cancer!\u201d he yells.</p><p>Did I just hear him right?</p><p>Julia walks into the room with her sewing machine and I give her a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cYou only live once, right?\u201d She smiles and places the sewing machine on the bar.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s letting us make the tumors for the lungs,\u201d Kel says. \u201cYou want to make one? I\u2019ll let you make the big one.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even know how to respond. \u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKel,\u201d Lake interrupts. \u201cWill and Caulder can\u2019t help, they\u2019ll be out of town all weekend.\u201dSeeing the excitement on Caulder\u2019s face, there\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather be than right here. \u201cActually, that was before I found out we were making lung cancer,\u201d I say. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to reschedule our trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHERE\u2019S YOUR MEASURING tape?\u201d Lake asks Julia.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have one, actually.\u201d</p><p>I have measuring tape, so I try to think of a way to get Lake to come with me to get it. I know she\u2019s dying to know what happened today and I owe her a huge apology for acting the way I did toward her last night. She had experienced what was more than likely a horrifying event alone with Javi, and I acted like a jerk the entire way home. I was trying to refrain from yelling at her last night, when I should have been consoling her.</p><p>\u201cWill has one. We can use his,\u201d Lake says. \u201cWill, do you mind getting it?\u201d</p><p>I play dumb. \u201cI have measuring tape?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cYes, it\u2019s in your sewing kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a sewing kit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in your laundry room.\u201d She spreads the material out in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s next to the sewing machine on the shelf behind your mother\u2019s patterns. I put them in chronological order according to pattern nu\u2014 Never mind,\u201d she says quickly. She shakes her head and stands. \u201cI\u2019ll just show you.\u201d</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>I quickly jump up, maybe a little too eagerly.</p><p>\u201cYou put his patterns in chronological order?\u201d Julia asks.</p><p>\u201cI was having a bad day,\u201d Lake says over her shoulder.</p><p>I hold the door for Lake, then close it behind us. She turns around and completely loses her calm demeanor. \u201cWhat happened? God, I\u2019ve been worried sick all day,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI got a slap on the wrist,\u201d I say as we walk toward my house. \u201cThey told me since I was defending another student, they couldn\u2019t really hold it against me.\u201d</p><p>I jog a few steps and open my front door for her, stepping aside to let her in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. What about your internship?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a little tricky. The only available ones they had in Ypsilanti were all primary. My major is secondary, so I\u2019ve been placed at a school in Detroit.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me, her eyes full of concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean? Are y\u2019all moving?\u201d</p><p>I love the fact that the thought of our moving scares her so bad. I laugh. \u201cNo, Lake, we\u2019re not moving. It\u2019s just for eight weeks. I\u2019ll be doing a lot of driving, though. I was actually going to talk to you and your mom about it later. I\u2019m not going to be able to take the boys to school, or pick them up either. I\u2019ll be gone a lot. I know this isn\u2019t a good time to ask for your help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. You know we\u2019ll help.\u201d She grabs the tape measure and shuts the box, then walks the kit back to the laundry room. I follow her, but I\u2019m not sure why I feel compelled to. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s about to head straight back to her house and I still have so much left I need to say to her. I walk into the laundry room behind her and pause in the doorway. She\u2019s staring quietly in front of her, running her fingers across my mother\u2019s patterns. She\u2019s got that distant look in her eyes again. I lean against the doorframe and watch her.</p><p>I still can\u2019t believe I thought she would willingly allow Javi to kiss her, especially after seeing my performance last night. I know her better than that, and she knows she deserves so much better than Javi.</p><p>Hell, she deserves so much better than me.</p><p>She reaches to the wall and flicks off the light, then turns toward me. She comes to a halt when she sees that I\u2019m blocking the doorway. She quietly gasps and looks up at me, her beautiful green eyes full of hope again. She scrolls her eyes over my features, searching my face, waiting for me to either speak or move out of her way. I don\u2019t want to do either. All I want to do is take her in my arms and show her how I feel about her, but I can\u2019t. She stares up at me, slowly dropping her gaze to my mouth. She tugs on her bottom lip with her teeth and nervously darts her eyes to the floor.</p><p>I\u2019ve never wanted to be teeth so bad in my entire life.</p><p>I take a deep breath and prepare to get out what I need to say, despite knowing I shouldn\u2019t say it. I just need her to know why I did what I did last night, and why I acted the way I acted. I fold my arms across my chest and prop my foot against the doorway, looking down at it. Avoiding eye contact with her is probably best right now, considering my lack of resolve at the moment. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve been alone in a situation like this. The way things have been going the past few weeks, I had myself convinced that I was stronger than I am, and that I\u2019ve overcome the weakness I feel when I\u2019m around her.</p><p>I was completely wrong.</p><p>My heart slams against my chest at record speed and I\u2019m consumed by an insatiable desire to grab her by the waist and pull her to me. I hug myself tighter in an attempt to keep my hands to myself. I work my jaw back and forth, hell bent on finding a way to bury my urge to confess to her, but I can\u2019t. The words spill out of me before I can stop them.</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d I say, my voice cracking the tension like a sledgehammer. \u201cWhen I saw Javi kissing you . . . I thought you were kissing him back.\u201d</p><p>I swing my eyes to her, searching for a reaction. Any reaction. I know how she tries to hide what she\u2019s feeling more than any other person I\u2019ve ever met.</p><p>Her eyes widen at the realization that I wasn\u2019t defending her at all last night. I was reacting like a possessive boyfriend, not her knight in shining armor.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the whole story until this morning, when you told your version,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t know how I held myself together in the office this morning when I found out. All I wanted to do was lunge across the table and punch Javi\u2019s father across the jaw for raising such an asshole. Just thinking about it causes my blood to boil. I inhale a deep breath, filling my lungs to their maximum capacity before huffing out a sigh. I notice my hands are clenched into tight fists, so I relax them and run my hands through my hair, turning to face her.</p><p>\u201cGod, Lake. I can\u2019t tell you how pissed I was. I wanted to hurt him so bad. And now? Now that I know he really was hurting you? I want to kill him.\u201d I lean my head back against the doorframe and close my eyes. I have to get the thought of him out of my head. He hurt her, and I wasn\u2019t there in time to protect her. The image of him pressing his mouth to hers against her will is clear in my mind, as is the fact that his lips were the last to touch hers. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be kissed like that. She deserves to be kissed by someone who loves her. Someone who spends every waking moment trying to do everything right by her. Someone who would rather die than see her hurt. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be kissed by anyone other than me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her brows are furrowed and she\u2019s staring at me with a confused expression. \u201cHow did you\u201d\u2014she pauses\u2014\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you. When I finished my piece, I saw you leaving.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me and quietly sucks in a small breath with my admission. Her hand searches for support behind her and she takes a step back, steadying herself. Despite the darkness, I can see her eyes dance with hope. \u201cWill, does this mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>I immediately take two steps forward, closing the gap between us. My chest heaves with each passing breath as I attempt to calm my desire to show her just how sincere my words were last night. I trail the back of my fingers against the smooth skin of her cheek, then hook my thumb under her chin, bringing her face closer to mine. The simple contact of her skin against my fingers reminds me of what her kiss is capable of doing to me. It hypnotizes me. Her touch completely, wholeheartedly shakes me to my core and I try to force myself to slow down.</p> <p>She places her hand against my chest when I wrap my arms around her. I can feel her wanting to resist, but her need is just as strong as mine. I take a step forward until she finds solid backing and I quickly lean in and press my lips to hers before either of us has time to change our minds. When my tongue finds hers, she moans a soft moan and becomes putty in my hands, dropping her arms to her sides. I kiss her passionately, tenderly, and eagerly all at the same time.</p><p>I grip her by the waist and easily lift her up onto the dryer, taking a stance between her legs and never losing contact with her lips. She begins to pull at my shirt, wanting me closer, so I oblige by pulling her against me as she encircles me with her legs. Her nails lightly dig into the muscles of my forearms as her fingers search their way up my arms. When she reaches my neck, her hands glide through my hair, sending chills to places I didn\u2019t even know could get chills. She grabs tufts of my hair in her fists and pulls my head down, repositioning my mouth against the sweet skin of her neck. She takes the opportunity to catch her breath, panting and quietly moaning as my lips tease their way across her collarbone. I reach behind her and grab a handful of hair just as she did mine, then lightly tug until she leans her head back, giving me more access to the incredibly perfect skin against my lips. She does just as I\u2019d hoped and arches her back, giving my lips silent permission to resume their pursuit as I make my way down her neck. I release her hair and slide my hand down her back, slipping my fingers between her skin and her jeans. My fingertips skim the top edge of her panties, and I groan under my breath.</p><p>Having her in my arms fills the constant void that has been in my heart since the first night I kissed her, but with every passing moment, every kiss, and every stroke of her hands, an even greater desire builds within me. I need more of her than these stolen moments of passion. I need so much more.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>I mumble against her skin, unable to get out an audible response. I don\u2019t really feel like talking at the moment. I run my other hand up the back of her shirt until it meets her bra and I pull her against me as I work my way back up her neck toward her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cDoes this mean . . .\u201d she breathes heavily. \u201cDoes it mean we don\u2019t have to pretend . . . anymore? We can be . . . together? Since you\u2019re not . . . since you\u2019re not my teacher?\u201d</p><p>My lips freeze against her neck with her breathless words. I want more than anything to cover her mouth with my own and make her stop talking about it. I just want to forget about it all for one night. Just for one night.</p><p>But I can\u2019t.</p><p>My incredibly irresponsible moment of weakness just gave her the wrong idea. I\u2019m still a teacher. Maybe not her teacher, but I\u2019m still a teacher. And she\u2019s still a student. And everything happening between us right now is still completely wrong, no matter how right I want it to be.</p><p>In the process of thinking about all of the potential complications of her question, I\u2019ve somehow released her from my death grip and have taken a step away from her.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d she says, sliding off the dryer. She steps closer to me and the fear in her eyes makes my stomach drop. I did this to her.</p> <p>Again.</p><p>I can feel the regret and agony creep up to my face, and it\u2019s obvious she can see it, too.</p><p>\u201cWill? Tell me. Do the rules still apply?\u201d she says fearfully.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say that can make it any less painful. It\u2019s obvious I just made a huge mistake. \u201cLake,\u201d I whisper, my voice full of shame. \u201cI had a weak moment. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She steps forward and shoves her hands into my chest. \u201cA weak moment? That\u2019s what you call this? A weak moment?\u201d she yells. I flinch at her words, knowing I just said the wrong thing. \u201cWhat were you gonna do, Will? When were you gonna stop making out with me and kick me out of your house this time?\u201d</p><p>She spins on her heel and storms out of the laundry room. Seeing her walk away causes me to panic at the thought of not only upsetting her, but losing her for good. \u201cLake, don\u2019t,\u201d I plead, following after her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. It won\u2019t happen again, I swear.\u201d</p><p>She turns to face me, tears already streaming down her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re damn right it won\u2019t! I finally accepted it, Will! After an entire month of torture, I was finally able to be around you again. Then you go and do this! I can\u2019t do it anymore,\u201d she says, throwing her arms up in defeat. \u201cThe way you consume my mind when we aren\u2019t together? I don\u2019t have time for it anymore. I\u2019ve got more important things to think about now than your little weak moments.\u201d</p><p>Her words slam me. She\u2019s absolutely right. I\u2019ve gone so long trying to get her to accept things and move on so she won\u2019t be burdened by my life, but I can\u2019t even resist her long enough not to cave in to my selfish desire for her. I don\u2019t deserve her. I don\u2019t deserve her forgiveness, let alone to be loved by her.</p> <p>\u201cGet me the measuring tape,\u201d she says, standing with her hand on the door.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the damn floor! Get me the measuring tape!\u201d</p><p>I walk back into the laundry room and retrieve the measuring tape, then take it back to her, placing it in her hand. She looks down at my hand clamped over hers. She wipes away falling tears with her other hand. She refuses to even look at me. The thought of her hating me for what just happened between us terrifies me. I love her so much and I want more than anything to be able to give it all up for her.</p><p>But I can\u2019t. Not yet.</p><p>She has to know how hard this is for me, too. \u201cDon\u2019t make me the bad guy, Lake. Please.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her hand from mine and looks into my eyes. \u201cWell you\u2019re certainly not the martyr, anymore.\u201d She walks out, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>The words \u201cwait for me\u201d pass my lips just as the door closes, but she doesn\u2019t hear me. \u201cI want you to wait for me,\u201d I say again. I know she can\u2019t hear me, but the fact that I can say it out loud gives me the confidence I need to run after her and tell her to her face.</p><p>I love her. I know she loves me. And despite what Julia thinks is good for us, I want her to wait for me. We need to be together. We have to be together. If I don\u2019t stop her from walking away right now, I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life.</p><p>I swing open the door, prepared to run after her, but I pause when I see her. She\u2019s standing in her entryway, wiping away the tears that I\u2019m responsible for. I watch as she takes a few deep breaths, trying to pull herself together before walking into her house. Seeing her effort to move past what just happened so that she can help her mother inside her own home brings it all back into perspective.</p><p>I\u2019m the last thing she needs in her life right now. I have too much responsibility, and with how things are going for her right now, the last thing she needs is to put her life on hold for me. Everything I say or do just brings her more grief and heartache and I can\u2019t ask her to hold on to that while she waits for me. She doesn\u2019t need to focus on me. Julia\u2019s right. She needs to focus on her family.</p><p>I reluctantly walk back into my house and shut the door behind me. The realization that I need to let her go for good physically brings me to my knees.</p><p>17.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cI WISH MORE than anything I had gone after you that night,\u201d I say. \u201cI should have told you exactly what I wanted to say. It would have saved us both a world of heartache.\u201d</p><p>Lake sits up on the bed and hugs her knees, looking down at me. \u201cNot me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m happy things worked out the way they did. I think we both needed that breather. And I definitely don\u2019t regret all the time I spent with my mother during those three months. It was good for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I smile. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t run after you.\u201d</p><p>She releases her knees and falls back onto the bed. \u201cBut still. It was so hard living across the street from you. All I wanted to do was be with you, but I didn\u2019t want anyone to know that. It\u2019s like I spent the entire three months pretending to be happy when I was in front of other people. Eddie was the only one who knew how I really felt. I didn\u2019t want Mom to know because I felt like it would just burden her even more if she knew how sad I was.\u201d</p><p>I raise up and lean forward, crawling on top of her. \u201cThank God she knew how we both really felt, though. Do you think you would have showed up at the slam the night before my graduation if she didn\u2019t encourage you to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would have shown up. If it weren\u2019t for her telling me about your conversation with her, I would have continued the rest of the year thinking you didn\u2019t love me like I loved you.\u201d</p><p>I press my forehead against hers. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you showed up,\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou changed my life forever that night.</p><p>schooled</p><p>I\u2019VE SPOKEN TO Lake once in the last three months.</p><p>Once.</p><p>You would think it would get easier, but it hasn\u2019t. Especially today, since my last day of student teaching is finally over. I graduate tomorrow, which should be a day I\u2019m looking forward to more than anything. Instead I\u2019m dreading it, knowing Lake won\u2019t be waiting for me.</p><p>There are two emotions in this world I\u2019ve learned I can handle. Love and hate. Lake has loved me at times and she\u2019s hated me at times. Love and hate, despite their polar opposites, are both feelings that are induced by passion. I can handle that.</p><p>It\u2019s the indifference I don\u2019t know how to process.</p><p>I went to her house a few weeks ago to talk to her about my new job at the junior high and she didn\u2019t seem to care one way or another. I would have taken it well if she had been happy for me and wished me good luck. I would have taken it even better if she had cried and begged me not to do it, which is what I was hoping would happen more than anything. It\u2019s the sole reason I even went to tell her about the job in the first place. I didn\u2019t want to accept it if I thought I still had a chance with her.</p><p>Instead, she didn\u2019t react either way. She congratulated me, but the indifference in her voice was clear. She was simply being polite. Her indifference finally sealed our fate, and I knew in that moment that I had messed with her heart one too many times. She was over me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She is over me.</p><p>I have a two-week window in which I\u2019ll be nothing. I won\u2019t be a student. I won\u2019t be a teacher. I\u2019ll be a twenty-one-year-old college graduate. I\u2019ve thought about walking straight over to Lake\u2019s house today to tell her how much I love her, even though I\u2019m technically still a teacher, considering the contract I have with the junior high. Not even that would stop me if it weren\u2019t for the way she reacted to me last month with so much indifference. She seemed to have accepted our fate, and it was good to see her handling everything so well, as much as it hurt. The last thing I want to do, or need to do, is pull her back down with me.</p><p>God, this is going to be the hardest two weeks of my life. I need to keep my distance from her, that\u2019s a fact.</p><p>When the audience begins clapping, I snap back to reality. I\u2019m supposed to be judging tonight, but I haven\u2019t heard a single word any of the performers have said. I hold up the standard 9.0 on my scorecard without even looking up at the stage. I don\u2019t even want to be here tonight. In fact, I don\u2019t want to be anywhere tonight.</p> <p>When the scores are tallied, the emcee begins to announce the winners. I lean back in my seat and close my eyes, hoping the night goes fast. I just want to go home and get to bed so graduation will come and go tomorrow. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m dreading it. Probably because I\u2019ll be the only person there who couldn\u2019t find enough people to give my graduation tickets to. The average person never gets enough tickets for graduation. I have too many.</p><p>\u201cI would like to perform a piece I wrote.\u201d</p><p>I jerk up in my seat at the sound of her voice, the sudden movement almost causing my chair to flip backward. She\u2019s standing on the stage, holding the microphone. The guy next to me laughs along with the rest of the crowd once they realize she\u2019s interrupting the night\u2019s schedule.</p><p>\u201cCheck this chick out,\u201d he says, nudging me with his elbow.</p><p>The sight of her paralyzes me. I\u2019m pretty sure I forgot how to breathe. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m about to die. What the hell is she doing? I watch intently as she brings the microphone back to her lips. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t standard protocol, but it\u2019s an emergency,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The laughter from the audience causes her eyes to widen and she spins around to look for the emcee. She\u2019s scared. Whatever she\u2019s doing, it\u2019s completely out of character for her. The emcee nudges her to face the front of the room again. I take a deep breath, silently willing her to keep calm.</p><p>She places the microphone back in its stand and lowers it to her height. She closes her eyes and inhales when the guy next to me yells, \u201cThree dollars!\u201d</p><p>I could punch him.</p><p>Her eyes flick open and she shoves her hand into her pocket, pulling out money to hand to the emcee. After he takes the money, she prepares herself again. \u201cMy piece is called\u2014\u201d The emcee interrupts her, tapping her on the shoulder. She shoots him an irritated glance. I expel a deep breath, becoming just as irritated by all the interruptions. She takes the change from him and shoves it back into her pocket, then hisses something at him that makes him retreat off the stage. She turns back toward the audience and her eyes scan the crowd.</p><p>She has to know I\u2019m here. What the hell is she doing?</p><p>\u201cMy piece is called Schooled,\u201d she says into the microphone. I swallow the lump in my throat. If I wanted to move at this point, my body would fail me. I\u2019m completely frozen as I watch her take several deep breaths, then begin her piece.</p> <p>I got schooled this year.</p><p>By everyone.</p><p>By my little brother . . .</p><p>by The Avett Brothers . . .</p><p>by my mother, my best friend, my teacher, my father,</p><p>A boy that I\u2019m seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in love with.</p><p>I got so schooled this year.</p><p>By a nine-year-old.</p> <p>He taught me that it\u2019s okay to live life</p><p>a little backward.</p><p>And how to laugh</p><p>At what you would think</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>By a band</p><p>They taught me how to find that feeling of feeling again.</p><p>They taught me how to decide what to be</p><p>And go be it.</p><p>I got schooled this year.</p><p>By a cancer patient.</p><p>She taught me so much. She\u2019s still teaching me so much.</p><p>She taught me to question.</p><p>To never regret.</p><p>She taught me to push my boundaries,</p><p>Because that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for.</p><p>She told me to find a balance between head and heart</p><p>And then</p><p>she taught me how . . .</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>By a foster kid.</p><p>She taught me to respect the hand that I was dealt.</p><p>And to be grateful I was even dealt a hand.</p><p>She taught me that family</p><p>Doesn\u2019t have to be blood.</p><p>Sometimes your family</p><p>are your friends.</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>By my teacher</p><p>He taught me</p><p>That the points are not the point,</p><p>The point is poetry . . .</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>By my father.</p><p>He taught me that heroes aren\u2019t always invincible</p><p>And that the magic</p><p>is within me.</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>A boy that I\u2019m seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in love with.</p><p>And he taught me the most important thing of all\u2014</p><p>To put the emphasis</p><p>On life.</p><p>COMPLETELY.</p><p>Utterly.</p><p>Frozen.</p><p>My eyes drop to the table in front of me when she finishes. Her words are still sinking in.</p><p>A boy that I\u2019m seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in love with.</p><p>In love with?</p><p>That\u2019s what she said.</p><p>In love with. As in present tense.</p><p>She loves me. Layken Cohen loves me.</p><p>\u201cHold up your scores, man,\u201d the guy next to me says, forcing the scorecard into my hand. I look at it, then look up at the stage. She\u2019s not up there anymore. I spin around and see her making her way toward the exit in a hurry.</p><p>What the hell am I doing just sitting here? She\u2019s waiting on me to acknowledge everything she just said, and I\u2019m sitting here frozen like an idiot.</p><p>I stand up when the judges to the right of me hold up their scorecards. Three of them gave her a nine, the other an 8.5. I round the front of the table and flip the scores on all of their cards to tens. The points may not be the point, but her poetry kicked ass. \u201cShe gets tens.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and jump onto the stage. I grab the microphone out of the emcee\u2019s hands and he rolls his eyes, throwing his hands up in the air.</p><p>\u201cNot again,\u201d he says, defeated.</p><p>I spot her as soon as she swings the doors open to step outside. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d I say into the microphone. She stops in her tracks, then slowly turns around to face the stage. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t leave before you get your scores.\u201d</p><p>She looks at the judges\u2019 table, then back to me. When she makes eye contact, she smiles.</p><p>I grip the microphone, hell bent on performing the piece I wrote for her, but the magnetic pull to jump off the stage and take her in my arms is overwhelming. I stand firm, wanting her to hear what I have to say first. \u201cI\u2019d like to perform a piece,\u201d I say, looking at the emcee. \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency.\u201d He nods and takes a few steps back. I turn around to face Lake again. She\u2019s standing in the center of the room now, staring up at me.</p><p>\u201cThree dollars,\u201d someone yells from the crowd.</p><p>Shit. I pat my pockets, realizing I left my wallet in my car. \u201cI don\u2019t have any cash,\u201d I say to the emcee.</p><p>His eyes shift to Lake and mine follow. She pulls out the two dollars in change from her fee and walks to the stage, slapping it down in front of us.</p><p>\u201cStill a dollar short,\u201d he says.</p><p>Jesus! It\u2019s one freaking dollar!</p><p>The silence in the room is interrupted as several chairs slide from under their tables. People from all over the floor walk toward the stage, surrounding Lake as they throw dollar bills onto the stage. Everyone quickly makes their way back to their seats and Lake eyes the money, dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the emcee says, taking in the pile of cash at my feet. \u201cI guess that covers it. What\u2019s the name of your piece, Will?\u201d</p><p>I look down at Lake and smile right back at her. \u201cBetter than third.\u201d</p><p>She takes a few steps back from the stage and waits for me to begin. I take a deep breath and prepare to tell her everything I should have said to her three months ago.</p><p>I met a girl.</p><p>A beautiful girl</p><p>And I fell for her.</p><p>I fell hard.</p><p>Unfortunately, sometimes life gets in the way.</p><p>Life definitely got in my way.</p><p>It got all up in my damn way,</p><p>Life blocked the door with a stack of wooden two-by-fours nailed together and attached to a fifteen-inch concrete wall behind a row of solid steel bars, bolted to a titanium frame that no matter how hard I shoved against it\u2014</p><p>It</p><p>wouldn\u2019t</p><p>Sometimes life doesn\u2019t budge.</p><p>It just gets all up in your damn way.</p><p>It blocked my plans, my dreams, my desires, my wishes, my wants, my needs.</p><p>It blocked out that beautiful girl</p><p>That I fell so hard for.</p><p>Life tries to tell you what\u2019s best for you.</p><p>What should be most important to you.</p><p>What should come first</p><p>Or second</p><p>Or third.</p><p>I tried so hard to keep it all organized, alphabetized, stacked in chronological order, everything in its perfect space, its perfect place.</p><p>I thought that\u2019s what life wanted me to do.</p><p>This is what life needed for me to do.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Keep it all in sequence?</p><p>Sometimes life gets in your way.</p><p>It gets all up in your damn way.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t get all up in your damn way because it wants you to just give up and let it take control. Life doesn\u2019t get all up in your damn way because it just wants you to hand it all over and be carried along.</p><p>Life wants you to fight it.</p><p>Learn how to make it your own.</p><p>It wants you to grab an axe and hack through the wood.</p><p>It wants you to get a sledgehammer and break through the concrete.</p><p>It wants you to grab a torch and burn through the metal and steel until you can reach through and grab it.</p><p>Life wants you to grab all the organized, the alphabetized, the chronological, the sequenced. It wants you to mix it all together,</p><p>stir it up,</p><p>blend it.</p><p>Life doesn\u2019t want you to let it tell you that your little brother should be the only thing that comes first.</p><p>Life doesn\u2019t want you to let it tell you that your career and your education should be the only thing that comes in second.</p><p>And life definitely doesn\u2019t want me</p><p>To just let it tell me</p><p>that the girl I met\u2014</p><p>The beautiful, strong, amazing, resilient girl</p><p>That I fell so hard for\u2014</p><p>Should only come in third.</p><p>Life knows.</p><p>Life is trying to tell me</p><p>That the girl I love?</p><p>The girl I fell</p><p>So hard for?</p><p>There\u2019s room for her in first.</p><p>I\u2019m putting her first.</p><p>AS SOON AS the last line escapes my lips, I set the microphone down on the stage and jump off. I walk directly to her and take her face in my hands. Tears are falling down her cheeks, so I wipe them away with my thumbs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, Lake.\u201d I lean my forehead against hers. \u201cYou deserve to come first.\u201d</p><p>Telling her exactly how I feel about her is the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever done. The honesty comes so naturally. It\u2019s the months of hiding my feelings that have been unbearable. I breathe a huge sigh of relief when the weight of holding everything back disappears.</p><p>She laughs through her tears and places her hands on top of mine, looking up at me with the most beautiful smile. \u201cI love you, too. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her softly on the lips. My heart feels like it literally swells within my chest when she kisses me back. I wrap my arms around her and bury my face into her hair, pulling her tightly against me. I close my eyes, and it\u2019s suddenly just the two of us. Me and this girl. This girl is in my arms again . . . touching me, kissing me, breathing me in, loving me back.</p> <p>She\u2019s not just a dream, anymore.</p><p>Lake moves her mouth to my ear and whispers, \u201cWe probably shouldn\u2019t be doing this here.\u201d I open my eyes and the concern on her face registers with me. She\u2019s still a student. I\u2019m still technically a teacher. This probably doesn\u2019t look very good if anyone here knows us.</p><p>I reach down and take her hand, then pull her toward the exit. As soon as we\u2019re outside, I grab her by the waist and push her against the door. I\u2019ve been waiting months to be with her like this. Two more seconds without touching her and I. Will. Die.</p><p>I lower my hand to the small of her back, then lean in and kiss her again. The feeling I get when my lips are on hers is something I\u2019ve thought about, over and over, since the first time I kissed her. But actually being in the moment with her again, knowing my feelings for her are reciprocated, is nothing short of amazing.</p><p>She runs her hands inside my jacket and up my back, pulling me to her as she returns my kiss. I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d rather do for the rest of my life than be wrapped up in her arms with her lips pressed to mine. But I know that despite what we\u2019ve been through and despite how I feel about her, I\u2019ve still got responsibilities. I don\u2019t know how much more waiting she\u2019s willing to do. The thought of it takes all of the excitement built up inside of me and crushes it.</p> <p>I stop kissing her and wrap my hands in her hair, then pull her to my chest. I take a long, deep breath and she does the same, locking her hands together behind my back.</p><p>\u201cLake,\u201d I say, stroking her hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen in the next few weeks. But I need you to know that if I can\u2019t back out of my contract . . .\u201d</p><p>She immediately jerks her head up and looks at me with more fear in her eyes than I\u2019ve ever seen. She thinks I\u2019m telling her I might not choose her, and the fact that something so absurd is running through her mind right now makes me hurt for her. This is how I\u2019ve made her feel for the past three months and she thinks I\u2019m doing it to her all over again.</p><p>\u201cWill, you can\u2019t do this to . . .\u201d</p><p>I press my finger to her lips. \u201cShut up, babe. I\u2019m not telling you we can\u2019t be together. You\u2019re stuck with me now whether you like it or not.\u201d I pull her back to my chest. \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to say is, if I can\u2019t break out of my contract, it\u2019s only four months. I just need you to promise that you\u2019ll wait for me if it comes to that. We can\u2019t let anyone know we\u2019re together until I find out what I need to do.\u201d</p><p>She nods against my shirt. \u201cI promise. I\u2019ll wait as long as you need me to.\u201d</p> <p>I close my eyes and rest my cheek against her head, thankful that all the times I\u2019ve pushed her away haven\u2019t made her lose faith in me completely.</p><p>\u201cThis probably means we shouldn\u2019t be standing out here like this,\u201d I say. \u201cYou want to come to my car?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wait for her to answer, because I need her to come to my car with me. I\u2019m not ready to stop kissing her yet, but I can\u2019t keep doing it so carelessly and in public like this. I grab her hand and lead her to my car. I open the passenger door, but rather than let her get in first, I sit in the seat and pull her onto my lap, then shut the door. I pull my keys out of my pocket and reach over to crank the car so it\u2019ll warm up. She positions herself on my lap, straddling me. I acknowledge that our position is incredibly intimate, being as though I can count the number of times we\u2019ve kissed on one hand, but it\u2019s the only comfortable way to make out in a car.</p><p>I take her hands and pull them up between us, then kiss them. \u201cI love you, Lake.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cSay it again. I love hearing you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I love saying it. I love you.\u201d I kiss her cheek, then her lips. \u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper again.</p><p>\u201cOne more time,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve imagined hearing you say it. I\u2019ve been hoping this whole time that whatever I was feeling wasn\u2019t one-sided.\u201d</p><p>The fact that she had no idea how I felt about her makes my chest ache. \u201cI love you, Lake. So much. I\u2019m so sorry for putting you through everything I\u2019ve put you through.\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cWill, you were doing the right thing. Or trying to, anyway. I get that. I just hope this is for real now, because you can\u2019t push me away again. I can\u2019t go through that again.\u201d</p><p>Her words are like a knife to my heart, but deservedly so. I don\u2019t know what I could do or say that could convince her that I\u2019m here. I\u2019m staying. I chose her this time.</p><p>Before I have the chance to convince her of that, she grabs my face and kisses me hard, causing me to groan under my breath. I slip my hands underneath her shirt and around to her back. The softness and warmth of her skin beneath my palms is a feeling I never want to forget.</p><p>As soon as my hands meet her skin, she takes my jacket in her fists and begins tugging it off me. I lean forward, still meshed to her mouth, and struggle to free myself from the jacket. Once it\u2019s off, I toss it behind me and place my hands back underneath her shirt.</p><p>Touching her, kissing her, being with her . . . it feels so natural. So right.</p><p>I move my lips to the spot on her neck that drives me crazy. She tilts her neck to the side and moans quietly. I move my hands to her waist and tighten my grip while I trail kisses along her collarbone. I slowly inch my hands up her waist until my thumbs meet her bra. I can feel her heart hammering against her chest, and it causes my own heart to try to outrace hers. As soon as I slip my right thumb underneath her bra, she pulls back, away from my lips. She gasps for air.</p><p>I immediately pull my hands out from underneath her shirt and place them on her shoulders, silently cursing myself for being so impatient. I push her shoulders back in order to give us space to breathe. I lean my head back against the seat and close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I open my eyes and keep my head flush against the headrest. \u201cI\u2019m going too fast. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve just imagined touching you so many times I feel like it\u2019s so natural. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and pulls my hands away from her shoulders, holding them together between us. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re both going too fast. I just need a moment. But it feels right, doesn\u2019t it? It feels so right being with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it is right.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me silently, then out of nowhere, she crushes her lips to mine again. I groan and wrap my arms tightly around her, pulling her back against me. As soon as she\u2019s pressed against my chest, I place my hands on her shoulders and push her away. As soon as she\u2019s apart from me, I pull her back to me for another kiss. This happens several times and I keep having to remind myself to slow down. I eventually have to push her off my lap and onto the driver\u2019s seat. However, this doesn\u2019t help, because as soon as she leans her back against the driver\u2019s side door, I lean across the seat and kiss her again. Seeing how much I need her causes her to laugh, which makes me laugh at how pathetically desperate I\u2019m acting right now. I somehow pull away and slump against the passenger door. I run my hand through my hair and grin at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really making this hard,\u201d I laugh. \u201cPun intended.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and even in the dark I can see her blush.</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d I run my palms over my face and groan. \u201cGod, I want you so bad.\u201d I lunge forward and kiss her, but place my hand on the doorknob. I yank it and the door opens up behind her. \u201cGet out,\u201d I say against her lips. \u201cGo get in your car where you\u2019re safe. I\u2019ll see you when we get home.\u201d</p><p>She nods and swings one of her legs out of the car, but I don\u2019t want her to go. I grab her thigh and pull her back in and kiss her again. \u201cGo,\u201d I groan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d She laughs, pulling away from me. She climbs out of the car and I slide across the seats, following her straight out the car door.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you park?\u201d I ask her. I wrap my arms around her and press my lips to her ear.</p><p>\u201cA few cars over,\u201d she says, pointing behind her. I slide my hand into her back pocket and retrieve her keys, then walk her to her car. After I open the door for her and she climbs in, I lean in to kiss her one last time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go inside when you get home. I\u2019m not finished kissing you,\u201d I say.</p><p>She grins. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>I shut her door and once her Jeep is cranked, I tap my knuckles against the window and she rolls it down. I place my hand on the nape of her neck and lean through her window. \u201cThis drive home is about to be the longest thirty minutes of my life.\u201d I kiss her on the temple and take a step back. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>She rolls up her window, then places her palm against the glass. I lift my hand up to mirror hers, matching our fingertips together. She mouths, \u201cI love you, too,\u201d and begins backing away.</p><p>I wait until she\u2019s out of the parking lot, then I walk back to my car.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t understand how I went so long without her and now I feel like she\u2019s such a vital part of me, I\u2019ll die if I\u2019m not touching her.</p><p>I\u2019M NOT EVEN in my car for a minute before I dial her number. I\u2019ve never called her without the conversation being linked to Kel or Caulder before. It feels good calling her for her.</p><p>She\u2019s driving directly in front of me so I can see her reach for her phone when it rings. She tilts her head and holds the phone between her shoulder and her neck. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk on the phone while you\u2019re driving,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t call me when you know I\u2019m driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you for the whole sixty seconds we\u2019ve been apart,\u201d she says sarcastically.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI want to talk to you while we drive, but I want you to put your phone on speaker and set it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I say, \u201cit\u2019s not safe for you to drive with your head cocked to the side like that.\u201d</p><p>I can see her smile in her rearview mirror. She drops the phone and sits up straight. \u201cBetter?\u201d she says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter. Now listen, I\u2019m about to play you an Avett Brothers song. Make sure the volume on your phone is turned all the way up.\u201d I turn on the song I\u2019ve listened to on repeat since the night I fell for her and turn the volume up. When the chorus hits, I start singing along to the lyrics.</p><p>I lower my voice and continue to sing the rest of the song, then the song after that, and the song after that. She listens silently the entire drive back to Ypsilanti.</p><p>LAYKEN PULLS INTO her driveway right before I turn into mine. I rush to kill the engine and head across the street before she has a chance to open her car door. When I reach her, I swing the door open and reach in, pulling her out by her hand. I want to push her against the Jeep and kiss her crazy, but I know we\u2019ve more than likely got at least three pairs of eyes on us. What I wouldn\u2019t give to have her alone in my house right now, rather than out here in the open. I kiss the top of her head and stroke her hair, accepting whatever time I can get with her right now.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a curfew?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m eighteen. I don\u2019t know if she could give me one if she wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to push our luck with her, Lake. I want to do this right.\u201d I\u2019m lucky that Julia would even allow her to be with me at this point. The last thing I want to do is upset her.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to talk about my mom right now, Will?\u201d</p><p>I smile and shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d I slip my hand behind her head and pull her mouth to mine, kissing her like I don\u2019t care who might be watching. Hell, I don\u2019t care. I kiss her crazy for several minutes until it gets to the point that my hands can\u2019t stay above her shoulders for much longer. I pull away just enough for us to catch our breath.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to your house,\u201d she whispers.</p> <p>The suggestion is so tempting. I close my eyes and pull her to my chest. \u201cI need to talk to your mom first before I pull something like that. I need to know what our boundaries are.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWhy? So we can push them?\u201d</p><p>I lift her chin and pull her gaze to mine. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>The entryway light flicks off, then back on. An indication that Julia is setting some boundaries.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d I groan into her neck. \u201cI guess this is goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, though, right? What time do you have to leave for graduation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot until tomorrow afternoon. You want to come over for breakfast? I\u2019ll make you whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cAnd lunch? What are you doing for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooking for you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAnd dinner? I might want to have dinner with you, too.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s so cute. \u201cActually, we have plans. My grandparents are coming to graduation and we\u2019re going out to dinner afterward. Will you come?\u201d</p><p>A worried look crosses her face. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s a good idea? What if someone sees us together? You\u2019re technically still a teacher, even though you\u2019re between jobs.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. I\u2019m really starting to hate this new job and I haven\u2019t even started yet. \u201cI guess I do need to figure that out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to come to your graduation, though. Is that okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou better,\u201d I say to her. I\u2019ve wanted her there more than anyone, but until tonight I didn\u2019t think that was a possibility. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard as hell keeping my hands off you, though.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her one last time, then back away from her. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I turn and begin walking away. My emotions are contradicting themselves because I feel absolutely elated that we\u2019re finally together, but devastated that I have to leave her right now. I turn around to look at her one last time and when I catch sight of her watching me walk away, a satisfied smile spreads across my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks when she sees the look on my face.</p><p>Just seeing the smile on her face is enough to keep me satisfied for the rest of my life. Seeing her happy again is better than any feeling in the world. I never want to see her sad again. \u201cThis will be worth it, Lake. Everything we had to go through. I promise. Even if you have to wait for me, I\u2019ll make it worth it.\u201d</p><p>The smile fades from her eyes and she clutches her hand to her heart. \u201cYou already have, Will.\u201d</p><p>That. Right there. I don\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>I walk swiftly back to where she\u2019s standing and take her face in my hands. \u201cI mean it,\u201d I say. \u201cI love you so damn much, it hurts.\u201d I force my lips against hers, then pull away just as fast. \u201cBut it hurts in a really good way.\u201d I briefly kiss her again. \u201cWe thought it was hard being apart before? How the hell am I supposed to sleep after tonight? After actually getting to kiss you like this? After hearing you tell me you love me?\u201d I kiss her again and walk her until she\u2019s against her Jeep.</p><p>I kiss her like I\u2019ve wanted to kiss her since the moment I knew how perfect we were together. How much we made sense. I kiss her with abandon, knowing I\u2019ll never have to walk away from her again. I kiss her knowing that this won\u2019t be our last kiss. That it won\u2019t even be our best kiss. I kiss her knowing that this kiss is our beginning, not another good-bye.</p><p>I continue to kiss her, even when the light turns off and on several more times.</p><p>We both notice the light, but neither of us seems to care. It takes us several minutes to actually slow down and pull apart. I press my forehead to hers and look directly into her eyes when she opens them. \u201cThis is it, Lake,\u201d I say, pointing back and forth between us. \u201cIt\u2019s real now. I\u2019m not walking away from you again. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fill with tears. \u201cPromise?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI swear. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>A tear rolls down her cheek. \u201cSay it again,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lake.\u201d My eyes scroll over every inch of her face, afraid I\u2019ll miss something if I don\u2019t take every last piece of her in before I go.</p><p>\u201cOne more time.\u201d</p><p>Before I love you can come out of my mouth again, the front door swings open and Julia walks outside. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to set some ground rules,\u201d she says. There\u2019s more amusement in her voice than anger or annoyance.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Julia,\u201d I yell over my shoulder. I turn back to Lake and kiss her one last time, then take a step away from her. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m madly in love with your daughter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Julia laughs. \u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>I mouth one last I love you before heading across the street.</p><p>18.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cAND WE LIVED happily ever after,\u201d she says.</p><p>I laugh, because that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, for like two weeks,\u201d I say. \u201cUntil your mother put the brakes on things the night she walked in on us.\u201d</p><p>Lake groans. \u201cOh, my God, I forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not something I wish I remembered.\u201d</p><p>point of retreat</p><p>\u201cWHERE ARE WE going?\u201d</p><p>I put my seat belt on and lower the volume on the radio. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the first night I\u2019ve been able to take her out in public since we officially started dating two weeks ago. I was able to pull out of my contract with the job at the junior high when I was accepted into the Master\u2019s level teaching program. So technically, we\u2019re able to date. I\u2019m not sure how it would look, since I was her teacher just a few weeks ago. But to be honest, I don\u2019t really care. Like I told her, she comes first now.</p><p>\u201cWill. It\u2019s Thursday night. I have a feeling wherever you\u2019re taking me, it\u2019s not that much of a surprise. Are we going to Club N9NE?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cAre you doing a slam for me?\u201d</p><p>I wink at her. \u201cMaybe.\u201d I reach over and take her hand in mine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving early, though. Are you actually taking me out to eat? No grilled cheese tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say again.</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cWill, this date is going to be my suck for the day if you don\u2019t become a little more talkative.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYes, we\u2019re going to Club N9NE. Yes, we\u2019re going to dinner first. Yes, I wrote a slam for you. Yes, we\u2019re leaving the club early so we can go back to my house and hardcore make out in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just became my sweet,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOUT OF ALL the restaurants in Detroit, you chose a burger joint,\u201d I say, shaking my head. I take her hand and lead her toward the club entrance. I like to give her a hard time, but I love that she chose a burger joint.</p><p>\u201cBite me. I like burgers.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around her and nip at her neck. \u201cI like you.\u201d I keep my arms wrapped around her and my lips attached to her neck as we walk through the door. She pries my fingers from around her waist and presses her palm against my forehead, pushing me away from her neck. \u201cYou need to be a gentleman in public. No more kissing until we\u2019re back in your car.\u201d</p><p>I lead her back to the exit. \u201cWell, in that case, we\u2019re done here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She yanks my hand back. \u201cNo way. If you plan on seducing me on your couch later, you have to seduce me with your words, first. You promised a performance tonight and we\u2019re not leaving until I see one.\u201d She walks me toward the booth that Eddie and Gavin saved us seats in. She scoots in beside Eddie and I scoot in beside her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Eddie says, eyeing us curiously.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lake and I say simultaneously. Eddie\u2019s expression grows even more curious.</p><p>\u201cThis is weird,\u201d Eddie finally says.</p><p>Gavin nods. \u201cIt is weird. It really is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so weird?\u201d Lake asks.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d Eddie says to Lake. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been dating for a couple of weeks now, but this is the first time I\u2019ve actually seen you with him. Like this, anyway. You know, all in love and stuff. It\u2019s just weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Lake says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take some getting used to. It just seems like you\u2019re doing something wrong. Something illegal,\u201d Eddie says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-one,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI\u2019m not even a teacher anymore. What\u2019s so weird about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is weird,\u201d Gavin says again. \u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><p>I can see their point, but I think they\u2019re overreacting. Especially Gavin. He\u2019s known how I\u2019ve felt about Lake for months. \u201cWhat exactly is so weird?\u201d I put my arm around Lake\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThis?\u201d I turn and kiss Lake hard on the mouth until she laughs and pushes me away. We both turn back to Eddie and Gavin and they\u2019re still staring at us like we\u2019re a freak show.</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d Eddie says, crinkling up her nose.</p><p>I pick up a sugar packet and toss it in Eddie\u2019s direction. \u201cGo sit somewhere else, then,\u201d I tease. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gavin picks up the sugar packet and throws it back at me. \u201cWe were here first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen deal with it,\u201d I say.</p><p>The table grows quiet and it\u2019s obvious Lake and Eddie have no idea Gavin and I are only kidding around.</p><p>\u201cPersonally,\u201d Gavin says, leaning forward. \u201cI thought you and Mrs. Alex made a much better couple.\u201d</p> <p>I shrug. \u201cShe shot me down. I had to go with my second choice,\u201d I say, nudging my head toward Lake.</p><p>Lake scoffs at the same time the emcee begins speaking into the microphone.</p><p>\u201cThe sac has been preselected tonight, due to time constraints by the performer. Everyone please welcome Will Cooper back to the stage.\u201d</p><p>The crowd starts clapping and I slide out of the seat.

We\u2019ll be really, really, really busy after this.\u201d I kiss her on the cheek and walk to the stage. I don\u2019t even give myself time to prepare. I begin my poem as soon as I reach the microphone so that I don\u2019t waste another second. \u201cMy piece is called The Gift. . . .\u201d</p> <p>If my dad were alive, he\u2019d be sitting right there</p><p>Watching me up here, with a smile on his face</p><p>He\u2019d be proud of the man I\u2019ve become</p><p>He\u2019d be proud that I stepped up to take his place</p><p>If my mother were alive, she\u2019d be at home</p><p>Teaching my brother all the things she taught me</p> <p>She\u2019d be proud of the man I\u2019ve become</p><p>She\u2019d be proud of who I grew up to be</p><p>But they aren\u2019t here.

I can feel their smiles.</p><p>I can hear them say, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Will.\u201d</p><p>When I thank them for sending you from heaven.</p><p>AS SOON AS I return to the booth she\u2019s trying to thank me with a hug, but instead I grab her hand and wave over my shoulder as I pull her to the exit. \u201cSee you guys later,\u201d I say to Gavin and Eddie. I don\u2019t even wait for them to say good-bye as we make our way to the door. I remain two steps in front of Lake the entire way back to the car, practically dragging her along behind me. I can\u2019t think of anything but being alone with her tonight. We\u2019re never alone and I need some uninterrupted, alone time with her before I go crazy.</p><p>When we reach the car, I practically shove her inside, then climb into the driver\u2019s seat. I crank the car, then turn toward her and grab her shirt and pull her mouth to mine while I back out of the parking spot.</p><p>\u201cWill, do you realize your car is moving?\u201d she says, attempting to pull away from my grip. I glance out the rear window and cut the steering wheel to the right, then turn back to her.</p><p>\u201cYep. We need to hurry. You\u2019ve got a curfew and that only gives us two more hours together.\u201d I press my lips to hers again and she shoves my forehead back with the palm of her hand.</p><p>\u201cThen stop kissing me and drive. It won\u2019t be much fun making out with you when you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPULL OVER,\u201d SHE says, several houses down from my driveway.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust pull over. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>I pull over and park the car on the side of the street. She leans across the seat and kisses me, then pulls the keys from the ignition. \u201cIf my mom sees your car, she\u2019ll know we\u2019re back. She told me to bring you to my house if we came home early. She doesn\u2019t want us alone at your house. Let\u2019s sneak in through your back door and we can come get your car later.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in awe. \u201cI think I\u2019m in love with your brain,\u201d I say.</p><p>We both exit the car and run toward the back of the house we parked in front of. We make our way behind the fence, then crouch down and run across three backyards until we reach mine. I take the keys out of her hands and unlock the back door. Why do I feel like I\u2019m breaking in? It\u2019s my house.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn on the lights. She\u2019ll know we\u2019re back,\u201d I say as I help her make her way through the darkened doorway.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see,\u201d she says.</p><p>I put my arm around her back and bend down, scooping her legs up with my other arm. \u201cAllow me.\u201d</p><p>She throws her arms around my neck and squeals. I walk her until we\u2019ve reached the couch and gently lay her down. I take off my jacket and slip off my shoes, then reach down until I find her. I slide my hand down the length of her legs until I reach her feet, then I remove her shoes while she slips off her jacket.</p><p>\u201cAnything else you need me to remove?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Your shirt.\u201d</p><p>I immediately agree with that and pull my shirt over my head. \u201cWhy are we whispering?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>The sound of her voice when she whispers . . . knowing she\u2019s on her back . . . on my couch.</p><p>The significance of the next two hours is almost more than I can handle, knowing the things that could occur between us. I recognize that, so rather than lower myself on top of her, I kneel on the floor next to the couch. As much as I want her, I want to take it at her pace tonight, not mine. I tend to be extremely impatient when it comes to her.</p><p>I find her cheek in the dark and turn her face toward mine. When I touch her, her breath hitches. I feel it, too. I\u2019ve touched her face countless times before, but somehow in the dark with absolutely no interruptions, it seems a hell of a lot more intimate.</p><p>She moves her hand to the back of my neck and I press my lips lightly against hers. They\u2019re wet and cold and perfect, but as soon as I part her lips and taste her, perfect becomes the understatement of the year.</p><p>She responds to my kiss tentatively. We\u2019re both slowly exploring our limits and I want to be sure I\u2019m not taking it too fast this time. My hand remains on her cheek while we kiss, then I begin to slowly move it down her neck, trailing over her shoulder and down to her hip. Each movement I make only seems to encourage her, so I slip my hand underneath her shirt and grip her waist. I wait for any indication that she wants me to stop.</p><p>Or go further.</p><p>She presses her hands into my back, pulling me forward, indicating she wants me on the couch with her.</p><p>\u201cLake,\u201d I say, pulling back several inches. \u201cI can\u2019t. If I get on this couch with you . . .\u201d I release a deep breath. \u201cJust trust me. I can\u2019t get on this couch with you.\u201d</p><p>She reaches down to my hand that\u2019s still gripping her by the waist. She slides my hand up her stomach and doesn\u2019t stop until my hand is covering the cup of her bra.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cI want you on the couch with me, Will.\u201d</p><p>I immediately pull my hand away, but only because I need her shirt off. I practically yank it over her head and immediately join her on the couch. As soon as I lower myself on top of her and feel her pressed against my chest, I kiss her again and return my hand right where she put it. She smiles and wraps her legs around me as I kiss my way down her chin, straight to her neck.</p><p>\u201cI can feel your heartbeat right here,\u201d I say, kissing the base of her throat. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hand and slips it beneath her bra this time. \u201cYou can feel it beating right here, too.\u201d</p><p>I bury my face in the couch and groan. \u201cOh, my god, Lake.\u201d</p><p>I want to touch her. I want to feel all of her. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s stopping me. Why the hell am I so nervous?</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d</p><p>I pull my face away from the couch, very aware that my hand is still tucked safely beneath her bra. My hand has never been happier. \u201cYou want me to slow down? I will, Lake. Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and runs her hands down my back. \u201cNo. I want you to speed up.\u201d</p><p>My hesitation immediately disappears with those words. I slide my hand around her back and unfasten her bra, then slide it down her shoulders. I drop my mouth to her skin and as soon as the softest moan escapes her lips, my hand finds its way back to where she planted it earlier. I lower my lips, then immediately freeze at the sound of a key turning in the front door.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d About that time, the front door swings open and my living room light flicks on. I lift my head far enough to peer over the back of the couch and see Julia walking toward the hallway. I drop my head to Lake\u2019s neck. \u201cShit. It\u2019s your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she whispers, frantically pulling her bra back up. \u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d</p><p>I clamp my hand over her mouth. \u201cShe might not notice us. Be still.\u201d</p><p>Our hearts are pounding now faster than they\u2019ve ever pounded before. I know this, because my palm is still firmly planted right on top of Lake\u2019s breast. Apparently she recognizes the awkwardness of the moment, too.</p><p>\u201cWill, move your hand. This is weird.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hand away. \u201cWhat is she doing here?\u201d</p><p>Lake shakes her head. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when it happens. I\u2019ve heard people can see their lives flash before their eyes in the moments before death.</p><p>It\u2019s true.</p><p>Julia walks back into the room and screams.</p><p>I jump off Lake.</p><p>Lake jumps off the couch and there it is. My entire life flashes before my eyes the moment Julia sees Lake standing in my living room, fastening her bra.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just us,\u201d I blurt out. I don\u2019t know why I chose those words to be my possible last words. Julia is standing with her hand over her mouth, staring at us wide-eyed. \u201cIt\u2019s just us,\u201d I say again, as if she doesn\u2019t already know that.</p><p>\u201cI was . . .\u201d Julia holds up Caulder\u2019s pillow. \u201cCaulder wanted his pillow,\u201d she says. She looks back and forth between us and in a split second, her expression turns from fear to anger. I immediately reach down and retrieve Lake\u2019s shirt, then hand it to her.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Lake says. She doesn\u2019t follow it up with anything else because she has no idea what to say.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Julia says to Lake.</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d I say to Julia.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d Julia says to me, cutting a warning shot in my direction. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with you later.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words come out of Julia\u2019s mouth, Lake\u2019s face turns from embarrassed to really, really angry. \u201cMom, we\u2019re adults! You can\u2019t talk to him like that!\u201d Lake yells. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t prevent us from making out! This is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>I grab Lake\u2019s elbow in an attempt to calm her down. \u201cDon\u2019t, babe,\u201d I say quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looks at me defensively. \u201cShe can\u2019t tell me what to do, Will. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d</p><p>I calmly place my hand on her shoulder. \u201cLake, you\u2019re still in high school. You live under her roof. I shouldn\u2019t have brought you here, I\u2019m sorry. She\u2019s right.\u201d I lean in and kiss her briefly to calm her, then I take her shirt and help her pull it over her head.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Julia yells. \u201cAre you kidding me, Will? Don\u2019t help her put her clothes back on! I\u2019m standing right here!\u201d</p><p>What the hell am I thinking?</p> <p>I release the shirt and hold my palms up in the air, then back away from Lake. She looks at me apologetically and whispers, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d then heads toward the door.</p><p>The door doesn\u2019t even shut before Julia begins yelling at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dating him for two weeks, Lake! What do you think you\u2019re doing going that far with him that fast?\u201d The door finally closes and I sink back to the couch, feeling incredibly stupid. Incredibly guilty. Incredibly pathetic. Yet . . . somehow still incredibly happy.</p><p>I reach down and am picking my own shirt up when the front door swings open again. Julia has a grip on Lake\u2019s arm and marches her straight back into the living room, then positions her on the couch across from me.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t wait,\u201d Julia says. \u201cI don\u2019t even trust that y\u2019all won\u2019t start this back up tonight as soon as I go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Lake is looking at me the same way I\u2019m looking at her. Confused.</p> <p>Julia turns to Lake. \u201cAre y\u2019all having sex already?\u201d</p><p>Lake groans and covers her face with her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Lake says defensively. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had sex yet, okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m watching the conversation between them, hoping to hell I don\u2019t get involved in it.</p><p>\u201cYet?\u201d Julia says. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to?\u201d</p> <p>Lake stands and throws her hands up in the air. \u201cWhat do you want me to say, Mom? I\u2019m eighteen! Do you want me to tell you I\u2019ll be celibate forever? Because that would be a lie.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolls her head back and looks up at the ceiling for several seconds. When she looks at me, I dart my eyes to the floor. I\u2019m so embarrassed I can\u2019t even look at her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d she says flatly.</p><p>I glance at Lake, then to Julia. \u201cAt the end of the street,\u201d I reluctantly admit.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asks accusingly, and rightfully so.</p><p>\u201cMom, stop. This is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Julia turns her attention to Lake. \u201cRidiculous? Really, Lake? What I find ridiculous is the fact that you two parked at the end of the street and snuck over here to have sex less than a hundred yards from your mother. You\u2019ve only been dating him for two weeks! What I also find ridiculous is that you\u2019re acting like you did nothing wrong, when it\u2019s obvious you were trying to hide it by parking at the end of the damn street!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re all quiet for a moment. Lake leans her head against the back of the couch and closes her eyes. \u201cWhat now, then? If you\u2019re going to ground me let\u2019s just get it over with so you can stop embarrassing me.\u201d</p> <p>Julia sighs an extremely frustrated sigh. She walks over to the couch, taking a seat next to Lake. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to embarrass you, Lake. I just . . .\u201d</p><p>Julia sighs again and drops her face into her hands.</p><p>Lake rolls her eyes again.</p><p>I groan.</p><p>Julia lifts her head from her hands and takes a deep breath. \u201cLake?\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI just . . .\u201d She attempts to get out what she wants to say, but her eyes well up with tears. When Lake realizes Julia is crying, she sits up straight.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Lake says, scooting closer to her. She puts her arms around Julia and hugs her. Seeing her care for her mom despite her frustration with her absolutely melts my heart. It makes me love her even more, somehow.</p><p>Julia separates from Lake and wipes at her eyes. \u201cUgh!\u201d she says. \u201cThis is so hard for me. You have to understand that.\u201d She turns to Lake and takes her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play the sick card, but it\u2019s impossible not to. We\u2019re at this transition in our lives where you\u2019re becoming the grown-up. Sometime this year, as much as we don\u2019t want to admit it, you\u2019ll be raising my little boy. It breaks my heart to know that I\u2019m responsible for you being forced to grow up so fast. I\u2019m forcing you to become his guardian. I\u2019m forcing you to become the head of a household at eighteen. It\u2019s not fair to you. All the other areas of your life like falling in love and enjoying high school and new boyfriends and . . . having sex? I just feel like these are the last things you have left before you\u2019re forced to grow up completely. I know I can\u2019t slow down the inevitable, but I\u2019m taking away every other part of your youth by leaving you with all of this responsibility. Until that time comes, I guess I just want you to stop growing up. For my sake. Just stop growing up so fast.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she finishes speaking, Lake begins to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says to Julia. \u201cI get it, Mom. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I feel like an ass. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d I say to Julia.</p><p>Julia smiles at me and wipes at her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m still mad at you, Will.\u201d She stands up and looks at both of us. \u201cOkay. Now that we have that out of the way.\u201d She turns her attention to Lake. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the doctor tomorrow. You\u2019re getting on the pill.\u201d She turns to face me. \u201cAnd both of you need to think about this. There\u2019s no rush. You have the rest of your lives to be in a hurry. You both need to set good examples for these boys who look up to you. Sneaking around is not the kind of thing you want to be modeling. You think they don\u2019t notice, but they do. And you two are going to be the ones dealing with them as teenagers, so believe me. You don\u2019t want them throwing your own actions back in your faces.\u201d</p><p>She makes a terrifying, but excellent point.</p><p>\u201cI want you both to promise me something,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWait one year. There\u2019s no rush. You\u2019re both still young, so young. You\u2019ve been dating all of two weeks and believe me when I say this, the more you know about each other and the more in love you are, the better it\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>I do my best to pretend this is not coming out of my girlfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s mouth, but it doesn\u2019t help ease the awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Lake groans, sinking back into the couch.</p><p>\u201cWe promise,\u201d I say, standing up. I immediately regret making the promise to her, knowing what that will entail. An entire year of having to keep myself in check around Lake is like agreeing to infinity. Especially after being on that couch with her tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Julia. Really. I respect Lake and I respect you and . . . I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ll wait. I love Lake and that\u2019s all I need from her right now. Just knowing I can love her is more than enough.\u201d</p><p>Lake sighs and I look over at her. She\u2019s smiling at me. She stands up and throws her arms around my neck. \u201cGod, I love you,\u201d she says. She pulls away from my neck and kisses me.</p><p>\u201cMake sure that kiss is a good one, Lake, because you\u2019re grounded for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Lake and I both snap our heads in Julia\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cGrounded?\u201d Lake says incredulously.</p><p>Julia nods. \u201cRegardless of how much I love your boyfriend . . . you snuck over here knowing I told you I didn\u2019t want you alone at his house. So, yeah. You\u2019re grounded. I\u2019ll give you five minutes to say your good-byes and get home.\u201d Julia walks out and shuts the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d I say to Lake. I press my lips to hers and kiss her crazy for five solid minutes.</p><p>I MADE IT twenty-one years without her. After meeting her earlier this year, I somehow made it three months without her. Now, after finally being able to date her, I\u2019ve had to go another two weeks without her. But these past two weeks have been the most unbearable two weeks without her of my entire twenty-one years.</p><p>I know it\u2019s not even eight in the morning and it might seem desperate if I show up at her door this early, but we\u2019ve been waiting for these two weeks to pass for what feels like an eternity. I rush across the street and am lifting my hand to knock on the door when it swings open and she jumps into my arms, showering kisses all over my face.</p><p>\u201cWay to play hard to get,\u201d I hear Julia say from behind Lake. I put Lake down and shake my head slightly, letting her know we need to tone it down. Lake rolls her eyes and pulls me inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing today?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want. I was thinking maybe we could take the boys somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Julia says from the kitchen. \u201cThat would be great. I need a day of peace after being cooped up in this house with your mopey girlfriend for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Lake laughs and pulls me toward the hallway. \u201cCome to my room while I get ready.\u201d We disappear down the hallway and into her room. She shuts the door and pulls me to her bed. She falls back and I fall on top of her, our lips reconnecting after the torturous time they had to spend apart.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I missed you.\u201d</p><p>We kiss some more.</p><p>And some more.</p><p>And some more.</p><p>I wish we didn\u2019t have to leave this bedroom, because I could do this all day. She\u2019s already working her hands up the back of my shirt and I\u2019m groaning into her neck, remembering how close I got to actually being with her two weeks ago. I want to run my hand up her shirt, or touch her waist, or pull her legs around me, but I have no idea what\u2019s safe with her now. Now that we have to wait a whole damn year.</p><p>Why did I agree to that? As much as I understand where Julia was coming from, I still don\u2019t know how in the hell we\u2019re going to wait an entire year. Especially considering how much it\u2019s already driving me insane.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d I say, pulling my lips away from hers. \u201cWe need to talk about this.\u201d I lift up and sit on the bed beside her.</p><p>\u201cAbout what? Our plans today?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d I lean forward and kiss her again. \u201cThis,\u201d I say, waving my hand up and down her body. \u201cWe need to talk about what\u2019s okay and what\u2019s not. I really want to respect the promise we made to your mother, but at the same time there\u2019s no way in hell I can keep my hands off you. I just need to know what my boundaries are before I slip up.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying we need to set limits to how far we can go?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cExactly. I need you to tell me when I\u2019ve reached the point of retreat.\u201d</p><p>She grins mischievously. \u201cWell, there\u2019s only one way to find out what our boundaries are. I guess we need to test them.\u201d</p><p>I smile and scoot back down beside her, slowly looking her up and down. \u201cI like that idea.\u201d I brush away a strand of hair from her face and kiss her softly on the mouth. I run my nose across her jawline and kiss my way to her ear. \u201cHow\u2019s this? Should I retreat yet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cHell, no. Not even close.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand on her shoulder and slowly run my fingers down her arm, resting my hand on her waist. I lean in until my lips are barely touching hers again. \u201cHow about this?\u201d I ask her. I part her lips with my tongue, sliding my hand beneath her shirt and across her stomach. The muscles in her stomach clench beneath my palm. \u201cIs this your point of retreat?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She shakes her head slowly. \u201cNope. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>I lower my lips to her neck and my fingers crawl up her stomach and come to a stop where her bra usually is, if she were wearing one right now. I bury my head in her pillow and groan. \u201cGod, Lake. Seriously? Are you trying to kill me?\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head again. \u201cNot retreating yet. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>I raise my head away from her pillow and scroll over her lips with my eyes. My thumb grazes her breast and that\u2019s when we both lose it. Our lips crash together, and as soon as I cup her breast, she moans into my mouth and wraps a leg around my thigh. I immediately slide off her and stand up.</p><p>\u201cI think we found my point of retreat,\u201d I say, breathing heavily. I run my hands through my hair and back up to the wall, putting a safe distance between us. \u201cYou need to get dressed so we can leave. I can\u2019t be alone in here with you right now.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and rolls off the bed, then heads to her closet. \u201cAnd Lake? If you want to survive the day without being completely mauled by me, make sure you put on a bra.\u201d I wink at her and walk out of the room.</p><p>19.</p> <p>the honeymoon</p><p>HER EYES ARE closed, but there\u2019s a smile spread across her lips. I lean forward and lightly kiss them. \u201cYou asleep?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s late and we have to drive home tomorrow. I\u2019m not ready to go to sleep yet. I want to drag this night out as long as I can.</p><p>She shakes her head no, then opens her eyes. \u201cRemember the first time we didn\u2019t call point of retreat?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWell, considering it was just last night, then I\u2019d say I remember it pretty damn well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell me all about that,\u201d she says. She closes her eyes and cuddles up to me.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to tell you about last night?\u201d</p><p>She nods against my chest. \u201cYeah. It was the best night of my life. I want you to tell me all about it.\u201d</p><p>I smile, more than willing to tell her what I thought about the sweetest sweet I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>honeymoon night</p><p>\u201cTHREE MORE MINUTES,\u201d she says. She reaches behind her and pulls down on the handle, swinging the door open. \u201cNow carry me over the threshold, husband.\u201d</p><p>I bend down and grab her behind the knees and pick her up, throwing her over my shoulder. She squeals, and I push the door all the way open with her feet. I take a step over the threshold with my wife. The door slams behind us, and I ease her down onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cI smell chocolate. And flowers,\u201d she says. \u201cGood job, husband.\u201d</p><p>I lift her leg up and slide her boot off. \u201cThank you, wife.\u201d I lift her other leg up and slide that boot off, too. \u201cI also remembered the fruit. And the robes.\u201d</p> <p>She winks at me and rolls over, scooting up onto the bed. When she gets settled, she leans forward and grabs my hand, pulling me toward her. \u201cCome here, husband,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I start to make my way up the bed but pause when I come face to face with her shirt. \u201cI wish you\u2019d take this ugly thing off,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who hates it so much. You take it off.\u201d</p><p>So I do. I start from the bottom this time and press my lips against her skin where her stomach meets the top of her pants, causing her to squirm. She\u2019s ticklish there. Good to know. I unbutton the next button and slowly move my lips up another inch to her belly button. I kiss it. She lets out another moan, but it doesn\u2019t worry me this time. I continue kissing every inch of her until the ugly shirt is lying on the floor. When my lips find their way back to hers, I pause to ask her one last time. \u201cWife? Are you sure you\u2019re ready to not call retreat? Right now?\u201d</p><p>She wraps her legs around me and pulls me closer. \u201cI\u2019m butterflying positive,\u201d she says.</p><p>I grin against her lips, hoping that this entire year of being frustratingly patient will be worth it to her. \u201cGood,\u201d I whisper. I reach my hand beneath her and unclasp her bra, then help her slip it off. She slides her hands through my hair and pulls me against her.</p><p>By the time all of our clothes are off and we\u2019re wrapped together under the covers, I\u2019m breathing too hard to hear the pounding in my chest anymore, but I can definitely feel it. I press my lips to her neck and inhale a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cLake?\u201d My hands are exploring her and touching her and I can\u2019t decide if I ever want to stop long enough to actually consummate this marriage.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she says breathlessly.</p><p>I somehow find it in me to pull back and give myself enough space to look her in the eyes. I need her to know that she\u2019s not the only one experiencing something for the first time right now. \u201cI want you to know something. I\u2019ve never . . .\u201d I pause and pull back a little bit farther and hold my weight up on my left arm. I reach up and slip my hand to the nape of her neck, then dip my head and kiss her softly on the mouth. I look her directly in the eyes and finish telling her what I need her to know. \u201cLake . . . I\u2019ve never made love to a girl before. I didn\u2019t realize that until this very moment. You\u2019re the first girl I\u2019ll ever make love to.\u201d She smiles a heartbreakingly beautiful smile that completely swallows me up. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the last girl I\u2019ll ever make love to,\u201d I add. I lower my head and press my forehead to hers. We keep our eyes locked together as I lift her thigh and brace myself against her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Will Cooper,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Layken Cooper.\u201d</p><p>I hold still against her, taking one final look at this amazing, beautiful girl beneath me. \u201cYou\u2019re the greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to my life,\u201d I whisper. As soon as I push myself inside her, our lips collide, our tongues collide, our bodies collide, and our hearts collide. Then this girl completely shatters the window to my soul and crawls inside.</p><p>20.</p><p>the honeymoon</p><p>\u201cI LIKE THAT version,\u201d she says.</p><p>She\u2019s wrapped up in my arms where she\u2019s been most of the weekend. I couldn\u2019t have imagined a better way to spend the last forty-eight hours. I think back on everything we\u2019ve gone through . . . everything I just shared with her. Everything she learned about me and I learned about her and how, by some miracle, I\u2019ll leave this hotel room loving her just a little bit more than I did when we arrived. I kiss her on her forehead and close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, husband.\u201d</p><p>welcome home</p><p>I CAN\u2019T COUNT how many times I\u2019ve pulled into my own driveway. At least once a day since I\u2019ve lived here; sometimes twice. But I\u2019ve never pulled into this driveway with my wife before. I\u2019ve never pulled into the driveway of a house where I live with my own family\u2014a family other than my mom and dad. I\u2019ve never pulled into this driveway feeling so complete before.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna turn off the car?\u201d Lake asks.</p><p>Her hand is on her door handle and she\u2019s waiting for me to put the car in park and turn it off, but I\u2019m staring at the house, lost in thought. \u201cDon\u2019t you just love this driveway? I\u2019m pretty sure we have the best driveway in the whole world.\u201d</p><p>She lets go of the door handle and falls back against her seat. \u201cI guess,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a driveway.\u201d</p><p>I put the car in park and reach over and grab her hands, then pull her onto my lap. \u201cBut it\u2019s our driveway now. That makes it the best. And it\u2019s our house.\u201d I slip her shirt over her head and she tries to cover herself, but I move her arms out of the way and kiss up her neck while I talk about all the things that are no longer just mine. \u201cAnd the dishes in the kitchen are our dishes. And the couches are our couches. And the bed is our bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, stop.\u201d She laughs and attempts to pull my hands away from her bra. \u201cYou can\u2019t take off my bra, we\u2019re in our driveway. What if they come outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark,\u201d I whisper. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not your bra. It\u2019s our bra and I want it off.\u201d I slip it off her, pulling her against me as I rub my hands down the length of her back, then around to the button on the front of her jeans. \u201cAnd I want to take off our pants.\u201d</p><p>She grins against my lips and slowly nods. \u201cOkay, but hurry,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI can be quick,\u201d I assure her. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never hurry.\u201d</p><p>AFTER CHRISTENING THE driveway, we make it inside to a completely empty, dark house. I flip on the light switch in the kitchen and there\u2019s a note on the table.</p><p>\u201cMy grandparents left a few hours ago. The boys are with Eddie and Gavin across the street.\u201d</p><p>Lake tosses her purse on the couch and makes her way into the kitchen. \u201cDo we have to go get them right away? I sort of want to enjoy some quiet while we can. The second we tell them we\u2019re back, the honeymoon will officially be over. I\u2019m having fun; I don\u2019t want it to end yet.\u201d</p><p>I pull her to me. \u201cWho says it has to end? We still have rooms to christen. Where should we start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides your driveway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur driveway,\u201d I correct her.</p><p>She squints her eyes, then they suddenly widen with excitement. \u201cYour laundry room!\u201d she says excitedly. \u201cOur laundry room,\u201d she adds quickly, before I can correct her. She grabs the collar of my shirt and stands on her tiptoes, pressing her lips to mine. \u201cCome on,\u201d she whispers, pulling me along with her while she continues to kiss me.</p><p>The front door swings open and someone runs through the living room. I squeeze my eyes shut and groan as Lake separates her mouth from mine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind me, we just need the ketchup,\u201d Caulder yells. He runs past us and into the kitchen. He grabs the ketchup and glances at us as he makes his way back to the front door. \u201cGross,\u201d he mumbles before he pulls the door shut behind him.</p><p>Lake laughs and presses her head against my shoulder. \u201cWelcome home,\u201d she says unenthusiastically.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI wonder what they\u2019re eating? You gave me a solid two-day workout and I\u2019m hungry now.\u201d</p><p>Lake shrugs and pulls away from me. \u201cI don\u2019t know but I\u2019m hungry, too.\u201d</p><p>We both make our way across the street. When we reach the front door, she puts her hand on the doorknob, but pauses and turns to me before opening it.</p><p>\u201cShould I knock? It feels weird knocking on my own door, but I don\u2019t live here anymore.\u201d</p><p>I ease past her and grip the doorknob. \u201cNobody else knocks, why should we?\u201d I open the door and we make our way inside. The boys and Kiersten are seated at the table and Eddie and Gavin are both in the kitchen, filling plates with food.</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s back!\u201d Kiersten says when she spots us. \u201cHow was the honeymoon?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lake walks into the kitchen and as soon as Eddie sees her, she immediately takes her hand and pulls her down the hallway. \u201cYes, Layken. How was the honeymoon? I need details,\u201d Eddie says. They disappear into the bedroom.</p><p>I walk into the kitchen and take over the plates Eddie was working on. \u201cThe honeymoon was perfect,\u201d I tell Kiersten.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a honeymoon?\u201d Kel asks. \u201cWhat do people do when they go on one?\u201d</p><p>Gavin spits out his drink with his laugh. \u201cYes, Will,\u201d Gavin says, smirking at me. \u201cI must know what people do on honeymoons so that I\u2019m prepared for when I have mine. Enlighten us.\u201d</p> <p>I pick the plates up and glare at Gavin, then walk to the table. \u201cA honeymoon is what people have after they get married. It\u2019s when they spend a lot of time together . . . telling stories about their past. And eating. They tell stories and eat. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Caulder says. \u201cLike a campout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I say, taking my seat at the table across from Kiersten, who\u2019s rolling her eyes at me. She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lying to both of you because he thinks you\u2019re still nine years old. A honeymoon is when newlyweds have sex, traditionally for the first time. But in some cases,\u201d she rolls her head toward Gavin, \u201cpeople get ahead of themselves.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re all staring at Kiersten with our mouths agape when Lake and Eddie return.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is everyone so quiet?\u201d Eddie asks.</p><p>Gavin clears his throat and glances at Eddie. \u201cSuck and sweet time,\u201d he says. \u201cSit down, ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe first,\u201d Caulder says. \u201cMy sweet is that me and Kel are finally brothers. My suck is that I now know what Will and Layken did during their honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI second that,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>Lake looks at me questioningly, so I nudge my head toward Kiersten. \u201cBlame her.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten shoots me a glare that has become all too familiar from her. \u201cMy suck,\u201d she says, \u201cis that I seem to be the only person in this room aware of the importance of sex education. My sweet is that a few months from now, thanks to Gavin\u2019s inability to wait for his honeymoon, I\u2019ll have a steady job babysitting.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin spits his drink out for the second time in five minutes. \u201cNo. No way are you babysitting my daughter.\u201d He wipes his mouth and stands up, clinking his fork on the red plastic cup in his hand. \u201cI\u2019m going next because I can\u2019t wait another second to share my sweet.\u201d He turns to Eddie, seated next to him, and he clears his throat. Eddie smiles up at him and he presses his hand to his heart. \u201cMy sweet is that the woman I love, as of last night, has agreed to become my wife.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the word wife leaves his mouth, Kiersten and Lake are making high-pitched noises and hugging Eddie and jumping up and down. Eddie takes a ring out of her pocket and puts it on her finger to show the girls. Lake says something about this being her sweet and Eddie agrees, but Gavin has sat back down and all the boys are now eating while the girls are still squealing.</p><p>I look over at Lake and she\u2019s turning Eddie\u2019s hand back and forth in the light, admiring her ring. She\u2019s smiling. She looks so happy. Eddie is happy, too. The boys, aside from learning what you do during your honeymoon, are smiling. Gavin is watching Eddie and looks genuinely happy. I can\u2019t help but think back on these past two years and all we\u2019ve been through. The heartache we had to endure to get here and the tears we\u2019ve all shed in the process. I don\u2019t know how one minute, a person can think his life is nothing more than a barren valley with nothing left to look forward to. Then, in the blink of an eye, someone can come along and change it with a simple smile.</p><p>Lake looks at me and catches me smiling at her. She grins and leans against me as I wrap my arm around her. \u201cYou want to know my sweet?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She nods.</p><p>I kiss her on the forehead. \u201cYou. Always you.\u201d</p><p>The End.</p><p>\u201cGIVE HER SOME medicine!\u201d Gavin yells at the nurse. He\u2019s pacing back and forth. Beads of sweat have pooled on his forehead and he lifts a hand to wipe them away. \u201cLook at her! She\u2019s in pain, just look at her! Give her something!\u201d His face is pale and he\u2019s gesturing toward the hospital bed. Eddie rolls her eyes and stands up, taking Gavin by the shoulders and shoving him toward the door.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Will. You would think he would take it better since I\u2019m not the one in labor this time. If I don\u2019t get him out of here he\u2019ll pass out like he did when Katie was born.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but can\u2019t find it in me to laugh. Seeing Lake on that bed in as much pain as she\u2019s in has me feeling completely helpless. She\u2019s refusing medicine, but I\u2019m about to go grab a damn needle and give her some myself.</p><p>I walk to the head of her bed and as soon as the contraction passes, the tension eases slightly from her face and she looks up at me. I take the wet rag and press it against her cheek to cool her off. \u201cWater. I want water,\u201d she grumbles.</p><p>This is the tenth time she\u2019s asked for water in the past hour, and the tenth time I\u2019ll have to tell her no. I don\u2019t want to see the anger in her face again, so I just lie. \u201cI\u2019ll go ask the nurse.\u201d I quickly walk out of the room and take a few steps past the doorway, then collapse against the wall with no intention of looking for a nurse. I slide to the floor and drop my face into my hands and try to focus on the fact that this is really happening. Any minute now, I\u2019ll become a dad.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for this.</p><p>At least if Kel and Caulder turn out horrible, we can still blame mine and Lake\u2019s parents. This is a completely different ballgame. This baby is our responsibility.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Kel drops down beside me and kicks his legs out in front of him. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean,\u201d I answer truthfully.</p><p>He laughs.</p><p>It\u2019s been three years since Lake and I married, and three years since Kel moved in with me. I know that technically I\u2019m becoming a dad for the first time today, and in so many ways it\u2019s so different, but I can\u2019t imagine loving Kel any more if he really were my own. I can honestly say when my parents died, I felt cursed that my life had to change course like it did. But now, looking back, I know I\u2019ve been blessed. I couldn\u2019t imagine things any differently.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Kel says. He pulls his leg up and ties his shoe, then straightens it back out again. \u201cMy mom? She left me something I\u2019m supposed to give to you today.\u201d</p><p>I glance at him and, without having to ask, know immediately what it is. I hold out my hand and he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a star. \u201cIt was in one of the gifts she left me for my birthday last year, along with a note. In fact, she left eight of them. One for each kid y\u2019all might have. Four blue ones and four pink ones.\u201d</p><p>I fist the star in my palm and laugh. \u201cEight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI guess she wanted to be covered, just in case. And they were all numbered, so that one goes with this kid.\u201d</p><p>I smile and look down at the star in my hand. \u201cIs it for Lake too? I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s in the mood for this right now.\u201d</p><p>Kel shakes his head. \u201cNope. Just for you. Lake got her own.\u201d He pushes himself up off the floor. He pauses after taking a few steps back toward the waiting room, then he turns around and looks down at me. \u201cMy mom thought of everything, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>I smile, thinking of all the advice I\u2019m still somehow getting from Julia. \u201cShe sure did.\u201d</p><p>Kel smiles and turns away. I open the star; one of many that I incorrectly assumed would be the last.</p><p>Will,</p><p>Thank you for taking on the role of father to my little boy.</p><p>Thank you for loving my daughter as much as I love her.</p><p>But most of all, thank you in advance for being the best father I could ever hope for a grandchild of mine to have. Because I know without a doubt that you will be.</p><p>Congratulations,</p><p>Julia</p><p>I STARE AT the star in my hands, wondering how in the world she could be thanking me when they\u2019re the ones who changed my life. Her whole family changed my life.</p><p>I guess in a way, we all changed each other\u2019s lives.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d Lake yells from inside the room. I quickly stand up and put the star in my pocket. I walk back into the room and over to the bed. Her jaw is clenched tight and she\u2019s gripping the handrail so hard, her knuckles are white. She reaches up with one hand and grabs my shirt, then pulls me to her. \u201cNurse. I need the nurse.\u201d</p><p>I nod and once again rush out of the room. This time to actually find a nurse.</p><p>WHEN THE WORDS \u201cYou\u2019re ready to push\u201d come out of the doctor\u2019s mouth, I grip the rail of Lake\u2019s bed and have to hold myself upright. This is it. This is finally it and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready. In the next few minutes I\u2019m going to be a dad and the thought of it makes my head spin.</p><p>I am not Gavin.</p><p>I will not pass out.</p><p>The seconds turn into nanoseconds as the room fills with more nurses and they\u2019re doing things to the bed and to the equipment and to Lake and to the lights that are really, really, really, bright and then a nurse is standing over me, looking down at me.</p><p>Why is she looking down at me?</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I nod. Why am I looking up at her?</p><p>I\u2019ve either shrunk six feet or I\u2019m on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d Lake\u2019s hand is reaching over the side of the bed for me. I grip the rail and pull myself up. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again,\u201d she breathes heavily. \u201cPlease. I need you to suck it up right now because I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d She\u2019s looking at me with fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d I assure her. She smiles, but then her smile does this twisted thing where it flips upside down and turns into a mangled, demonic groan. My hand is being twisted worse than her voice, though.</p><p>I lean over the rail and wrap my arm around her shoulders, helping her lean forward when the nurse tells her to push. I keep my eyes focused on hers and she keeps her eyes focused on mine. I help her count and I help her breathe and I do my best not to complain about the fact that I\u2019ll never be able to use my hand again. We\u2019re counting to ten for what feels like the thousandth time when the twisted sounds begin coming out of her mouth again. Except this time the noises are followed by another sound.</p><p>Crying.</p><p>I look away from Lake and at the doctor, who is now holding a baby in his hands.</p><p>My baby.</p><p>Everything begins moving in fast motion again, but I\u2019m frozen. I want so bad to pick her up and hold her but I also want to be next to Lake and ensure she\u2019s okay. The nurse takes our baby out of the doctor\u2019s hands and turns around to wrap her in a blanket. I\u2019m craning my neck, trying to look over the nurse\u2019s shoulder at her.</p><p>When the nurse finally has her wrapped up, she turns and walks to Lake, then lays her on her chest. I push the rail down on Lake\u2019s bed and climb in beside her, sliding my arm beneath her shoulders. I pull the blanket away from our baby\u2019s face so we can both see her better.</p><p>I wish I could explain how I feel, but nothing can explain this moment. Not a vase of stars. Not a book. Not a song. Not even a poem. Nothing can explain the moment when the woman you would give your life for sees her daughter for the very first time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears are streaming down her face.
