Whatever it was, she\u2019d gone from being curled up, enjoying a dream about the great tenth birthday party she was going to have at her grandparents\u2019 tavern, the Dragonslayer, to being pulled out of her dream, as if she needed to be awake. And aware.</p><p>There was someone in her room, she thought. Someone with a kind, handsome face staring down at her, eyes filled with great concern.</p> <p>Then the face was gone and she was instantly wide-awake.</p><p>And scared.</p><p>She slipped from her bed and out of the room in the apartment above the Dragonslayer, running to the door in the little hallway that led to her grandparents\u2019 suite. Neither of them was in bed.</p><p>That scared her more. Her grandparents weren\u2019t in their bed.</p><p>She instantly knew she should be quiet. The fear she felt was instinctive, and she tiptoed in bare feet down the curving metal stairs to the ground floor.</p> <p>Halfway there, she stopped. Her heart seemed to squeeze and her whole body froze.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of the tavern, she never had been. It was filled with old ships\u2019 wheels, countless figureheads, paintings, etchings, maps and more. The elegant beauties, dragons and mythical creatures that gazed down at her from the walls were part of her heritage.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t afraid of anything in the Dragonslayer, but...</p><p>Someone was there, someone who shouldn\u2019t be. He was standing at the entry, looking through the cut-glass window on the front door, and it wasn\u2019t her grandpa Gus.</p><p>He was tall, and beneath his tricorn hat, his rich black hair fell down his back in curls. He had a neatly manicured beard and mustache. His black boots were tight on his calves over tan breeches. He wore a crimson overcoat with elegant buttons that matched those on his vest, and a white shirt with lace at the throat and sleeves. He seemed improbably imposing as he stood there\u2014as if nothing could pass by him. She couldn\u2019t see his eyes in the darkness, but she knew their color.</p><p>Just as she knew him.</p> <p>He was the man who\u2019d been standing by the bed, watching over her.</p><p>She\u2019d seen images of him dozens of times. He\u2019d been loved\u2014and hated. He\u2019d sailed the seas on a constant quest for adventure, some said. For his own riches, according to others. He\u2019d never killed a man, although he\u2019d made good on many threats regarding severe thrashings. He\u2019d kidnapped a wealthy man\u2019s daughter and held her for a fortune, but when she was rescued, the girl had wanted to go back to her captor. He never broke his word.</p><p>Of course, despite his sense of honor, he\u2019d been hunted. He had been the pirate, Blue Anderson. He was her umpteen-great-great-uncle.</p><p>Had been.</p><p>He was dead. He had been dead for more than two hundred and fifty years.</p><p>But there he was\u2014standing in the darkness, watching whatever was happening outside the door. Watching with intense interest.</p><p>He looked up at her suddenly, as if he realized she was there.</p><p>He studied her for a moment and then he smiled, inclining his head curiously and nodding.</p> <p>He could tell that she saw him.</p><p>If she\u2019d been able to move, she would have. She would have screamed and gone running back to her room to hide under the bed.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t move. She could hardly breathe, much less scream.</p><p>He smiled again, tipped his tricorn hat, glanced outside one more time and then slowly disappeared.</p><p>As he did, she heard the door open. Her eyes darted to it with fear.</p><p>It was her grandparents coming back into the building. But it had to be about four in the morning, and they didn\u2019t go out at 4:00 a.m. From the stairway window\u2014she hadn\u2019t managed to move yet\u2014she realized there were flashing lights in the parking lot.</p><p>Flashing lights. The kind police cars had.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry. They got him, Brenda, my love,\u201d Gus told her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cYes, but... Oh, Gus! That horrible man might have gotten in.\u201d Her grandmother sounded worried. She was such a wonderful grandmother\u2014different from most, perhaps; she wasn\u2019t much of a cookie baker. But she came to all of Abby\u2019s school events. She loved to dress up, she read stories and acted out all the characters. She was slim and energetic, too; she loved a long bike ride.</p><p>\u201cHey, so what? He would\u2019ve stolen what little cash we have in the register. But he didn\u2019t get in. We woke up, we called the police, all is good,\u201d Gus said. He looked up then\u2014just as Blue had done, but of course, she couldn\u2019t really have seen Blue. That would\u2019ve been seeing a...</p><p>A ghost.</p><p>\u201cHey, munchkin, what are you doing up?\u201d Gus called to her.</p><p>She willed her frozen lungs to function. \u201cI woke up,\u201d she said. Her voice sounded funny, and she forced herself to move. \u201cI\u2014I just woke up. And I couldn\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, now, Abby. Everything\u2019s okay. You can go back to sleep,\u201d Gus told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Her grandmother turned to her grandfather, and Gus answered. \u201cA thief trying to break in, baby. But the police got him. We\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to bed, child!\u201d her grandmother said. She smiled to lighten the sternness of her words. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Or early. Whichever. Time for young\u2019uns to be asleep! What would your parents say about the way we keep you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad wouldn\u2019t mind. Mom always says you\u2019re the best. She said that if you and Gus weren\u2019t so wonderful, she\u2019d never be able to travel with Dad as much as she does. Not many kids are so lucky. I get to stay with you.\u201d Her father worked for a major tech company and traveled frequently. She had a room at the tavern with almost as much stuff in it as her room in the house on Chippewa Square.</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may!\u201d her grandmother began. \u201cI want you back in your bed. It\u2019s a school night.\u201d</p><p>Abby gave her grandfather a wide-eyed look. He was an easier mark than her grandmother. She couldn\u2019t possibly go back to bed\u2014alone. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cCome on down. We\u2019ll have a cup of tea, and then we\u2019ll go back to bed. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She managed to nod. And to come running the rest of the way down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAbigail Anderson!\u201d Brenda said sternly. \u201cI told you not to run around barefoot! Glasses do break, my darling, and even when we clean up, you can\u2019t be sure we get all the little slivers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her be right now, Brenda,\u201d Gus suggested.</p><p>Brenda wagged a finger at her. \u201cTonight. Just tonight. You follow the tavern rules\u2014my rules, young lady\u2014or you don\u2019t stay here anymore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Brenda spun on Gus. \u201cAnd you! Don\u2019t go putting a shot of whiskey in her tea to calm her down, do you hear me? She\u2019s barely ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Brenda, it\u2019s what our parents did for us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nowadays, it\u2019s considered child abuse. You two behave. I\u2019m going back up.\u201d</p><p>She caught Abby\u2019s chin and gave her a kiss on the cheek before she went up the winding staircase.</p><p>Gus winked at Abby. \u201cCome into the kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll brew some tea.\u201d</p><p>In the tavern\u2019s large, modernized kitchen, she sat on a stool and watched Gus place the kettle on a burner and bring out the makings for tea. There was a bottle of whiskey on one of the top shelves. He hesitated, and then shrugged. \u201cOne little nip. Cured me of colds, stubbed toes and a broken heart, and I had a wonderful mother, God bless her!\u201d He crossed himself and looked upward. \u201cNow, think you\u2019ll be able to sleep after this?\u201d</p><p>She nodded enthusiastically. A few minutes later, he\u2019d made tea\u2014with a \u201cnip\u201d of whiskey in it for the two of them. He brought the cups out front and they sat together beneath the figureheads and other artifacts. She cherished these occasions with him; there weren\u2019t many.</p><p>\u201cSo, why are you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t there,\u201d she said.</p><p>He ruffled her hair. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gone. I\u2019d die before I\u2019d leave you, munchkin, you know that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again and sipped her tea. It was sweet and good with a lot of milk and sugar. Whatever else was in it, she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, Gus, of course!\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t know why she called him Gus, since she called her grandmother Nana.</p><p>He sighed and turned to her and stroked her face. \u201cA bad man was trying to break in. But we heard him...saw him. Called the police, they came right away and now all is well.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. She couldn\u2019t get rid of the image of the dead pirate watching her grandparents through the door. Watching her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gus persisted.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know someone was trying to break in, Gus?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He looked away from her quickly. \u201cAh, just heard him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus...\u201d</p><p>He studied her, as if trying to read her mind. She was afraid to speak, afraid to say she\u2019d seen a ghost. She was almost ten, and she didn\u2019t want him thinking she was a scaredy-cat baby. Or worse\u2014having mental problems. Benny Adkins had acted weird at school, and they\u2019d taken him out and sent him to some kind of special home for children.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to speak. Gus sipped his tea thoughtfully. Eventually he said, \u201cYou saw old Blue, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her heart thumped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I was about your age when I saw him for the first time,\u201d Gus said. \u201cWhere was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Something about the somber tenderness in her grandfather\u2019s eyes made her believe it was going to be all right. She could admit to him what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I think he was over my bed. I think...maybe he... I think he was making sure I was all right. But I was scared and I jumped out of bed and I came running down the stairs. I saw him standing there...at the entry.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh or tell her she was crazy or seeing things. He nodded gravely and smiled at her. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of Blue. He\u2019s kind of like a guardian angel for us. Some of us see him\u2014some of us in the family\u2014but the rest of the world? I don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t see him often. I figure we\u2019re very lucky, but also that others wouldn\u2019t understand. So let\u2019s keep it a secret, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid he wake you up, Gus? Is that how you knew the tavern was in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe woke me up. Yes. I hadn\u2019t seen him in years and years. Hey, this is between us. Drink that tea now so you can get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbby,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t tell people that you see Blue. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re some kind of fake or crazy, one or the other. And seeing Blue is...well, it\u2019s special. So, just know that if he\u2019s around, he\u2019s looking after you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t speak about it unless we\u2019re alone, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She drank her tea and they went back to bed. She was surprised she fell asleep easily and that she wasn\u2019t afraid.</p> <p>But she wasn\u2019t. The way her grandfather had explained it...Blue was looking after her.</p><p>The next day, although her family tried to keep the facts from her, Abby learned that the man who was trying to get in had broken into a tavern in Charleston a few nights before\u2014and killed the owner. Thanks to her grandparents calling the police so quickly and quietly, they\u2019d never have to find out what their fate might have been had he gotten in. And thanks to them, he\u2019d been apprehended.</p><p>Thanks to Blue, she thought.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t see the pirate in the tavern again, and as the years went by, she convinced herself that she\u2019d seen him standing there because she knew so much about him, because actors portrayed Blue all the time, and because she\u2019d been so frightened.</p><p>Once, when she was thirteen, she talked to Gus about it. \u201cI never saw him after that night,\u201d she said.</p><p>And Gus had smiled and put an arm around her shoulders. \u201cHe comes when we need him, Abby. He comes when we need him. He made an appearance during the American Revolution when a family member needed to escape after spying on the British. And he came during the Civil War...and he came again when an Anderson was hiding from a fed during prohibition,\u201d Gus admitted dryly. \u201cBlue watches, you know. And he finds the one who sees him, and...well, he\u2019s not on call. God save us all from ghost hunters. I won\u2019t let them in here. Blue isn\u2019t a s\u00e9ance away. Like I said, he comes when he\u2019s needed.\u201d</p> <p>She saw him the night her mother died of pneumonia, and again two years later when her father died, his heart having given out. Blue stood in the cemetery and watched solemnly as they were buried, and Abby felt his touch on her hair as she sobbed each time.</p><p>She thought she saw him at her bedside, occasionally, just watching over her.</p><p>But life was busy. Years passed, and her memory of Blue faded and settled back into history, exactly where it belonged.</p><p>1</p><p>\u201cMr. Gordon, how were you able to find Joshua Madsen when the police were completely baffled as to where Bradford Stiles was keeping the child?\u201d</p><p>That was the first question shouted, but there were dozens of reporters in front of the Richmond police station where Malachi Gordon had just finished the interviews and paperwork that completed the Stiles case as far as he was concerned. They were like a flock of ring-billed seagulls with their microphones.</p><p>Should\u2019ve had someone sneak me out the back, he thought.</p><p>He raised a hand. \u201cPlease. It\u2019s been a long day and night for everyone involved.\u201d</p> <p>At his side, Detective Andrew Collins supported his efforts to escape. \u201cEveryone who worked this case is drained. There\u2019ll be a police spokesperson out shortly. Let Mr. Gordon pass!\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t stop the barrage of questions or change the fact that Malachi felt as if he was being attacked by a flock of birds as he and Andy Collins made their way to the street and his SUV.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Andy muttered. \u201cShould have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, should\u2019ve gotten me out through the back. Or maybe I could\u2019ve called for a \u2018Beam me up, Scotty!\u2019\u201d Malachi said. \u201cNot to worry\u2014my mistake. I guess we\u2019re all worn out.\u201d</p><p>They reached the car, which was behind a police fence so the reporters couldn\u2019t follow them that far. As Malachi slid into the driver\u2019s seat, Andy asked, \u201cHow the hell did you find that cabin in the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure luck, I think. We\u2019d all fanned out. I just got to it first. It\u2019s my neck of the woods, so I pretty much knew where it couldn\u2019t be,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cWell, another few hours and... That boy owes you his life.\u201d</p><p>Malachi shook his head. \u201cEveryone worked on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his mom came to you\u2014and the case broke once you were on it,\u201d Andy said. \u201cYou know, if you admitted you were a psychic, no one would think less of you. I mean, yeah, some of those guys can be jerks, and they like to tease you about your voodoo powers and all that, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t admit I\u2019m a psychic, Andy, because I\u2019m not,\u201d Malachi told him. \u201cI\u2019m going to go home and get some sleep. You need to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. Thanks, Malachi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Malachi said. He hesitated. On a case like this, cops could be hard-asses. Big tough guys, they still felt fear. Not fear of a junkie or a drug dealer or even a brutal killer, but fear of what they didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t understand. After he\u2019d left the force in New Orleans, he\u2019d preferred to work on his own for that very reason. As a P.I., he didn\u2019t mind working with them; he just didn\u2019t want to be one of them. That way when the ribbing got bad, he could always walk out.</p><p>Some cops, though, like Andy, were all right. They didn\u2019t understand. Maybe they were even a little afraid. But they were willing to accept any help they could get, and they weren\u2019t afraid to be grateful for it.</p><p>\u201cAndy,\u201d he said, \u201cthanks to you and your lieutenant for letting me in on this, and for listening to me. The kid owes you his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah!\u201d Andy said.</p><p>Grinning, Malachi waved to him and revved the car into gear, leaving the parking lot. He headed out of the city then, anxious to get away. He\u2019d never expected the publicity that would come with this case. He\u2019d taken it on because Joshua Madsen\u2019s mother, Cindy, had come to him. She had broken his heart. Joshua had been abducted during the two-block walk from his school bus to his home yesterday afternoon. A neighbor had seen a nondescript white van pull away, and when that news came out, police had immediately suspected Stiles, the Puppy Killer, as he\u2019d been called.</p><p>Stiles didn\u2019t kill puppies; he used puppies to lure young people to his van. They\u2019d rescued a litter of golden retriever pups and their mom when they\u2019d found Stiles and Joshua Madsen.</p><p>Malachi didn\u2019t consider himself particularly brilliant in finding Stiles. The police investigative work had been excellent. They\u2019d narrowed down the white vans in the city, thanks to the keen eye of the neighbor who\u2019d managed to give them a partial on the license plate. Soil found on one of the victims had placed him in a certain area.</p><p>Malachi had known the area.</p><p>And he lived not twenty miles away in a home that was over two-and-a-half centuries old and came complete with pocket doors so that it could serve as a tavern, way station, home and hideout when need be. And it also came with Zachary Albright, Revolutionary spy and resident ghost.</p><p>No need to try explaining that to Andy, even if they were friends, or any of the other cops. Because, frankly, Zachary didn\u2019t have all the answers; being dead didn\u2019t make him omniscient. Just like he\u2019d been in life, Zachary was a passionate man with a strong sense of right and wrong. He wandered the grounds, and he\u2019d been the one to note the reclusive hunting lodge near the river. He\u2019d suggested it to Malachi, and Malachi had remembered it\u2014yes, the perfect place to bring a victim. Cries couldn\u2019t be heard and the sure-flowing water was always ready to wash away an abundance of evidence.</p><p>It occurred to him that he really shouldn\u2019t be thanked; he\u2019d been observing the comings and goings on the trail when he was spotted by Stiles. He\u2019d been forced to kill Stiles or be killed himself. The trail had led to a run-down shack but there\u2019d been no sign of the missing boy. Police had searched the woods. Because of the \u201chideaway\u201d in his own home\u2014floorboards that lifted to reveal a six-by-six hidden room below\u2014he\u2019d begun to tear apart the shack. And he\u2019d found Joshua Madsen, bound hand and foot, dehydrated, unconscious...but still alive.</p><p>Kids were resilient, he told himself. And this time, Stiles hadn\u2019t had a chance to abuse the boy. They got him to the hospital and he\u2019d been returned to the loving arms of his family. He\u2019d make it, Malachi believed, without carrying the kind of abuse that might have made him an abuser himself.</p><p>Malachi wished he could say that about all kids who were abducted.</p><p>It was late, past midnight, and once he took the ramp off I-64, the country road that would take him home was dark. He turned down the air-conditioning in his car. Summer was quickly changing into fall.</p><p>He pulled into his drive and entered the old house he\u2019d inherited from his uncle, an academic who\u2019d never married, thus leaving him the place in his will. Malachi had spent time with him there from when he was a kid. He\u2019d loved it, and his parents had owned a home just minutes away in a suburb of Richmond. He usually kept the pocket doors open. While the original structure had been maintained, it was also a home. It had always been a home, even when the original inhabitants had opened it as a tavern because of the economy. Yep, things didn\u2019t really change. Back in the 1700s, sometimes the only way to survive had been to serve up good old country fare and lots of locally brewed ale and use the home itself as income.</p><p>Malachi picked up his mail and dropped his keys on the side table as he walked in. He was immediately accosted by Zachary. Once, Malachi had been unnerved by the ghost. Now he was accustomed to Zachary, clad in the black frock coat and silk vest in which he\u2019d been buried out back in the family cemetery.</p><p>\u201cYou found him?\u201d Zachary asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cWe did. Thank you. If you hadn\u2019t mentioned that place\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve thought of it. Eventually.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd the kid might have been dead by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour jacket!\u201d Zachary said. He touched Malachi\u2019s arm. Malachi felt the movement of air around him, nothing else.</p><p>\u201cThe killer fired at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood God, man, he was close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo close. I shot back. He\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite fine!\u201d</p><p>Malachi shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to kill him. We hadn\u2019t found the boy yet. But I assumed someone built the shack on the lines of old places like this, and I was right. Joshua Madsen was in the hideaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you saved him. Are you injured?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly my pride. I didn\u2019t think Stiles had seen me. I was trying to watch the place and get closer, and I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d come out back. Not until the bullet grazed my shoulder. I liked this jacket\u2014not as much as uninjured flesh, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, all ended well,\u201d Zachary broke in, pleased. \u201cI\u2019m out to tell Genevieve!\u201d</p><p>The ghost turned and left him, moving through what was now the kitchen and outside, dissolving through the walls. He was heading to the small family cemetery in back, Malachi knew. Zachary\u2019s wife and children were there\u2014the three who\u2019d died as infants and the three who\u2019d survived childhood diseases to adulthood. Many of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren were there, too. Malachi had asked him once why he stayed around when he missed his Genevieve so much. Zachary had told him, \u201cI believe I will know when it\u2019s time for me to follow my love.\u201d</p><p>Malachi never reminded him that he hadn\u2019t known when it was time to hide from the British during the Revolution. Zachary had been caught spying. They\u2019d intended to hang him but he\u2019d escaped and yet, in escaping, he\u2019d been mortally wounded and had died in the arms of his Genevieve, right in the house, in front of the large stone hearth.</p><p>Then again, Malachi mused, he hadn\u2019t been that bright himself. Stiles had almost caught him in the chest with a .45.</p><p>He walked into the kitchen to pour himself a shot of his favorite single-malt Scotch. As he did so, there was a tap at his door. He immediately stiffened.</p> <p>Aw, come on! His address wasn\u2019t public. The damned reporters hadn\u2019t found him out here, had they?</p><p>He decided to ignore the summons and remained unwaveringly focused on his shot of Scotch.</p><p>His phone rang. He glanced at his caller ID as he passed it. The number was unavailable, so he didn\u2019t answer. The ringing stopped.</p><p>The pounding at the door began again.</p><p>Swearing, he strode over to it. He lifted the little cover on the peephole and looked out. He was ready to swing the door open, oh-so-ready to berate whoever was knocking at this time of night.</p><p>He stopped, surprised by the sight of three somber and distinguished-looking men in suits. One was elderly\u2014possibly around eighty or so. The other two were tall and appeared to have Native American blood in their backgrounds, though mixed with some kind of Northern European ancestry.</p><p>The elderly man held a cell phone. He hit the keys.</p><p>Malachi\u2019s cell began ringing again.</p> <p>Seriously, what the hell? These guys had his number and they knew where to find him.</p><p>He opened the door and scowled at the three of them.</p><p>\u201cMr. Gordon, we\u2019re sorry to disturb you, but we\u2019ve been trying to reach you,\u201d the elderly gentleman said. He held up his cell phone with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a little busy,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cAnd it is\u2014\u201d he looked at his watch \u201c\u2014almost 3:00 a.m. Who are you? I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I\u2019ve had a long day and a longer night. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour unusual talent, Mr. Gordon,\u201d the elderly man said, offering his hand. \u201cMy name is Adam Harrison. These are agents Jackson Crow and Logan Raintree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, great, nice to meet you. What unusual talent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind explained by your roommate,\u201d one of the other men said. Raintree, Malachi thought.</p><p>\u201cMy roommate?\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>Raintree indicated someone who stood behind Malachi.</p><p>Malachi turned. Zachary was back in the house, watching him\u2014and the newcomers\u2014with obvious amusement.</p><p>\u201cI believe these gentlemen see me, Malachi,\u201d Zachary said.</p><p>\u201cYes, we see you,\u201d the man introduced as Crow acknowledged. \u201cMay we come in, please? You had a long and fruitful day, and we\u2019re pretty sure you don\u2019t intend to stop when it comes to protecting the innocent who are in imminent danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe we can make you an offer you can\u2019t refuse,\u201d Adam Harrison said.</p><p>Harrison. Malachi thought he knew the name. Harrison had been around a long time; he was known for solving some horrible crimes, some cases that...</p><p>Were unusual.</p><p>That had some kind of...</p><p>Ghosts.</p><p>He opened the door. \u201cOkay, come on in, but I was about to have a Scotch. You can join me or not. I\u2019ll listen to you\u2014but that\u2019s it. I\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>Harrison walked in, followed by the other two. Malachi closed the door behind them.</p><p>They saw Zachary.</p><p>He asked them to go ahead and sit down in the old parlor by the huge stone hearth. Back in the kitchen, he scooped ice into glasses and poured Scotch.</p><p>He paused, then added a second shot to his own.</p><p>He had a feeling his life was about to change.</p><p>\u201cOne day I\u2019ll fall, but I will fall to the law on the high seas, and not to the likes of you, Scurvy Pete! I will go with my ship\u2014and not with the dregs of the sea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the death, Blue Anderson! To the death!\u201d</p><p>The two young fencers/actors played out the battle between Blue Anderson and Scurvy Pete Martin with passion and panache on a raised all-weather stage at the far side of the Dragonslayer parking lot. They were decked out in full pirate gear, colorful flared and embellished jackets swirling around them as they accomplished each choreographed step.</p><p>The wench they fought over\u2014a British admiral\u2019s daughter named Missy Tweed\u2014cowered in a corner while they fought. She was customarily played by a pretty young blonde from the local arts academy. Eyewitness accounts of the encounter in the river between the two pirates described Blue as a hero, even if he\u2019d been a pirate. But Blue was known for being a staunch Englishman above all else; he didn\u2019t mind sacking a non-British ship of her treasure, and he only went to battle against enemies of the Crown. Blue swore he\u2019d never be caught, nor would he abandon his crew. He never was caught; he sailed away one summer when storms were rampant and wasn\u2019t seen again.</p><p>The tourist performance\u2014and come-on for the restaurant\u2014ended with the death of Scurvy Pete, and Blue\u2019s announcement, \u201cThe lady may bring riches, but she\u2019ll not be disrespected whilst in my, er, care!\u201d Abigail applauded with the others. She knew the two young actors playing the parts. Blue was played by Roger English, an old friend; they\u2019d graduated from high school together. Without his long dark braided wig and beard, he had sandy-blond hair and deep brown, expressive eyes. Roger, who was an avid fan of Savannah\u2019s history, also ran one of the best ghost tours in the city.</p><p>She smiled, thinking about old times. Even as a kid, he\u2019d loved to tell scary stories, some from history and some he\u2019d made up. It had all paid off for him in the end.</p><p>Scurvy Pete was played by Paul Westermark, who\u2019d gradated in the class before them. Paul sometimes worked for Roger, but he was also an accomplished vocalist and guitarist and spent many nights playing local venues.</p><p>While their audience, collected from passersby on the street and those who knew that the two pirates performed on Saturdays, grouped around to congratulate them on their performance or ask \u201cpirate\u201d questions, Abby hurried around to the front to reach the restaurant.</p><p>She was anxious.</p><p>Come home. I need you.</p><p>That cryptic summons had come from Gus Anderson, her grandfather, and had brought Abigail Anderson driving down from Virginia. He hadn\u2019t wanted to talk to her about \u201cthe situation\u201d on the phone; he needed to see her in person. She feared the worst. Gus was in his early nineties and even if he was in excellent shape for his age, he was certainly no spring chicken. And while she would\u2019ve dropped anything in the world to come home if he was in trouble, she couldn\u2019t help but marvel at his timing. She\u2019d finished at the academy, and she was now waiting for her actual assignment. That made it a perfect time for her to drive home.</p><p>Gus\u2019s restaurant, the Dragonslayer tavern, sat right on the river, just as it had since 1758. Abby had arrived in time to see the end of one of the three performances given every Saturday, this one done as the tavern closed after lunch to prepare for the dinner crowd. Whether the show brought diners to the restaurant or not, Gus didn\u2019t really care. As a youth, he\u2019d played his great-great\u2014however many greats\u2014uncle in the shows; now, he simply loved his restaurant. They weren\u2019t the only \u201cpirate\u201d restaurant in town, and they weren\u2019t the most famous. But they were, as far as preservation went, filled with integrity. Diners could get great stories from Gus if they were intrigued by the old-time lure of the establishment.</p><p>Approaching the restaurant was part of the charm to Abby, and part of the allure of coming home. Driving the streets with their majestic moss-covered and stately oaks, she always felt a little thrill when she saw the Dragonslayer appear before her. She\u2019d grown up in Savannah, and had often stayed at the Dragonslayer. It wasn\u2019t that her family didn\u2019t have a house, and a lovely house at that, on a nearby square, almost as historic as the restaurant itself. But, as a child, she\u2019d spent days and nights with her grandparents, who\u2019d maintained their apartment right above the tavern where famous men had come for two and a half centuries. She\u2019d been regaled with tales of the pirate days, when her ancestor had built the pub and where his brother\u2014the infamous Blue Anderson\u2014had been known to slip in and shanghai many a ne\u2019er-do-well.</p><p>The Dragonslayer never changed. It was lovingly maintained, but it never changed. Its edifice appeared much as it had in the 1750s. There were probably far more adult trees surrounding it now, with their mystical sweep of dripping moss, but other than that, she could well imagine stepping back in time. Of course, that would mean slop pots, pigs, chickens and other animals crowding what was now the parking lot, and a horrendous smell in the midst of a summer like this. But still, there was a touch of magic about a place imbued with history. Gus called it living history\u2014each new generation being a part of the past and creating more history. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hurried toward the building, anxious to see her grandfather, dreading whatever problem he might have that had brought him to say, \u201cI need you.\u201d A problem he didn\u2019t want to discuss on the phone.</p><p>A covered porch with old wooden benches for diners awaiting their tables had been part of the original building. Now steps and a ramp led up to the porch. Near the old double doors to the entry Gus kept the typical wire bin that offered promo materials, maps of the historic section and a free local community paper. The community paper was on the top tier of the bin; Gus\u2019s clientele were locals as often as they were visitors. Even distracted as she was, she noticed the blazing headline in the paper.</p><p>Second Body Found; Police Seek Any Information!</p> <p>She picked up the paper, surprised that she hadn\u2019t seen anything on the news regarding a murder in Savannah. She glanced over the article as she reached for the old iron ring that opened the door.</p><p>She learned that tourists leaving an Irish bar around the bend on the river had found the first victim, a young woman. This morning, the second victim, a businessman from Iowa, had come ashore down by one of the coffeehouses. The reporter asked: \u201cIs a River Rat killing in the city?\u201d Abby flinched; she had a feeling the moniker would stick.</p><p>Were these deaths related?</p><p>The victimology was different\u2014one woman, one man. But both had been tourists or visitors, which meant they didn\u2019t know the city.</p><p>Since she\u2019d just come from her FBI classes, it was hard not to speculate on the situation. But while part of her mind wondered if it was the kind of case she might be called in on if the local police invited the feds to take part, she was still too worried about Gus to give the horrible matter her full attention. She folded the paper and slipped it into the large canvas carryall she had over her shoulder. Gus first, paper later.</p> <p>Pulling off her sunglasses, she stepped through the door. Lights were ablaze inside, but they didn\u2019t compare with the sun burning outside in the late-summer heat of Savannah.</p><p>\u201cAbby!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d barely stepped in when she heard Macy Sterling, Gus\u2019s day manager, call her name. Macy came from behind the reservation desk to throw both arms around her in an enthusiastic hug. \u201cHey, Gus said you were coming today! He\u2019s been talking about nothing else all morning. I\u2019m so glad! Seems like forever since you\u2019ve been here!\u201d</p><p>Macy was an attractive woman in her early forties with bright green eyes and sable hair swept up in a chignon. She\u2019d worked for Gus since her mid-twenties and she was a family friend as well as employee. Like all employees here, she was dressed up in Dragonslayer traditional costume, that being pirate mode. Macy made a beautiful wench. She had a lovely figure and did her white cotton blouse, black leggings, boots and red vest proud.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to be here,\u201d Abby told her. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t been that long. Only about six months. I did my basic training, twenty weeks, and then I graduated. And after that, I was assigned to more behavioral classes and desk duty. Fortunately, I was in a sort of holding pattern so I could come home now. They\u2019re working on permanent assignments for everyone in my class and my current supervisor told me I could take a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, last time you were here, it was just for a day, and Gus hoarded you selfishly. I hope you have more time this trip. We miss you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Abby said. \u201cAnd I miss you all when I\u2019m gone. And this place, for sure!\u201d She took a minute to appreciate the bar; it had been there from the beginning and had actually been constructed from the planks of an old ship. Now, of course, it was lovingly tended with wood polish.</p><p>The walls were adorned with antique figureheads and pirate flags. An old ship\u2019s wheel separated the entry from the bar area to the left\u2014as well as the steps to the second floor\u2014and the restaurant rooms to the right. The old secondary stairs, cut out of stone, were seldom used now. They led down to the basement and the \u201csecret\u201d passage to the river and were guarded by rails and a life-size robotic mannequin of a 1700s pirate, namely Blue Anderson.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Macy dropped a kiss on her cheek. \u201cI should\u2019ve said congratulations! You passed! I was so sorry we couldn\u2019t attend the ceremony. Our little girl is really all grown up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s hope so, since I\u2019m twenty-six,\u201d Abby said, smiling. \u201cI mean, if any of us ever really grows up completely.\u201d</p><p>Macy studied her as proudly as a parent. \u201cTell me more. How are you? How\u2019s living there? Who are you dating? Do people still date? How\u2019s the great state of Virginia?\u201d Macy fired questions at her.</p><p>Abby laughed. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I rent a little house in a rural district not far from work\u2014it\u2019s historic. The \u2018history\u2019 thing must\u2019ve gotten into my blood. I love living there. Yes, I believe people still date, but not me. I\u2019ve been too busy. And Virginia is as hot as Savannah,\u201d she said, trying to answer Macy\u2019s questions in order.</p><p>Macy held her at arm\u2019s length, studying her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your hair? You didn\u2019t chop off your hair, did you? One day, you mark my words, you\u2019ll get old and you\u2019ll have to dye it, so you need to have lots of that glorious color while you can!\u201d Macy said.</p> <p>Yes, it was good to be home.</p><p>\u201cMy hair\u2019s all here, Macy,\u201d she said. \u201cJust swept up because it\u2019s hot as hell on my neck,\u201d she said. She\u2019d heard that her hair color came down to her from Gus and his family; apparently Blue Anderson, the pirate brother, had enjoyed the same coloring. But whether his moniker had come from the blue-black hair color that appeared in the Anderson clan every so often or the brilliant color of his eyes, no one really knew. Or because he had a reputation for the \u201cblack and blue\u201d he could inflict on those who defied his orders...</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll catch up some more later,\u201d she said, then asked, \u201cbut where\u2019s Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure. He was up in the office. You want to wait for him there? Oh, are you hungry? Shall I have the cooks whip something up? You drove five-hundred-plus miles, and you are the heir to a wonderful restaurant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve eaten, thanks. I stopped at the North-South Carolina border,\u201d Abby told her. \u201cI\u2019m going to run up to the office, okay? If he\u2019s not there, I\u2019ll wait for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet!\u201d Macy gave her another fierce hug. She returned it.</p><p>She turned to hurry up the stairs but before she could do so, she was hailed from the bar.</p><p>\u201cAbby! Why, Abby\u2019s here, just as old Gus said!\u201d</p><p>Abby knew the voice well.</p><p>\u201cBootsie!\u201d she said, turning back to greet the man sitting at the end of the bar with two other familiar faces. Together the three looked every bit the rakish pirate crew. Young compared to her grandfather, Bootsie was still close to seventy\u2014and yet seemed ageless. He had a thick hard-muscled chest and arms like a linebacker. He\u2019d been a fixture on his bar stool as long as she could remember, and if any man had ever resembled an old pirate, it was Bootsie. His real name was Bob Lanigan; he\u2019d been in the marines, followed by the merchant marines, and then he\u2019d captained one of the ships that ran along the river. He\u2019d had a sweet, long-suffering wife who\u2019d indulged his whims and waited patiently at home for whenever he chose to return, but Betty had died about a year ago and Bootsie now spent much of his time on the bar stool. He had a thick thatch of long white hair, a white beard\u2014and a peg leg. He\u2019d lost his left leg from the knee down when he was in the service, and he didn\u2019t \u201ccotton to\u201d any of the new technology. While he owned a number of new, very real-looking prosthetics, his peg leg was just fine for him. Abby only remembered seeing him without it once or twice.</p><p>If he wore an eye patch, he\u2019d be perfect for the role of pirate, but thankfully, Bootsie still had both eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, lass! Beautiful! Didn\u2019t I tell you she\u2019d grow up beautiful?\u201d he asked Dirk Johansen, one of his companions at the bar. Dirk was the \u201cwhippersnapper\u201d of Bootsie\u2019s group of cronies. He was in his late forties and still sailing. A lean, fit man, he often resembled a staff member at the Dragonslayer, since he typically came in straight off one of his \u201cpirate cruises\u201d on the Black Swan. He was handsome and distinguished, an eternal bachelor, or so it seemed. Abby was pretty sure that Macy had maintained a secret crush on him for years. They would have made a handsome couple.</p><p>Dirk smiled at her as he replied to the statement. \u201cBootsie, she\u2019s been a beautiful young woman for quite a while now. Abby, welcome home. It\u2019s always wonderful to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers!\u201d said the third member of their group, Aldous Brentwood. Aldous was several times a millionaire from his own\u2014and his family\u2019s\u2014maritime efforts. He was in his mid-fifties, but hard work had kept him toned. He shaved his head bald, had bright blue eyes and wore a single gold earring in his left lobe. Like Bootsie, he could easily pass for a pirate, or, Abby thought, the character for the Mr. Clean line of household products.</p><p>\u201cBootsie, Dirk, Aldous,\u201d Abby said, giving each a quick hug and kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cGus misses you terribly when you\u2019re away,\u201d Dirk said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he grins for a week when you\u2019re coming back!\u201d Aldous told her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here now. I figured I\u2019d find him on a bar stool with you gentlemen. So where\u2019s my favorite old grouch? I was on my way up to see if he\u2019s in the office,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe might be up there. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Bootsie shrugged. \u201cHe let me in when the kitchen staff started arriving at ten. We sat and talked for a while and he did keep looking at his watch, telling me about where you\u2019d be on your drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him right at opening,\u201d Dirk offered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did, too, but I didn\u2019t see him after that,\u201d Aldous said.</p><p>Sullivan, the lunchtime bartender, a handsome thirty-year-old with green eyes and flaming red hair, plus a neatly coiffed mustache and beard, came by to check on his \u201cbarflies\u201d as the three referred to themselves. He smiled at Abby; she didn\u2019t know him well. He\u2019d only worked for her grandfather about four years and she\u2019d been gone most of that time. His given name was Jerry, but he went by Sullivan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbby, he said something earlier about working on the books, so you\u2019re probably right. He\u2019s got to be up in his office. I haven\u2019t seen him since before the lunch crowd started coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sullivan,\u201d Abby said. \u201cAnd, gentlemen, see you later,\u201d she told the three older men seated at the bar.</p><p>They responded with an out-of-sync chorus of \u201cAye, Abby,\u201d \u201cSee you, Abby,\u201d \u201cGlad you\u2019re here!\u201d</p> <p>She smiled and walked over to the winding iron stairway that had been there forever and was watchfully maintained, since it was still used on a daily basis.</p><p>The second floor of the establishment had a low ceiling. No food was stored on the upper level, but a long room housed wine, spirits, kitchen utensils and other restaurant supplies. The second floor also had a nice lounge for the employees with lockers and closets full of costumes so no one had to come as a pirate or wench and leave as a pirate or wench. On one side of Gus\u2019s office was the apartment he\u2019d lived in with her grandmother until Brenda Anderson\u2019s death eight years ago. Now he remained there alone. It had a little sitting room and access to a balcony that looked over the rear grounds and out to the river. Beside the sitting room were the two bedrooms, the one Abby had always slept in and the one her grandfather now maintained for himself. On the other side of Gus\u2019s office was the manager\u2019s office, shared by Macy and Grant Green, the night manager.</p><p>Gus wasn\u2019t in his office nor was he in the manager\u2019s office. She tried his apartment door. It was open, but Gus was nowhere to be seen. The room was sparse and spotless. The only pictures on the walls here were images of his family.</p><p>Abby called his name as she hurried through the apartment, and then went out to check the supply room, as well. She walked past carefully stored rows of different liquors and the wine vault. There were boxes marked Dragonslayer plates, salad bowls and glasses, tablecloths and more, but none of the employees were up there now.</p><p>\u201cGus!\u201d Abby called again, but all she heard in return was the distant sound of the \u201cpirate\u201d track that played during lunch hours.</p> <p>Frustrated, she went into the lounge, but she seemed to be the only person on the second floor. Abby walked back to Gus\u2019s office and sat at his desk. Despite his age, Gus had entered the age of technology with gusto; he had a new computer, a printer and, to the side, a file cabinet. There was a little office carrier filled with incoming and outgoing mail. She looked anxiously at the incoming mail, hoping she wouldn\u2019t find a stack of doctors\u2019 bills. She didn\u2019t\u2014most of the mail was solicitation letters. She knew he read most of it, always looking to see if there was something the restaurant could use.</p><p>\u201cNo important mail from doctors or diagnostic clinics,\u201d she murmured aloud.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think it was anything to do with his health that had made him summon her in such a manner, and yet couldn\u2019t help being concerned. And curious. Gus had an impressive history. He\u2019d served in the navy during World War II, then he\u2019d returned to Savannah\u2014where he was guaranteed to make a living since his family owned the restaurant\u2014to join the police force. But when his father passed away, he\u2019d left the force to concentrate on the Dragonslayer. She\u2019d admired him all her life. It was thanks to Gus that she\u2019d gone to the FBI academy; he\u2019d encouraged her in every action she\u2019d ever wanted to take. He hadn\u2019t pushed her toward law enforcement, but he\u2019d told her she was smart and could do anything she wanted to do.</p><p>There was nothing on his desk giving her any indication that something might be wrong with Gus.</p><p>Had he run out to do an errand? She drummed her fingers on the desk and then took the newspaper from her handbag to study the article on the murders.</p><p>Both victims had drowned. Both had been found with their hands tied behind their backs. Police were withholding other information, as it was an ongoing investigation. Next of kin had been notified, and anyone with any information regarding either victim was urged to contact law enforcement.</p> <p>She set the paper down, then started, certain she\u2019d heard a sound coming from the storage area\u2014but she\u2019d just been there. At the rear of the storage area was a wrought-iron stairway from the back of the dining area to the second floor. It was far narrower than the main staircase and it was gated. Diners were prohibited from taking those stairs, as was the staff, she reminded herself. Gus didn\u2019t consider them safe. At one time, they\u2019d allowed pirates who were drinking, wenching and enjoying their liberty in Savannah to escape quickly from the upstairs to the underground passage that led to the river and their ships. While Robert Anderson\u2014brother of Blue, and Abby\u2019s direct ancestor\u2014had been a legitimate businessman, he and his pirate brother were known to be close and Blue Anderson was known to have frequented the tavern. British officers were prone to burst in on the Dragonslayer in search of Blue, and thus the easy escape route.</p><p>Thanks to the secret passage, they\u2019d never caught Blue\u2014or any of his men\u2014at the tavern.</p><p>The door to the passage was covered with a grating now. Before, it had been hidden under wooden planks that matched the rest of the floor. Now it was a curiosity and guarded by chains, a locked metal grate and the robotic Blue Anderson. Blue was set up beside the grate, and diners loved to have their pictures taken with him.</p><p>Abby stood up, then walked down the hall to the storage room. The lights remained on as they always did during business hours. She moved silently along the rows of modern chrome restaurant equipment and boxes to the back of the room.</p><p>Halfway there, she paused.</p><p>Her heart seemed to rise to her throat and catch there.</p><p>Blue! She could see him. He was standing right by the winding iron stairs. He beckoned to her and went down them.</p><p>She might have been a kid again, frozen there. For long moments, she wasn\u2019t sure she was even breathing.</p> <p>He only comes when he\u2019s needed, Gus had told her.</p><p>Abby came to life. She sprinted across the room and to the stairs.</p><p>A chain stretched across the iron railing of the landing here; it was in place as it should have been.</p><p>Abby slid underneath it and quickly followed the winding steps to the main floor.</p><p>A few diners lingered, but she\u2019d been quiet and hadn\u2019t been noticed. The grating was in place. She knelt down\u2014and saw that the lock was open.</p><p>Heedless of anyone who might see her, Abby lifted the grating. It was dark below. There were lights, but Gus kept them off except for the ones directly by the grate. She hurried down the stairs, calling his name. \u201cGus!\u201d</p><p>She reached the bottom and the dank tunnel that led out to the river.</p><p>\u201cGus!\u201d</p><p>Someone seemed to be ahead of her. A shadow moving almost as one with the darkness.</p><p>She followed.</p><p>And then, ten feet along the tunnel, she found him.</p><p>Gus.</p><p>She fell to her knees at his side. \u201cGus, Gus, Gus!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t feel her touch when she felt for a pulse, for any sign that he was breathing.</p><p>He was so cold!</p><p>Yes, cold, she realized, horrified and heartbroken.</p><p>Stone-cold dead.</p><p>2</p><p>Augustus Anderson was laid to rest a week after his death at the city\u2019s incredibly beautiful Bonaventure Cemetery.</p><p>Abby\u2019s family had a plot there, a group of tombstones that ran the gamut from the mid-1800s, when the cemetery was founded, to the last burial before this one, when her father had passed away. A lovely low fence surrounded the small plot. The number of people who\u2019d come to the church ceremony and now to the cemetery to honor Gus was almost overwhelming. The crowd didn\u2019t fit into the actual plot area and many waited on the other side of the fence, listening to Father McFey as he spoke his final words over the coffin and Gus was left to rest in peace.</p><p>Abby barely heard the service. Despite the fact that he\u2019d been gone a week, she was in no less a state of mental turmoil. Friends had sympathetically reminded her of his age and that he\u2019d died quickly and hadn\u2019t suffered a long and debilitating illness, which would have mortified him. She didn\u2019t need to be told. She knew she was blessed that she\u2019d had him for so many years\u2014and that he\u2019d been lucky to have led such a robust and healthy life.</p><p>All of that was true.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t right. What had happened wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Gus, she was certain, had been murdered.</p><p>Making the suggestion to the police had merely brought her more sympathy.</p><p>Gus had been as old as the hills. She\u2019d recognized the looks that the officers who were called to the scene had given her.</p><p>Poor girl\u2019s lost her only living relative. She just came out of the academy at Quantico, and she can\u2019t accept an old\u2014old!\u2014man dying, so she had to turn it into a mystery.</p><p>An autopsy had revealed that he\u2019d died because his heart had given out.</p><p>She believed that. But his heart had given out for a reason.</p><p>Gus had expected her; he\u2019d been anxious to see her. Gus never got up and suddenly decided he needed to go down into the old pirate tunnels\u2014he hadn\u2019t been down there for years. To ensure that the tunnel remained safe and supported the structures above, he sent workers down every few months. He maintained the tunnel because of its historic value. It wasn\u2019t a place he went for exercise or to commune with his ancestors or anything of the kind.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to be logical. Gus had been very old. She\u2019d heard of a number of cases like his, cases in which someone had led a long and healthy life, and just dropped dead. Young runners occasionally dropped dead, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t forget how and when it had happened. Couldn\u2019t forget what he\u2019d said.</p><p>Come home. I need you.</p><p>She wished now that she\u2019d insisted he talk to her over the phone, that she\u2019d demanded he provide some sort of explanation.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>And still his words haunted her. If she didn\u2019t discover why he\u2019d said those words to her, they\u2019d haunt her for the rest of her life.</p><p>She suddenly realized that everyone was silent, that Father McFey was looking at her. He\u2019d finished with the ceremony, and everyone was waiting for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She held the folded American flag that had draped his coffin, since he\u2019d seen military service in two wars, and a single rose. She was supposed to drop the rose on the coffin, allow others to do the same thing and officially end the burial of a man who had become an icon.</p><p>It seemed that half of Savannah had come out for the occasion. They needed to get back to their lives.</p><p>She needed to figure out how to organize hers.</p> <p>She walked over to the coffin, which still sat above the ground; they wouldn\u2019t lower it into the earth until she and the rest of the mourners were gone.</p><p>The soprano from Gus\u2019s church was singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d as they finished and Abby was aware that Macy\u2014and several other people\u2014were sniffing and trying to hold back sobs.</p><p>Abby didn\u2019t cry; she\u2019d cried herself out over the past week. She stood and touched the coffin and spoke to him within her own mind.</p><p>Thank you, Gus. Love you, Gus. Thank you for loving me the way you did. You will always be a part of me, with me. I will never forget you....</p><p>She set her rose on the coffin and stepped back, gazing into the crowd. As she\u2019d expected, Blue Anderson was there, across from the coffin, a little to the left, behind Gus\u2019s old cronies\u2014Bootsie, Dirk and Aldous. The men had dressed in their best suits for the occasion. But even in their tailored and proper attire, they looked like pirates. Bootsie had his peg leg, of course, and Aldous was still bald, still wore his earring.</p> <p>Maybe the pirate resemblance came from the fact that Blue Anderson, in his splendid frock coat and sweeping pirate hat, stood behind them.</p><p>She stared gravely at Blue. He nodded to her, a gesture of consolation that somehow seemed reassuring.</p><p>Father McFey took her arm and led her from the burial site. A uniformed chauffeur waited to open the door to the black limo that would take her back to the Dragonslayer. Those who could join them would be there for a repast in honor of Gus.</p><p>It was what he\u2019d wanted; he had let his wishes be known in his will. He\u2019d wanted to lie next to his wife and his son, Abby\u2019s father, and he\u2019d wanted \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and Father McFey. He\u2019d left explicit instructions. And then bring our friends back to the Dragonslayer. Please laugh with them and remember the wonderful events in my life. Celebrate for me, for I was blessed, and life comes to an end for us all.</p><p>She turned before getting into the car. A very tall man she didn\u2019t know leaned against another car, a silver SUV. He hadn\u2019t come to the grave site, she thought. But he\u2019d been watching\u2014he\u2019d watched the burial rites, just as he watched her now.</p><p>He was interesting-looking, certainly. He appeared to be six-three or -four. He was appropriately dressed for a funeral in a dark suede jacket, white shirt and a dark vest. Black hair was neatly clipped, with one swatch that sat slightly low over his forehead. She couldn\u2019t see his eyes because he was wearing sunglasses but she knew he was watching her.</p> <p>An old friend of Gus\u2019s? Or a new one? Definitely someone she hadn\u2019t met.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t really taken part in the service. He\u2019d stood at a distance, as if he had needed to watch\u2014and still meant to be respectful. Odd, to say the least.</p><p>\u201cMs. Anderson?\u201d</p><p>She realized she\u2019d been staring at him when the driver suggested that she enter the car.</p><p>She was alone on the short drive back to the Dragonslayer. Macy had gone on ahead to see that they were set up for the reception to follow the service. Reception? No, party. Gus had insisted they celebrate his life, not the passing of it.</p><p>She thought about the week since his death and the funeral. Many people considered that a long time, but there\u2019d been an autopsy and she\u2019d wanted to arrange for those who\u2019d loved Gus\u2014some of them from out of town\u2014to show up for the service.</p><p>The parking lot was half-full when the limo drove up to let Abby out. She wasn\u2019t sure why she felt she needed more fortitude for Gus\u2019s party than she had for the church or the graveside service. She knew a lot of people were going to cry\u2014party or no\u2014but she felt drained of tears, numb. Gus\u2019s death was the end of her world as she\u2019d known it.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p> <p>When she walked in, she almost smiled. The first people she saw were Gus\u2019s old cohorts already at the bar. Bootsie, Dirk and Aldous.</p><p>They had teacups in front of them but she knew the tea had been spiked with whiskey\u2014Gus\u2019s favorite drink and cure-all.</p><p>They swung their stools around to greet her, all raising their cups. \u201cAbby!\u201d</p><p>She felt oddly as if they were saluting a monarch. Maybe they were afraid she\u2019d oust them from their seats at the bar.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d she said.</p><p>Aldous reached for something and came over to her. She noted the way his bald head shimmered in the tavern\u2019s lights. His blue eyes seemed gray, sad, solemn.</p><p>He\u2019d collected another cup from the bar. \u201cWe had it ready for you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d have a private toast before you got caught up in all the craziness. Gus was one of a kind. A lot of people loved him. But I think we\u2019re going to miss him the most, the four of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Aldous,\u201d she said, taking the cup from him. She lifted it. \u201cTo Gus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Gus! Long may his legend live!\u201d Bootsie said.</p><p>She gave Aldous a kiss on the cheek and walked over to do the same with Bootsie and Dirk. \u201cYou guys all okay, workwise?\u201d She looked specifically at Dirk. His \u201cpirate\u201d ship went out every day. Dirk loved to play the pirate master of ceremonies and he was very good at it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s handled. I have the crew taking care of everything. No way I wouldn\u2019t honor Gus,\u201d Dirk told her.</p><p>Macy came striding over to her. \u201cAbby, the mayor wants to convey his condolences and the chief of police is here.\u201d She glanced at the men. \u201cIf I can steal you away for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in a bit, guys,\u201d she said as she accompanied Macy.</p><p>And so continued what already felt like a long day.</p><p>She was cordial to the chief, despite the fact that she wasn\u2019t feeling especially fond of the local police at the moment. She supposed she couldn\u2019t blame them. Her insistence that something was wrong with the circumstances of an old man\u2019s death couldn\u2019t compare with some of the very real and obvious crimes they were facing.</p><p>And the autopsy did conclude that Gus had died of a heart attack, not surprising for someone of his age who wanted to crawl around in historic tunnels as if he were a young man.</p><p>But that was the point they weren\u2019t getting. Gus didn\u2019t crawl around in tunnels!</p><p>Fine. There was very little she could do about their lack of interest in the tunnels. She\u2019d contacted the officer in charge of her assignment at Quantico, who didn\u2019t seem to have much understanding of her situation. An old man had died. It happened; that was life. But, of course, she should take whatever time she needed and report in as soon as possible, let them know when she\u2019d be returning.</p><p>And she\u2019d probably be in a boatload of trouble when she did return for an assignment. Because she\u2019d gone over her supervisor\u2019s head to contact another FBI unit leader.</p><p>Jackson Crow.</p><p>Crow was in charge of a special section of the agency; he and his people were based in a field office of their own in Arlington, Virginia. From there, they were sent across the country.</p><p>At the regular offices, they were referred to as the \u201cghost busters.\u201d Despite that reference, they were held in awe by most of the other agents. They had a spectacular record of solving cases. She knew about Jackson Crow because he was a legend at the agency; he\u2019d solved cases with various units before being asked to form a special one dedicated to situations that were...out of the ordinary.</p><p>They were officially known as the Krewe of Hunters. She assumed that was because the first assignment as a new unit had been in New Orleans, when the wife of a U.S. senator had mysteriously died.</p><p>Abby didn\u2019t want any ghosts \u201cbusted.\u201d She wanted someone to believe that her grandfather had been onto something, that he\u2019d needed to speak with her for a very real reason. And from what she understood, while there were rumors about the Krewe agents having \u201cspecial\u201d abilities, they worked with evidence and cold hard facts. Even so, Jackson\u2019s units had often been called in when cases involved historic properties that were supposedly haunted.</p><p>Heart attack or not, she was convinced Gus had been murdered. His heart had stopped because he\u2019d been startled or come upon some sight so horrible that he\u2019d died of shock. She hoped that her email to Jackson Crow, filled with information on the history of Savannah and the Dragonslayer, would bring him out to investigate. She wasn\u2019t sure how she could make a federal case out of the death of a Georgian in Georgia, but she couldn\u2019t let it rest. She owed Gus way more than that.</p><p>So, as she greeted the local law and government personnel who\u2019d turned out in respect for Gus, she was polite and circumspect. She moved from one to another, thanking them all.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mention again her belief that he\u2019d been murdered. She didn\u2019t need more pitying stares from those who thought she was a little crazy with grief\u2014or suspected that, fresh from the academy, she\u2019d try to create problems between federal and local law enforcement.</p><p>Luckily, the people she didn\u2019t know didn\u2019t stay long. An hour and a half later, she found herself at a table near the life-size image of Blue Anderson, still sipping the spiked tea Aldous had handed her, with Grant Green, the night manager, and a couple of her old friends, Roger English and Paul Westermark. She\u2019d seen Roger and Paul portraying Blue Anderson and Scurvy Pete Martin when she\u2019d arrived a week ago.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was immortal,\u201d Roger said, sighing. \u201cLord, I loved that man. He knew how to keep the fun and magic in history. When we were kids, remember, he\u2019d let us dress up? Sometimes we\u2019d pretend to be captives that Blue had taken. Or mates running around, trying to shanghai other men down to the ships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever, ever paid us late.\u201d Paul smiled. \u201cI remember during one of the storms that hit Savannah a few years back, Gus had us go and do a whole pirate day for a bunch of kids at one of the shelters. He just did it out of the goodness of his heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe put me in a wig and dressed me up as a silly maiden in distress for that one,\u201d Grant Green recalled, sipping on a beer. \u201cGus was the best. The day I applied to work here, I hadn\u2019t even filled out a form and he was short a server, so he stuck an order pad in my hand and said, \u2018Just sing some kind of pirate song if you mess up\u2014you\u2019ll be fine!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus was like that,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cAh, Gus!\u201d Grant said sadly. \u201cHe was a force of nature. I don\u2019t think any of us believed we\u2019d ever really lose him.\u201d</p> <p>She could see that Macy was thanking some of Gus\u2019s church friends and saying goodbye. She should have gotten up and joined her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite manage it.</p><p>As she watched, Jerry Sullivan came to the table, bearing a fresh cup.</p><p>\u201cNew one for you,\u201d Sullivan told her. \u201cThe one you\u2019re holding must be iced tea by now.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cGus did think that a shot of whiskey in hot tea solved all.\u201d He grinned at her, green eyes sympathetic. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an Irish thing\u2014I know, \u2019cause of my folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy great-grandfather married an Irish girl in the 1890s, fresh from Ellis Island, or so I heard.\u201d Abby smiled back, accepting the tea. She had a feeling that Sullivan had heavily spiked this cup.</p> <p>He had, but it was good. It burned as she swallowed it, warming her stomach, and then seemed to move outward to her limbs.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he said, and went back to work.</p><p>She watched him leave. Twisting, she saw that someone was standing at the bar with her grandfather\u2019s trio of cronies.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she murmured, rising from the table and heading to the bar.</p><p>Before she even came near, she realized that the man was the same one who\u2019d been watching her at the cemetery\u2014few people were that tall with hair quite so dark. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but it seemed that her heart was racing a little as she walked to the bar.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s our girl now,\u201d Bootsie said affectionately. \u201cOur Abby, more beautiful every day, the finest wench ever to grace such an illustrious tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, here I am,\u201d Abby said dryly, slipping in between him and Dirk.</p><p>She faced the unknown man. He was minus his sunglasses. His eyes were green, sharp and enhanced by the darkness of his well-defined brows. His features were striking. Weathered, hardened, bronzed, but striking. His chin was a solid square while his cheekbones were high. He had the look of someone who\u2019d seen the harder side of life\u2014but had come out swinging. Still, his dress was entirely appropriate and she had a feeling he\u2019d be courteous and polite.</p><p>\u201cMs. Anderson,\u201d he said, offering her a hand. \u201cMy name is Malachi Gordon. I\u2019m here from the bureau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, taking his hand. Fed? Yes, he could be a fed. But she doubted it. A fed would\u2019ve shown up in a more standard suit, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cThank you. It wasn\u2019t necessary for the bureau to send a representative. Only a few friends in my classes ever met Gus, and the agency sent a beautiful wreath,\u201d Abby explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see you, Ms. Anderson,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was curious but didn\u2019t want to ask any more in front of the others. She wondered what this was about. Did the agency believe a death in a family could have such a negative effect on an agent that he or she was rendered less able for duty?</p> <p>\u201cThank you for being here,\u201d she said, assuming he\u2019d clarify later.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been giving him a history of the Dragonslayer,\u201d Aldous said.</p><p>\u201cAnd telling him about Gus,\u201d Bootsie added.</p><p>The trio lifted their cups again. \u201cTo Gus!\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>Malachi Gordon smiled at Abby. She smiled in return.</p><p>\u201cThis is an incredible place,\u201d he said. \u201cWell-preserved\u2014and yet alive. Living history is always the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, people do love pirates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d Dirk shrugged and said, \u201cI make my living by running a pirate ship that we take out for tourists every day. We do birthday parties and other occasions, too.\u201d He produced a card from his wallet to hand the newcomer. \u201cAbby\u2019s worked on her over the years. Go figure\u2014she made a great pirate and now she\u2019s a federal agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who ever said there weren\u2019t a few pirates among the feds?\u201d Malachi Gordon asked lightly.</p><p>That was very amusing to her grandfather\u2019s friends; they all laughed. Glancing around, Abby saw that Roger and Paul were about to leave and she excused herself to say goodbye to them. She\u2019d try to catch the fed on his own soon.</p><p>Roger and Paul were old friends and both hugged her warmly. She walked out front with them. \u201cHey, your freebie newspapers were delivered,\u201d Roger said, picking up the bundle to open them and lay them on top of the stand. As he did, she noticed the headline.</p><p>Body of College Student Found in River</p><p>A third murder? she wondered, itching to pick up the paper and find out what was going on.</p><p>Or...a fourth? Had Gus been murdered by the same person who\u2019d killed three people found in or near the river?</p><p>Was her mind going haywire because she was a new graduate from the academy who\u2019d just taken classes taught by a premier behavioral specialist? Was she looking for a mystery where none existed?</p><p>But...Savannah\u2019s murder rate for the past few years had been low for a city of its size. Any large city battled violent crime and Savannah had seen its share. But this...</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019ll be heading back to Virginia,\u201d Roger reminded her. He took her by the shoulders, his eyes meeting hers. \u201cYou have to worry about you right now, Ms. Anderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Paul asked her. \u201cYou\u2019ve inherited the Dragonslayer. You wouldn\u2019t close down the tavern, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be tough\u2014you being an absentee owner,\u201d Paul pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMacy has it down pat,\u201d Abby said. \u201cWe have great bartenders, cooks and waitstaff. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all going to work out. That\u2019s been the least of...\u201d Her voice trailed off. She didn\u2019t want to say worries. \u201cThat\u2019s...well, not what I\u2019ve worried about,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry, kid. So sorry,\u201d Roger murmured. \u201cI know how much you loved Gus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really loved him, too, you know?\u201d Paul said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOf course. I know.\u201d</p><p>Abby went back inside. One of their newest waitresses\u2014a girl named Julie whom Abby had just met\u2014was cleaning up in the dining rooms. The staff who\u2019d been there the longest hadn\u2019t really worked that day, other than stepping in to help get a few things loaded into the bus carts. They\u2019d come as mourners.</p><p>She looked around; there was no sign of Malachi Gordon.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s left?\u201d she asked Julie.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few of us still tidying up in the kitchen. It\u2019s back to full service tomorrow, or so I was told,\u201d Julie said. She hesitated. She was young and sweet, a student at the design school. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m sorry\u2014that\u2019s your call now. But, um, that\u2019s what I was told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re back to regular hours, Julie. Thanks.\u201d Abby smiled. \u201cAnd thanks for getting everything picked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a real sad thing about Gus. He was so good to all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear, even though it\u2019s something I know\u2014that Gus was great to work for,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>She turned and went back to the front. Sullivan was behind the bar. Macy was collecting glasses that had been left at the tall bar tables.</p><p>Aldous, Dirk and Bootsie remained on their bar stools.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your new friend?\u201d she asked him. \u201cThe man from the bureau?\u201d</p><p>Dirk frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe he took off. He wasn\u2019t actually a friend of yours, right? Just a rep from the government?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d thought he\u2019d speak with me again before he left,\u201d Abby said. \u201cBut...I guess not.\u201d</p><p>Bootsie stood, his peg leg wobbling. \u201cListen, Abby, we know today\u2019s been hard on you. Now, the boys and I, we can hang around here as long as you like. Or, better still, we can take you off somewhere else and give you a break from this place.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, thanks. It\u2019s okay. To be honest, I\u2019m looking forward to some time alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d Bootsie said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cDo you want us to walk you to your parents\u2019 house?\u201d Dirk asked her. \u201cI mean, do you really want to stay here right now? You have that beautiful house on the square....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should come with us,\u201d Aldous said. \u201cThe house is where...and this is where...\u201d He broke off. The house was where her parents had died; this was where Gus had just died.</p><p>\u201cI love my house\u2014it\u2019s beautiful. I really should rent it out again.\u201d The previous tenants had been a writer and his family, and they\u2019d gone back to New York a few months ago. She\u2019d rented the place furnished. Not sure what she wanted to do with it yet, she\u2019d brought over some extra clothes and retrieved boxes of her old belongings from the basement, returning them to her childhood bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m not unhappy in either the house or the Dragonslayer, guys. I have good memories here\u2014and there. I\u2019m fine. Just need a little time to take a deep breath now that the funeral\u2019s over, and then get everything in order. So...out with the three of you! Go wander along the riverfront and give another innkeeper your business tonight. Come back tomorrow. With or without Gus, this remains your place. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I came home and didn\u2019t find the three of you here. But for now, scat!\u201d</p><p>They looked like a group of fathers forced to leave their children for a first day at school.</p><p>\u201cHey, come on now. Out, out,\u201d Abby told them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They finally left her with a bit more grumbling and a lot of hugs.</p><p>Sullivan cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll just get these last glasses....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Sullivan, that\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve got it. I\u2019d like something to do,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Macy said. \u201cGrant\u2019s upstairs. He\u2019s checking on supplies for the week. After that, I think he plans on leaving for the night. But, Abby, I don\u2019t feel you should be alone here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my life here!\u201d</p><p>Macy walked behind the bar to get her purse. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said with obvious reluctance. \u201cMake sure you lock up. The city can be scary. I don\u2019t ever remember so many people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDying?\u201d Sullivan finished. \u201cCome on, Macy. Abby doesn\u2019t want us here. I\u2019ll walk you home.\u201d</p><p>Macy nodded as she stood behind the bar, looking at Abby. \u201cYou have my number. If anything comes up. Or if you just need to talk...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were both wonderful to Gus. He loved you and appreciated your loyalty to the Dragonslayer. And so do I. Now, I\u2019m fine. You two go on home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know you control the music from behind the bar,\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Abby assured him.</p><p>\u201cI wish Gus had gotten a solid alarm system for this place.\u201d Macy glanced at Abby and flushed. \u201cI\u2019m not criticizing. He had cameras put in the front and over by the parking lot, and there\u2019s an emergency police buzzer behind the bar. Most of the downstairs windows are sealed now, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought his security installations were a big deal. State of the art. He started them more than fifteen years ago, when we were nearly broken into,\u201d Abby said. \u201cBut, Macy, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll see about getting a real alarm system before I go back to Virginia,\u201d Abby promised. She looked up; she heard Grant coming down from the offices upstairs. He joined them, giving her a hug.</p><p>She loved Grant. He\u2019d worked for Gus, first as a pirate entertainer. Grant had spent seven years getting his hospitality degree, he\u2019d told her some time ago. He couldn\u2019t decide between acting, modeling and going into the restaurant or hotel business. Once he had his degree in hand, the first person to really believe in him had been Gus.</p><p>\u201cI heard the words alarm system,\u201d Grant said. \u201cI have brochures up in my office. Gus asked me to look into a good system just a few days ago,\u201d Grant said.</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Abby promised. \u201cGrant, sometime tomorrow, if you want to go through the different companies with me, that\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Grant said. \u201cI\u2019m going to head out now\u2014if you\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Grant, who was gay, had been with his partner, Alden Blaine, for well over ten years. Alden worked for the fire department and had left the tavern earlier, since he had an early call the next day.</p><p>\u201cGo home, yes, go home. My Lord, getting you people out of here is a real project.\u201d</p><p>At last, with everyone still protesting, she got them all out the door.</p><p>As she closed and locked it, she smiled, wondering what they were worried about; she\u2019d been staying here every night since she\u2019d arrived, and\u2014except for today\u2014the Dragonslayer didn\u2019t close until 2:00 a.m. That meant the staff never left until three or four. She\u2019d been going to bed much earlier, leaving Grant to lock up.</p><p>And she\u2019d been fine.</p><p>Maybe it was the fact that people were here so late\u2014and that the first of the setup crews were usually in by six in the morning, although they didn\u2019t open until eleven. So there were only a few hours when she\u2019d been alone and despite, or because of, the circumstances she\u2019d come home to, she\u2019d been sound asleep during those hours.</p> <p>They were probably worried about what she might imagine in the darkness, worried that she\u2019d be afraid.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t afraid. She knew what they didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Blue Anderson watched over the Dragonslayer.</p><p>In the days that had followed her grandfather\u2019s death, she\u2019d hoped Blue would make an appearance. She\u2019d hoped as well, that she\u2019d be haunted by her grandfather.</p><p>But no one had appeared to her, upstairs or down, by day or night. Blue had stood by the burial site in the graveyard, though....</p><p>With the door finally closed and locked, Abby walked around the downstairs. Figureheads from ships of many centuries stared down at her. She walked past the hostess stand and behind the bar, gathering up the last of the glasses as she did so.</p><p>A copy of the day\u2019s paper lay on the bar. She set the glasses by the sanitizer and picked it up.</p><p>There was no mention of a serial killer in the article; it stated simply that the body of Felicia Shepherd, twenty-two, had been found on the river embankment by the bridge. The cause of her death would be determined by the medical examiner.</p><p>Thoughtfully, Abby walked back to the hostess stand and searched through the papers collected there until she came to the one she had picked up the day she arrived.</p><p>The first victim had also been a young woman, aged twenty-five. Her name was Ruth Seymour and she\u2019d come to Savannah on vacation. She\u2019d wanted to stay in the historic city for a night on her own before meeting up with friends at Hilton Head. She had checked into her bed-and-breakfast\u2014the clerk remembered her as bubbly and charming\u2014and that was the last anyone could remember seeing her until her body was discovered.</p><p>The second victim was Rupert Holloway, a salesman for a mobile phone company. He never arrived at his hotel. His wife told police he\u2019d planned to meet business associates on the riverfront for lunch.</p><p>The associates had gone to lunch; Rupert Holloway had not. He had next appeared on the river embankment\u2014dead.</p><p>No cause of death was mentioned for Holloway, either. An autopsy had been pending for both at the time the article was written.</p><p>\u201cFoul play suspected,\u201d she read aloud.</p><p>She set the first paper down and picked up the most recent one.</p><p>Abby didn\u2019t care what the police were saying. Ruth Seymour, Rupert Holloway and now Felicia Shepherd were all out-of-towners, all found by the river.</p><p>Serial killer.</p><p>She shook her head. The victimology was so different. A serial killer usually liked a type. With Ted Bundy, it had been young women with long dark hair. Jeffrey Dahmer had gone for boys or young men. Some killers preyed on couples.</p><p>Maybe he was after young women\u2014and the businessman had been a mistake or had stumbled upon him when he\u2019d been engaged in some other illegal act?</p><p>\u201cMs. Anderson?\u201d</p><p>Abby was so startled by the voice that she screamed and threw the newspaper in the air. She swung around.</p><p>To her astonishment, she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>She\u2019d locked herself in, all right, but somehow she\u2019d managed to lock herself in before confirming that everyone else was out.</p><p>It was the agent, and he was staring at her from the left dining room. But the lights had been dimmed in the dining rooms, so he would\u2019ve known they were closing.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t gone, after all.</p><p>He walked toward her quickly, apologizing as he did. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you still doing here?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou did scare me\u2014you scared me out of my wits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have frightened you because of the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cYou did just come from the academy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, Mr. Gordon?\u201d she asked. \u201cA certain amount of fear is healthy for all of us. It keeps us from being reckless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the line at the academy, is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She frowned. A small trickle of fear assailed her again. Who the hell was this man? She didn\u2019t know him; he\u2019d said that he\u2019d come from the FBI but he\u2019d done nothing to prove it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember the academy?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cRemember it? I never went to it.\u201d</p><p>There was, she knew, a gun below the bar in the strongbox. A nice safe place during the business day\u2014hard to get to right now. And this guy was probably a full six-foot-four, lean, muscled and hard as nails.</p><p>Unease slithered alone her spine.</p><p>Serial killer?</p><p>He didn\u2019t look like a serial killer.</p><p>But, of course, she had just come through the academy, as he\u2019d said. So she was well aware that a serial killer could be charming, credible and handsome. They\u2019d seen enough examples of that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You really are frightened. And you\u2019re thinking that getting your gun from under the bar won\u2019t be easy, and since it was your grandfather\u2019s funeral service today, you aren\u2019t carrying your regulation Glock,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around this place since I was a kid, Mr. Gordon\u2014or whoever you are. I\u2019m lethal with a broken bottle and I can grab one and smash it before you can blink!\u201d</p><p>He smiled and shook his head, frowning. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you shouldn\u2019t have been hiding in a darkened restaurant. If you needed to speak with me, you might have stayed around and done so instead of just vanishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t hiding in a darkened restaurant\u2014and I didn\u2019t vanish.\u201d</p><p>Abby arched her brows and looked toward the dining room.</p><p>\u201cI went down into the tunnel,\u201d he told her. He took a step toward the bar. She reached for a bottle and held it by the neck. He stopped, lifting his hands, smiling grimly. \u201cYour grandfather did die in the tunnel, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe grate from the restaurant to the tunnel is locked.\u201d She could tell that her voice sounded thin.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat tunnel is almost pitch-black.\u201d Her voice was growing even tighter and thinner.</p><p>And while she wasn\u2019t armed, she realized he did have a gun worn discreetly beneath his jacket. She wasn\u2019t sure what kind, because the flap of his jacket was covering it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her fingers tightened around the neck of the bottle she held.</p><p>He reached into his pants pocket; she drew back, slamming the bottle against the wall.</p><p>He let out a sigh and stepped back again. \u201cMan, that\u2019s going to be a bitch for someone to clean up,\u201d he said. \u201cI was only getting my light. It\u2019s finger-size but casts a glow big and strong enough to light up Pluto.\u201d</p> <p>He held up a small flashlight. To add insult to injury, he turned it on. It nearly blinded her.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing in the tunnel?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cInvestigating, Ms. Anderson. That\u2019s what you wanted, right? You think your grandfather was murdered. I\u2019m here to investigate.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in denial. \u201cNo one paid any attention to me,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd you just said you hadn\u2019t been to the academy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been. Yet. I\u2019m here on a trial basis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m a consultant. I\u2019ve been asked to join the Krewe and we\u2019re seeing if I work out as a Krewe member. Whether they like me enough\u2014and whether I like the job enough to accept it.\u201d</p><p>Wary, Abby said, \u201cMr. Gordon, you really need to leave. You haven\u2019t been through the academy, so no one I know sent you. And I\u2019ll see to it that the grating is locked. Thank you so much for letting me know it isn\u2019t. Now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u2014yes, now. Can we please have a discussion? A rational discussion. Look, you\u2019re the one who sent for help!\u201d he said irritably.</p><p>\u201cTalk about what? I don\u2019t know who you are or what you\u2019re doing here if you don\u2019t have the credentials\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sent here because you asked for help!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a copy of your email, Ms. Anderson. I\u2019ll show you, as long as you don\u2019t drag the whole bar down if I reach into a pocket again. You wrote to Jackson Crow, from the Krewe of Hunters. Jackson Crow sent me. Take me or leave me, Ms. Anderson, but I\u2019m your man. If I agree you\u2019ve got the right kind of problem\u2014and there is a strong possibility that your grandfather was murdered, possibly in connection with those murders you were just reading about\u2014then more Krewe members will step in. For now, you\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>Abby swallowed. There were a number of agents in the Krewes who\u2019d been with the FBI for some time now. This man was saying he hadn\u2019t even gone to the academy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an agent?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord,\u201d she said shaking. \u201cThen...then what are your credentials?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWell, I\u2019m a private investigator legitimately licensed. At one time I was a detective with the New Orleans police. And now I\u2019m legitimately on the books as a consultant to the feds. Perhaps most important, Ms. Anderson, I just had a conversation with an ancestor of yours. Calls himself Blue. Will that do for starters?\u201d</p><p>3</p> <p>Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have mentioned the fact that he\u2019d seen Blue Anderson, Malachi thought. But, then again, the young woman seemed to think he was a serial killer himself, so he had to say something.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t occurred to him that the place would have emptied out by the time he came back. But the tunnel had fascinated him, and he\u2019d followed it from the tavern to the riverbank and back more than once, marveling at the pirates who had constructed the escape\u2014or kidnapping or shanghai\u2014route. Once in the tavern again, he\u2019d had no choice but to make himself known.</p><p>Or maybe he should just have told her he was an agent. Except that he wasn\u2019t. Not yet. If he chose to accept an appointment with the Krewe of Hunters, then, yes, he\u2019d have to go through a course at the academy. But he was still skeptical.</p><p>And neither had he expected to be sent out on his own. But, apparently, that was the way Adam Harrison, Jackson Crow and Logan Raintree felt it should be done.</p><p>Sort of like a baptism by fire.</p><p>Malachi was game, though. Especially after he\u2019d read about the two bodies that were discovered on the riverbank. He hadn\u2019t been convinced that the death of a man in his nineties was murder, but since the man\u2019s granddaughter had just graduated from the academy and had written such an impassioned letter, someone needed to come out here. And these recent murders did give a degree of credence to her beliefs.</p><p>So it was a test. For them, and as he\u2019d said, for him. A chance to find out if he was really willing to join a unit or \u201ccreate his own,\u201d as he\u2019d been offered. They needed more units in Jackson Crow\u2019s specialized area and apparently they thought he was a man who could head up another one.</p><p>Actually, it didn\u2019t seem like a bad deal. Work with people who didn\u2019t think he was crazy or that he was a psychic. Trying to convince some people that he wasn\u2019t a psychic was as hard as convincing others that he did have certain...talents.</p><p>As Abby Anderson stared at him, Malachi tried to sum her up. She was tall, a stunning woman with a headful of the darkest, richest black hair he\u2019d ever seen and eyes so blue they appeared to be violet or black. Her features were delicate and beautifully chiseled, and while she was lithe and fit, she was still well-endowed. Slim and yet curvy\u2014hard to achieve.</p><p>She had to have ability and intelligence; he refused to believe she could have made it through the academy without both. What agents sometimes lacked, in Malachi\u2019s opinion, was imagination and vision. Though not, he had quickly discovered, the agents who wound up in what Adam Harrison had created\u2014the Krewe of Hunters or, as it was generally called now, the Krewes. There was the original Krewe and then the Texas Krewe, although even adding a second was proving to be insufficient. Adam Harrison had told him passionately that it wasn\u2019t a calling that came to just anyone. No two ways about it, forming a new Krewe was difficult. Very few people had the talents they needed\u2014and the ability to physically and mentally work in law enforcement.</p><p>She continued to stare at him as time ticked by. She seemed almost frozen, as if she were in a tableau. He feared she had to be in shock, although she didn\u2019t reveal her emotions.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he said, somewhat awkwardly. \u201cLook, Ms. Anderson, I know what I\u2019m doing around a crime scene and I generally know what I\u2019m doing around people. Alive and dead. No, I don\u2019t see hundreds of ghosts walking the streets, but when someone\u2019s hanging around a place like this the way your Blue Anderson seems to be doing, it\u2019s usually for a reason, like safeguarding someone.\u201d</p><p>Was he wrong? Had she never seen the ghost of the pirate? If not, he\u2019d just shown himself to be a real quack in her eyes.</p><p>No, in her email to Jackson she\u2019d stated there was a ghost at the tavern, a ghost reportedly seen through the centuries. She hadn\u2019t come out and said she\u2019d seen the ghost, but reading between the lines, he was certain she had.</p><p>And even if she did think he was a quack, so what? He still wasn\u2019t completely sure he wanted to be here or be part of this. He\u2019d spent the past five years working for himself and he liked it that way. Maybe he should\u2019ve started off with the fact that he\u2019d served in the military and been a cop in New Orleans for several years before Marie\u2019s death from cancer, when he\u2019d come home to his family property in Virginia. That was when he\u2019d chosen to work for himself, getting a P.I. license.</p><p>Now...</p><p>\u201cHe spoke to you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s life behind those eyes!\u201d he murmured. \u201cYes, it seems to take him a great deal of effort. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s practiced at speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPracticed?\u201d she asked, sounding startled. \u201cPracticed? Ghosts have to practice...being ghosts?\u201d</p><p>Curious. She didn\u2019t seem worried that he\u2019d seen the ghost. She was worried\u2014or maybe confused\u2014about its being a practiced ghost.</p><p>Jackson Crow had been certain, reading her email, that Abigail Anderson was of their own kind. A communicator, as Jackson referred to people who saw more than others did.</p><p>\u201cMs. Anderson, in my own experience, those who remain behind meet the same difficulties we do in life. Some are shy and don\u2019t do much more than watch. They never manage to speak to the living, move objects, even make a room cold. Some discover that they can learn to speak, to move objects\u2014and they can even create a cold wind. Just like some of us on earth speak many languages while others are lucky to speak one. And some can barely walk, while others have athletic talent and prowess or perform in dance or join the Cirque de Soleil. Every ghost is an individual, just as each of us is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you...saw Blue. And spoke to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. He hardly ever appears. He\u2019s never spoken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to you, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his descendent!\u201d she said indignantly.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWell, have you ever tried speaking to him?\u201d</p><p>She straightened, glaring at him with hostile, narrowed eyes.</p><p>No, Malachi decided, it didn\u2019t seem he\u2019d gone about this the right way at all.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re old friends. Where is he now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCertainly not old friends,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t met a ghost yet who appears on demand. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s around somewhere, though. I don\u2019t think he leaves these premises. At least not often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you spoke with him where, exactly?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was there at first. He put a hand on my shoulder and said, \u2018This is where he died. He was strong of heart. His death was not so simple.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She stared at him with such incredulity, Malachi found himself growing irritated. She saw Blue herself.</p><p>\u201cMr. Gordon, even if you are for real, I wish you\u2019d leave right now. My grandfather died. We buried him today. But you know that. You were watching.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her. \u201cI can leave, or we can get started. Your grandfather called you because he suspected something or knew something\u2014at least, that\u2019s what you wrote to Agent Crow.\u201d He tapped the newspaper. \u201cSo Gus is dead, possibly a victim, and there are three more\u2014in a city where the murder rate is customarily quite low. Four victims in a short period of time. Do you want to sit there doubting me, or do you want to piece together what we know? Shouldn\u2019t take long. It isn\u2019t a lot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlmost nothing,\u201d she agreed after a moment, disgust in her tone. She picked up the newspaper behind the bar. \u201cAnother girl dead, found on the riverbank. The police haven\u2019t released cause of death, and when I tried to speak with them, I got nowhere. I tried to tell them Gus hadn\u2019t just died\u2014that there had to be someone else down there in the tunnel, someone who caused him to die.\u201d She shook her head, studying him. \u201cLook, you\u2019re not even an agent. How are you going to get any information?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI honestly have a private investigator\u2019s license and I am now on the federal payroll as a consultant. Feel free to check that out. Call Jackson Crow. I think he\u2019ll be expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him? I don\u2019t have a number. All I could find in the material I have from Quantico was an email address. And I couldn\u2019t reach him on an official line now. It\u2019s nearly eight!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have his cell number. And he might be in the office, anyway. He works long hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So I could be calling anyone!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that. \u201cEver suspicious. That should make you a good agent, but you do have to go with your gut and trust someone at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not seeing why that should be you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could have approached me earlier\u2014while there were still people here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you said, your grandfather\u2019s funeral was today. And then, I wasn\u2019t sure whether you wanted to advertise the fact that you\u2019d called in...the ghost investigators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that number,\u201d she said, pulling her cell phone out of her pocket.</p><p>He rattled off the numbers and she dialed. She watched him as she spoke. \u201cMr. Jackson Crow, please.\u201d</p><p>Malachi could hear the deep murmur of Crow\u2019s voice from where he stood.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re Jackson Crow, would you by any wild chance still be at work?\u201d She was silent for a minute. \u201cI see. Then...would you be good enough to call me back on an official line?\u201d</p> <p>Jackson murmured something again. She pressed the end button on her phone and studied him while she waited for it to ring. When it did, she looked at the exchange. After she\u2019d answered, Malachi could once again hear the deep timbre of Crow\u2019s voice as he spoke to Abby Anderson.</p><p>She thanked Crow, then ended the call. She frowned slightly, but now there seemed to be a touch of wonder in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe said that once we get an initial investigation going, he\u2019ll come down himself.\u201d</p><p>Malachi nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe said you do know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Malachi laughed at that. \u201cI\u2019ve been working as a P.I. I needed to be on my own. But I was a cop, up until about four years ago in the city of New Orleans. I have a connection in the homicide department here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA connection?\u201d she asked. For the first time he heard a touch of hope in her voice. \u201cWhat kind of a connection.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that. \u201cDetective David Caswell, homicide. My ex-partner. Have you met him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a card out of his pocket and handed it to her. \u201cThat\u2019s David\u2019s card. Keep it with you. He\u2019s a great guy. He married a woman from Savannah about a year ago and moved up here. But when we were both working in New Orleans, he was my partner.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>She was still looking at him, as if he were an alien who\u2019d suddenly landed in the tavern. Or...a ghost.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cSo, I guess you\u2019re with me\u2014or on your own.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for another minute. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d she said at last. \u201cWe\u2019ll work together. I\u2019ve lived here most of my life, and I\u2019ve gone through all the real training, but you have the connections. You said you wanted to get started. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s compile the little that we do know about the victims. Then we\u2019ll figure out what we want to ask when we get in to see David. This is your city. Tomorrow I want to see where the bodies were discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue Anderson just showed you where I found my grandfather,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>He took out his notepad and pen. A number of law enforcement professionals were now using their smartphones as notebooks, but he still preferred a pen and pad. Maybe actually writing the words gave him time to think about them. \u201cOur first victim, Ruth Seymour, was a young woman who loved the city. She came to Savannah happy, excited and ready to enjoy a bit of history searching on her own before meeting her friends. She did check into her bed-and-breakfast\u2014her car was found in their parking lot. Next victim was Rupert Holloway from Iowa. It\u2019s easy to understand why no immediate connection was made with the first victim, since Rupert was a man and in the city on business. Ms. Seymour would have been searching out tourist haunts. But a mobile phone exec? I\u2019m not so sure. He was due to see business associates for lunch on the river\u2014but he never showed. Our third victim was a student in the city. Her hometown was Memphis, Tennessee. So far, we don\u2019t know where she was last seen, only that her body was discovered on the riverbank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they have in common that they were all found by the river,\u201d Abby said. \u201cPlus they were from out of town.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cyou think that my grandfather died because he knew something about the murders or the murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. You found him in the tunnel. The tunnel leads down to the river and a dock. Well, not exactly. There\u2019s landfill now, but basically, when you follow the twists and turns of the tunnel, you come out at the very edge of the Dragonslayer property\u2014about a hundred yards from the embankment and another fifty from the dock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...Gus really didn\u2019t spend his time walking around in the tunnel,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cNo. So he went down there for a reason,\u201d Malachi said. He closed his notebook. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow around ten. We\u2019ll have a talk with David and you can show me around the city, the river and the docks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He waited. He thought she\u2019d ask him where he was staying. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, lock me out, Ms. Anderson. I made sure that both grates\u2014at the entrance to the tunnel here and at the riverbank\u2014were secured and bolted.\u201d He glanced around. \u201cThere should be a better alarm system here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been fine. And don\u2019t even suggest that we\u2019d harbor a murderer here!\u201d Abby said indignantly.</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cHard to say, isn\u2019t it\u2014when you don\u2019t know who the murderer might be.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond to that but said, \u201cAllow me to show you out.\u201d</p><p>As Malachi walked to the door, she followed. \u201cThis is a big, rambling place for you to stay alone, Ms. Anderson.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cBlue\u2019s here, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019m not alone. Good night, Mr. Gordon.\u201d She closed the door and he heard her lock it. Bemused, he headed out to the parking lot for his car. He wasn\u2019t particularly good with people anymore, he realized.</p><p>But then again, that was why he\u2019d worked on his own for the past four years.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Abby said aloud when the door was closed. \u201cBlue Anderson! Why don\u2019t you speak to me?\u201d</p><p>She got no reply and the tavern was silent. Glancing at her watch, she saw that it had grown late. Well, not that late. It was only eight-thirty. Still, she\u2019d been up most of the previous night. She needed to get some sleep. Looking around one last time\u2014wary in case anything had been left unsecured\u2014she decided she should pack it in for the night and go to bed.</p><p>Jackson Crow had responded. She should\u2019ve been elated.</p><p>But...</p><p>He\u2019d sent her a rookie!</p><p>She told herself she should be grateful that she received a reply at all\u2014even if it came in the form of Malachi Gordon. The man who claimed he\u2019d spoken to Blue. Well, Crow had told her on the phone that if she and Malachi found a situation in which the Krewe could be of real assistance, he\u2019d come himself and he\u2019d bring more associates. Gordon also claimed to have an in with the police, which could help. And, if she needed someone intimidating, the man was tall and did have a strange air of authority about him. He wore his suit well; he was ruggedly attractive, which could be good with the right people.</p><p>She hoped he didn\u2019t usually walk around claiming he\u2019d just spoken with the local ghost.</p><p>Abby cleaned up the mess she\u2019d made when she\u2019d broken the liquor to create a makeshift weapon. Then she went upstairs, but rather than turning in, she walked back to Gus\u2019s office. She\u2019d started to go through his papers and invoices during the past week, but had been continually interrupted by someone needing an answer to a restaurant or bar question\u2014or people who wanted to tell her how sorry they were about Gus and then tried to make her feel better by mentioning his age and reminding her that he\u2019d led a good life.</p><p>Now she sat back behind his desk and picked up a sheaf of papers.</p><p>Invoices from liquor companies.</p><p>She looked around, feeling the silence of the tavern weigh down on her.</p><p>\u201cBlue?\u201d she said again.</p><p>But the ghost of her ancestor didn\u2019t appear.</p><p>She looked back at the papers in her hands. She saw Gus\u2019s handwriting on some of them. One note indicated that a certain flavor of vodka had not gone over well with his customers. Another said that the salesman now working for a particular company was one of the best he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>As she began to leaf through them, another paper slipped down to the desk, smaller and different from the invoices. It was a sheet ripped from a small notepad. She quickly read the words he\u2019d written, almost as if he\u2019d been thinking out loud and had scribbled them down.</p><p>The murders. Am I right? Call Abby.</p><p>Just as she read the words, she heard the loud ship\u2019s buzzer that was the tavern\u2019s doorbell.</p><p>It startled her so much that she jumped and the sheets she\u2019d been reading flew into the air, wafting back down in disarray. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Glad that she hadn\u2019t gotten into her pajamas yet, and wondering who would come by when most of the city knew the tavern had been closed in honor of Gus, she started to run down the stairs. She hesitated, ran back up to her room and opened the little dresser next to her bed, retrieving her service Glock and sliding it beneath her jacket. Then she ran down the stairs again to the front door. She looked through the ship\u2019s portal to see who was calling.</p><p>The man standing outside appeared to be about forty; he was of medium height with sandy-brown hair and was wearing a blue suit with a white shirt and a tie that had been loosened.</p><p>Cop, she thought instantly. Plainclothes cop.</p> <p>That was instinct, but she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>\u201cYes? The tavern\u2019s closed,\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cMs. Anderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, but I have a few questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBadge?\u201d she said.</p><p>He produced his credentials. His badge looked real, as did the ID he flashed with it.</p><p>Abby opened the front door. The cop seemed uncomfortable. \u201cDetective Peters, Ms. Anderson. I just remembered seeing in the papers that you were closed today for your grandfather\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here about this girl,\u201d he said, showing her a picture. \u201cHer name is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen Long,\u201d Abby said. \u201cYes, I know her. She works for a friend of my grandfather\u2019s, Dirk Johansen. He does pirate ship tours and she plays a pirate wench.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s missing,\u201d Peters said. \u201cHer roommate called it in this morning.\u201d</p><p>Abby frowned. \u201cDirk was here all day. He didn\u2019t mention that she was missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might not know yet,\u201d Peters told her. \u201cHelen Long was off today, and she was off yesterday. She had lunch here with friends. Do you remember seeing her?\u201d</p><p>Abby nodded. Like so many people, Helen had made a point of approaching her to express her condolences. She hadn\u2019t really known Gus that well. She\u2019d only worked for Dirk for about a month. Helen had grown up in Atlanta but come to Savannah to be an extra in a pirate movie, since the exterior shots were filmed in the city. She\u2019d been waiting to see if she\u2019d gotten a part in another movie about to be filmed down in New Iberia, and she\u2019d been honest with Dirk about her intentions.</p><p>\u201cI did see her. She had lunch here, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember seeing her leave?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Wait, no\u2014she was with some girlfriends and they left first. She stayed at the bar awhile longer. I don\u2019t know when she left. I went back upstairs after I talked to her,\u201d Abby explained. \u201cBut my staff and a few customers might be able to tell you more. Dirk was here himself at the time, sitting with Bootsie\u2014Bob Lanigan\u2014and Aldous Brentwood. My bartender, Jerry Sullivan, was on, as was the day manager, Macy Sterling. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be more helpful.\u201d Abby paused, wondering about something. \u201cHelen\u2019s been missing since she was seen at lunch yesterday? I thought you had to wait until an adult was gone for more than twenty-four hours before you filed a report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually,\u201d Peters agreed. \u201cBut...we\u2019ve had a few people go missing and then turn up dead. Like I said, her roommate called it in when she woke up this morning. Helen never came home last night. And she hasn\u2019t shown up today. So\u2014\u201d he cleared his throat \u201c\u2014we\u2019re starting early with this one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see. I\u2019m glad,\u201d Abby told him. \u201cShe\u2019s a sweet girl, Detective. I wish I could help you. And you should speak with my staff and my customers. They may know more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that tomorrow, thank you. And if you can think of anyone else who might\u2019ve seen her, please get in touch.\u201d He passed her a card, which she tucked into her pocket.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, good night,\u201d Peters said. He looked as if he wanted to say more. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again, \u201cbut this was the last place her girlfriends saw her, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to search these premises, you\u2019re more than welcome to do so,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to speak with your people first,\u201d Peters said. \u201cSomeone might\u2019ve seen her leave\u2014and they might\u2019ve seen who she left with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I have a list of numbers. You can call them now, if you wish. It\u2019s really not that late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Abby hurried back behind the bar and found the list Sullivan kept there of their regulars. He was a good bartender and liked to memorize their drinks. Then she moved over to the host stand to find the sheet with staff contact information, as well. Peters waited politely at the door. She gave him the pages and he thanked her.</p><p>Abby locked the door again and stood there for a moment. Where the hell was Blue?</p><p>Not making an appearance that night, it seemed. Wearily she went back upstairs, sorted out the papers that had flown everywhere and sat back down.</p><p>Helen.</p><p>She felt horrible. She knew Helen.</p><p>So far, those who\u2019d disappeared had taken a few days to be discovered.</p><p>Maybe there was still hope.</p><p>She stared down at the paper that was back in her hands, written in Gus\u2019s broad scrawl.</p><p>The murders. Am I right? Call Abby.</p><p>This time, as she reflected, she nearly jumped sky-high again when the office phone on the desk began to ring.</p><p>Once again, papers flew.</p><p>\u201cAbby!\u201d It was Dirk Johansen. She knew why he had to be calling....</p><p>\u201cHi, Dirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! My actress\u2014my pirate wench\u2014Helen. She\u2019s missing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know, Dirk. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA detective was just here. Apparently, she was last seen having lunch at the tavern.\u201d</p><p>His voice was thick. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the last time I saw her, too. I told the cops that,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cDid you see her leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. She was teasing about the pirate days with Aldous, Bootsie and me...and Sullivan. Then she looked at her watch and said she had an appointment. She didn\u2019t say who with. She just went running out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she was actually doing some online dating. She said she\u2019d met at least six guys and found one, maybe, worth a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019ll help the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she might\u2019ve taken off on some romantic spree?\u201d Dirk asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cSure, maybe,\u201d Abby lied. \u201cDirk, what\u2019s going to be important is that you think of any bit of information that might give the authorities some leads to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right...her roommate must have her computer. That should help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I bet it will.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence followed. Then Abby said, \u201cDirk, I\u2019m going to get some sleep. In the morning\u2014\u201d She hesitated, thinking about Gordon. The hell with him. He\u2019d have to play it her way. \u201cIn the morning, I\u2019ll be your personal agent. We\u2019ll find her. How about that?\u201d The local police might not be impressed with her, but Dirk might want her help.</p><p>\u201cYeah, um, well, actually, that was what I was going to ask you,\u201d Dirk said.</p><p>\u201cTo help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to be my wench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a wench for tomorrow. Helen shared the job with Chrissy Sutton, and Chrissy is in Atlanta, visiting her mom. She won\u2019t be back until late tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Great. She thought she might be wanted for her investigative skills.</p><p>Dirk wanted a wench.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. She\u2019s missing. I\u2019m terrified for her. But...I still have to keep it going, keep others working.\u201d</p><p>But maybe it wasn\u2019t a bad idea. She could talk with shipmates who knew Helen; she could hang out at the dock.</p><p>\u201cSure, Dirk. I\u2019ll be your wench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to ask you after...after Gus and all, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there, Dirk. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShip leaves for the first run at ten. We\u2019re back at one. Second run at three. Last one leaves right at sunset. I\u2019ll need you to show up at about nine for costuming and a few instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBless you, Abby.\u201d</p><p>She started to reply but he\u2019d already hung up.</p><p>Abby let her head fall on the table. Gus... She\u2019d been sick about Gus.</p><p>But two young women and a man had also died. Now Helen was gone....</p><p>She really needed help. And what she\u2019d gotten was Malachi Gordon. Maybe he did have a few talents with the dead. But whoever had taken Helen had to be alive.</p><p>Very much alive\u2014and very busy in the beautiful city of Savannah.</p><p>Dirk\u2019s Black Swan was a beautiful ship. She was a schooner with one large square-rigged mainmast; her figurehead was that of a mermaid crowned with pearls. Topside was the great helm on the forecastle and behind it was a stage of about twenty by thirty feet, surrounded by seating at the inner hull. There were barrels around, advertising rum or gunpowder, and Dirk\u2019s parrot, Achilles, sat on a little perch in the center of the stage. Toward the aft, down a few steps, was a snack shop that also offered gifts and souvenirs, and passengers could step atop the sterncastle, above the captain\u2019s quarters, to catch a great view of the riverfront.</p><p>Malachi Gordon had called Abby bright and early\u2014at 7:00 a.m.\u2014to make sure she\u2019d be ready for their planned excursion of the city and the river. She began to tell him about Helen\u2019s disappearance but he already knew. When she explained that not only was she helping out an old friend but she\u2019d get a chance to be on the pirate ship and the docks, he wasn\u2019t angry. Nor was he disappointed. He just said he\u2019d catch up with her.</p><p>Dressed in pirate gear, custom-made by a costumer to resemble the real thing rather than a contemporary Halloween fashion, Abby stood with Dirk\u2019s two main performers, Jack Winston and Blake Stewart. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything, Abby,\u201d Jack said. \u201cDirk really runs the show. Our characters serve grog\u2014to the adults\u2014and soda to the kids. It\u2019s fun, honestly. Blake and I get into a fight over you, we split up some treasure and we have a few songs. All you do is respond and react.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWell, you\u2019re a child of the Dragonslayer. You\u2019ve been a pirate before, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, mate, we\u2019re all pirates at heart, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she responded.</p> <p>He smiled again. \u201cThey\u2019ll be boarding soon. The concept is that they\u2019re all prisoners being held for a fine ransom. We\u2019re good to them because they might be worth a lot.\u201d He grimaced as he added, \u201cDirk\u2019s character is probably based on Blue Anderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cJust greet people as they come up the gangplank,\u201d he told her, turning to walk back to the dock himself; he took tickets there with Dirk.</p><p>Abby looked around. Besides the performers, there were four men and two young women dressed up to man the ship. Unpiratelike, Dirk had plenty of automatic winches to deal with his sails. She watched as they made last-minute preparations to move the ship out onto the river.</p><p>She turned to see that their third performer, Blake Stewart, was seated at one of the benches by the hull. He seemed somehow lost. She thought he was young, maybe around twenty-one, the age Dirk required for anyone serving on his ship, since a lot of his money was made on alcohol.</p> <p>Young and, yes, lost.</p><p>She sat down next to him and he gazed at her with wide brown eyes. \u201cNice of you to do this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded but he didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about Helen?\u201d</p><p>Again, he nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not like her. Did you ever meet Helen? She\u2019s very responsible. She really wants to be an actress. She told me once that work ethic is everything. If she\u2019s not here, it\u2019s because something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou really care about her.\u201d</p><p>He flushed and said, \u201cI\u2019m crazy about her. But she won\u2019t go out with me. Said it\u2019s no good to date people you work with, and besides, she doesn\u2019t expect to be here forever. So, instead, she went online.\u201d His expression was a little desperate. \u201cWho knows what kind of crazy she might\u2019ve met online?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up hope, Blake.\u201d</p><p>He changed his tone abruptly. \u201cShowtime\u2014captives aboard.\u201d He pointed to the gangplank and went straight into action, putting on his best pirate face as he greeted those boarding the ship. \u201cStep lively, step lively! Now, no trouble from you landlubbers, and there be smooth sailing ahead. Eh! And that means you, my fine lad!\u201d He stopped a boy of about ten who was getting on and reached for his ear, pulling out a \u201cpirate coin.\u201d \u201cAh, we\u2019ll be watching you! You are the treasure, lad! The ransom we\u2019ll be getting for a fine lad like you. Don\u2019t be trying to out-pirate a pirate!\u201d</p><p>The Black Swan took a maximum of fifty people per trip. Soon all had boarded and the crew rushed about to set sail. During the first twenty minutes, Abby dipped grog and soda, warned the passengers of dire consequences if they should act up and, as much as possible, talked to the crew.</p><p>Everyone, it seemed, loved Helen Long.</p><p>No one could fathom where she might have gone.</p><p>All of them feared the worst; she was just so responsible.</p> <p>When they were full out on the river, a good breeze sprang up. Dirk suddenly clanged a bell, calling attention to the show that was about to start. It began with Dirk and the parrot as he told his tale of being a poor lad, shanghaied into the ways of pirate life. He spoke to individual members of the crowd, asking questions, interacting. The parrot was perfectly trained to make wisecracks to him and he responded, bringing delighted giggles from the children aboard. Then he picked up his guitar and sang a sea shanty\u2014and as his rollicking song came to an end, his two key pirates, Jack and Blake, began a loud and boisterous argument, cutting into Dirk\u2019s territory.</p><p>\u201cI say you leave her be\u2014the wench is mine!\u201d Blake shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot so says the wench!\u201d Jack argued.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you!\u201d one of the crew whispered to Abby.</p><p>She strode forward between them. \u201cAh, cut the whining, ye scurvy lot!\u201d she told them. \u201cThis wench belongs to no man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, you do!\u201d Blake said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t belong to any man. I can sail these seas on my own!\u201d she declared.</p><p>\u201cTechnically,\u201d Jack said, addressing the crowd, \u201cwe\u2019re not sailing the seas at all. This is a river.\u201d</p><p>Abby waited for the laughter to die down. \u201cRiver, lake, ocean, sea\u2014mud puddle! I can manage it on my own. However...\u201d She walked to each man and touched his face. \u201cI don\u2019t mind bringing on a mate who can prove his prowess should we be boarded!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, fight!\u201d Jack cried.</p><p>\u201cTo the death!\u201d Blake roared back.</p><p>Dirk stepped between them. \u201cFirst touch!\u201d he commanded. \u201cJeez, it\u2019s hard to get good help these days, even for a pirate! Just first touch\u2014I need you wretched blackguards alive!\u201d</p><p>Abby watched as the two of them went into their swashbuckling duel. In the end, Jack made the first contact, and while Blake muttered and the parrot ridiculed him, he sheepishly began to ask people where they were from, and what their opinions of the fray might have been.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Blake called. \u201cThis group is from Florida. They\u2019re demanding a recount!\u201d</p><p>Dirk knew right when to let the laughter fade and step in. \u201cRecount? Recount? How can I recount? The count was one!\u201d</p><p>Abby moved around the crowd. \u201cWe have a birthday here!\u201d she called, after speaking with a wide-eyed little girl. \u201cHer name is Jade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA birthday? A birthday?\u201d Dirk shouted. \u201cWell, then!\u201d He picked up his guitar and began to strum \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d and everyone on the ship seemed to sing along.</p><p>Blake found a couple celebrating their anniversary; she ran over with more grog. Jack spoke to a young man about to head off for basic training; she rushed over with two cups of grog as they all assured him he might need both, and then applauded his service to his country.</p><p>Abby came upon a young man with wild dark hair, sunglasses and a ridiculous shirt. \u201cAnd what are you celebrating, sir? Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t really see his face\u2014not with the glasses he wore and the baseball cap that sat low on his forehead. Despite that, she could tell he had heavy dark eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cJust vacation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m from the great Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirginia!\u201d Dirk said, and broke into, \u201cCarry me back to old Virginny.\u201d</p><p>They continued with the festivities, Jack hauling out a pirate chest next and providing young and old alike with trinkets. Handing a pack of chocolate doubloons to a small child, Abby noted the Virginian had left his seat and was chatting with crew members.</p><p>Then he disappeared down the steps into the galley and snack bar below.</p><p>A passenger asked her a question about Dirk\u2019s pirate flag and she took the time to explain how pirates created their own flags. When she could, she slipped toward the steps and made a quick getaway to the deck below.</p><p>There was a counter at the far end. The price of the cruise included one glass of grog or soda and chips; hungry passengers could buy hot dogs, hamburgers, veggie burgers or salad\u2014and beer or other beverages if they weren\u2019t fond of grog. There were tables alongside a central shelf that held pirate flags, eye patches, \u201cdoubloons\u201d and other souvenirs. She glanced at the tables, which were empty. People tended to gather there while the ship moved out to the river and back, rather than during the height of the pirate festivities.</p><p>No one on either side.</p><p>Abby walked up to the man tending the snack bar and asked, \u201cHey, I just saw one of the passengers wander this way. Did you see where he went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, below, down to the magazine. Of course, we don\u2019t really carry any powder or guns down there now. It\u2019s food storage, mostly,\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cWhy would a passenger go down there?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Wiley\u2014one of the crew\u2014was talking to him. This guy owns a similar outfit up in Myrtle Beach and was fascinated to hear about Dirk\u2019s bilge pumps. They\u2019re probably down there by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Abby said. She headed to the side of the counter, where a velvet rope blocked off the stairs down to the level below. She walked into the vast magazine. It was piled high with all manner of supplies, not just food but costumes, giveaways, makeup and wigs. There were bunks against the inner hulls, as well; Dirk let his workers sleep on board when they needed a place to stay.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Abby said. No one answered. She hurried up and down the length of the magazine. The place was deserted. Searching as she went, she found the hatch to the bilge below and opened it, climbing down the little ladder that led to the lowest area of the ship, where the two sides met at the keel. The bilge was dry. She could hear the pumps working.</p><p>No one was there.</p><p>Frustrated, she returned to the action topside. She didn\u2019t see the man who\u2019d said he was from Virginia\u2014and who had then disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhere ya been, lass?\u201d Dirk roared over to her. \u201c\u2019Tis time to make certain we\u2019ll be getting the ransom from this lot of landlubbers!\u201d</p><p>He was playing a pirate captain; he was supposed to sound gruff. But she thought he was irritated with the fact that she hadn\u2019t been on deck\u2014and in sight.</p><p>\u201cCaptain, we\u2019ve gotten the ransom for all of them!\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey paid it before they got on board!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, well, then, I guess we\u2019ll be bringing them back in,\u201d Dirk said.</p><p>A little boy jumped up and cried out, \u201cNo! I want to stay on the ship and be a pirate!\u201d</p><p>Dirk was good. He walked over to the boy and pulled an eye patch from his pocket. \u201cThere you go, laddie! Now you\u2019re an honorary pirate!\u201d</p><p>The Black Swan returned to the dock. Abby kept up her act\u2014but kept looking for the man in the baseball cap, too. She didn\u2019t see him. Had he somehow disappeared off the ship? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was that what had happened to Helen?</p><p>They reached the dock, and the Black Swan was tied up at her mooring. The passengers\u2014all happy\u2014said their goodbyes. Dirk reminded Abby that they\u2019d leave again at three. He seemed to be impatient with her, but he didn\u2019t ask her where she\u2019d been. She was a gift horse, after all.</p><p>She walked down the dock and pulled out her cell phone, placing a call to Malachi Gordon. He answered after the first ring.</p> <p>\u201cHave you found out anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind you.\u201d</p><p>She turned around. She saw him on the phone.</p> <p>He was the Virginian tourist with the baseball cap and sunglasses.</p><p>4</p><p>Once again, Abby Anderson stared at him, her frown intense, her manner completely unnerved and highly irritated.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d she demanded in a harsh whisper, coming up to him.</p><p>He arched one of his heavy dark brows and felt the spirit gum on it tighten. \u201cYou said you thought it was important to be on the ship. So I thought that it was important, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to be investigating the murders\u2014seeing your friend, David Caswell, and finding out what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did see David,\u201d he told her. \u201cI met him for coffee at eight. Weird situation. He\u2019s investigating the murders, but the other detective\u2014the man you met last night\u2014has been assigned the missing-person situation. So he\u2019s asked that he be paired up with Ben Peters. All the stations and all law enforcement officers in the area have been alerted about the murders, but my friend David is the head of the task force. I learned a great deal today\u2014before boarding the ship.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem to make her happy. \u201cWhy are you in this ridiculous getup?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d met Dirk. I didn\u2019t want him to know I was on board, observing.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and started walking toward the end of the dock.</p><p>He followed her. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>She spun on him. She made a good wench, he thought. A pirate hat with little pearl strings attached sat over her forehead. She wore boots, black leggings, a long-sleeved blouse, fitted red vest and frock coat\u2014male attire, which certainly might have been chosen by a woman who found herself sailing the seas. She had long shapely legs and the boots added to her height. The color of her eyes was so rich and deep a blue that it was mesmerizing, especially when framed by the near-ebony darkness of her hair. He was surprised to feel something stir in him. But she stirred more than his senses; she seemed to touch something deeper than the simple lust that biology and nature dictated. She had passion. She seemed to breathe vitality.</p><p>\u201cDo you enjoy sneaking up on me, playing dress-up?\u201d</p><p>He cast his head to the side with a small, amused smile. \u201cI often worked undercover when I was in New Orleans and, quite frankly, I used disguises in my work as a private investigator. As a matter of fact, Jackson Crow actually mentioned that some members of his unit have found their acting talents to be of use. In a way, acting is part of human behavior. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve learned that criminals, especially psychopaths, have a tendency to act incredibly sane and rational. We need to be able to play certain parts, as well. And while you\u2019re busy commenting on me, you might take a look in a mirror. I think you\u2019re dressed up, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to make a fool of anyone,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to make a fool of you, Ms. Anderson. I was trying to take a ride on the high seas\u2014or river, as it may be\u2014and get a take on the man who owns the ship. A man you might not see with open eyes because he\u2019s been a friend for so long,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>Abby gasped. \u201cDirk? You think Dirk could be guilty of...this? Of...of anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Malachi caught her arm and walked her down the dock toward the street. \u201cMs. Anderson, as I told you, the first thing I did this morning was meet with my friend, David Caswell. And I discovered several things about the deaths. The victims had marks at their wrists that indicated they\u2019d been bound, probably with heavy rope, according to the medical examiner. They all showed signs of blunt force trauma. In other words, they were hit on the head. But in all three cases, the actual cause of death was drowning. So, Ms. Anderson, it looks as if they were held captive, knocked out\u2014and then forced into the water. Water...hmm. That could mean a ship. Look at it this way. They\u2019d been bound and\u2014metaphorically, at least\u2014forced to walk the plank. That kind of implies a \u2018pirate\u2019 might have wanted them dead, or they might have met their end off the deck of a pirate ship.\u201d</p><p>Abby stared at him. \u201cOh, no! All right\u2014maybe. But they could\u2019ve gone off a rowboat or...or an oil tanker just as easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Malachi said, \u201cthey could have. But how likely is that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve known Dirk most of my life. This is his livelihood. Why would he suddenly go insane and start killing people off his ship\u2014especially without any of us seeing a change in him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever really knows another human being,\u201d Malachi said simply.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I would\u2019ve noticed bodies popping up in my city over the years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople sometimes crack, Ms. Anderson. Strain, pressure. All the same, no one completely understands the human brain. It\u2019s the most wonderful computer in the world\u2014but just like a computer it can short-circuit. And I didn\u2019t say your friend was the killer. I merely thought it prudent to investigate. Under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you knew I was on that ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to fight you, Ms. Anderson. I\u2019m not trying to go against you. Look!\u201d he said with exasperation. \u201cI\u2019m here because you wrote to Jackson Crow. I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to stalk me, you can quit calling me Ms. Anderson. It\u2019s Abby,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off suddenly, blue eyes growing large as saucers as she stared past him.</p><p>\u201cAbby?\u201d he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. She was still staring.</p><p>\u201cHelen?\u201d she whispered, her voice thick.</p><p>Malachi spun around to see where she was pointing.</p><p>She was looking at the water, to the far side of the dock. They\u2019d done a good job in the past years, cleaning up the river, but it was impossible to stop a certain amount of natural growth and unnatural garbage from cresting the water and drifting up against the embankment.</p><p>There was sea grass or fungus, a plastic soda bottle someone had tossed away and a few cigarette butts. Oil slick covered the water right at the docks, creating little curlicues of blue and purple on the water.</p><p>And caught there, just by one of the pilings for the dock, was a body.</p><p>Facedown, it appeared to be a woman\u2014long strands of river-sodden hair fanned out from the head. And it appeared that she\u2019d just washed up.</p><p>On the slim chance that she might be alive, Malachi took his phone out of his pocket and let it fall on the deck before he dove into the river. Surfacing by the body, he quickly turned her over.</p><p>It was indeed a woman. That was all he could really tell as he looked at her face.</p><p>And she was dead. River life had already been eating at her flesh. The tip of her nose was gone and her flesh was icy cold and a grotesque shade of gray.</p><p>He looked up the five or six feet from the water to where Abby stood on the dock. She was almost as gray as the corpse.</p><p>\u201cCall 9-1-1,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Despite her pallor, she was functioning. \u201cI already did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Helen?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t begin to know,\u201d she said, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t even look...real.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, the corpse was in an ambulance bound for the morgue, crime scene techs were scouring the water and the embankment, and police divers had been dispatched to see if any evidence might remain in the water. Shaken, Dirk had canceled his afternoon and evening pirate cruises, rescheduling or refunding the money of those who\u2019d bought tickets. Abby sat with Malachi Gordon\u2014who had cast off all vestiges of a costume\u2014at a desk in police headquarters.</p><p>She liked Malachi\u2019s former partner from the get-go.</p><p>David Caswell\u2019s desk was surrounded by others. There was a fair amount of activity at the station. A hooker was arguing with her arresting officer and two other cops were trying to deal with a junkie on a bad trip.</p><p>David had arrived at the dock soon after the initial response team had cordoned off the area and plucked Malachi and the corpse from the water. About six-one, sandy-haired, green-eyed, he was serious without being somber, smart and probing without being aggressive or demanding. Abby thought he had to be in his early thirties. He spoke with a slow, smooth Southern accent that matched his steadfast but easy manner.</p><p>Maybe he didn\u2019t have to be demanding; he knew he\u2019d get a straight story from Malachi, no matter what the story\u2014and there really wasn\u2019t much of it.</p><p>\u201cYour statements are being typed up. You can sign them and get out of here for now,\u201d Caswell told them. \u201cI figure you want to attend the autopsy?\u201d he asked Malachi.</p><p>Malachi, hands clasped in front of him, nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be scheduled for later today. I\u2019ll call you when I know the exact time. Before I let you go, can we run through what happened? Ms. Anderson...\u201d He paused, looking at Abby, and smiled. \u201cOr is it Agent Anderson?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI just realized it is. Agent Anderson. I am official. But please call me Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Abby. So you were working on your friend\u2019s pirate boat because his usual actress is the young lady reported as missing. Helen Long.\u201d He studied her. It wasn\u2019t that costumes and pageantry didn\u2019t abound in Savannah. But it could also be a very conservative, old Southern city. She was hardly dressed as a respectable young local in her plumed hat, frock coat, breeches and boots.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was being his wench for today. He\u2019s very upset. Dirk is a great employer. He provides sleeping space when his people need it. He takes on part-time help so his employees can go to school if they choose. He really cares about Helen,\u201d Abby said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut...he couldn\u2019t say that the girl we found in the water was Helen, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t tell you, either,\u201d Abby added. \u201cAnd I knew her. I\u2019d met her several times,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was Helen. But I can\u2019t be sure. The body...\u201d Her voice trailed off. She had to be better about things like this; she\u2019d been through an autopsy, for God\u2019s sake. She\u2019d passed the academy with flying colors.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Malachi said, looking over at her. \u201cNo matter how long you chase the bad guys, death can still tear you up. And if you get to where it doesn\u2019t...then you need to reassess what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>\u201cSo you were working on the ship, the ship came back in to berth, you were walking down the dock and you just happened to stop and see the body,\u201d Caswell said.</p><p>\u201cI was behind her. I\u2019d called out to her,\u201d Malachi explained. \u201cIt was while we were standing there talking that Abby saw the body and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you dove in,\u201d Caswell finished.</p><p>Malachi raised his hands. \u201cWe could only see her from the top. She was facedown, but the pirate ship and some small boats had just come in, so\u2014I doubted it\u2014but...she might have been alive. Better to try than to find out you might have saved someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways,\u201d David murmured. \u201cNow...this may change things,\u201d he said, leaning toward them. \u201cThe powers that be wanted to handle the situation on their own, but now with another murder...I think they\u2019ll ask for federal help, if you want to give the right people a heads-up.\u201d</p><p>Malachi nodded in acknowledgment. \u201cAnything else you can tell us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you sign the statements, I\u2019ll give you a copy of the notes I\u2019ve compiled. Then do me a favor and get out of here. I don\u2019t want any resentment if we do go official\u2014or if we don\u2019t. You know how cops can be\u2014I don\u2019t want them to think the feds were snooping around before they were asked in. Some officers take it to mean they\u2019re being judged, that they weren\u2019t considered competent at their jobs and therefore the federal government had to step in. It\u2019s not conducive to constructive work and everyone does need to work together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat lines of investigation are you working on right now?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cSearching for Helen? We\u2019ve got her computer and we\u2019re following up on the online dating angle. That was Peters\u2019s case,\u201d he said, and hesitated. \u201cIt might be mine now. We\u2019ve gone through the cell phone records on the others, tried to figure out if there was someone they were meeting. We\u2019re retracing their steps. And we\u2019re still waiting for lab reports from Forensics, although the autopsy procedures have been completed on Ruth Seymour, Rupert Holloway and Felicia Shepherd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any suspects?\u201d Malachi asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo\u2014not a one. We have our tech guys working on tracing the men Helen Long met through the online dating service, as I said. That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t have anything solid. Ruth Seymour checked into her B and B, and no one remembers seeing her after. She was a tourist, of course, and wouldn\u2019t be known by locals, but we\u2019ve had her picture all over. Same with Rupert Holloway. He was due at a meeting at a restaurant on the riverfront. He never made it. Felicia Shepherd left her apartment, presumably to go to class. She said goodbye to her roommate\u2014and that was it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey disappeared on foot, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Felicia\u2019s car was in her parking space at the complex, Rupert Holloway\u2019s was in the garage at the hotel, Ruth Seymour\u2019s car was in the drive at the B and B.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later they left the station. They were in Malachi\u2019s car heading back toward the Dragonslayer. He drove an Explorer, and while the interior was clean, it looked as if he\u2019d driven on some rough roads.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Abby said, flipping through her files.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m getting dry clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She\u2019d forgotten that he must be sodden; he hadn\u2019t had anything other than a towel provided by one of the crime scene techs. \u201cYes, you must be miserably wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost dry but I feel like my clothes are glued to my skin. If you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll stop by my hotel. I\u2019ll only be a minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe 17hundred90 Inn and Restaurant,\u201d he replied. \u201cHey, it\u2019s supposed to be one of the most haunted in Savannah.\u201d</p><p>Abby nodded. \u201cI love the bar area and the restaurant. There\u2019s a great fireplace\u2014nice to sit around on a chilly night. The house was actually built in 1820, but that was a disastrous year for the city. A fire wiped out half of it and an epidemic of yellow fever killed whole families, so I guess someone liked 1790 better and used that year to name the place. The ghost of Anna haunts it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, who threw herself from the window when her lover deserted her,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cIn my room\u2014204. Hey, I knew I was staying down here. Might as well go for an intriguing room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Anna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d he told her. \u201cWell, other than the fact that the owners have a fantastic sense of joining in with the city fun. There\u2019s a mannequin of her in the window. I pass her every time I come in and out of the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tour guides love it when they go by,\u201d Abby agreed.</p><p>Malachi managed to find parking quickly. Abby went into the bar while he walked up to his room. As she entered, she realized that she was still in pirate attire\u2014a number of stares came her way, and before she could get far, a couple of children asked to have a picture taken with her. She complied and finally entered the bar. A friend of hers was bartending and laughed as she explained that she hadn\u2019t had time to change. She noticed that a lot of people were talking about the situation in the city in hushed voices. The media was broadcasting the fact that another body had been found by the river.</p><p>Abby ordered a cup of tea to sip while she waited. Locals frequented the bar and met visitors to the city there.</p><p>She didn\u2019t particularly want to become involved in a conversation right now and took her tea to one of the plush chairs near the fireplace, the folder with notes from David in her hand. When she looked through them, she discovered the autopsy reports on all but the newest victim. The women, she saw, had engaged in sexual activity before their deaths, but whether it had been coerced or consenting, the M.E. had not been able to determine. The bodies had been too compromised. No fluids had been recovered, so DNA matches from semen wouldn\u2019t be possible.</p><p>She frowned, reading that. If a serial killer was a rapist as well, it seemed strange that he\u2019d chosen a male victim. She leafed through the next report, and learned that the male victim, Rupert Holloway, hadn\u2019t shown any signs of sexual assault.</p><p>But if her grandfather had been a victim of the same killer, was he surprised by him in the tunnel to the point of having a heart attack? Or perhaps forced to move quickly in an attempt to escape and that had brought it on?</p><p>She looked up. Malachi had reappeared. He\u2019d evidently taken a shower because his dark hair was damp and slicked back. She noted the clean scent that emanated from him and the color of his eyes and the way he stood. And, as she\u2019d told herself before, he could certainly appear intimidating.</p><p>He was wearing jeans, a tailored shirt and a lightweight taupe jacket. She saw that he wore a shoulder holster and suspected that he was seldom without his weapon. She was without hers. Pirate wenches didn\u2019t run around with Glocks. But in the days to come, she had to remember that she was an agent, which meant having her weapon available at all times. She\u2019d asked for help that had turned out to be Malachi, and if she wanted to carry her weight, she had to behave like an agent.</p><p>He could disguise himself, too. First, he\u2019d caught her unaware from out of the shadows. Then she\u2019d spoken to him on the ship and not even known who he was!</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you might want to change? But maybe not. That pirate garb is quite fetching.\u201d</p><p>She took a last sip of her tea and rose. She was glad she was fairly tall; in the pirate boots, she didn\u2019t feel short against his height. Abby wasn\u2019t sure why that mattered. But it did, probably because she felt that she\u2019d been taken in by him a few times. Of course, maybe he really hadn\u2019t meant to make her feel like a fool. Maybe he\u2019d just accomplished the feat by accident.</p><p>\u201cI think I will give up the pirate attire for now,\u201d she said. \u201cShall we go back to the Dragonslayer?\u201d</p><p>During the short drive, Malachi asked Abby if she\u2019d seen anything in the files to draw her attention. She told him what she\u2019d read, and then realized that he must have known the cause of death\u2014and the fact that the women had engaged in sex, which was most likely not consensual. He would also know that the man had not been molested. After all, he\u2019d spent an hour with his detective friend.</p><p>\u201cMakes you wonder, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf there are two killers?\u201d Malachi asked, glancing over at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. My guess is that the murders are being done by the same person. The disposal of the bodies is what makes me think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I agree,\u201d Abby said thoughtfully. \u201cAnd cause of death\u2014drowning\u2014is the same in each case.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived at the Dragonslayer, Dirk Johansen was at the bar with Bootsie and Aldous. He\u2019d obviously had a drink to calm his nerves.</p><p>Macy met her at the door. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty upset,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut then, from what I understand, you found the body. And it might be Helen Long!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s Helen,\u201d Abby said softly. She saw that Macy was studying Malachi. \u201cHello, there. You were at the funeral, right?\u201d</p><p>Abby made the introductions. \u201cMacy, this is Malachi Gordon. Malachi, Macy Sterling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do, and yes, I was here yesterday,\u201d Malachi told her. \u201cI\u2019m a friend of a friend of Abby\u2019s at the agency.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, oh, oh!\u201d Macy said. \u201cA fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m more of a fed than he is,\u201d Abby couldn\u2019t resist pointing out. A smile of amusement glimmered on Malachi\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t say a word. She sensed that he wasn\u2019t being polite, he really didn\u2019t care if he was an agent or a detective or an investigator. He was interested in the job, not the title.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Macy said, shaking his hand. Macy liked him, Abby thought. Or, at least, admired his appearance. She had that look she wore when she found a man attractive.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Malachi said, bowing slightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going up to change,\u201d Abby announced. \u201cMalachi, come on up and you can wait in Gus\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your office now,\u201d Macy said.</p><p>\u201cIt will always be Gus\u2019s office,\u201d Abby said. Macy seemed a little stricken and Abby quickly added with a smile, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s call it Gus\u2019s and my office. How about that?\u201d</p><p>Macy smiled.</p> <p>Abby strode over to the bar. Aldous glanced at her and nodded at Dirk, who was staring down into his drink, then shook his head sadly. Abby set a hand on Dirk\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDirk?\u201d</p><p>Dirk looked up at her. \u201cThat could be Helen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could be Helen. That blond hair... Helen has blond hair that streams around her like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirk, you couldn\u2019t really tell if the hair was blond or not,\u201d Abby told him. \u201cThe woman we found was light-haired, but...I know Helen, Dirk. I don\u2019t think it was her. I wouldn\u2019t lie to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to contact her family,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police have been trying.... I have no idea what to say to them, but I\u2019ve got a reprieve. They\u2019re on safari in Kenya. It\u2019ll be another week before they can be reached. Oh, Lord\u2014I pray we find her, alive, before then.\u201d</p><p>Malachi\u2019s phone rang and he excused himself to answer it.</p><p>\u201cThis is horrible, so horrible,\u201d Dirk moaned as Abby tried to comfort him.</p> <p>Malachi came back over to them. \u201cThat was Detective Caswell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical examiner\u2019s office has the young woman cleaned up. He says she\u2019s still pretty rough to look at, but they\u2019ve gotten all the river gunk off her and he wants you to come down and see if you recognize her. I told him Abby could probably come make the same identification. He suggested you both come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change first,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Dirk\u2019s voice broke. \u201cShe worked for me. I owe her.\u201d</p><p>Aldous and Bootsie each set a hand on his shoulders. They reminded Abby of the Three Musketeers\u2014one for all, and all for one. It must be nice to have such close and steadfast friends. She didn\u2019t lack friends but a friendship like theirs, like the one they\u2019d shared with Gus, was pretty special.</p><p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d She ran up the stairs, stopping to throw the file folder of notes David Caswell had given them into the bottom drawer of Gus\u2019s desk. Something made her hide it beneath a stack of other papers.</p><p>She paused, looking around the room. \u201cBlue?\u201d She waited. \u201cGus?\u201d she said hopefully.</p><p>But she spoke to the air.</p><p>Leaving the office, she hurried to her own room to dress. She put on one of her white tailored blouses and lightweight blue pantsuits. She was going to the morgue. It felt important to dress properly.</p> <p>Malachi found a perch on the bar stool next to Bootsie. Sullivan asked if he wanted anything; he decided that if he was going to sit there commiserating with the tavern\u2019s intriguing trio of barflies, he should have a drink so he ordered a light beer.</p><p>\u201cSad business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, Dirk, this might not be Helen. Abby doesn\u2019t seem to think it is. Still, it\u2019ll be best to know for sure.\u201d</p><p>Bootsie turned to him. \u201cYeah, I guess so. I mean, you can hope the girl just went off on a whirlwind romance, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen was responsible,\u201d Dirk said. He lifted his glass. \u201cAh, Helen.\u201d</p><p>Dirk might be a little too far gone to recognize anyone, Malachi thought.</p><p>\u201cDirk, did Ms. Long have any tattoos or birthmarks? Anything that might help if her face is too...damaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamaged?\u201d Aldous repeated with a shudder.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Dirk said thoughtfully. \u201cShe, uh, did say she had a tattoo. But she never said what it was\u2014or where it was. She liked to tease her pirate cast mates aboard the Black Swan. Make them guess. They were a phenomenal group of young people to work with\u2014Helen, Jack and Blake. They got along so well.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBlake had a major crush on Helen. She liked him well enough, but said she wouldn\u2019t date anyone she worked with. Would that she had!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that it\u2019s Helen,\u201d Malachi repeated.</p><p>\u201cAnd if it\u2019s not\u2014then where is Helen?\u201d Aldous asked. He stared at Malachi and, in turn, Malachi stared at him. He was definitely unique and hard to miss, a big, powerful man with his shiny head and gold earring.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, alive and well somewhere,\u201d Malachi said. He gave Aldous a smile. \u201cSir, do you work on the pirate ship now and then? You\u2019ve certainly got the look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHereditary baldness,\u201d Aldous told him. \u201cSometimes\u2014say, around St. Patrick\u2019s Day\u2014the city gets crazy busy and then I work with my friend here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a captain, as well, though? Different kind of ship, if I remember our conversation from before,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cMy family\u2019s been in the shipping trade for generations. We were bringing goods back and forth from the Old World before the colonies became a nation. I own Brentwood Shipping. We have ships all over the world. My dad was old school. I started work as a deckhand on a nine-hundred-and-six-foot container vessel. I\u2019ve sailed on almost everything known to man, but these days, I mostly use my little fishing boat. She\u2019s a thirty-three-foot Boston whaler with a fine cabin and a galley. I can take her out for a few days on my own when I feel I need the water beneath me. But, yeah, there\u2019s fun in playing a pirate. I\u2019m still on the company board, but I already put in my time. Now, I do the world a favor and give people jobs to keep the company afloat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. We all need jobs,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? You spend a lot of time on the water?\u201d Bootsie asked.</p><p>\u201cI spent some time with friends on shrimp boats down in Louisiana,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been on a cruise\u2014does that count?\u201d</p><p>Dirk managed a smile. \u201cHardly! You\u2019ve got to have the wheel in your hands, really feel the power of the water, even on a river. Feel the wind whip around when you aren\u2019t sure you can fight your way back to the docks. Now that\u2019s being on the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear, hear!\u201d Bootsie shouted as he thumped the bar with his fist.</p><p>\u201cThen you gentlemen have it all over me,\u201d Malachi said, smiling. \u201cWhat about you, Bootsie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m living on borrowed time here. I\u2019m nearly as old as Gus! But, yeah, give me a chance and I\u2019ll be a pirate!\u201d</p><p>Just then Abby came back down the steps, out of her pirate attire. She was now in a customary business suit, the kind worn by agents running all over Quantico and D.C. But there was no way to tone down her beauty or inner vitality. It might have been her coloring\u2014or it might\u2019ve been that she had a passion for life. She had dearly loved Gus; that was plain. But she loved her city, too. She\u2019d made that clear when she\u2019d told him so enthusiastically about the inn where he was staying.</p><p>She looked at him, then looked at the beer in front of him. He\u2019d barely touched it. He raised his glass and saluted her, showing her that only a few sips were gone.</p><p>\u201cWant me to drive?\u201d she whispered, coming up beside him.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t think. You should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear\u2014two sips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d she said. \u201cDirk, let\u2019s do this, okay?\u201d</p><p>They walked outside and Malachi headed for his SUV. She was headed to the parking lot. She frowned at him, and he grinned and lifted his hands. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Amused, he followed her and Dirk to the car, choosing to take the backseat.</p><p>\u201cHey, big man, you can take the front,\u201d Dirk said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I fold well. And we\u2019re not going that far.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the coroner\u2019s office, Malachi found that David was there, waiting for them.</p><p>\u201cDr. Tierney has the case,\u201d he told them. \u201cHe wants someone to come in, rather than just viewing the remains on the screen. She\u2019s really ripped up. An identification might take some time if we have to go through dental records or DNA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Dirk? You can do this?\u201d he asked the man.</p><p>\u201cI can go in alone, Dirk,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Dirk shook his head and squared his shoulders. They were led down a hallway and into a pristine autopsy room. The smell of chemicals was strong, but as they approached the gurney, so was the smell of death.</p><p>Tierney was a man of about fifty, medium in height and weight, with brown eyes, huge spectacles that made them appear bigger and a mask over his mouth and nose.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d David said.</p><p>Tierney lifted the sheet that covered the corpse.</p><p>Malachi found himself thinking that the poor girl now resembled something that might have been created for the final scene of a horror movie\u2014a mermaid beaten and destroyed or some other creature brought low. He shivered, remembering what he\u2019d felt when he\u2019d turned her over in the water and realized that hope had been gone for some time. She\u2019d hit a propeller somewhere in the river, it seemed, since chunks of her flesh were gone. Her face had been attacked by fish and crabs. Very little remained of her nose or lips.</p><p>He wondered if even the girl\u2019s mother would recognize her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d Dirk exclaimed, and turned away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>David looked at Abby. Abby was white and pinched, but she didn\u2019t turn away. \u201cCan you tell?\u201d David asked her.</p><p>To Malachi\u2019s surprise, Abby nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not Helen,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that because...?\u201d</p> <p>She pointed to the corpse\u2019s left breast\u2014in relatively good condition. \u201cHelen had a tiny clover tattooed right there. She told a bunch of the girls about it one day, as long as we swore not to say anything to the guys she worked with. She liked to tease them, telling them she had one somewhere, but they\u2019d have to guess where, and when she had all their guesses, maybe she\u2019d tell them. And the hair...I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the shade of Helen\u2019s hair. She was almost platinum. This girl had a manicure and Helen didn\u2019t manicure her nails. She always said wenches didn\u2019t use polish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d David let out a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking for Helen. And we have to find out who this poor girl might be. I\u2019ll get them started on missing-person reports back at the office. Thank you for coming in.\u201d</p><p>Malachi didn\u2019t want to leave yet. He walked closer to the table and stared at the dead woman. What he saw now might help him later when they were further along in the investigation. \u201cDeath was by drowning?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHer lungs were filled with water from the river,\u201d Dr. Tierney said. \u201cThey\u2019ve scraped her nails, searched for trace evidence...but I don\u2019t know. She was in the river about a day and a half to two days, until she washed up near the dock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she died around the time Helen Long disappeared,\u201d Malachi said.</p> <p>Tierney glanced at David.</p><p>David shrugged. \u201cThat timing sounds about right,\u201d he said.</p><p>Malachi didn\u2019t want to act like a ghoul but he wanted to touch the body. He moved closer and leaned over her, trying to study the remains of her face. He touched her arm; she was cold and he felt no sense of her. But he noticed something he hadn\u2019t seen before. Perhaps it was a detail the medical examiner\u2019s office and the police had wanted to keep quiet.</p><p>Her hands were darkened and curled at her side but there was something odd about her left hand. Malachi raised his brows at brow at Tierney and touched the icy hand. He looked at Tierney.</p><p>Tierney returned his look with a fierce frown.</p><p>Malachi straightened. \u201cMay I see the other corpses?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Tierney swung around to face David.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of my old partners, Doc. And now Mr. Gordon is a consultant with the FBI. I would appreciate it if you\u2019d help us.\u201d</p><p>Tierney hesitated and pulled back his sleeve. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cCan I... May I get out of here?\u201d Dirk pleaded.</p><p>\u201cAbby?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>She wanted to stay and help\u2014that was clear in her eyes\u2014but it was obvious that she was the one who needed to be with Dirk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you home, Dirk,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Mr. Johansen for a coffee across the street. We\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d David offered. \u201cAbby should be here since she just graduated from the academy. She\u2019s an FBI agent now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Tierney murmured. It didn\u2019t sound as if he was impressed. Malachi made a point of grinning at her. Learn to live with it, he told her silently.</p><p>Whether she understood his message or not, she handled it. \u201cThank you. I believe it\u2019s important that we see all the victims.\u201d</p><p>David left with Dirk.</p><p>When they were gone, Malachi spoke to Tierney. \u201cShe\u2019s missing her ring finger. It wasn\u2019t gnawed off, it was cut off,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not letting that information out,\u201d Tierney said curtly.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Malachi nodded. \u201cIs it the same with the other corpses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tierney walked over to a wall with numbered sliding doors and placards in little slots. He went straight to drawer nine. A handwritten name tag read Ruth Seymour.</p><p>He pulled the drawer back and gently removed the sheet from her face.</p><p>Ruth had fared better than the unknown girl they\u2019d just seen. Most of her face was intact. Malachi saw the mark of some kind of bondage that had been described in the autopsy notes. He also saw that the ring finger on her left hand had been severed at the knuckle.</p><p>\u201cHead injury is here,\u201d Tierney told him, pointing.</p><p>She\u2019d been struck on the back of the skull\u2014one solid blow.</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve knocked her out?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably came close to fracturing the skull, so, yes, likely she would\u2019ve been knocked out. But if you look at the wound closely, you can see there\u2019s healing. So she regained consciousness again\u2014a day, a few days?\u2014before she was killed,\u201d Tierney explained.</p><p>That made something cold curl up inside his gut. Dead was dead\u2014but he wondered what torture she\u2019d gone through before death.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rupert Holloway?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat was different. As far as I can tell, Holloway was knocked out and killed soon after. Maybe a few hours later, somewhere in that time frame, at any rate. Both young women were kept alive longer. I assume you\u2019ve read the reports. Although I can\u2019t state it definitively, I believe both were sexually molested, and killed later. I don\u2019t think they were in any condition to fight off the rapist. They were probably knocked out and held until they annoyed their attacker\u2014or he tired of them. Ms. Shepherd was the last victim found before today. She\u2019s right here.\u201d</p><p>She could have been anyone. \u201cHow did you ID her?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cFingerprints. They were on file at her school. It\u2019s a safety measure taken there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s missing the ring finger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Malachi looked at Abby. She was stoic, watching, listening, betraying sorrow but allowing little else to show on her face.</p><p>Tierney went over the young woman\u2019s injuries.</p><p>Malachi moved closer to inspect the corpse again, touching the body. And again, he had no sense of anyone remaining.</p><p>\u201cMr. Rupert Holloway is the last of our recent victims. You don\u2019t want to visit the entire morgue, do you?\u201d Tierney obviously wanted to be on his way.</p><p>\u201cJust these victims,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cMr. Holloway, please.\u201d</p><p>Rupert Holloway was in nearly the same shape as their Jane Doe, and his head wound was worse; the skull had been fractured. \u201cHe might still have been out cold when he was tossed in the river,\u201d Tierney said.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s missing his ring finger, as well.\u201d</p><p>Tierney looked uncomfortable. \u201cYes. Taken while he was still alive\u2014as with the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other marks on him?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cJust one. On his back. Help me roll him and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>He obliged; Rupert Holloway had been a big man.</p><p>Low on his back there was a wound, which was sharp and broad.</p><p>\u201cNot serrated,\u201d Abby commented.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was made by a smooth blade,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cNow, if that\u2019s all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all, Dr. Tierney. Thank you so much for your time.\u201d</p><p>He led Abby out. They removed the scrubs they\u2019d donned and left them in the appropriate receptacles.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a serial killer,\u201d Abby said. She shuddered and looked at him apologetically. She was ashen, although she\u2019d held up well. \u201cWhy...why the fingers? Is there a significance to the ring finger? Are they trophies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. And I can\u2019t begin to fathom if there\u2019s a symbolic reason of some kind for the ring finger. Does it have anything to do with wedding or engagement rings? Holloway was married, but the others...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d As he spoke, he watched something come alive in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cI mean, there is a symbolic reason for the ring finger. Pirates used to cut off the ring fingers of their hostages specifically to steal their rings. Blackbeard supposedly cut off his own ring finger as a warning to others to leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it is symbolic,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I believe that has to be it. But still, the killing of Rupert Holloway was different from the others. The injury on his back is completely unlike the injuries on the women. What do you think the blade was?\u201d Abby asked. \u201cAnd why that mark left there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the small of his back?\u201d Malachi mused thoughtfully. \u201cA pirate sword, Agent Anderson. I\u2019m willing to bet that wound was made by a sword.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Helen. It\u2019s not Helen,\u201d Dirk repeated. He\u2019d said the words dozens of times during the drive back to the Dragonslayer.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dirk, it\u2019s not Helen,\u201d Abby assured him.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Did you see her face?\u201d</p><p>They reached the parking lot and Abby put the car in Park. Malachi was out of the backseat, opening the door for Dirk. When Dirk stood in front of him, he steadied the man with a hand at his elbow. \u201cNot Helen, Dirk. So if you can think of anything at all that might help us find her, it could save her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s doing that to her\u2014to Helen\u2014right now?\u201d Dirk asked.</p><p>\u201cDirk, the poor girl looks so bad because of what the creatures in the river did to her. Helen could be alive. She\u2019s a bright girl, and if anyone can manage to stay alive, she can. I\u2019ll tell you what might help. You let the police do a thorough search of the Black Swan,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cA search?\u201d Dirk asked blankly.</p><p>By then, Abby had come around the car. \u201cIf they search the Black Swan, Dirk, they might find something Helen left on the ship. A note, a scrap of paper, a card\u2014something.\u201d</p><p>She watched Dirk carefully\u2014although she couldn\u2019t believe anything evil of him, not in a thousand years.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cIf it\u2019ll help, hell, yeah, search the ship.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malachi might have been surprised by Dirk\u2019s easy agreement; if he was, he didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Dirk, thank you. I\u2019m going to call my buddy David back and ask him to get a team in there, okay? You\u2019ll have to give David official permission.\u201d</p><p>Dirk nodded. \u201cAnything that\u2019ll help,\u201d he said. He looked back at Abby. \u201cIt will help, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCall him. That detective. Tell him I\u2019ll sign anything he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Dirk left the two of them, striding for the bar. He stopped and turned back. \u201cYou two just saw all that and don\u2019t need a drink?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d Abby said.</p> <p>She looked at Malachi. \u201cHonestly, it can\u2019t be Dirk. You figure someone\u2019s kidnapping people, taking them on a pirate ship. With the women, he\u2019s making them behave like captives\u2014forcing them to have sex as if they\u2019d been seized by pirates. And because he has a pirate ship, you\u2019re thinking Dirk.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAbby, yes, obviously, I\u2019m thinking Dirk. Helen worked for him, Helen is gone. And he runs a pirate ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf someone is going to search the Black Swan, shouldn\u2019t it be us?\u201d Abby asked him.</p><p>\u201cGet permission from your friend,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Abby whirled around and ran, catching up with Dirk just before he got to the door. He seemed perplexed but told her she was welcome on the ship anytime, any day. He handed her his keys; the gate down at the dock where the Black Swan berthed would be locked.</p><p>She ran back to Malachi. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d She dashed by him.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d he called after her.</p><p>\u201cFaster to walk than to find a parking place on the river. Come on!\u201d</p><p>It was only a matter of blocks to the marina. Abby used the key Dirk had given her to open the gate. She waited for Malachi, and tried not to remember how she\u2019d seen the body here earlier. There was no crime scene tape; it wouldn\u2019t have served much purpose. She assumed the techs had looked for anything they possibly could, considering that the body had floated in the river for a day or two.</p><p>Malachi entered behind her. \u201cRelock it,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She did. They hurried on down the dock. Malachi passed by her and jumped onto the deck of the Black Swan. The little gangplank that tourists used to board was on the ship, taken up at night to discourage anyone who might make it onto the dock.</p><p>Malachi stretched out his hand. She hesitated only briefly and accepted it to join him on board the ship.</p><p>Dock lights lit up the main part of the forecastle and performance area. Abby hurried on to the restaurant area and the restrooms. Employee lockers were in an anteroom. She turned on lights as she went in and heard Malachi behind her, searching the snack stand and environs.</p><p>She found Helen\u2019s locker, which was open. But on inspection of its contents yielded nothing except for a sweater, a makeup bag, a brush and Helen\u2019s costume.</p> <p>Frustrated, Abby closed the locker.</p><p>The others were open and she decided to search them, as well. She felt awkward\u2014as if she were sticking her nose where she really had no right\u2014but Blake Stewart and Jack Winston worked with Helen. They were friends, and Blake had been in love with Helen. It had to be done.</p><p>But their lockers yielded nothing, either. There was a small costume and prop area next to them. She went through the swords and guns used by the players, touching each one. None was real. The blades were plastic, although they\u2019d been artfully created to appear real.</p><p>She left the lockers, disappointed, and discovered that Malachi was no longer in the snack shop.</p><p>\u201cMalachi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown in the magazine!\u201d he called to her.</p><p>She hurried to the below deck and found him by one of the hammocks against the inner hull, placed there for the use of the cast and crew.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He handed her a folded pamphlet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tour map,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, this particular map is printed and put out by a friend of mine. You might have met him at the Dragonslayer yesterday. I went to high school with him\u2014he was a major player in our drama department and a huge history buff. He does ghost tours here in the city and they\u2019re supposed to be some of the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger English,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cYes. You did meet him, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. His name is on the map. It\u2019s advertising for his tours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think Helen might have had it? The map, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI do. Because this looks like a woman\u2019s handwriting\u2014small, neat, lots of curlicues. I know there\u2019s a young woman working on the crew, but the probability that it\u2019s Helen\u2019s is high. And she\u2019s marked something. Here.\u201d He pointed at a location on the map.</p><p>\u201cLet me see it, please.\u201d</p><p>Abby took the map from him. It had real streets and real places, but they were sketched out cartoon-style. There was a checkmark on the map and in the border was written, \u201cMeet here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Abby shook her head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t any particular place, but there\u2019s an old church nearby. It was deconsecrated years ago and was a restaurant and nightclub for a while. Right now, it\u2019s just empty. A private restoration group bought it about a year ago, but they haven\u2019t started working on it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut you thought people were being snatched on the river,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cI do believe the victims are being taken out to the river. But...we have nothing that tells us where they\u2019re being taken from. They\u2019re dying on it, yes\u2014but how are they getting there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRupert Holloway was supposed to be meeting friends right here at the riverfront,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes, but no one saw him here. Or, even if he was taken down here, it doesn\u2019t mean the women were kidnapped on the river. Can we go there? You know this part of the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we can go there. But that precise area is just the sidewalk,\u201d Abby said. \u201cExcept that...well, I could talk to Roger. He knows Savannah even better than I do. Maybe he can see something that I\u2019m not seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more about Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, he\u2019s a friend from high school. I\u2019m positive he\u2019s not a suspect. If he were going to kill anyone, it would be over a prime role in a pirate movie or in an argument on the history of Savannah. Roger, well, I\u2019ve known him all my life. And I can\u2019t see him taking any...any physical trophies. He passed out at school when we were donating blood during an emergency blood drive.\u201d</p><p>Malachi\u2019s phone rang, and he answered it. \u201cDavid,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he went on, \u201cwe\u2019re down in the magazine. Coming up. We\u2019ll leave it to your fine crew now, my friend.\u201d He ended the call.</p><p>\u201cInvestigators are here. They can finish. I think we might have found something useful. He folded the map and put it in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to give it to the cops?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell David the location, and he can send a car to check it out. I say we leave the rest of this to the experts and head back. I might have a surprise for you,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not really in the mood for surprises. I have had the longest two days in history.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly. Abby realized she was getting to like that smile; she was even coming to understand his strange ways. He could be unerringly polite, especially when someone else was acting like an idiot, and manage to get what he needed. He gave information out, but held on to what he felt he needed. Close to him, alone down in the magazine, she was aware of how attractive he was. Old-fashioned courtesy, combined with rugged masculinity, would make him appealing to most women.</p><p>Maybe she was one of them.</p><p>She stepped back. She tried to remind herself that he\u2019d made a fool of her a few times, and yet...he\u2019d seemed so puzzled that she\u2019d felt that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to David as we leave. Let\u2019s get back to the Dragonslayer.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s after nine now. I\u2019m ready for that drink Dirk suggested. And I won\u2019t be driving to my hotel. I can easily walk, but I won\u2019t have to. I\u2019m sure I can catch a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi!\u201d</p><p>They heard his name shouted. He stepped past her and hurried up to the deck. As she followed him, he turned back for her, helping her make the hop-over to the dock. David was at the gate with a five-man crew of investigators, and they walked down to meet him, opening the gate to allow them all entrance before handing him the key.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cNo blood or guts,\u201d Malachi said, waiting until David\u2019s team went by.</p><p>When they had, he said, \u201cWe found a map. May or may not have been Helen\u2019s.\u201d He produced it and showed David. \u201cYou might want a man or two to check out the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the middle of a sidewalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Abby told me. But it is marked on the map,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cOkay if I hang on to this?\u201d When David nodded, he folded it, returning it to his pocket.</p><p>\u201cThere may be something in the area\u2014a restaurant, someplace Helen might\u2019ve gone to meet someone,\u201d Abby explained. \u201cAnd, actually, it could have been anyone\u2019s map, but since we\u2019re grasping at straws here...\u201d</p><p>She let her voice fade. David shook his head, lowering it. \u201cYeah. We are grasping at straws, but we need to grasp quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I suggested searching the Black Swan\u2014tonight,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cBut then you beat me to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t got the forensic talents to find what your crew might,\u201d Malachi told him. \u201cWe just did a run-through. After all, we already spent hours on the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I\u2019m reconsidering the map. How about handing it over?\u201d David asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malachi smiled serenely. \u201cWhat map?

So, X marks the spot. I\u2019ll send a car tonight. And they\u2019ll call me and say that I sent them to stare at the middle of a sidewalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But it\u2019s worth a shot, right? Call me if there\u2019s anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will,\u201d David said. \u201cAnd you do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the Dragonslayer, Abby,\u201d Malachi suggested. \u201cLet the detective get on with his work.\u201d</p><p>As they headed to the tavern, David called after him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget. Call if you discover anything!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know it,\u201d Malachi called back.</p><p>He kept walking; he had long strides, but Abby kept up with him. \u201cAre you running for that drink you said you need?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, sorry. I was just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should call your friend. The tour-guide-slash-mapmaker, Roger English. It\u2019s his map Helen had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can pick up that map at any souvenir store in the city.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s his map. We\u2019ll have him show us around the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the city!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t know it like he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she agreed. \u201cRoger\u2019s always been a fanatic, obsessed with the city.\u201d She smiled. \u201cGus occasionally let him stay at the Dragonslayer, just because he loved it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but I might not need to. He hangs around the Dragonslayer after his tours sometimes. They end around nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Malachi opened the door to the tavern for her. Once they\u2019d stepped inside, he walked up to Grant Green, on duty at the host stand as night manager. Trying to keep an eye on him, Abby went to the bar where Dirk was, as usual, seated between his two old friends, Bootsie and Aldous.</p> <p>\u201cAnything?\u201d he asked her anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNot that we could find, Dirk, but the police are there now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I told Detective Caswell that I was happy for him to search,\u201d Dirk said.</p><p>\u201cI keep telling him we\u2019re going to find her.\u201d Bootsie yawned. \u201cHate to leave you, my friend, but I am old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Dirk told him.</p><p>\u201cI can stay a bit longer,\u201d Aldous said. \u201cHell, twenty years ago, I could\u2019ve sat up all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, you have another drink with him, Aldous. I need to get some sleep. Good night, all.\u201d Bootsie left, his peg leg making a little thump with every other step.</p><p>Dirk should have been bleary-eyed, considering the amount of time he\u2019d spent in the bar that day, but he seemed to be all right. Abby cast a glance at Sullivan and raised her brows. Sullivan inclined his head with a secretive smile; that was his way of telling her that he\u2019d promised Dirk the Dragonslayer would be picking up his drinks that day\u2014and then Sullivan had watered them down to keep Dirk from keeling off his bar stool.</p><p>She smiled her thanks, then patted Aldous and Dirk on the back. \u201cTake it easy, you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay. We\u2019ll stumble home together soon,\u201d Aldous assured her.</p><p>She nodded. Aldous sipped his drinks slowly and looked after his friends. He and Dirk both lived nearby, a few blocks from the Dragonslayer.</p><p>She turned, but Malachi was no longer there. Grant Green was giving directions to a couple who wanted to see the Colonial Park Cemetery, in the heart of the old town. They wanted to visit it the following day. She smiled and thanked them for coming to the Dragonslayer as they left, then asked Grant, \u201cWhere did Malachi go?\u201d</p><p>Grant pointed to the dining room, where a group sat at one of the large round tables near the grate to the tunnel and the image of Blue Anderson. Malachi had taken a seat with them. There was an empty chair beside him.</p><p>As if he sensed her watching him, Malachi rose and beckoned her over.</p><p>She approached the table. All four of the people there\u2014two men and two women\u2014stood, too. The women were blonde, one petite and one tall. The men were both dark-haired, slim, handsome. They looked like a who\u2019s who of beautiful people.</p><p>Malachi smiled broadly as she reached the group. \u201cI told you I had a surprise for you. One I thought you\u2019d like. And these lovely people are it. The blonde across from you is Katya Sokolov. To your left is Angela Hawkins. Next to her, we have our illusionist and magician extraordinaire, Will Chan, and here, by me, Jackson Crow.\u201d</p><p>She was startled and told herself she should have recognized him from the pictures she\u2019d seen of him, and now, of course, she did. Crow.</p><p>A surprise.</p><p>And she was surprised. Jackson Crow himself, now a legend in the agency, had arrived.</p><p>He was a striking man with his evident mixture of heritage. She shook his hand, and then met Angela, Will and Kat. She sat down in the chair held for her between Malachi and Jackson Crow, and the others sat, as well.</p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d she said, staring at Jackson Crow. She\u2019d never met him. She just knew his name, had seen his picture. Everyone at Quantico knew who he was. They whispered about him, sometimes in a teasing fashion, and sometimes with awe. Either way, his record spoke for itself.</p><p>\u201cMalachi said this is a situation that warrants some extra help,\u201d Crow told her. \u201cI figured we\u2019d put Will to work with the pirates, since he\u2019s an excellent actor and magician. Kat is a pathologist. She\u2019ll see if anything\u2019s missing as far as the autopsies are concerned. Angela and I will work the computer angles and interview those who were last seen with the victims, leaving you and Malachi free to delve into the city. You\u2019re the expert on Savannah. I\u2019ve got a meeting first thing tomorrow with Detective Caswell and the task force to give them some idea of what we think we\u2019re looking at\u2014and who we might be looking for. And then we\u2019ll all buckle down to try to locate the missing girl.\u201d</p><p>Abby nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad. So glad. Her life has got to be the priority right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Angela spoke quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful that you came in force!\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cAgent Anderson, there have been a number of bodies found. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t think that warranted serious attention,\u201d Jackson Crow told her.</p><p>\u201cBut do you believe what I was trying to explain\u2014that my grandfather was murdered?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>Crow nodded. \u201cWith the message he sent you, and his death right before your arrival? Yes, I do. Something is going on here. We\u2019ll do everything in our power to find out what. And I don\u2019t expect our hands to be tied. Two of the victims were from other states, which gives us jurisdiction\u2014although I hate to step in uninvited. But because Malachi has a good relationship with the detective in charge, I believe an invite is in the works.\u201d</p><p>Across the table, Angela Hawkins leaned in. \u201cThe Dragonslayer is incredible. What a wonderful place\u2014and what a fascinating history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food is excellent, too,\u201d Kat Sokolov added.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve enjoyed it,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cWe have,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cFor now, however, we\u2019re going to get the check. There\u2019s a girl out there\u2014and she might still be alive. Everyone will be starting early.\u201d He glanced around, as if looking for the waitress.</p><p>Abby shook her head. \u201cDinner is on the house,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cThis is your business, Agent Anderson. We don\u2019t take advantage,\u201d Jackson Crow told her.</p><p>\u201cPlease! You\u2019ve come here. Let me offer what I can. Which, by the way, is a house,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe do have rooms booked,\u201d Jackson responded. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson,\u201d Will said. \u201cIt might be wise to accept. We\u2019ll have space and privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can cancel your hotel rooms,\u201d Abby urged.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to put you out. We only need two rooms\u2014except that I thought we should assign someone here, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been staying at the Dragonslayer since I came back,\u201d Abby said. \u201cAnd not to worry. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve spent time here all my life. But I also have a home\u2014a family home\u2014on Chippewa Square.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt happens to be available. And there\u2019s no reason to incur taxpayer expenses that don\u2019t need to be incurred.\u201d Abby realized that Malachi had remained quiet; he\u2019d been watching her all the while. He didn\u2019t appear angry, just bemused.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t take chances,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cMalachi, do you want to stay here? I\u2019m sure Agent Anderson has a couch somewhere. And, if you really don\u2019t mind, Agent Anderson, we will take you up on your offer. We do, as a group and as individuals, tend to prefer the historic and the private\u2014places with plenty of room to meet, without probing eyes. Detective Caswell will set us up with a room at the police station, but we still like having some private space\u2014when we can get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine on a couch. Or a floor,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are sure you want to offer this invitation?\u201d Crow asked Abby.</p><p>They were leaving Malachi here?</p><p>Maybe that made sense. Malachi had already seen Blue. And she hadn\u2019t seen him since he\u2019d led her to her grandfather\u2019s corpse.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, of course.\u201d Abby turned to look at Malachi. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sleep on a floor or a couch,\u201d she told him. \u201cI can give you my grandfather\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat certainly sounds more comfortable,\u201d Malachi said. He still appeared a bit bemused. Of course he did. Now that Jackson Crow had arrived, she was all hospitality. \u201cI\u2019ve been staying a few blocks away at a hotel on the riverfront, so moving over will take ten minutes.\u201d He spoke softly to Jackson. \u201cWe have a lead. At least, I think it\u2019s a lead. We found a map with an X. Abby has a friend who\u2019s a city expert, and we\u2019re meeting up with him in the morning to see what we can find.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be speaking with the task force,\u201d Jackson Crow said, \u201cand we\u2019ll compare notes later.\u201d</p><p>Abby got a piece of paper and wrote down the address of her house on the square. \u201cThere are a few things there\u2014coffee in the freezer, dry creamer, but not much else. I went over one day last week, checking up on the place, and everything\u2019s in order.\u201d She hesitated, looking at the group. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019d rent it out again when I leave here to get my assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rest of your family is gone?\u201d Angela asked her.</p> <p>Abby nodded. \u201cYes, it was Gus and me for a while there,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Angela didn\u2019t add that her grandfather had been old, and Abby was glad of it.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Jackson said, rising. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to your house now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t stayed at the house in years, and it\u2019s been empty for a while. Oh, it won\u2019t be terrible\u2014no moldy sheets or anything like that. They\u2019re in the hall closet in sealed bags. I can come with you, to get you in, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cYou need to see if your tour-guide buddy is here.\u201d</p> <p>Abby retrieved her house keys and handed them to Jackson.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you both tomorrow. In the meantime, we\u2019ll keep in contact on our cell phones,\u201d he instructed. \u201cAnd, like I said, we\u2019re careful in this unit. That\u2019s why we check out a situation, and then work in numbers when warranted. We\u2019ll say good-night now.\u201d Jackson Crow left a tip on the table. Abby started to dispute, to assure him she\u2019d handle it.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, the least we can do is reward our excellent server,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Abby nodded, and the group walked to the door. Malachi told her he\u2019d pick up his bags at the hotel while the restaurant was still in full swing.</p><p>When they were gone, she realized that Grant Green was standing right at her back. \u201cOkay, give!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA cool-looking, authoritative...mysterious group of people! So, who are they?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see any reason to lie to him. \u201cFBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d he said. \u201cI knew it.\u201d Then he grew serious. \u201cSo they\u2019re here to help? Thank God. I mean, bodies don\u2019t usually pop up like that in this city. We have our criminal element, but who doesn\u2019t? I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve\u2014 Oh, man, is it true? Do cops and FBI agents really not get along? Do the cops get resentful when the FBI is called in?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cGrant, I have no idea. I\u2019ve never been with a group that\u2019s been called in. Actually, I haven\u2019t been with a group at all. I was ready to be given an assignment...but then, well, Gus. And my superior back in Virginia told me to check in when I\u2019d taken care of my family affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted!\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised. \u201cHey, Roger doesn\u2019t happen to be in here, huh? I don\u2019t see him at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s here.\u201d Grant lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s with a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date? Impressive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the far dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I interrupt?\u201d Abby wondered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your place. You can just wander by and ask if everything\u2019s all right. By the way, are you having the actors do the reenactment this Saturday? I\u2019ll need to call them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant, you and Macy manage the place,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cYou decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill have to know the new owner\u2019s mind,\u201d Grant told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an absentee owner, and I think you two do a great job managing the place.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a hug. \u201cMacy and I get along well, and we\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re never disappointed.\u201d She hugged him back, and then disentangled herself. \u201cI\u2019m going to swing over and say hello to Roger.\u201d</p><p>Roger was in a little nook in the far dining room. He was leaning over the table, close to his date, a pretty girl with dark brown hair and a sweet gamine face.</p><p>The girl saw Abby first and indicated to Roger that someone was coming. He pulled back, said, \u201cHi, Abby,\u201d and started to get up.</p><p>\u201cSit, Roger, I\u2019m just stopping by to see how everything\u2019s going,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFabulous.\u201d He widened his eyes at her. \u201cAbby Anderson, this is Bianca Salzburg. Bianca, Abby, who owns this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you. And it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Bianca said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m glad to hear that. Do you two need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You hire the best. Which includes me,\u201d he told his date. \u201cYou\u2019ll see when I play Blue Anderson on Saturday.\u201d He looked at Abby. \u201cAm I playing Blue on Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cGrant will confirm with you. Oh, I wanted to ask you something, too. I have a friend in town\u2014well, friends. One of the guys wants a tour of Savannah from someone who really knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that would be you,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know it the way you do. Can I book a private tour tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you?\u201d he asked, perplexed, curious\u2014and, she thought, a little flattered.</p><p>\u201cYes, for me. And the friend I mentioned. You might\u2019ve met him, since he\u2019s been hanging around here. His name is Malachi Gordon. I\u2019ll tell you more tomorrow. If you can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Anything for you, kid. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d He smiled and glanced at his date. \u201cAbby and I used to love exploring places\u2014especially places we weren\u2019t really supposed to go. Gus dragged us out of that tunnel time and time again. We liked to play pirate. Except Abby never wanted to play captive\u2014she always had to be a pirate herself. Like Anne Bonney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That was a lot of years ago!\u201d Abby said. \u201cSo tomorrow. Nine. Ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen works better for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Abby nodded. \u201cBianca, it was very nice to meet you. You\u2019re new to the area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to find an apartment. I work for a delivery company, and I\u2019m being transferred from Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, welcome to Savannah.\u201d Abby made her way back to the bar. Grant was going over the following day\u2019s reservations at the host stand. Aldous and Dirk were gone. \u201cAldous left with Dirk, didn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they were kind of cute as they went out, big pirate-kind-of-guy leaning on bald, gold-earringed guy. Don\u2019t worry, Aldous said he\u2019d walk Dirk straight to his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Grant.\u201d Abby went to the bar and took a seat. There were no more customers and Sullivan was sterilizing the bar glasses, then hanging them on the wooden racks.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve brought in a bunch of FBI agents?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, she frowned at him.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou told Grant. That\u2019s like posting something on Facebook. And the one guy, Malachi Gordon, introduced himself to us the other day.\u201d</p><p>Abby laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly bring in a bunch of FBI. Malachi Gordon showed up because of Gus\u2019s funeral,\u201d she said. That was true. Let them think he was a representative of the agency, there to show his respects. \u201cBut, Sullivan, four bodies have been found\u2014three, and then the one today. At least two of the victims were from other states. One was a college girl. And we don\u2019t know about the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really sad, Abby. What do you think is going on? What did they teach you at FBI school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have the same suspicions now whether I\u2019d gone to the academy or not,\u201d Abby said. She wasn\u2019t giving anything away by stating the obvious. \u201cI suspect there\u2019s a serial killer in Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He stopped what he was doing and rested his elbows on the bar. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, though. Three women, one man. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went crazy when you found him,\u201d he said gently. \u201cIf there\u2019s a serial killer, why would he go after Gus\u2014and how did he get into the tunnel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, Sullivan. Maybe I was a little crazy. Gus was everything to me,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>One thing she\u2019d learned: an agent shouldn\u2019t share thoughts or information with anyone other than those also working the case, unless someone was at risk. Information in the wrong hands could be dangerous.</p><p>Not that she considered Sullivan a suspect. It would\u2019ve been impossible for the man to slink through the restaurant, since he was always behind the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Abby. You know we all loved him,\u201d he was saying.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I do know that.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek, a brotherly gesture. \u201cBe careful, okay?\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>\u201cI am careful. And guess what? I excelled in marksmanship. I\u2019ll be fine. Thanks, Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>He backed away, looking toward the door. \u201cHmm. Your FBI man is back\u2014with a suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s going to be staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Sullivan said. A smile twitched his lips.</p><p>\u201cNo oh,\u201d she told him. \u201cHelen Long was last seen here, and we\u2019re near the river, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a shame,\u201d Sullivan teased. \u201cThat it\u2019s just business, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSullivan,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cTall, dark and handsome. Has a nice aura about him, full of confidence. You could do a hell of a lot worse, you know. Hmm. You have done worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sayin\u2019. You always dated pretty boys. Not up to par. And from what I\u2019ve seen in the past few years, you date someone for a few months, then you\u2019re bored.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! I\u2019ve been focused on my career, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Malachi was coming to join her at the bar. She frowned fiercely at Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, just jump his bones. Everybody\u2019s life is better with some hot sex in it,\u201d Sullivan told her.</p> <p>\u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>He made a show of buttoning his lips. Malachi slid his suitcase up beside his bar stool. \u201cI\u2019m...back,\u201d he said a little lamely. \u201cEverything okay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight as rain,\u201d Sullivan said before she could respond.</p><p>\u201cCome on up. I\u2019ll show you Gus\u2019s room.\u201d Abby smiled sweetly at her bartender.</p><p>\u201cYep, and don\u2019t worry about anything,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cGrant and I will see that the place is locked up tight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Malachi smiled at Sullivan, got his bag and followed her up the stairs. She flicked on the light as she opened the door to the apartment. \u201cI talked to Roger English. We\u2019re all set to meet him in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Malachi said absently. He stepped into the apartment and glanced around. \u201cNice.\u201d He walked in, noted the little coffee nook and moved into the center of the living room area. He went straight to the balcony. \u201cDo you mind if I look out?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and stepped onto the balcony. Leaning, he looked to the left. She followed him.</p><p>\u201cSo you grew up here?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cHere, and at our family\u2019s house on Chippewa Square,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen my parents died\u2014my mom and then my dad\u2014I spent my time here with Gus. And my grandmother, of course, when she was still with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to lose family,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>A moment later, he gave his attention to the view. \u201cYou can see the river from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Abby agreed. \u201cOf course, if they build up anymore, it\u2019ll block the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd made sense for old pirates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe new pirates?\u201d</p><p>He turned and looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re worried that this place is somehow being used. But because a woman was last seen here doesn\u2019t mean the Dragonslayer has anything to do with what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Gus?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He was thoughtful for a minute and then said, \u201cKat will go over the M.E.\u2019s records for Gus. I believe he did die of a heart attack\u2014but the heart attack might have been brought on when he accosted someone or vice versa. Whatever happened, it won\u2019t happen again. With your blessing, Will Chan will set up a camera system in the tunnel. No one will get down there by any means without being seen. Does that make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cHow did you wind up on this case? You said you\u2019re not an agent, that you\u2019re a consultant.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI was recently part of a high-profile case in Virginia. Then Jackson Crow, Logan Raintree and a man named Adam Harrison\u2014you probably know he started the whole Krewe of Hunters branch\u2014came to see me. I told you, this is on a trial basis. And...\u201d He paused, lowering his head, smiling slightly. \u201cI\u2019d been working alone since I left New Orleans because I got tired telling fellow workers that I\u2019m not a psychic. Most people want to lock you away when you tell them you came up with some of your deductive reasoning because of a ghost\u2014and therefore you don\u2019t tell them. Jackson apparently knew what I was doing because he\u2019d studied the work I\u2019d done. After I got to spend time with him, Logan and the other agents, I felt right at home. As if I\u2019d found my people, so to speak. Jackson sent me down here to see what\u2019s going on, and I let him know what I\u2019ve learned. They work in groups, which is why the others have joined us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you leave New Orleans because you lost your partner\u2014David Caswell?\u201d</p><p>He looked back out at the night.</p><p>\u201cNo. I left New Orleans when my wife died. It was her home and I always saw it through her eyes. When she was gone, I couldn\u2019t stay anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cIt was a long time ago now. We all lose people, and we learn to go on. That\u2019s life\u2014and death. So, show me Gus\u2019s room. I\u2019ll get that bag put away. And maybe we should try to grab a couple of hours\u2019 sleep, because during those few hours in between shifts when this place is empty, I\u2019m going to want a private tour. If you\u2019re up to it...? Maybe old Blue will let himself be known when it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Gus\u2019s room is over here.\u201d</p><p>She led him down the little hall within the apartment to the first door. Stepping inside, she switched on the light. The old captain\u2019s bed was just as it had been. She\u2019d spent some time in the week since he\u2019d died cleaning up, gathering up his clothes and donating them to the Salvation Army. Gus had been almost fanatically clean, but she\u2019d given the room a once-over, too. It was decorated with ships\u2019 lamps, a whaling harpoon and other memorabilia from the sea. The walls were paneled, very much like a ship\u2019s cabin.</p><p>Malachi nodded approvingly. He set his suitcase on the floor and said, \u201cI guess you accept that I\u2019m more or less legitimate now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a minute, and offered her a smile. \u201cI think you\u2019re legitimate, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She felt strange, looking at him there, feeling that subtle smile of his as if it were a caress.</p><p>And liking it.</p><p>She stepped back into the hallway. Tall, dark and very handsome.</p><p>He was suddenly far too appealing.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then...see you in a few hours,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She turned and walked the few steps down the hall that led to her own bedroom. She quickly walked in, leaned against the door and realized she was shaking. And she knew then that she was impossibly attracted to him.</p><p>Sleep. Oh, hell, yeah. Sure thing.</p><p>\u201cBlue, you\u2019re supposed to come when we need help!\u201d she whispered aloud. \u201cAnd, Blue, I definitely need some help now!\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>It was a good thing he\u2019d never really needed much sleep, Malachi thought.</p><p>He\u2019d lain in bed, staring at the ceiling, going over everything he\u2019d seen and everyone he\u2019d met since he arrived. He hadn\u2019t wanted to alarm Abby, but he couldn\u2019t help assuming that the Dragonslayer had been used in some way. Either that or the killer was a patron of the tavern.</p><p>Dirk. Most obvious suspect. He ran a pirate ship. He played a pirate daily.</p><p>Sullivan? The bartender knew the place like few others.</p><p>Aldous, Bootsie, Grant, Macy. Bootsie was an old man. Macy was a woman, which didn\u2019t clear her, but the sexual activity the women had engaged in\u2014rape?\u2014before death had been with a man. Still, she could be in on it. A facilitator.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to be able to sleep, so he got up and studied Gus\u2019s room. It made him wish he\u2019d had the opportunity to know the man. He\u2019d evidently loved the river and history and ships. His room wasn\u2019t furnished with reproduction pieces; the lamps and harpoons and other paraphernalia were original, probably worth a small fortune.</p><p>When he opened the old sea chest at the foot of the bed, he saw that it contained neatly folded blankets. Wandering around the small space, he discovered that the room didn\u2019t have a closet, just an old oak armoire, but it had been emptied except for a few shirts and a woolen captain\u2019s coat.</p><p>There was one dresser in the room. On top of it sat a few pictures. One he guessed was Abby as a child with her parents. Another was of Abby and, surely, Gus. Another was Abby\u2019s college graduation photo. She was young and beautiful, and her eyes were filled with the bright light of one anticipating the future.</p><p>She still had that look about her, but now it was tempered by loss. The important people in her family had died. She\u2019d made it through the academy and certainly seen enough of the brutality that could exist. It hadn\u2019t silenced the resilient, vibrant chord of life within her; she\u2019d seen something wrong in her grandfather\u2019s death and was determined to get to the root of it.</p><p>And, she knew there was more in the world than what was seen by most people. Maybe she hadn\u2019t had a lot of experience\u2014but then, you didn\u2019t really need a lot. Once you\u2019d experienced the dead appearing before you or speaking to you, you recognized that it was possible.</p><p>He paused for a moment before opening the first drawer. Although he\u2019d already been prying, he murmured, \u201cForgive me, Gus, I have to see if there\u2019s anything here that will help us.\u201d</p><p>The first drawer held neatly folded briefs and nothing more. It didn\u2019t seem that Abby had gotten around to going through Gus\u2019s more personal items.</p><p>In the second drawer he found T-shirts and two sets of long underwear. Savannah, on the river, could get damply cold in winter.</p><p>Third drawer contained jeans. He looked under them.</p><p>There was a newspaper neatly folded beneath the several layers of jeans. Malachi glanced at the date\u2014three months earlier. He studied the paper. A brief article on the bottom of the front page had a headline that read Savannah Underground!</p><p>He scanned the article, which was interesting; apparently, years ago, Savannah had teemed with life below the surface.</p><p>He started to put the jeans back, deciding that, with more time, he\u2019d refer back to the article. As he held the jeans, he felt something in one of the pockets.</p><p>He pulled out a small plastic bag. There was a Post-it stuck to the bag with a note. \u201cPolice. Found at bottom of tunnel ladder. Must get to right person.\u201d</p><p>Curious, Malachi examined the contents of the bag. He couldn\u2019t figure out what the object was and then a chill seemed to settle in his bones. The...thing was small and oddly dark, as if it were growing charred. He had to open the bag and let it spill out before he saw what it was.</p><p>A finger. Presumably a ring finger. Decaying. He looked at the note again. It had to mean that Gus had found the finger and meant to give it to the police. But he\u2019d wanted to talk to his granddaughter\u2014someone he trusted. Gus had known or suspected something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d Abby tapped at his door. He opened it.</p><p>\u201cI heard you rummaging around,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I knew you were awake. I wanted to tell you that Grant and Sullivan are gone. The Dragonslayer\u2019s empty except for the two of us.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply right away.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGus was onto something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cGus found a...um, finger. He found a finger at the bottom of the tunnel. He knew that someone who had some involvement with the murders had been in the tunnel. Except the police never released the fact that the ring finger of the left hand had been taken from each of the victims. So he probably didn\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019d found\u2014which was why he wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Abby lowered her head. \u201cHe died,\u201d she said dully, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t get here fast enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbby,\u201d he said, lifting her chin, \u201che died because it was his time. He died doing what was right, and that would\u2019ve been important to Gus.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and he released her. \u201cYou\u2019re right, even though you didn\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I had, but I know that much about him.\u201d</p><p>He realized she was far too close. She smelled sweetly of soap and shampoo, and he was surprised that it was suddenly so difficult for him to separate a coworker from someone...</p><p>Someone he wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do with the finger?\u201d</p> <p>He stepped awkwardly back as her words broke through his thoughts. \u201cGive it to Kat,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019ll tell us whether it\u2019s new and showing some kind of decay or if it\u2019s been in the tunnel for ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely\u2014since this killer is taking fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. But we\u2019ll give it to Kat,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He paused for a minute. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll give it to the cops, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOkay, now show me the Dragonslayer,\u201d he said.</p><p>She led him through the upstairs first, leaving the family apartment behind to show him Gus\u2019s office, the manager\u2019s office, the employee lounge, lockers and restroom. They went to the supply room and she showed him the stairs that went down to the dining room below.</p> <p>Only the night-lights were on. When they went down the stairs, they were greeted by the image of Blue Anderson standing guard over the grate that led to the tunnel below. The robotic mannequin\u2014handsomely crafted\u2014was eerie in the half-light.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t the Blue he\u2019d met the night he arrived.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in the bar and the dining rooms,\u201d Abby told him. \u201cOh, and the kitchen is reached through the server entrance over there.\u201d She paused and pointed to a doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s always open. Gus thought diners had a right to see where their food was cooked. And there\u2019s a little service window that opens to the bar.\u201d</p><p>He gazed carefully around. \u201cIf someone knew the routine here\u2014the hours of business, when people were where\u2014it would be possible for that person to be upstairs, maybe, in the storeroom, and come down those stairs...and all the way to the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we keep the grating locked,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t locked when I got here.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was right. \u201cThe lock on the grate is a combination lock Gus had for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you really don\u2019t know who\u2014or just how many people\u2014might have the combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she admitted. \u201cNew lock in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re okay for tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut tomorrow I\u2019ll go out and get a combination lock. How many people have keys to the tavern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant, Macy, our morning chef and Sullivan. That\u2019s as far as I know. I don\u2019t think Gus would have given the keys to anyone else. When I was a child, we were almost broken into one night.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s when I saw Blue for the first time. He woke my grandfather. I heard them and came out of bed and looked downstairs\u2014my grandparents were outside with the police by then\u2014and I saw Blue standing by the door. My grandfather suggested I not mention that I\u2019d seen him to anyone else. I never did. Until now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never talked about seeing people, either,\u201d Malachi told her. \u201cI had\u2014have\u2014a few friends who suspect I see things that they don\u2019t. They tend to think I\u2019m a real psychic, regardless of what I say. Or they accept the work I\u2019m able to do, know I don\u2019t want to explain and let it go at that. Like David. As far as others are concerned, I avoid the topic. Too many people want stock tips and that\u2019s something I truly can\u2019t give,\u201d he added dryly. \u201cLook, I\u2019m a really early riser. I\u2019ll run out to buy a new lock, and I\u2019ll make sure that Jackson and the group get in here to set up some cameras. That\u2019s something we almost always do in this kind of investigation. It\u2019s possible that the killer will realize the Dragonslayer has been identified and try something else. But it\u2019s also possible that...\u201d</p><p>He paused, looking at her and wondering if he should go on.</p><p>\u201cPossible that?\u201d she urged. She\u2019d stiffened, and he felt she expected his answer, but dreaded hearing it.</p><p>\u201cA victim might appear,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He drew in a breath, hoping he wasn\u2019t going to sound ghoulish. \u201cIt was important for me to touch the victims today. Sometimes, the dead actually talk on the autopsy table. Kat Sokolov can tell you more about that. I may be repeating what you might already know or suspect, but...we should think about it. From what most of us have discovered, ghosts don\u2019t like to be with their mortal remains if they\u2019re trapped on this plane for whatever reason. But if they do stay behind, they may appear where they feel they can find someone to help them achieve justice. If any of the victims did somehow come through here, they could be caught on camera.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her eyes stricken.</p><p>\u201cYou okay? You don\u2019t need to fear the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to think about Blue hanging around the tavern\u2014he\u2019s my ancestor and he obviously stayed because he loves the family and loves the tavern. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder victims only stay because they need help,\u201d he said.</p><p>Abby nodded. \u201cAnd they just might be caught on camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I sleep lightly and I\u2019m just a few steps away.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised when her smile was deep and real.</p><p>\u201cFunny how things go, huh? You pissed me off when I first met you. That wasn\u2019t very long ago, and tonight I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go up, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s go up,\u201d she said.</p><p>She walked ahead of him, directly for the stairs. When they were both back in the apartment, she locked the door to the outer hallway. It was a good measure, even if they were alone in the restaurant. She walked down the hall to her room, beyond the door that led to Gus\u2019s. She hesitated there. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>He found himself hesitating, too. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>She started to speak, but paused again. \u201cI, uh, meant what I said. I truly am grateful that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m truly grateful that you let me be here. Though I am curious now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour home on Chippewa Square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said. That time, she walked in and closed her door.</p><p>Malachi did the same. He smiled as he did so. There was something about her...</p><p>As he\u2019d said, he was very glad he was there.</p><p>Again he lay awake for hours, trying to concentrate on the case and put all the facts in order. Three female victims now, and one male. The killer, to Malachi\u2019s mind, had killed Rupert Holloway for coming too close, so the victimology didn\u2019t completely fit. That meant the killer was after pretty young women.</p><p>Those who might be seen the way women were once seen, as damsels. Lovely young women as prizes.</p><p>They\u2019d all been found in the river.</p><p>As if forced to walk the plank, at least, symbolically.</p><p>And then there was Gus. Dead in the tunnel.</p><p>He looked around the room in the dim light, once more wishing he could have met the man. He imagined him as temperate, prone to liking people. But he\u2019d lived a long time and been through a lot. He loved the river, history, antiques\u2014and his granddaughter. She\u2019d grown up with confidence and ability and the strength to choose her own path in life.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beauty, Gus,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cAnd a strong, smart person. I couldn\u2019t know you, but I\u2019m proud to know her.\u201d</p><p>He realized that his thoughts were going in a direction he\u2019d never expected when he\u2019d headed down to Savannah. But there was no denying she had a beauty any man would instantly admire and somewhere in his heart\u2014or libido\u2014instantly desire. He\u2019d lost Marie five years ago. When she\u2019d died, they\u2019d been young and madly, almost insanely, in love. While he\u2019d engaged in a few brief relationships since her death, he\u2019d never really known any of the women and nothing between them had ever done more than touch the surface of his emotions.</p><p>Maybe this was different because of the ghost thing.</p><p>And maybe it was because of the way she looked. Or the fire that seemed to simmer within her, a passion for laughter as well as justice.</p><p>At some point, he dozed. He wasn\u2019t sure if he opened his eyes and saw Blue Anderson there, standing over him, and then walking to the window\u2014or if he dreamed it. He managed to get some sleep.</p><p>His phone rang early around 7:00 a.m. It was Kat Sokolov.</p><p>\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. Yes, but I need to get up.\u201d He liked Kat. But he liked Will, too, and the other members of the Krewes he\u2019d been brought in to meet after Adam, Logan and Jackson had brought him to their offices. She was the tiniest, cutest little blonde and didn\u2019t look like any medical examiner he\u2019d ever met. But she certainly knew what she was doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just wanted to let you know I\u2019m heading to the morgue. I\u2019ll be attending at the next autopsy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI hope the local guy, Dr. Tierney, likes you better than he seemed to like me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He heard the soft sound of her laughter. \u201cNot to worry. Adam Harrison has done his magic. We\u2019re officially invited in. Jackson and Angela will be down at the local station, giving a heads-up on what we believe, based on what we\u2019ve seen and learned from you and Abby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a would-be pirate,\u201d Malachi said quietly, \u201cwho likes to take the ring finger of the left hand as a souvenir. And...I, uh, have a finger to give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus was onto something. I think the killer lost one of his trophies in the tunnel, and Gus found it before he had any idea of what was going on. It might be why he asked Abby to come down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found it where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn one of his drawers. I need to get it to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll run by for it,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe pirates liked to make necklaces out of the bones of people they killed? I\u2019ll research my pirate lore,\u201d Kat promised him. \u201cOh, and Will\u2019s taking over for Dirk this morning as head pirate on the Black Swan to keep an eye on that ship. And Dirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy really does seem devastated,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I gather he can be a very good actor\u2014as a pirate, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent plan. And I\u2019ve heard Jackson gets along well with the local police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has his ways. Not that he has a lot to say yet. They\u2019re probably looking for a white male, with or without a companion,\u201d Kat said. \u201cSomeone who knows the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd has a boat or a ship, or access to one,\u201d Malachi added.</p> <p>\u201cBig river,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Keep me posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at ya.\u201d</p><p>Malachi checked his watch. Time for a cup of coffee before starting the day. In fact, he could smell coffee coming from nearby, not from the restaurant below.</p><p>He showered quickly, thinking all the while about the clues they had\u2014his thoughts disrupted now and then by another that intruded. Abby.</p><p>He was glad he was going to spend the day with her.</p><p>Abby selected two coffee cups and two small plates from the overhead kitchen cabinet. They actually had time for breakfast.</p><p>She toasted a couple of bagels, and Malachi spread cream cheese on them while she poured coffee. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>She glanced at him. He seemed exceptionally appealing as he stood in the tiny kitchen area of the apartment. Fresh from the shower, his hair was dark and slick. His hazel eyes were set somberly upon her and seemed to speak of a depth she couldn\u2019t begin to understand. She wondered about his past\u2014the wife he\u2019d lost\u2014and she suddenly wanted to know everything about him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about your grandfather\u2014wishing I\u2019d known him.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHe was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She put one of the cups of coffee in front of him. \u201cThanks.\u201d She watched him for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to comfort me by telling me that he was old and lived a full life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes someone having been old make you miss them any less?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, however, help if you know that someone did lead a full life. And it should also help if you know just what you meant to him\u2014that you were the most important person in his life. That\u2019s what life is all about. The grief remains, but there\u2019s consolation in those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked. She was pushing it, she thought, but her curiosity was beginning to consume her. \u201cHow did you cope? What happened to your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancer. One day she was fine and then, within a year, she was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that. And time has helped, as they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you coped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, not really. New Orleans was her home. I loved living there, loved the music, the food, the architecture. You name it, I loved it. But when she died...I quit the police force and the city. I left. I can\u2019t bear to go back, even though I loved her family, too. I returned to Virginia, moved into my old family home, and...\u201d His voice trailed off as he looked toward the windows and the river.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI realized that in my state of mind, I wouldn\u2019t be able to play well with others. So I got licensed and became a private investigator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that is coping,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled. It was a crooked, rueful smile, and she yearned to walk over to him and stroke his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coping,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019re on fire. Going after the killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t go after cancer. No one can.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged again. \u201cI guess I know that\u2014knew that. I went after God for a while. Didn\u2019t work. But...ah, well. I have an ancestor who hangs around, too. Doesn\u2019t hesitate to speak his mind. He fought a revolution and saw friends die right and left, and wasn\u2019t interested in my self-pity. So...I started really using whatever this ability is that we have. I pursued bad guys. I tried to save lives and sometimes succeeded. That does help.\u201d</p><p>Abby made a point of keeping her distance from him. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever wanted to touch another person so badly.</p><p>\u201cWith any luck, we\u2019ll save Helen Long,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLuck\u2014and work,\u201d he agreed. He flicked a glance at his watch. \u201cWe meet your friend soon? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn front of the tavern. But not until ten.\u201d</p><p>Macy was at the host stand when they went down. She greeted them both, acting a little perplexed. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said. \u201cYou came in earlier?\u201d she asked Malachi.</p><p>He leaned on the stand and gave her a charming smile. \u201cI\u2019m staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, uh...\u201d Macy looked at Abby. Abby just smiled, too.</p><p>\u201cMacy, you\u2019ll see some of my colleagues here in a few hours,\u201d Malachi told her. \u201cThey\u2019ll be setting up some security cameras. If they need it, you\u2019ll lend them a hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, sounding flustered.</p><p>He thanked her and turned to head out of the building.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Macy whispered to Abby.</p><p>Abby merely shrugged and smiled. She quickly joined Malachi outside.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks we\u2019re sleeping together,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you set her straight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what she thinks. I just followed you. Is there a reason you walked out?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cKat\u2019s coming by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She lifted a questioning brow\u2014and then she remembered. The finger. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, a dark SUV swung into the lot. Malachi headed for it, reached into his pocket and produced the finger wrapped in a clean silk handkerchief Abby had given him.</p><p>\u201cI may be able to match it to a body,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I also hope it doesn\u2019t mean there are more bodies out there.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded and waved to Abby. He stepped back from the SUV and she drove off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost nine, so I\u2019m going out to see if I can buy a better lock. Should be back in half an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>Abby spent the time he was gone organizing more of Gus\u2019s papers. By 9:45, she was too anxious to do anything but wait for Malachi downstairs.</p><p>He returned just as she stepped outside. \u201cGot it. I\u2019ll leave it in the car until we\u2019re back. Good timing\u2014that\u2019s your friend\u2019s car, right? As he spoke, Roger waved at them from across the parking lot.</p><p>Abby waved back. \u201cBe prepared,\u201d she warned Malachi, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re in for a tour. I don\u2019t think Roger can help himself. He should be an ambassador.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want,\u201d Malachi said. He paused as Roger drew closer. \u201cWhat I want are the ins and outs tourists don\u2019t usually get. The city secrets,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd no faith in me, huh?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEternal faith in you, Ms. Anderson. But Roger English made the map that Helen Long might\u2019ve had in her possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. And he probably does know more than I do. It\u2019s my home, my heritage, and I love Savannah. But Roger is a fanatic.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, head slightly bent, and she liked the way he looked at her. He might see the world through mocking eyes, but if so, he seemed to mock himself first and there was something charming about that. Then again, he seemed more and more charming to her as time went by.</p><p>And, of course, she was more and more intrigued by him.</p><p>Not to mention attracted...</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Roger said, walking up and shaking Malachi\u2019s extended hand. \u201cI\u2019m Roger English, best guide in the city. I\u2019m totally yours for the day, my minions are handling all else...and where shall we go from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi Gordon, Roger. And the answer is everywhere\u2014the public city and the hidden city,\u201d Malachi told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with the feds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re taking a tour?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>Malachi grinned at that. \u201cYeah, with the feds, hoping to catch a killer. I think it\u2019s the killer\u2019s city, so I need to know it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with the right man!\u201d Roger studied Malachi for a minute, hands on his hips. \u201cYeah, I guess that makes sense. Okay, well...we can walk first, if you\u2019re up to it. My favorite secret is about four blocks up, but I thought we\u2019d walk along the riverfront and start with Colonial Park Cemetery,\u201d he said, glancing at Abby.</p><p>\u201cFine with me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve been in the Dragonslayer, of course,\u201d Roger began. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cComing to know it well,\u201d Malachi told him.</p><p>\u201cThe city has another famous restaurant along the same lines,\u201d Roger said. \u201cThe Pirates\u2019 House. Tourists, children...everyone loves it. People get off the highway and come to Savannah to dine there. Children grow up and bring their children. Oh.\u201d He looked at Abby apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI love Pirates\u2019 House, too,\u201d Abby said, laughing, \u201calmost as much as I love the Dragonslayer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll talk while we walk along the riverfront. You\u2019ll notice our shops, the monuments, the hotels\u2014the riverfront is the heart of everything. The city of Savannah was established in 1733 and it\u2019s known as our country\u2019s first planned city. It was the first capital of colonial Georgia and, later, the state of Georgia. General James Oglethorpe named the thirteenth and final colony Georgia after King George. He arrived at the city via the ship Anne with one hundred and twenty settlers. He and his company landed on a high bluff above the Savannah River and he dreamed of a port to rival the best. Oglethorpe\u2019s original plan was for total religious freedom and no slavery, but with the marshes to create rich rice fields, his concept of no slaves didn\u2019t last too long. However, the planning of the city gives us the unique beauty of her riverfront and the squares we still have today. Streets are built on a grid with squares providing public meeting places and lovely little areas to enjoy. Today, the downtown area is one of the largest National Historic Landmark areas in North America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery impressive,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to the squares and more landmarks later. We\u2019ll start with Colonial Park Cemetery. It was the first graveyard for Christ Church Parish, and we\u2019ll enter by Alercorn and Oglethorpe. More than seven hundred dead from the 1820 yellow fever epidemic rest here, along with a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Button Gwinnett. And, sadly, a number of those killed in duels are buried here, as well. There\u2019s one really great restored stone. Come on, we\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>Roger had walked them down the river and then up and through the streets until they reached the regal arched entry, surmounted by a noble eagle. A number of tourists and tour groups were in the cemetery. Roger didn\u2019t even see them; he walked among stones, aboveground sarcophagi, family vaults, mausoleums and memorials to get to his objective. He read aloud, \u201c\u2018He fell in a duel on the 16th of January, 1815, by the hand of a man who, a short time ago, would have been friendless but for him.... By his untimely death the prop of a Mother\u2019s age is broken: The hope and consolation of Sisters is destroyed, the pride of Brothers humbled in the dust and a whole family, happy until then, overwhelmed with affliction.\u2019 We are looking at the 1815 headstone of James Wilde. Sad, huh? Facing all the dangers of those early days, men still shot one another down in the streets.\u201d He grinned at them for a minute. \u201cNowadays you just have to go on Facebook and unfriend people who piss you off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, and much less gruesome,\u201d Abby agreed.</p> <p>\u201cSave the mother, the sisters and brothers a lot of heartache,\u201d Malachi added.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Roger continued, \u201cmost Americans know that during the Civil War, General William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea. He pursued a scorched-earth policy, believing that the only way to beat the Confederacy was to bring her to her knees. So he razed Atlanta and headed on east. When he got to Savannah, the city surrendered, which meant he didn\u2019t have to burn down Savannah. Colonial Park Cemetery was closed to burials in 1853, so there are no Civil War soldiers buried here. But the Civil War left a lasting mark on the cemetery. As I said, Sherman didn\u2019t burn the city. Instead, he wrote a telegram to President Lincoln, presenting him with Savannah as a Christmas gift in December of 1864. Today, we\u2019re grateful. But here\u2019s something interesting. Union troops filled the city with few places to billet. Many were forced to stay here in the graveyard. So, in some instances, they tossed corpses out of the mausoleums and family vaults. Bored, they scratched out the dates on a number of tombs, so in some instances, you can find a grave for someone who was born in 1820, but died in 1777. Names were changed, stones were moved around. They say the cemetery is, to this day, riddled with ghosts, dismayed by the way their graves were so rudely desecrated and disturbed. Now, it was pretty cold, so I\u2019m guessing sometimes the Union soldiers were bitter and that sometimes, when they threw a corpse out for an enclosed place to sleep, it was just because the poor suckers were freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad story,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cBut if the dead were asleep...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they were asleep?\u201d Roger echoed.</p><p>\u201cWell, if they\u2019d really gone on, they wouldn\u2019t much care, would they?\u201d</p><p>Roger frowned suddenly. \u201cHey!\u201d he said. Abby saw that he was looking at one of the tour groups.</p> <p>\u201cRoger? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d His attention still on the group, he glanced back at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Abby repeated.</p><p>\u201cMy date from last night is cheating on me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out with another tour group!\u201d Roger said indignantly. \u201cYou met her last night. Bianca. She\u2019s with that group over there. Excuse me. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He trotted off. \u201cAh, young love,\u201d Malachi murmured, watching him go.</p><p>Then he gestured in the opposite direction. \u201cSee them?\u201d he asked softly.</p> <p>\u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>Malachi pointed again. \u201cAn elderly couple there, on the bench. He\u2019s holding her hand very tenderly. They still seem to be in love, a feat during any era. And there...far over there past the bench. Seems to be a lumbering fellow...a huge lumbering fellow. Lord, he must be almost seven feet tall. He\u2019s acting furtive, as if he\u2019s scared....\u201d</p><p>She stared out at the far side of the cemetery; she didn\u2019t see what he saw. She was about to tell him that, but then, looking where he looked, listening to his words, she felt she did begin to see.</p><p>The elderly couple... They were in Revolutionary-era clothing. He wore a wig and she wore a cap over her white hair. They did hold each other tenderly.</p><p>And the bumbling man who seemed frightened, who seemed to stumble around...</p><p>She gasped suddenly. The big man was legend\u2014the pure stuff of ghost stories!</p><p>Malachi turned to her. \u201cYou see them. You could have seen them all along. You didn\u2019t know to look for them. Despite what Roger said, not many people haunt a graveyard. Why would they? They didn\u2019t live here. But those two. Perhaps they\u2019re upset by something written on a stone or some desecration committed during the Civil War and never righted.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply to that; she pointed at the other man. \u201cRene Asche Rondolier,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the ghost tours talk about him. He was mentally slow. He was accused of killing animals as a child. Whether he did or didn\u2019t, no one\u2019s ever established. His parents tried to keep him on their property behind a huge brick fence, or so the story goes. I often wonder if he was mentally deficient and therefore an automatic whipping boy at a time when a lot of the populace was still superstitious. People made fun of him or they feared him. He was accused of killing two local girls\u2014their bodies were found here in the cemetery. The local people chased him down to the swamps and lynched him. Afterward, the murders continued, and I don\u2019t believe the real killer was ever caught. But Rene had already been hanged for the crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor man. Sure looks like he\u2019s weeping and still afraid,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if what we hear about his reputation was true, or if it\u2019s been enhanced over the years,\u201d Abby said. \u201cWhat is true is that his family owned property that\u2019s now part of the cemetery. It expanded in the late 1700s to allow for...well, more time and more dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should try to speak with him sometime,\u201d Malachi suggested. \u201cAnd the older couple. There might be a way to find out why they\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>Abby looked at him. \u201cWhy is Blue still here, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was here for Gus. Or maybe he\u2019s here for you, to help you learn exactly what happened to Gus.\u201d</p><p>Roger came back to join them.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Malachi asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Bianca just knew I\u2019d be busy with you two today and she wanted to see some of the sights. We\u2019ll meet up later. Okay. Now we can walk through the city and I can tell you tales as we go. We can visit Christ Church, or the Juliette Gordon Low birthplace or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about secret Savannah?\u201d Malachi said. \u201cSecret is the most interesting. What do you know about tunnels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Roger brightened. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard that the city is riddled with tunnels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecret tunnels,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and if you\u2019re game, I know where we\u2019ll find some of the best!\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>\u201cMalachi, there are so many tunnels to choose from,\u201d Roger said happily. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s start walking toward the south again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe south,\u201d Malachi repeated. He pulled the map he\u2019d found on the Black Swan out of his pocket. \u201cAre we going in this direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we can head there. We\u2019ll stand on that spot marked X and I can tell you more.\u201d He moved at a brisk pace and they followed a step or two behind. He paused to look back. \u201cThere are lots of tunnels. Some more like catacombs. One I\u2019ve discovered recently that Abby probably doesn\u2019t even know about. Seriously, like I said, the city is riddled with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know there are tunnels. I didn\u2019t know the city was riddled with them,\u201d Abby said. \u201cWe have the shanghai tunnel at the Dragonslayer that leads to the river. There\u2019s one at the Pirates\u2019 House restaurant, too. And there are houses with tunnels that were part of the Underground Railroad during the Civil War. And, of course, the tunnels near Candler Hospital, but I know they\u2019re off-limits.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, there are the Candler Hospital tunnels\u2014truly fascinating, and with very little written history, especially on how and when they were built. Most believe it was during the Civil War. There was once an underground morgue, and autopsies were done there. Some historians note that it was cooler underground, so perhaps it was an attempt to stop the yellow fever and malaria epidemics that used to strike. Oh, and there are the catacombs under an old abandoned church called Saint Sebastian\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly stopped walking. \u201cWe\u2019re on X marks the spot,\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why anyone would have marked this spot on your map?\u201d Malachi asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re standing over a tunnel. Other than that? No. There\u2019s nothing here but sidewalk. And some pretty moss-draped oaks next to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe church is right there,\u201d Abby murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe church? Saint Sebastian\u2019s? The church you were just talking about?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cNone other,\u201d Roger told him, obviously gleeful that his knowledge of the city and its history was being fully appreciated. \u201cThe church and the tunnels will not be found on official tours. The city\u2019s had a problem at various times with vagrants crawling in. In fact, you can find historic beer cans and cigarette butts at the entries to many of the tunnels,\u201d he said, not hiding his sarcasm.</p><p>Abby glanced at Malachi. \u201cX equals underground,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like Helen. I mean, crawling around underneath the ground does not sound like Helen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelen Long?\u201d Roger looked a little ashen.</p><p>\u201cWe think this was her map,\u201d Malachi told him.</p><p>Roger nodded, clearly perplexed. \u201cYeah, I gave it to her, but I never saw her mark the map,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just asking me about taking a good tour of the city. She was hoping to leave soon. She\u2019s driven\u2014really wants to act. But she was asking me about the old church. She said she\u2019d talked to someone who was thinking of buying it, as it hasn\u2019t been renovated since the nightclub or worked on by the private company that bought it for historical preservation. This guy she knows wanted to make something out of it like a year-round haunted house. Pirate-themed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she hear about it? As far as I knew, it was off the beaten tourist and business track,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cThis guy she met, I guess.\u201d Roger shrugged. \u201cMaybe someone who\u2019d taken the tour out on the Black Swan. Helen\u2019s a sweetheart. Kids love her on that ship. Adults, too. Especially guys.\u201d</p><p>Malachi nodded. \u201cHow about showing us the church?\u201d he suggested.</p> <p>\u201cI can show it to you\u2014and the catacombs and tunnels, which are kind of one and the same. But it\u2019s against the law since it\u2019s private property. Oh, wait\u2014you are the law, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Malachi said, looking at Abby. \u201cWell, we really are the law, although I\u2019m still a consultant. But you\u2019re the real deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d she said softly. Her voice, her sincerity, stirred something within him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Roger said, turning back to them. \u201cLet\u2019s go around to the side. Casually, of course. There\u2019s an old, small iron door that was used for ice delivery. We can crawl through that and then through the hallway. Just be careful, okay. I\u2019d rather not draw attention to us as we creep around private property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall creep with incredible agility, and quietly,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>They crossed the street. It was actually easy to disappear into the many trees that surrounded the old church. Slipping around the side, Malachi realized that at one time there\u2019d been a delivery path there; he could imagine the horse-drawn wagon that would have carried the ice blocks, could see where it must have parked for the few minutes it took the driver to make his delivery. The ice delivery \u201cdoor\u201d was about four feet off the ground and had a massive dark metal hatch that opened to allow for a space of about three feet by two.</p><p>\u201cYou can get in?\u201d Roger asked. He gripped the handle. It was old, hadn\u2019t been oiled in forever and didn\u2019t budge. Malachi stepped past him. \u201cLet me give it a try,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have opened it before,\u201d Roger told him. \u201cSeemed to be easier then.\u201d</p> <p>Malachi gripped the handle, got it into the open position, then braced a foot against the building and pulled hard. When the door gave, he had to jump back quickly to keep from falling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pop through first. Make sure there are no spiders or snakes!\u201d Roger told Abby.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of spiders and snakes?\u201d Malachi asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not particularly fond of either, but I don\u2019t freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to scream like a girl when you saw a spider,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>\u201cI am a girl, but I haven\u2019t screamed at a spider in years,\u201d Abby insisted. Roger merely smiled, then hiked himself up and eased his body through the opening. Abby glanced at Malachi and followed Roger, and then Malachi followed her.</p><p>He had to crawl through the old, lined wooden icebox, and when he did, he stood in a room that was shadowed and empty. After a moment his eyes adjusted and he saw something that looked like a contemporary counter against the wall. There were cups covered in spiderwebs; the floor was gritty with dust.</p><p>\u201cCome this way,\u201d Roger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a hall that leads to the main church.\u201d</p><p>Malachi set a hand on the small of Abby\u2019s back as they started through the shadows to a door. There were drapes on the few windows down the hallway, shredded and torn in places. Daylight glinted through the rips and tears.</p><p>They came to a door that opened into the side of the main church. There were no longer pews that faced the altar, but the steps to the altar and the altar on its dais still stood. Here, there was light that seemed to spew into the interior in a number of colors. Stained-glass windows remained, none had been damaged or altered. Biblical scenes were represented in the glass, beautifully executed. Above the altar, Christ looked down at Mary Magdalene and his mother, Mary, surrounded by lambs. To one side was John the Baptist, to another, the archangel Gabriel.</p><p>The glass windows marched down both sides of the church. The blues in the glass were rich and deep, as were the crimsons. The light they admitted was eerie.</p><p>Tables had replaced the pews. When it was a nightclub, the owners had played on the religious symbols and added to them with an ironic and diabolical twist\u2014bats dangled from the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cThe tunnel entrance is up on the dais and behind the altar,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>They trailed after him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t quite as odd an entry as the one by which they\u2019d entered. A little wooden fence surrounded a grate; they opened the entrance and then Roger bent down to lift a hatch. A steep narrow stairway led to the darkness below.</p><p>\u201cFather Liam O\u2019Leary is in the coffin directly beneath the altar,\u201d Roger said. \u201cThe Irish Catholics liked to take their cues from Rome, I guess, and the Vatican. There are a number of coffins on biers just below here\u2014glass encased. Sort of creepy. I\u2019ve got a little penlight. Anyone else have anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Abby said, producing her key chain and a small flashlight. Malachi drew the light he\u2019d used that first night out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cPrepared, huh?\u201d Roger joked.</p><p>\u201cMe and the Boy Scouts,\u201d Malachi said. He shined his light over the circular room, directly beneath the altar where they were standing. Not surprising, it was dank and musty, and there seemed to be a verdant smell of the earth around them. He walked over to one of the coffins. The lid was glass; beneath it lay the decaying body of a priest in his vestments. His skin was growing brown as it stretched over the bone. Malachi dusted the grit and grime off the bronze plaque before him. His name had, indeed, been Liam O\u2019Leary and he\u2019d been born in County Cork in 1744 and died in Savannah, Georgia, in March of 1793, beloved of his \u201clambs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst priest here,\u201d Roger told him. \u201cAnd around the room you have several more of the especially beloved fellows who served the faithful. I\u2019m surprised they weren\u2019t dug up\u2014or carted out\u2014when the church sold the property in the late 1890s and the building was deconsecrated. Could\u2019ve been bureaucratic error, red tape, whatever. Seems strange and sad that these guys were down here while people were up above them drinking \u2018Exceptionally Bloody Marys\u2019 and watching vampire bats dance over their heads.\u201d</p><p>Malachi and Abby both nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen I first started exploring down here, I was shocked,\u201d Roger said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even know there were catacombs or tunnels\u2014until I leaned against the wall and it turned out someone had just boarded up the entry. I practically went through. But there are five tunnels leading out from here, with lots of corpses lining them. Again, kind of like the Christian catacombs in Ancient Rome. Savannah started off English, of course, but had a large Irish population from the beginning. Man, you should come for Saint Patrick\u2019s Day! But that\u2019s beside the point. These people were very Catholic. And when the church was established here, they emulated Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive entries\u2014by each of the five dead priests?\u201d Malachi guessed.</p><p>Roger nodded. \u201cAfter I found the first, I tapped around the room and found the rest of them. Those three\u2014\u201d he pointed across from Father O\u2019Leary \u201c\u2014must\u2019ve caved in decades ago. The other trunks go on and on. It gets damper and damper as they head under the streets to the river. So...\u201d He let the word hang as he lifted his flashlight to look at Malachi\u2019s face. \u201cYou can pick door number one or door number two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should head out from behind our good Father O\u2019Leary\u2014what say you, Ms. Anderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the good father would not lead us astray,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled and raised his own flashlight. The beam played over Roger, standing between two of the glass-domed coffins and their decaying priests, and then over Abby. She appeared to be pale, almost ethereal with her jet-black hair and deep eyes. She would\u2019ve been a perfect image, he thought wryly, when the place was a vampire-themed nightclub. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust push that piece of plasterboard aside. That\u2019s the entrance,\u201d Roger told them.</p><p>Malachi lifted the loose piece of wood\u2014plastered over and painted white to blend with the wall\u2014and moved it to one side. The first tunnel yawned directly before them.</p><p>\u201cYou can see why they don\u2019t want the average tourist family with their four-year-old running around down here,\u201d Roger said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Abby glanced at Malachi and then trained her light down the tunnel, which seemed to stretch ahead endlessly. She stepped forward and he followed. Roger quickly came up behind him.</p><p>Each side of the wall had shelving dug into it, and each shelf had been the burial point for one Christian soul. The shrouds on the bodies had long ago turned as dark and murky as the earth on which they rested; they seemed to have gone back into it, giving true meaning to the Biblical term dust to dust.</p><p>It was eerie and sad. Here and there, tree and brush roots were crawling through as if they reached down to embrace the last mortal remains of those who lay here, forgotten by time.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going toward the river,\u201d Abby commented, walking ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can feel that it\u2019s growing damper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome experts believe there are even more tunnels underneath the ground than those we know about,\u201d Roger said. \u201cThey know of some that were part of a real \u2018underground\u2019 railroad during the Civil War\u2014but in those days, they would\u2019ve used anything. I\u2019m thinking those hidden doors, like the one we came through, were put up during the Civil War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a valid theory,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>They moved slowly. The dark was so complete that their lights made the surrounding blackness seem even deeper.</p><p>Suddenly, while walking ahead of him, Abby let out a startled shriek, threw up her hands and dropped her flashlight.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Malachi demanded, rushing up behind her. Her arms flapped in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said quietly, holding her. He felt the beat of her heart, felt her frantic breathing.</p> <p>And her warmth, the way she started and then eased as he held her.</p><p>\u201cThey were all over me!\u201d she said. \u201cSorry\u2014ugh. I\u2019ve got to get it off.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed her face, removing strands of web. Raising his light, he saw the web in her hair and smoothed it away, too.</p><p>\u201cSpiderwebs!\u201d Roger said, and laughed. \u201cNothing but spiderwebs. I told you, Abby screams like a girl when it comes to spiders and snakes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Abby murmured. \u201cI did scream because I walked right into a big web. It was all over my face\u2014my eyes and mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a creepy feeling,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a girl or not,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI feel like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014I might have screamed like a girl, too.\u201d Malachi spoke reassuringly. \u201cNothing to be embarrassed about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Roger asked. \u201cCorpses melting into the earth don\u2019t bother you, but a little old spider can drive you nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but spiders are alive and bite. Corpses lay where they\u2019re left,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cUntil the zombie apocalypse.\u201d Abby laughed nervously. \u201cBut since I\u2019m not a big believer in zombies, yeah, spiders are scarier. You can get a nasty bite from a brown recluse, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, whatever you say, Abs.\u201d Roger retrieved her fallen flashlight and handed it to her. Abby turned\u2014and crashed into a wall of earth.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Roger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a funny curve here. I think this is where the Saint Sebastian\u2019s catacombs ended. We make a little twist to the right\u2014and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s where, long ago, another church stood. I checked the old records. There was a Lutheran church here from about 1790 to 1830. It burned to the ground and there\u2019s just parkland on top of us now.\u201d</p><p>They made the turn. The earth was dug out a little differently\u2014three shelves to a wall instead of four and there were no corpses in them.</p><p>Casting the beam of his flashlight around, Malachi said, \u201cThese shelves seem to be empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were probably dug out, and the dead reinterred, after the church burned down. They might\u2019ve been brought to Bonaventure Cemetery. I do know that the dead from some churches were reinterred, or whatever one calls it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Malachi agreed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re...not all empty,\u201d Abby said. She was across from Malachi, inspecting the middle shelf. She brought her light up, illuminating the space, and gasped.</p><p>\u201cAbby!\u201d Roger shook his head, laughing. \u201cThere are going to be spiders down here!\u201d</p><p>She turned. Her eyes, bluer than the sky, were caught in the glow of the light.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a spider,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a corpse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are corpses all over!\u201d Roger protested.</p><p>\u201cNot like this,\u201d Abby said, and her tone was weak.</p><p>Malachi moved past her, hunkering down to get a good look at the body on the middle shelf that had been dug into the earth by hands that had lived in a far past day.</p><p>There was, indeed, a \u201cfresh\u201d corpse on the shelf.</p><p>It was that of a young woman. He had little medical training, but he\u2019d seen his share of corpses.</p><p>He estimated that this one had been there about a month. She had bloated and browned, her skin tightening over her frame. She\u2019d worn a baby-doll dress and still had one shoe; the other was missing.</p><p>The third finger on her left hand was missing, too.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not going to be much of a secret tunnel anymore,\u201d Roger said, leaning against the trunk of Jackson Crow\u2019s car.</p><p>They\u2019d been down there for a long time after discovering the corpse. Malachi had called it in to Jackson Crow, and Jackson had arrived with David Caswell and Kat Sokolov. They\u2019d all been down in the tunnels waiting for Kat. She\u2019d brought a medical bag and had gloved her hands and made a cursory inspection of the corpse where she lay.</p><p>Two crime scene techs had come behind them, bearing a litter. Scoops of earth were taken, bright lights beamed within the tunnel and the corpse was photographed from every conceivable angle. They\u2019d been asked if they\u2019d moved anything at all and, of course, they hadn\u2019t. With David, Jackson, Malachi, Kat and two crime scene techs down in the tunnel, it had grown crowded. Roger and Abby had moved back through the tunnels to the priestly vault beneath the altar, and then up to the main church and out into the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Malachi had said to Roger. \u201cThe paperwork awaits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger, the tunnel couldn\u2019t have been your secret. Someone else has definitely been down there,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cThank God you said that! I was hoping you didn\u2019t think I managed to get that corpse down there. Oh, well, if I had put the corpse there, I wouldn\u2019t have taken you down to find it. Unless, of course, I was trying to throw you off by bringing you down there to discover the corpse. Oh! Hey, don\u2019t get any ideas! I obviously watch too many police shows on TV. I swear\u2014I haven\u2019t been down that far in ages. I\u2019ve known about the tunnels under the church. A lot of the other guides in town know about them, too, but...mostly, we honor the city\u2019s rulings on what we can and can\u2019t show people. Like I said, it\u2019s private property, so trespassing is against the law. I wouldn\u2019t bring the average tourist down there. You know that, right? You believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I believe you, Roger,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord! Are the police going to believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what other people will believe, but as far as I know, there isn\u2019t anyone out there who thinks you\u2019ve been running around murdering tourists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t murder tourists. I make my living off tourists.\u201d Roger shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not the type to murder tourists because they gave a lousy tip or didn\u2019t tip at all. I mean, there\u2019ve been a few I wanted to slap, but even then...survival wins out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger, I\u2019ve wanted to slap a few tourists over the years, too,\u201d Abby said, obviously trying to lighten the tone. As she spoke, the main doors to the church opened and the two crime scene techs appeared, bearing the litter holding the corpse\u2014now covered with a clean white sheet\u2014out to the ambulance. The others emerged into the sunlight behind them. Kat Sokolov waved and headed for the ambulance; she wasn\u2019t letting this corpse out of her sight. Jackson Crow, Malachi and David Caswell strode toward them.</p><p>\u201cCan you come down to the station and sign statements?\u201d David asked Roger and Abby. \u201cNo way out of record keeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, sure.\u201d Roger looked at Malachi and winced. \u201cI did tell you that these tunnels aren\u2019t on the beaten tourist path.\u201d</p><p>Malachi patted his shoulder. \u201cNot to worry. I told David that I insisted on going down there and that we were on federal law enforcement business. Your reputation as a tour guide will remain absolutely spotless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Roger said a little huskily.</p><p>\u201cPile in,\u201d Jackson told them. \u201cI\u2019ve got my old federal-issue SUV. We\u2019ll all fit.\u201d</p><p>They did pile in; David Caswell and Jackson Crow were in front.</p><p>Abby was in the back between Malachi and Roger. Despite Malachi\u2019s words, Roger was still agitated. He seemed nervous the entire time they were at the station, although Malachi did most of the talking and they were both merely asked if they had anything to add. When Malachi was asked why he\u2019d felt it was important to get down into the tunnels, he said flatly, \u201cI believe that the person or persons killing young women in Savannah now thinks of himself as some kind of pirate. I believe that he\u2014or he and his accomplice\u2014kidnaps these young women and brings them through to the river via the various tunnels.\u201d</p><p>Eventually, the statements were signed and they were free to go. Jackson drove back to the Dragonslayer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow. Lord. Oh, God,\u201d Roger moaned when they pulled into the parking lot at the tavern. He looked at Abby as if everything that had happened today was finally hitting him. \u201cThere was a dead girl in the tunnel. Not long dead. Newly dead.\u201d</p><p>She laid a hand on his arm. \u201cYou brought us there and we found her. That\u2019s a good thing, Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead. How can that be good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFinding her could help us catch the killer,\u201d Abby replied.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll still be dead,\u201d Roger said dully.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Malachi added, \u201cthe fact that her body\u2019s been found could bring some solace to her family. For those left behind, there\u2019s comfort in knowing that a killer is brought to justice.\u201d</p><p>Roger got out of the car. \u201cUh, did you want more of a tour?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cBut if I have any questions about the city, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, all right. I\u2019ll probably be in the Dragonslayer later,\u201d Roger muttered. \u201cMight see you then.\u201d</p><p>They watched him walk to his car. \u201cThat was good of you,\u201d Abby told Malachi. \u201cIt was really kind of you to speak to him the way you did. I know he was afraid he was a suspect.\u201d</p><p>Malachi looked at her. \u201cHe is a suspect,\u201d he said.</p><p>Abby frowned.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s a suspect right now,\u201d Jackson explained. \u201cLet\u2019s go into the Dragonslayer. We\u2019ll see what Will\u2019s managed with the cameras so far.\u201d</p><p>Abby walked slowly toward the restaurant. She had a sick feeling inside. She believed in Roger; they\u2019d gone to high school together!</p> <p>But she believed in Dirk as well, and their other customers and Macy and...</p><p>It didn\u2019t have to be anyone close to her. Maybe the Dragonslayer had been used, just as, perhaps, the Black Swan had been used.</p><p>She took a deep breath and entered the restaurant.</p><p>It was after lunch but before dinner. Will Chan was at the bar talking to Dirk, Aldous and Bootsie.</p><p>Malachi walked over as if he\u2019d known the four of them all his life. \u201cHey, Dirk. How are you? Have you heard that our Mr. Chan\u2019s a fine actor and magician?\u201d</p><p>Dirk nodded absently. \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t look all right. He was parchment-white. He turned to Malachi anxiously. \u201cAccording to the TV news, another body was just found in a tunnel. A woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Helen,\u201d Malachi assured him.</p><p>\u201cBut how do you know?\u201d Dirk asked.</p> <p>\u201cPoor girl was dead long before Helen disappeared,\u201d Malachi told him. He rested a hand on Dirk\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe bad news is that a number of young women have lost their lives. The good news is that the local police and the feds are working hard on the case. The streets will be full of police and agents who know what they\u2019re looking for and I\u2019d bet money that, with these combined efforts, the truth will come out and the killer will be caught.\u201d</p><p>Dirk nodded. \u201cDid you work today?\u201d Malachi asked him.</p><p>\u201cI took the first tour group out. I let the guys handle the second. My other actress was back so...I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s doing fine,\u201d Bootsie said.</p><p>\u201cI was telling him that if he wanted, I\u2019d head out with him tomorrow,\u201d Will put in. \u201cI\u2019d love to play pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tours are fun,\u201d Abby said. She felt as though she was playing a part at that moment. Pretending everything was normal. Pretending that the Dragonslayer would go on as it always had, and that Gus would be there in spirit. Women were not dead and missing\u2014and Gus had not been suspicious of anything before he died.</p><p>Malachi\u2019s phone rang and he answered it, stepping aside. When he hung up, he and Jackson seemed to share some kind of intuitive exchange.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to run out,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll show Abby the cameras we\u2019ve got set up.\u201d Jackson nodded to Will, who nodded back.</p><p>\u201cSee you all later,\u201d Malachi told them. He offered her a strange smile. She sensed that he was trying to tell her he wasn\u2019t avoiding her, but that he didn\u2019t want to be heard by anyone else. That the connection between them was private. She smiled in return.</p><p>As he left the restaurant, Macy came up to her. \u201cHave you eaten anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry right now. I\u2019ll eat soon, Macy, I promise,\u201d Abby replied.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to show her what I\u2019ve been up to all day,\u201d Will explained to Macy. He slipped an arm around Abby\u2019s shoulders. \u201cCome and see your new security system. We\u2019ll start upstairs.\u201d</p><p>He headed up the stairs, Abby behind him and Jackson at her heels. \u201cFirst camera,\u201d Will said, \u201ccovers the hall here, in front of the apartment. It\u2019ll show up on computer screens in the parlor area of the apartment, and in the living room at your house.\u201d He opened the door to the apartment. A large screen, divided into eight sections, was set up on a portable table with a chair in front of it. \u201cDown at the bottom\u2014with the strange light filter\u2014that\u2019s the tunnel. Here, upper left, you have the hall. Then you have the storage room and the employee lockers and lounge area. Below that you\u2019ve got the bar and the front entry, and the two back-to-back dining rooms. Your last camera covers the outside, the whole structure of the building. I want to make sure we can see anyone trying to get in through any other entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. Very high-tech,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I do love computers and cameras,\u201d Will told her. \u201cBut I plan to be on Dirk\u2019s ship tomorrow. We\u2019ll have Kat and Angela manning these cameras, just watching what\u2019s going on\u2014and trying to see if anything is going on. Frankly, I think this guy moves around. I think he uses different routes to get to the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Abby murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe cameras will help.\u201d Will smiled at her. \u201cI guess you have a guardian angel of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Will looked at Jackson.</p><p>\u201cThe pirate,\u201d Jackson said, smiling, too.</p><p>\u201cDid you get Blue on film?\u201d she asked incredulously.</p><p>Will shook his head. \u201cHe passed by while I was setting up the camera in the tunnel. He didn\u2019t speak to me, but he nodded, as if he approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him. I haven\u2019t seen Blue since he led me to Gus,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cI assume he\u2019s keeping watch. That\u2019s what he does for the Dragonslayer. He really is your guardian angel,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all learned that there\u2019s really no point in questioning how and when the dead choose to communicate with us. Or why some stay\u2014and some leave. We just work with them whenever they\u2019re willing to work with us.\u201d</p><p>Abby nodded. \u201cThank you for coming here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at very much the same thing as with the other killings,\u201d Kat told Malachi. \u201cShe was struck on the head. But the actual cause of death was drowning. And, as I\u2019m sure you already noted, third finger of the left hand is gone. I\u2019d say she\u2019s been dead a good three to four weeks. Do you see the marks on her wrists? They suggest she was bound by some kind of rough rope. But, you\u2019ll notice, there are bruises on her arms. I think she fought back.\u201d</p><p>Malachi nodded. This poor girl didn\u2019t look real anymore.</p><p>\u201cHas she been identified?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe police are going through missing-person reports,\u201d Kat said, \u201cand Jackson has sent what information we have to the national database back at the offices. So far, we don\u2019t have an identity for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would probably put her into the same category as the other women,\u201d Malachi said slowly. \u201cShe was a tourist, perhaps on her own. Or maybe she was here looking for work. Maybe she was just passing through\u2014so people are searching for her somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish there was more I could say, more I could tell you.\u201d</p><p>Malachi took a step closer to the corpse, setting his hand gently on her arm. He felt nothing except her cold, lifeless skin.</p><p>\u201cI tried that,\u201d Kat murmured.</p><p>Malachi nodded; he wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over the other autopsies, looking for anything,\u201d Kat said. \u201cOh, there\u2019s one other thing I should tell you. We did match the finger to a victim.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he blanked. \u201cWho?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt belonged to the first victim, Ruth Seymour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer must have been carrying it around,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cDavid has all the information for the reports. He was disturbed, of course, that Gus hadn\u2019t called the police. But it\u2019s too late to ask Gus why he didn\u2019t. Maybe he was afraid he\u2019d be a suspect himself? We\u2019ll never know. But at least we found out where the finger belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kat.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to the Dragonslayer now. There\u2019s something forming in my mind. I\u2019m not sure yet what it is. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry it up if you can,\u201d Kat broke in. \u201cWe have a girl out there who might still be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Jackson Crow left the Dragonslayer to head back to Abby\u2019s house on Chippewa Square to meet up with Angela. They were doing character studies on everyone associated with or working in the area of the river. He didn\u2019t tell Abby that they were concentrating on employees and frequent customers of Dirk\u2019s tour ship and the Dragonslayer. He didn\u2019t need to tell her, she knew.</p><p>Alone in the apartment, Abby watched everything revealed by the newly installed cameras. She was fascinated as she went from screen to screen; once the dinner hours began, customers came and went.</p><p>Bootsie, Aldous and Dirk remained at the bar. When he wasn\u2019t busy with other customers, Sullivan hung out there and chatted with them.</p><p>She watched as Macy spoke with Grant Green, giving him the day\u2019s report. She could see Macy go up the stairs and into the manager\u2019s office. Macy gathered up her belongings. She hesitated at the door to the apartment as if she meant to knock, but didn\u2019t. Instead, she walked downstairs, obviously preparing to leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abby thought about stopping her; she didn\u2019t.</p><p>As she stared at one of the screens, she gasped. She\u2019d been looking at the dining room with the grate to the tunnel and the image of Blue Anderson. But as she watched, Blue seemed to step out of his own image. He peered into the grate, then slipped through.</p><p>Abby jumped up and hurried down the stairs. Luckily, it was growing later by then. There were a few diners but none near the image of Blue. Rather than taking the main stairway, she hurried to the back of the storage room and came down the winding stone steps. At the grate, she fell to her knees and opened the combination lock that held the grating closed. She\u2019d moved casually, but quickly and silently. With the grate open, she caught hold of the sides and slid down, hopping the last foot. It was dark in the tunnel but she\u2019d come with her light and her Glock\u2014she wasn\u2019t taking chances.</p> <p>She shone the light over the tunnel.</p><p>There was something\u2014someone\u2014in the shadows.</p><p>She lifted the light higher.</p><p>For a moment, it was as if she saw Blue in the flesh, he was that solid and real to her. He seemed to stand there in living color.</p><p>\u201cBlue.\u201d She whispered his name.</p> <p>He looked at her, then turned and walked toward the river. Then he paused and looked back. He seemed to be waiting for her to follow.</p><p>She did.</p><p>The tunnel twisted and meandered and came to an end near the Savannah River. At one time, the entrance had been even closer to the river, but now it opened onto grass and parkland. The original hatch had been welded shut, but ancient, metal, ladderlike steps led up to the newer hatch.</p><p>She was in the area where she\u2019d found Gus.</p><p>Abby tried not to remember finding him and realizing he was dead.</p><p>Determined, she fumbled with the grate and pushed at it; years ago, it had been set over the tunnel for public safety. It was supposed to be sealed. At first, she thought it was, that it wouldn\u2019t give, wouldn\u2019t budge.</p> <p>Then, to her amazement, it did.</p><p>She pushed hard and hoisted herself out. She heard the lap of water against the supporting wall.</p><p>She hurried over to the wall, staring at the river.</p><p>She could see something there. Something in the darkness of the water.</p><p>Something that...moved.</p><p>Abby cried out and forgot everything else. She kicked off her shoes and removed her jacket and plunged into the Savannah River.</p><p>8</p><p>Leaving the morgue, Malachi drove straight back to the Dragonslayer. The historic district of Savannah was beautiful, even by night. Great oaks dripped moss onto streets where the architecture whispered of the past. Flowers bloomed copiously in beautifully grown yards and night-lights lay gently all around.</p> <p>When he\u2019d parked, he wasn\u2019t ready to go in.</p><p>He sat remembering all the times he felt he\u2019d been cursed with his strange ability to talk to the dead. In his generation, it had been his and his alone. Zachary had told him once that his grandmother had been able to talk to spirits and she\u2019d explained to him that it was just like sound. Some folks could simply see and hear what others couldn\u2019t quite grasp or get into their field of vision.</p><p>He\u2019d quickly learned not to talk about it. But when he\u2019d seen the dead and the dead had been able to help him, show him where to go\u2014show him how to stop a dangerous situation\u2014he\u2019d had no recourse but to act. And so people had thought he was psychic. Friends had trusted him for whatever it was they believed he had. Luckily, the jerks and idiots had left him alone, either scornful or intimidated. He didn\u2019t care which.</p><p>In New Orleans, he\u2019d gotten lucky, being partnered with David Caswell. Caswell could be a by-the-book cop, but he was also a big believer in \u201cgut\u201d reactions and in hunches. Malachi had trusted in David\u2019s intuition; in turn, David had trusted him and never pressed when Malachi had known where to go to help someone, especially after the summer of storms, when a dead man had led them to his children, alive and well and praying for rescue.</p><p>The problem with this kind of \u201ctalent\u201d was that you never knew when it would kick in. And, of course, you couldn\u2019t explain to the living that ghosts were like the living; they could only tell you about a situation if they\u2019d been there at the time. Or if they\u2019d seen something. Blue, for instance, could only point him to the killer if he knew who the killer was. Blue was aware that the tunnel had been used recently. He\u2019d known Gus was in the tunnel and he had led Abby there. But unless he\u2019d actually seen the killer...</p><p>Parking, Malachi started for the restaurant. But as he approached it, he paused. A few late-nighters were walking toward the front door.</p><p>They didn\u2019t see the pirate standing there, the man in the frock coat with the rakish hat and pitch-black hair.</p><p>Blue Anderson.</p><p>But Malachi saw him and saw him clearly. Blue, he thought, was waiting for him.</p><p>He stood still but the pirate didn\u2019t come any closer. Malachi strode toward him, hoping no one was watching from inside.</p><p>When he reached Blue, he heard the crackling whistle of the man\u2019s voice on the air\u2014or he heard it in his own mind, he was never sure.</p><p>\u201cThe river. Abby is at the river. He went through this tunnel...in the midst of the flurry over Gus. I did not see him...just the leaving. And I saw the boat...saw the rowboat out. When the rowboat is out, the bodies appear. Abby is out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere, Blue, where?\u201d Malachi asked anxiously. Abby was a trained agent. She knew how to use a Glock and she surely had it with her.</p><p>Blue drew a pattern in the air. \u201cThe little park\u2014little patch of ground by the river, by the embankment. Go now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to be told twice. He began to run, heedless of the fact that he ran past the rear of several other businesses and dashed between parked cars and a monument, then tore across a street where he might have been hit by oncoming traffic.</p><p>He reached the place; he knew it, of course. He\u2019d followed the tunnel to its end when he had first arrived. He\u2019d checked the hatch, put in by the city years ago.</p><p>The hatch was unsealed?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just unsealed, it had been thrown open.</p><p>He turned toward the river. There was someone in it\u2014someone swimming, towing another person. He raced to the water, digging for his phone, then called Jackson and told him where he was and what was happening. Then he threw the phone aside and dove into the water.</p><p>Abby seemed to be a strong swimmer but she was slowing down. She had a young woman in a life-saving hold as she swam toward the embankment. He made his way to her with strong, hard strokes, swimming as quickly as he could. The current was fierce that night.</p><p>She seemed startled as he approached her. He saw her eyes widen with alarm. He could almost see her mind working as she weighed her options in fighting off an attacker while preserving the life of the victim. He saw the woman she held; she was unconscious\u2014possibly dead. A trickle of blood streamed through the water but he couldn\u2019t figure out its source. As the water sloshed around them, he saw that the skin on the woman\u2019s wrists was raw and red, badly chafed.</p><p>She\u2019d recently been bound. And she was bleeding\u2014she might be alive.</p><p>He realized that Abby was trying to kick away from him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, it\u2019s Malachi!\u201d he said.</p><p>He saw relief flood her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take over,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He had no idea how far she\u2019d swum out, and knowing her as he was beginning to know her, she would have made it in with her burden.</p><p>But she was tiring.</p><p>When she nodded, he slipped his arm around the woman\u2019s torso and Abby eased her hold. The woman seemed to be dressed in voluminous clothing; in fact, the weight of her clothes was enough to have drowned her.</p><p>The sound of sirens was loud in the night. Abby began to swim toward the embankment and he followed. River water lapped into his mouth, and as he neared the embankment, he felt sea grass pull at his feet. But he was there.</p><p>He saw Jackson leaning over the supporting wall, grasping Abby\u2019s arms. Abby was hauled up. \u201cHang on!\u201d Jackson called to him. A moment later, he saw paramedics and police divers. Two more men jumped in, as well as a floating stretcher. The rescue team relieved him of his burden. He saw Jackson reaching down again and he grasped his friend\u2019s arms, grateful for the assistance.</p><p>Abby stood near him, shivering. He walked over to her without thinking and put his arms around her. He felt chilly in the night air, as well. They were both cold, but together, they seemed warmer.</p><p>They watched in silence as the rescue workers hoisted the stretcher from the water. When the stretcher and the woman on it were brought up, the EMTs started artificial respiration. He listened to the counts as two men worked together, trying to breathe life into the victim.</p><p>Water suddenly spurted from the woman\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive?\u201d Abby whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive,\u201d an EMT said.</p><p>Malachi saw the river-diluted blood that was smeared on much of her tangled clothing. He winced, suspecting what it signified.</p><p>Abby began to shake in earnest.</p><p>Malachi held her more tightly. \u201cPretty incredible, Abby,\u201d he told her. \u201cA few more minutes in that river with all that clothing tangled around her... She wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance.\u201d</p><p>Abby looked at him, her blue eyes enormous against the ashen color of her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Helen, Malachi. It\u2019s Helen Long. And thank God, she\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>Hard to believe how quickly the media arrived on the scene.</p><p>Or maybe not. The newscasters followed calls for police and rescue vehicles.</p><p>David Caswell moved to keep the media at bay, but before anyone could decide what information to keep secret, someone had guessed that the missing Helen Long had been found, and reporters immediately began setting up, even while rescue personnel and police worked the scene.</p><p>Abby stood there shivering, watching it all, grateful for Malachi at her side. And grateful that David was shielding them from inquisitive\u2014and sometimes aggressive\u2014reporters.</p><p>The situation seemed personal to her, very personal. She was grateful; they\u2019d saved a woman.</p><p>They\u2019d saved a woman she knew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Helen Long was rushed to the hospital, and Jackson climbed into the ambulance to drive with her. Soaking wet, Abby and Malachi again made the drive to the police station, where David Caswell met them. Encased in blankets, they gave more statements.</p><p>David kept them as briefly as possible. He looked at Abby curiously and asked how she\u2019d known Helen was in the river. Abby told him she hadn\u2019t known\u2014she\u2019d just been there and seen the disturbance in the water. They called Jackson at the hospital before they left; Helen Long was still unconscious. But the doctors hoped she\u2019d make a complete recovery.</p><p>When they returned to the Dragonslayer, Grant Green and Sullivan were just shutting down, and Abby realized they\u2019d gone into the wee hours of the morning.</p> <p>It had been a long day. They\u2019d found the body of one dead woman\u2014unknown, but surely loved and missed, and there would be sad news for a family somewhere.</p><p>But, she reminded herself again, they\u2019d also saved a woman. Someone she knew and even considered a friend.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, you both look like bloody hell!\u201d Grant told them.</p><p>\u201cWe took a swim,\u201d Malachi said. He didn\u2019t mention Helen, but Abby knew everyone would hear about it soon enough. No need to come up with something clever to explain their sodden shape.</p><p>\u201cA good swim. We found Helen,\u201d Abby said.</p> <p>\u201cYou found her?\u201d Sullivan demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe was in the river,\u201d Abby explained.</p><p>\u201cYou just found her\u2014in the river?\u201d Grant asked. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s wonderful! I haven\u2019t had the news on. Oh, no, wait, is she...dead?\u201d he asked, the last word a whisper.</p><p>Abby shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s alive. They\u2019ve taken her to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...then she\u2019ll be able to tell them what happened,\u201d Grant said. \u201cThank God! The cops will catch this bastard. Maybe he\u2019ll resist arrest and they\u2019ll have to shoot him. That would be justice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant, we have courts for justice, but, yes, we hope she\u2019ll be able to tell the police what happened to her,\u201d Abby said.</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t said anything yet?\u201d Sullivan asked.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t conscious,\u201d Malachi answered.</p><p>Sullivan let out a sigh. \u201cBut she will regain consciousness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hoping for a full recovery,\u201d Abby told him.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d Grant breathed.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank God,\u201d Sullivan echoed.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Grant wrinkled his nose and stepped back. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a lot to clean up that river, but you two are pretty disgusting. Abby, that hairstyle\u2014plastered to your face\u2014is not your best. We\u2019ll finish locking up. You two go take showers. And get some sleep. We\u2019ll take care of this place. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing now,\u201d Abby said.</p> <p>She turned and started up the stairs. \u201cGood night, you two,\u201d Malachi said. He followed Abby and they went into the apartment together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not locked,\u201d Malachi noted.</p><p>\u201cI rushed out,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just take a quick look around, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Malachi went down the hall. His \u201clook\u201d wasn\u2019t really that quick. She heard him open doors and she was pretty sure he checked under the beds. When he returned to the living room, he headed straight to the bank of cameras. He knew how to use the equipment, running through the time they\u2019d been out, scanning it all, screen by screen. He sat back after a minute. \u201cNope, no one even tried this door. Sullivan came up at about nine to get two bottles of bourbon. Grant came and worked in the office for a while.... Everyone else just worked. All seems well here.\u201d He looked over at her. \u201cWhy did you go to the river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a shadow by the grating\u2014it was Blue. He led me all the way through the tunnel and to the river. Malachi, the hatch was open. It should have been sealed.\u201d</p><p>Malachi drummed his fingers on the computer desk. \u201cWhen you found Gus, he was at the end of the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police and emergency crews came, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...well, no one checked the hatch.\u201d</p><p>Malachi pulled out his cell. He called David and winced when his friend answered, then covered his phone. \u201cSounds like I woke him and he\u2019s cranky,\u201d he said. But she could dimly hear David\u2019s voice; he might\u2019ve just fallen asleep, but he was already awake, telling Malachi he\u2019d get crews right on it.</p><p>He walked over to the apartment door and locked it. Smiling, he said, \u201cDespite Grant\u2019s comment, I\u2019m not sure you could find a bad hairstyle, Agent Anderson. Even dank from the river, you don\u2019t look bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. We\u2019re locked in, so we\u2019re fine, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAnd I have some news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found out about the finger\u2014from Gus\u2019s drawer,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belonged to Ruth Seymour. The first victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus couldn\u2019t have known that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe he could have. But I do believe he called you because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not the police?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe must have been worried\u2014and perhaps he knew you\u2019d never suspect him of such brutality, but the police might. Still...I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve changed anything if he had called them.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I know Gus was doing his best.\u201d She gave him a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go do the same,\u201d he said.</p><p>Abby walked down the hallway to her own room. She stripped, but before she went into the shower, she tended to her Glock. This wasn\u2019t a night she wanted to discover that she\u2019d damaged her service weapon. When she was sure it had dried properly and was back in good shooting order, she set it in a drawer of her bedside table, then finally walked into the shower. The heat that suffused her, the sense of being clean again, was almost sinfully delicious.</p><p>When she emerged, she slipped into a terry robe and returned to the living room. A figurehead gazed sternly down at her from the far wall; she smiled, looking at the various flags that adorned the walls. Gus had loved his heritage, loved this place.</p><p>She loved it, too. No monstrous killer making use of it would change that. She would find him.</p><p>She sat down to check the screens. There was no movement anywhere in or near the Dragonslayer.</p><p>As Malachi came out of Gus\u2019s room, she stood up. She saw that he was wearing a blue terry robe, his dark hair slicked back and wet. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d he asked her huskily.</p><p>\u201cQuiet. Just like it should be.\u201d</p><p>She sat at the computer table again and he leaned over her to study the screens. She became very aware of the heat of his body and couldn\u2019t help thinking that he might be naked under the robe. She was naked under hers.... She focused on his face as he watched the screen. She noted again the character that seemed etched in the rugged planes of his cheekbones and jaw. She felt the vitality of his muscles.</p><p>\u201cLooks good,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd these same screens are on at your home. Someone will be up all night\u2014they\u2019ll take shifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to take a shift?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re the principal agents,\u201d he told her. \u201cI admit I\u2019m new to this, too, but I did spend some time getting to know the people in both Krewes. Usually there are one\u2014or sometimes two\u2014agents closest to what\u2019s happening. The people most connected to the situation. That\u2019s us, in other words. So...we sleep when we can. The others cover the watches and do the research on people, places or possible suspects.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t really listening. There was something exceptionally compelling about the scent of soap on newly washed male flesh. There was something about...him.</p><p>He looked from the screen, into her eyes. She saw a sudden change in their mercurial hazel color.</p><p>Time passed, and then he touched her face, his fingers caressing and following the lines of her cheeks and jaw. She stood up, coming straight into his arms, and when his hands fell away, it was only because he needed them to pull her against him.</p><p>He kissed her, a pressure on her lips that was, at first, a request. She drew closer to him, responding, parting her lips, welcoming his tongue. Arousal swept through her, and she continued to feel the hunger of his lips, his touch. They seemed to stand there for an eternity, their kiss going on and on. It was as if a kiss were a brand-new thing, as if they\u2019d invented it.</p><p>But in time, the kiss wasn\u2019t enough, and she felt his hands under her robe, moving along her skin. His touch was almost...reverential. She threaded her fingers through his hair, moved closer and closer to him. And as they stumbled in their haste to touch and kiss again and again he whispered, \u201cBedroom.\u201d</p><p>She whispered back, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled sharply, his teeth grating. \u201cWait. We have to slow down. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI am. I wasn\u2019t planning on anything, but I\u2019m on the Pill.\u201d</p><p>He returned her smile.</p><p>They made their way down the hall, still touching, still kissing, crashing into a wall here and there. Finally they reached her bedroom and they fell onto the softness of her bed, the robes a tangle around them. Straddling her, Malachi wrangled out of his robe and helped remove hers. He paused for a minute, and she wasn\u2019t sure what went through his mind. She didn\u2019t care; she rose against him, loving the feel of her breasts against the heat of his chest. Again, they kissed, still kissing as they eased back down.</p><p>She felt him slide down the length of her body. She felt his touch, so evocative, so arousing that she was nearly delirious. Her life had been the Dragonslayer and the academy for so long...but she knew that wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Nothing would have mattered. There were people who changed reality for others, created magic for them, and Malachi was that magic for her. She had never wanted anyone so much, never felt so afire, so hungry. And his every touch fulfilled her. His intimacy brought her almost to the brink, teased her and let her slip to become almost insanely aroused again. And then, he thrust deeply into her, filled her, and his movements elicited that same fevered urgency. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The world around her seemed to spin, to disappear, and yet to become achingly real. She was fascinated by his touch. His hair, the wicked movement of his muscles. She arched and writhed against him until the fire within her seemed to explode. She felt him explode within her as well, and for a moment, she simply luxuriated in the sensation of winding down. When she did, she felt the coolness of the air around them and she smiled. Sex wasn\u2019t new; it was as old as life on earth. And yet she couldn\u2019t help feeling that they had somehow reinvented the wonder of it all that night.</p><p>She smoothed back a lock of her hair and curled up against his chest. \u201cIs...was that allowed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She saw the curve of his lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask anyone\u2019s permission.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s okay. Jackson is with Angela. Will is with Kat. We have two other couples in the teams. Maybe it has to do with our unique talents.\u201d He rolled so that they faced each other. \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019s because, somehow, these situations just bring us together with the most fascinating people in the country.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again and leaned back, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m fascinating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bit unusual yourself, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never have imagined...\u201d</p><p>He rose up on one elbow, gazing down at her. \u201cActually, I\u2019d never imagined any of this. I made a rather awkward start of it. My social graces may be a bit...lacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cYour other skills aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her once more. She\u2019d never, ever believed a kiss could be so deep, do so much, enter her every cell.</p><p>That kiss...</p> <p>They began making love again, more slowly at first, and then more frantically, and when they\u2019d finished she lay in his arms. She thought they\u2019d talk afterward, but they didn\u2019t. Exhaustion must have overwhelmed her. She fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear when the kitchen crew arrived in the morning.</p><p>She didn\u2019t awaken until she felt Malachi bolt up and go running out to the living area. Then she became aware of the sound of a ringing phone.</p><p>A minute later, he returned to the bedroom, pausing naked and perfect in the doorway. His tone was strange\u2014anxiety combined with regret. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get moving,\u201d he told her. \u201cHelen Long is conscious and talking. We have to get to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Jackson was there to meet them when they arrived.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing all right. She\u2019s suffering from dehydration more than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has she said so far?\u201d Malachi asked.</p> <p>\u201cVery little. She\u2019s only been conscious for a couple of hours, and David asked her what she remembered, who hurt her, but she still seemed disoriented. David thought she might be better once Abby got here,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd she might have had enough time now to reorient and remember at least some of what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Malachi nodded and looked at Jackson. \u201cWas I right about what I saw? She was bleeding in the water. I figured she had to be alive but I couldn\u2019t see the injury. Was her ring finger taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She cried for a while when she realized that. In fact, the hospital staff had to sedate her. She\u2019s calmer now, but still lucid,\u201d Jackson told them. \u201cThere was a plastic surgeon on duty and he explained that they could do a prosthetic that she\u2019d hardly notice. Then, of course, she cried because she\u2019s grateful to be alive.\u201d He turned to Abby. \u201cShe knows you saved her, although she can\u2019t figure out how you knew she\u2019d be in the middle of the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw movement,\u201d Abby murmured.</p><p>Jackson didn\u2019t question that. \u201cDid you notice what she was wearing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot of fabric,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cLet me guess\u2014she was dressed as a wench?\u201d</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cShe was wearing a costume like the one she wears when she works on the Black Swan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if we can get her to tell us anything,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>Helen Long\u2019s hospital room was fairly large, which was a good thing since David Caswell, Jackson Crow, Abby and Malachi were all huddled in it, trying to be mindful of the patient but eager to hear what she had to say.</p><p>Malachi was aware of the hum of the IV monitors, of the hospital staff tending to the sick and injured. Outside the door was a chair; an officer would sit there day and night. They feared that whoever had wanted Helen dead would know where she was\u2014and come back to finish the job.</p><p>Helen looked pale as she lay against the pillows. She was weak, but her eyes were bright and her mind seemed to be clear.</p><p>\u201cHelen, Abby is here now. She\u2019d like to talk to you. I know you can do it,\u201d Jackson said gently.</p><p>Helen looked at Abby and tried to smile. \u201cThank you!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHelen, thank you. You made it,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Helen\u2019s eyes touched Malachi\u2019s for a minute. \u201cAnd thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019re a survivor, Helen. And we believe in your strength. You\u2019re going to help us catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Helen glanced down at her bandaged hand. It looked as if tears were welling in her eyes again but she blinked them furiously away.</p><p>Abby said, \u201cPlease, Helen, tell us\u2014how did he get you? Or how did they get you? Please, help us catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can catch him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cTell us what happened,\u201d Malachi urged.</p><p>Helen took a deep breath and began. \u201cI met a man on the Black Swan one day. He told me he wanted to bring a tourist attraction to Savannah. He wanted to open a haunted house. A pirate-themed haunted house. He was nice\u2014just pleasant, not lecherous\u2014and when we spoke, he was easy to talk to. He asked me if I could make any suggestions about properties that might be available and would work for a haunted house. I told him I knew the best guide in the city\u2014Roger, of course\u2014and that I knew where he might find the perfect spot. I said he\u2019d have to follow certain historical guidelines, especially since it\u2019s owned by a private restoration society. But the society hasn\u2019t had the funds to restore it. Anyway, I got one of Roger\u2019s maps and I remembered what I\u2019d learned about the old church. Roger and I had talked about it. I had his map, I walked around, using it, and I was going to get together with the man I met on the Black Swan. It was...before Gus\u2019s funeral, after we were all talking one afternoon\u2014at the Dragonslayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone remembers that day,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought we were meeting in the parking lot at the tavern, but I didn\u2019t see him. Instead, there was a note on my car, along with his business card. He said to meet him at the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen,\u201d Malachi asked urgently, \u201cwhat did this man look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. He was just a businessman. Maybe about six feet tall? I guess he was getting started early on his whole pirate-theme thing. He had long hair and a beard and mustache. Dark. You could barely see his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know him? Had you ever seen him before?\u201d</p><p>Helen frowned. \u201cThere was something familiar about him...I feel I should have known him, but I didn\u2019t. Or maybe he reminded me of someone I knew, but I couldn\u2019t place who it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>Helen frowned. \u201cChris...Chris Condent. Christopher on the card, I think. He told me to call him Chris.\u201d</p><p>Malachi didn\u2019t allow a flicker of change on his face but his mind was racing. Chris...Christopher Condent. Christopher Condent had been a pirate, active from about 1718 to 1720. After taking a great prize, he retired from the sea and lived in France until a ripe old age. He\u2019d become very rich by taking his ill-gotten gains and investing them in a career as a merchant.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Malachi said, \u201cyou found the note on your car with the man\u2019s business card, telling you to go to the church. What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went there\u2014and I was surprised. The church door was open. I figured the man had gotten hold of the owners or one of the owner\u2019s representatives and been given a key,\u201d Helen explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>Helen let out a long breath. \u201cI went in.\u201d She stopped speaking and just stared ahead.</p><p>\u201cHelen?\u201d Malachi said quietly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move; she didn\u2019t seem to hear.</p><p>Abby moved closer and squeezed her hand. \u201cHelen, please, go on.\u201d</p><p>Helen shook her head. Tears gathered in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Abby said very softly. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Helen said. \u201cI walked in and suddenly I felt a searing pain in my head. Someone or something had hit me. I didn\u2019t see anything, anything at all.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent again, her expression anguished.</p><p>Malachi nodded at Abby, and she understood what he meant. Helen knew her, trusted her. She was the one who could probe where the rest of them couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou were hit\u2014and you were unconscious. But...you came to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was tied up. My wrists were bound. And I was in a cabin. A ship\u2019s cabin. At least, I think it was a ship\u2019s cabin. It seemed like I could hear water...and whistles and ships\u2019 horns. It was dark, really dark. There were portholes or windows but they were covered and I couldn\u2019t move to try to see out.\u201d</p><p>Abby sat on the bed next to Helen. \u201cI know this is hard, but it\u2019s important. What happened next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came in,\u201d Helen said. \u201cHe came in...and he was horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Helen,\u201d Abby murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe...told me I was a captive. A pirate\u2019s captive. So I\u2019d better be good. Captives who caused problems didn\u2019t live very long. He said he\u2019d put out the call for my ransom, but if I gave him any trouble, if I tried to escape...he\u2019d kill me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you recognize this guy? Was it the businessman you met?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>Helen stared at Abby. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know if they were the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Helen?\u201d Abby asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt was...the pirate. The real pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen,\u201d Malachi said, \u201cwas it someone acting as a pirate? You said that this Chris Condent wanted to open a pirate-themed haunted house.\u201d</p><p>Helen shook her head, growing agitated. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t Chris Condent anymore. He was the pirate, the real pirate. That\u2019s who kidnapped me. And I had seen him before. He was very big and he had dark hair. Rich, dark hair. And blue eyes.\u201d She took a shuddering breath. \u201cIt was the pirate, Abby. The pirate from the Dragonslayer.\u201d</p><p>She paused, as if waiting for Abby\u2019s comprehension.</p><p>\u201cIt was Blue,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pirate, Blue Anderson.\u201d</p> <p>9</p><p>They left the hospital soon after Helen Long stated that she believed she\u2019d been kidnapped and attacked by a pirate who had been dead for well over two hundred years.</p><p>Because it was private and they could watch the Dragonslayer on the screens at Abby\u2019s home on Chippewa Square, they returned there. David Caswell met with the group and they went through everything they knew.</p><p>The house on Chippewa had been built in the early 1800s and had come to Abby\u2019s family in the 1850s. Built in the colonial style, it had a handsome porch with eight white pillars standing sentinel. The house wasn\u2019t huge; the front door opened into a hall that stretched to the rear door and small yard. A staircase led to the second floor. There were three bedrooms and a den upstairs\u2014a nursery in days gone by\u2014while on the ground floor, to the left, was a large formal dining room and the pantry-now-kitchen, while the onetime kitchen out in the yard had been turned into a little summer house. The formal parlor was to the right of the front door with the old music room behind it.</p><p>Malachi hadn\u2019t seen her actual home yet, and he was curious. It was evident that Abby hadn\u2019t spent much time there in recent years. It was impeccably clean, although not much had been changed, the television in the old music room was as old as the stereo system. The upholstery was colonial-style, as was the furniture throughout the house, except for one massive recliner.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s. He loved it. He watched Sunday football from that chair every week,\u201d Abby told Malachi.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad had one of those chairs, too,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cI admit I\u2019m fond of it. I watch football on Sunday from that chair, too. And a few other shows, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the chair. Reminds me of my dad. He was great. So was my mother. They were typical parents, I guess. My mom loved to bake and cook and she had a little business making designer baby clothes. She made all kinds of things, of course, but she especially loved baby clothes. I think she would\u2019ve liked a houseful of children.... She was always the mom in charge of food drives at school and she collected for the Red Cross. She was the epitome of the Southern lady.\u201d Abby paused, a look of fond nostalgia on her face. \u201cThey both represented the very best of Southern hospitality. My dad worked for a tech company but he spent as much time at the Dragonslayer as he could. He loved the history, but he was practical. He used to say there was money to be made on the legend of Blue, and it might as well be made by the Anderson family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they raised a daughter intent on being a federal agent,\u201d Malachi commented.</p><p>\u201cThey raised me to reach for whatever I wanted, whether that was a rocket scientist or a stay-at-home mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cThat\u2019s how kids should be raised.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Although she\u2019d been talking to him, she seemed distracted.</p><p>They\u2019d left the others in the large formal dining room, where the computer banks and screens had been set up, when Abby set off to show him the rest of the house. And while she\u2019d shown him around with casual enthusiasm, he thought it was forced.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy hearing about your family, but what is it? What\u2019s tearing at you?\u201d</p> <p>She frowned at him, hurt, confused, indignant. \u201cMy ancestor is not attacking women and throwing them in the river!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAbby, we all know the ghost of Blue is not doing this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me ghosts...could be different? Some were shy, some talked, some hid... So who\u2019s to say that some haven\u2019t gotten almost-mortal power\u2014and the ability to hurt people. But I\u2019m positive Blue isn\u2019t one of them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby,\u201d he said, aching to draw her to him, but it wasn\u2019t the time or the place. \u201cAbby, I\u2019m sure some ghosts never make contact with anyone. They might be there, but they never show themselves. Others are outgoing and curious and seek out those who might see them. Some can create cold spells or learn a certain ability to move objects. But to my knowledge, there isn\u2019t a ghost out there with the strength or energy to physically attack human beings\u2014to bind them with rope and throw them in the river. No one believes that Blue Anderson is after people.\u201d</p><p>Abby let out a breath. \u201cSo, you agree it\u2019s someone dressing up as Blue,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t doubt. Let\u2019s go see the others, discuss what we\u2019re all thinking and what moves we should make today.\u201d</p><p>Abby smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a good day so far. Helen\u2019s awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a good day,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on. I have some info I should be sharing with everyone.\u201d</p><p>In the dining room, they discovered Kat and Angela seated at the side of the room, where they could watch the screens.</p><p>Jackson was at one of the computers, a sheaf of papers in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Will?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cHe went off to spend the day on the Black Swan,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d Malachi pulled out a chair for Abby, taking a seat himself.</p><p>\u201cAnything going on at the Dragonslayer?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMacy\u2019s arrived. She\u2019s at the host stand. Looks like she\u2019s checking reservations. Sullivan is hanging glasses. Bootsie just came hobbling in. He\u2019s alone\u2014no Aldous or Dirk at the moment\u2014but David called Dirk to let him know he could see Helen, just for a few minutes. He\u2019s not going out on any of the pirate voyages today. Will\u2019s going to work with his cast instead,\u201d Angela told them.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like business as usual at the Dragonslayer,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Malachi sat forward, folding his hands on the table. \u201cThere\u2019s something I happened to catch because I started researching when I first came down here\u2014Savannah and then the Dragonslayer and pirates in general. The name Helen Long gave us was Christopher Condent. I know David Caswell is searching local records to see if anyone with that name was registered at a hotel or bed-and-breakfast or used a credit card at a restaurant, gas station, shop or any other venue. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll find such a person. I think the man Helen met chose the name because it was that of a real pirate, one who survived his days of piracy to become a rich man and live happily in France after his career on the high seas. My guess is that he intends to \u2018retire\u2019 from piracy one day and live on his proceeds, so to speak. The real Condent was born in the 1690s, fled Jamaica in 1718 when Woods Rogers came in and went on to practice all kinds of atrocities. He cut off the ears and noses of many of his captives and tortured others. He was known to be brutal to those he captured. Karma didn\u2019t ever catch up with him. He and his men captured an Arab ship worth a fortune and Condent went on to negotiate a pardon with the governor of Bourbon. He became a merchant and died fat and wealthy in France in 1770. I\u2019m telling you all this history\u2014or legend, whichever it might be\u2014because I think our killer specifically picked this pirate. This was a man who practiced atrocities, got away with it and prospered. Supposedly, he was the man behind the ever-popular Jolly Roger flags. His own flag had a row of three skulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this person wants to be a pirate and retire happily\u2014after doing horrendously cruel and brutal things\u2014why would Helen have thought she was attacked by Blue?\u201d Abby asked him. \u201cBlue was revered as a gentleman pirate. He never hurt anyone, he didn\u2019t rape his female captives and he had a strict code for his men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe this guy dresses up as Blue because Blue\u2019s such a famous pirate in Savannah. Blue\u2019s image is used at the Dragonslayer, and there are shops with his image worked into their d\u00e9cor. There\u2019s a wooden image of him down by the river, with the face cut out so people can stick their own faces in for their pictures. Then, looking at the psychology of it\u2014\u201d he glanced at Jackson, who nodded, clearly intrigued by Malachi\u2019s theory \u201c\u2014he may resent Blue, since the real Blue didn\u2019t behave the way this creep thinks a pirate should. He didn\u2019t rape, torture or murder. This killer may find it amusing to think that if he\u2019s ever seen, people will believe Blue is somehow walking the streets again and that his reputation was a lie because he was as vicious as the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s consistent is that he has to kill his victims by forcing them off his ship or boat\u2014or whatever conveyance he has them on,\u201d Abby said slowly. She looked around the room, as if assuring herself that they wanted to hear her opinions. \u201cSo, we\u2019re back to the river. He uses the underground, not so much to get his victims to the docks, but because he figures a pirate would use the tunnels to secure captives or shanghai crew members.\u201d</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cI also think this man is no tourist or newcomer to the city. I think he\u2019s known and that, until now, if he were caught in costume, he\u2019d be able to explain it easily. He\u2019d claim he was going to help out a friend\u2014like Dirk\u2014on a ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr...he is Dirk,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>Abby raised her eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t you believe that if Dirk was guilty, he\u2019d stay away from Helen?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Malachi shrugged. \u201cNot necessarily. He might be confident in his disguise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abby fell silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not accusing Dirk. I\u2019m just saying he\u2019s not off the suspect list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Dirk,\u201d Jackson said quietly. \u201cProbe into his past and find out about his every movement over the past month and, more important, the past few days. Find out exactly where he was when Helen went missing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was at the Dragonslayer,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Malachi cleared his throat. \u201cHe was with Bootsie, Sullivan, Macy, Aldous, your buddy Roger English and others when Helen was there. Which is the last time she was seen. They all said they\u2019d seen her. But we don\u2019t know now just how long any of those people were there.\u201d</p><p>Abby was silent again. Malachi saw that Kat and Angela were watching her with sympathy; it was a difficult thing to learn that those you believed in might not be all that they seemed.</p><p>\u201cSavannah is filled with ships, boats, yachts\u2014and ship\u2019s captains,\u201d Abby said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cWe realize that, and we\u2019ve been pulling names and working on investigating ships, their schedules and their crews. But, so far, the victims we know have something in common,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cThey all made meal purchases at the Dragonslayer within a few days of their disappearances.\u201d Jackson looked at the sheet in front of him. \u201cEven Rupert Holloway. He ate at the Dragonslayer two nights before he disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Abby was frustrated. She felt she should be doing more. Perhaps going back to the Dragonslayer, confronting the image of Blue Anderson and demanding he show up, have a conversation with her. She wanted to yell at him and make sure he understood that she needed his help because people had been killed. And if their killer was doing terrible things while pretending to be him, his reputation was being tarnished. He\u2019d been a good pirate\u2014good at piracy and good in that he\u2019d followed a moral code. He didn\u2019t act with wanton cruelty, the way many had.</p><p>She was still learning about ghosts, of course. And yelling at one would probably prove as effective as yelling at the air.</p><p>She and Malachi were at the riverfront. They were due to have another interview with Helen Long in a few hours. In the meanwhile, Jackson had suggested they wander down by the river and get something to eat. She was hungry, since their meals had been irregular over the past few days.</p><p>They dined on bangers and mash at one of her favorite Irish pubs. From their vantage point on the outside patio, they could see one of the reproduction paddle wheelers heading out on the river. Gulls squawked and thronged the walks and the air; tourists ambled in and out of the shops on the riverfront.</p> <p>\u201cPaddle wheelers,\u201d Abby said. \u201cHas anyone checked into those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson had the police make thorough sweeps. Not one of the captains or owners refused. They cooperated. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re looking for a paddleboat. No, we\u2019re looking for a sailing ship,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cOr maybe a rowboat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we ever going to find it now?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cWhoever\u2019s doing this must still have been on the river when you saw Helen,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>She frowned at that. \u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing any vessels. I saw Helen because...she was a shadow. She was a shadow on the river, but there was movement. I didn\u2019t really think. I plunged in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was lucky you did. Although plunging in without thinking isn\u2019t such a good idea most of the time,\u201d Malachi told her.</p><p>Abby ignored that. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll have to really see this city,\u201d Abby said, changing the subject. \u201cSavannah is so beautiful. We\u2019ve been to Colonial Park Cemetery but Bonaventure is one of the loveliest, most gracious cemeteries I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there,\u201d he reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Right. Gus\u2019s funeral,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d actually been there before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! I\u2019m sorry. A lot of people visit the city, of course, and you\u2019re not that far away, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Savannah like you do,\u201d he said. He swallowed a long drink of iced tea and set his glass down. \u201cExcellent bangers and mash, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey have great Irish music here, too. And you really should have lunch at Mrs. Wilkes\u2019s. Every morning at eleven\u2014and I mean every morning\u2014a crowd forms. It\u2019s 107 West Jones. When you go in, tourist or local, you sit at a big table with strangers and you leave with a bunch of new friends. The food\u2019s superb. Gus and my folks used to take me there when Sema Wilkes was still alive, and she was wonderful.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cThere are so many historic homes all over Savannah. There\u2019s the Historic Savannah Theater, Juliette Gordon Low\u2019s birthplace, the Massie Heritage Center, and you should take a carriage ride down the streets and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reached across the table and touched her hand. \u201cI will do all those things,\u201d he promised.</p><p>She nodded, wondering why she suddenly felt as if she\u2019d known him for a long time. She really knew so little about him....</p><p>Except, she knew she wanted to wake up beside him again. She\u2019d be disconsolate if he never touched her again, if she couldn\u2019t study his eyes or the way he smiled. Or watch him when he was working something out\u2014by logic or intuition.</p><p>Abby looked down, feeling she\u2019d gushed too much. She didn\u2019t need to be defensive; Savannah was a gem of a city.</p><p>\u201cVirginia is great, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cVirginia is great. I love Richmond. The White House of the Confederacy, Hollywood Cemetery and all the old Civil War memorials... My part of Virginia is pretty remote. But I think you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>She started to answer him; she wanted to talk about Virginia, or anything else rather than what was going on between them. But before she could say a word, she was startled by the presence of someone beside their table.</p><p>It was Roger English. \u201cHey, you two okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine, Roger.\u201d Abby smiled at him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah. I shouldn\u2019t admit it, but yesterday freaked me out. I watched the news today and it\u2019s great\u2014you fished Helen Long out of the river last night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen her, Roger, and she\u2019s doing well,\u201d Malachi told him.</p><p>\u201cDid she solve everything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the hospital, so we\u2019re trying to give her time to feel better before getting her to remember details,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Roger nodded. \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll have what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Abby asked him. \u201cDid you just happen by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to meet Bianca for lunch. But she\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be along in a few minutes,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cI really like her,\u201d Roger murmured.</p><p>Abby suddenly heard a mental echo of her own voice. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be along in a few minutes.</p><p>But she might not be.</p><p>She glanced at Malachi, who was studying Roger. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give her a call, see what\u2019s holding her up?\u201d Malachi suggested.</p><p>\u201cI have. She\u2019s not answering her cell. I tried her bed-and-breakfast, too. Couldn\u2019t reach her.\u201d</p><p>The possible explanation seemed to hit Roger as he spoke. His knees gave out; he would\u2019ve fallen if Malachi hadn\u2019t leaped to his feet to bring a chair around for him.</p><p>Roger stared at the two of them. \u201cHe\u2019s got her!\u201d he cried. \u201cCall the police! I\u2019ve got to call the police. You are the police. No, you\u2019re the feds... Oh, God. What do I do, what do I do?\u201d</p><p>Malachi already had his phone out. \u201cFirst, don\u2019t panic. People do run late. Cell phone batteries die. But under the circumstances, we\u2019ll get all the information we have on Bianca to David Caswell.\u201d</p><p>Roger looked as if he\u2019d been hit by a brick. While Malachi spoke to David on the phone, Abby asked Roger, \u201cHer name is Bianca Salzburg, right? She said she was transferring here from Chicago. Is she from Chicago? This is important, Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalzburg, yes,\u201d Roger answered. \u201cShe was born in Chicago and went to Northwestern. She works for a small shipping company that handles delicate items\u2014Pack-A-Gram, it\u2019s called. They\u2019re opening an office in Savannah. She was staying at the old Hayden house. You know the place, Abby. It was owned by Jimmy Hayden until last year when he died. His niece Shelly came back to take over the property and turned it into a B and B. She fixed it up nicely.\u201d</p><p>There was little emotion in his voice, he was so distracted.</p><p>Abby thought, but didn\u2019t say, that\u2014like the known victims\u2014Bianca had eaten at the Dragonslayer.</p><p>Malachi ended his call and made another before returning the phone to his pocket. \u201cDavid\u2019s on it and he\u2019ll be here soon. We\u2019ve reported the situation to our colleagues, as well. Bianca could show up in a few minutes, but we\u2019ll get started on the information we need, just because we\u2019re all concerned these days. So, how late is she, Roger?\u201d</p><p>Roger glanced at his watch. \u201cNow? Almost forty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy colleague Angela Hawkins is on her way here to wait with you. Meanwhile, Jackson Crow is hitting the national databases to get all the information we can on Bianca. Let\u2019s hope she shows in a few minutes, apologizing for being late and explaining that she didn\u2019t charge her phone.\u201d</p><p>Roger jumped to his feet. \u201cHelen! You have to get Helen to tell you what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll go to the hospital. She\u2019ll talk to me\u2014she\u2019ll tell us what happened. You saved her, right? She owes you, Abby. You have to make her tell you!\u201d</p><p>Malachi rose and set his hands on Roger\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLook at me, buddy. You panicking will not help Bianca. We\u2019ve spoken with Helen, and we\u2019ll speak with her again, see if we can\u2019t get some details that might help. But listen to me and try to understand. We can\u2019t force Helen to tell us what she doesn\u2019t know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d Roger protested, \u201cshe\u2019s alive! She has to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says she saw a pirate,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Roger demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks Blue Anderson attacked her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlue Anderson?\u201d Roger repeated, looking at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cRoger,\u201d Malachi said in a firm voice, \u201crelax. Sit down. You\u2019ll wait here for a while longer. We\u2019ll stay until Angela arrives. Then we\u2019ll head out and start searching for her, okay? Every cop in the city will be on the lookout, too.\u201d</p><p>Roger shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s underground somewhere. Or she\u2019s being held on a ship. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll be able to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>Abby put a hand on Roger\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you one of Gus\u2019s old fixes, okay? A cup of tea and whiskey. Calm those nerves a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Roger said huskily. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>By the time Abby snagged their waitress and got the tea for Roger, Angela had arrived. Tall, beautiful, controlled, she quickly had Roger talking to her, telling her about Bianca, how they\u2019d met, and how great she was.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Malachi told Abby.</p><p>\u201cYes, get going,\u201d Angela said. \u201cRoger and I are fine here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe check,\u201d Abby began.</p><p>Angela waved a hand. \u201cRoger and I may have something else while we\u2019re here. And Jackson may come by soon. He\u2019s already got fliers into the hands of the police, and they\u2019ll get them out right away. Of course, we could really be jumping the gun, but...\u201d</p> <p>Abby gave Roger a kiss on the head. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He nodded. He still looked as if he\u2019d been hit by a brick.</p><p>Malachi took her arm and they walked down the length of the riverfront to the parking area.</p><p>\u201cDo you actually think she\u2019s been taken?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>Malachi pursed his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe she\u2019s just blowing him off, but we can\u2019t risk it. We\u2019ll stop by the bed-and-breakfast first and then go back to the hospital to talk to Helen. We\u2019ll see if we can get some kind of clue from her. Do you know the woman who\u2019s taken over the Hayden house? Shelly, he said her name was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Gus knew everyone in town. Shelly actually lived up in Charleston. I hadn\u2019t heard that she\u2019d turned the house into a bed-and-breakfast but I\u2019m not surprised. It\u2019s a big old colonial and they put in a pool about ten years back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me where to go.\u201d</p><p>Malachi was driving. He had a good grasp of the city\u2019s grid layout, with the squares bordered by streets.</p> <p>When he\u2019d parked, Abby ran up the walk. The front door was open; she went in. The Hayden house had a broad foyer with a staircase that went straight up to a second-floor balcony. Shelly had set up a reception desk in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cHey, Abby!\u201d Shelly smiled as she greeted her. She came around the desk to give her a big hug. They didn\u2019t know each other that well, since Shelly was about five years older than Abby. But whenever she\u2019d been in town, they\u2019d seen each other often enough. Slim and attractive, she must have made a complete aboutface in her life because she\u2019d worked in Charleston as a graphic designer.</p><p>\u201cShelly, it\u2019s good to see you,\u201d Abby said, returning the hug.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Agent Anderson. I understand you\u2019re full-fledged now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d Abby said. Malachi was behind her by then. She saw Shelly\u2019s eyes widen as she looked at him and then at her. She wondered how she hadn\u2019t realized from the beginning what she clearly saw now\u2014he was an extremely attractive and arresting man. Other women seemed to respond to him instinctively.</p><p>Of course, she was doing that herself.</p><p>She gave herself a mental shake. Whatever private relationships they had, she couldn\u2019t forget her position, her chosen vocation and what they were here to do.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Shelly said to Malachi. \u201cYou two are together?\u201d She evidently approved.</p><p>\u201cShelly Hayden, Malachi Gordon. He\u2019s a private investigator and a consultant with the FBI,\u201d Abby explained. \u201cWe\u2019re here because one of your guests didn\u2019t show up for a lunch appointment, and we want to be sure she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh!\u201d Shelly said. \u201cWhich guest? Oh, it has to be Bianca Salzburg. She\u2019s registered, and then I have two retired couples and a family of four. She was fine this morning. I made quiches for breakfast and she was so sweet, really loved them. She was cheerful when she left here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was that?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout eleven,\u201d Shelly told him.</p><p>\u201cDid she say where she was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t grill people when they leave,\u201d Shelly said. \u201cSometimes they ask me about a tour or a carriage ride\u2014but if they\u2019re going out for the day, well, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my place to ask questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere your other guests down here when she had breakfast?\u201d Malachi asked next.</p><p>\u201cYes, the Mortons were sitting with her at one of the tables on the patio. I serve breakfast outside by the pool when I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they still here?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cOut by the pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Abby gestured, indicating that she wanted to walk through.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Shelly followed Malachi as he kept pace with Abby. \u201cI heard they found the girl who was working for Dirk on his Black Swan. Do you think Bianca might have been...kidnapped and assaulted by the same man? Or...I mean, it\u2019s just been a few hours. Can she really be missing?\u201d She sounded both puzzled and concerned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not taking chances,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cThis is so distressing!\u201d Shelly murmured.</p><p>The Mortons were a handsome couple in their late sixties or early seventies, who both looked fit and tan. Abby envied them for a minute. They appeared to be the kind of people who\u2019d worked hard, raised their children\u2014and survived to enjoy their golden years together.</p><p>She quickly introduced herself and said that Bianca Salzburg was probably fine, but with the sad state of events lately, they were trying to make sure.</p><p>Mrs. Morton gasped softly. \u201cOh, that lovely, lovely girl!\u201d She turned to her husband, \u201cHenry, she was so pleasant, wasn\u2019t she? She joined us for breakfast.\u201d As he nodded, she looked at Abby. \u201cThis is Bianca\u2019s first trip to Savannah. She\u2019s from Chicago, you know. Loves Chicago\u2014her family\u2019s there\u2014but she was offered a chance to manage the new office for her company if she moved to Savannah. She says that since she got here, she\u2019s been absolutely thrilled, the city\u2019s so beautiful. We told her we\u2019d been coming for years. Can\u2019t move from Philly, since our grandkids live there, but we love to spend a month in Savannah every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most beautiful cities in the world,\u201d Abby agreed. \u201cDid Bianca say anything about her plans for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes. She said she\u2019d met a nice local fellow and that she was having lunch with him. Down by the river somewhere. I forget\u2014what did she say, Henry? The Irish pub?\u201d</p><p>Henry Morton murmured. \u201cYes, Connie. The Irish pub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry, if you know something, you have to speak up,\u201d Connie Morton said.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be doing fine for both of us,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>Connie rolled her eyes. Her husband smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cShelly is pretty sure she left around eleven,\u201d Malachi told them. \u201cDoes that sound about right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, precisely right,\u201d Connie said. \u201cShe waved to us as she was walking out.\u201d</p><p>Abby thanked them; when Henry expressed serious concern about Bianca, she promised they\u2019d call the bed-and-breakfast with any news.</p><p>They bade Shelly and the Mortons goodbye and headed out.</p><p>\u201cThey were a lovely couple,\u201d Abby said as they walked to the car.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI have a feeling they\u2019ve been together for years\u2014and that they\u2019re still in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI envy them in a way.\u201d</p><p>He flashed her a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to envy anyone yet. The world\u2019s out there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. They just made me think of my parents. The world was once theirs, too. But they died before they made it to where the Mortons are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Malachi said softly, \u201cwhat they had was probably better than what many people get even if they live to be over a hundred.\u201d</p><p>That was true, but Abby missed her parents and her grandparents as much as ever and found it painful to talk about. She changed the subject back to work.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to see Helen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d When they drove alongside Colonial Park Cemetery, she was surprised when he suddenly saw a parking space and slid into it.</p><p>Abby frowned. \u201cHelen\u2019s at the hospital. Why are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I thought we\u2019d stop for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>He was already out of the car. She followed as he walked through the main entrance, beneath the arch and the great eagle. He kept moving toward the back, making straight for the bench where he\u2019d seen the ghostly old couple and pointed them out.</p><p>They weren\u2019t at the bench. They were standing by a grave.</p><p>Abby hung back and watched. She saw Malachi approach them, not speaking at first. He stood by the grave and bowed his head.</p><p>After a few minutes, Abby inched closer. Malachi spoke quietly. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he greeted the pair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss. Your son?\u201d</p><p>The man appeared startled and looked at his wife. Then he looked at Malachi again and Abby heard his voice, like paper shifting on the wind.</p><p>\u201cYou are speaking to me, young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive my intrusion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The woman nodded. \u201cYes, it is our son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is gone, you know. And you could be with him,\u201d Malachi told them.</p><p>The elderly man shook his head. \u201cSoldiers came here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey defaced Josiah\u2019s grave. Scraped off his name with their knives. We must stand guard, lest they come again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you tell me what should be on the gravestone, I can see that it\u2019s fixed,\u201d Malachi promised. \u201cThe soldiers won\u2019t come again. They were bitter because so many of their own died in the war and they behaved badly. But that war is long over\u2014it ended a century and a half ago. I swear, I will see that the gravestone is repaired. If you tell me his name and what you wish written on it, I give you my solemn vow that it will be set to rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cWith her help,\u201d Malachi said, gesturing at Abby.</p><p>She walked over to join them. \u201cSavannah is my home. I know the people who can get this done,\u201d she told them.</p><p>The man turned to her. \u201cYou would really help us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are always here,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d The man took his wife\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou must notice what goes on around here,\u201d Malachi remarked.</p><p>\u201cWe watch. We watch over this grave,\u201d the wife said.</p><p>Malachi nodded. \u201cA mother\u2019s love, a father\u2019s dedication. But perhaps you could help us, too. People are disappearing. I know the city is crowded, that tourists come daily. But...late at night, or even during the day, do you see things?\u201d</p> <p>The man studied Malachi for a long time and then slowly lifted his arm, pointing. \u201cThere is something\u2014there, on the corner\u2014something that is odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot truly odd. It was dug years and years ago,\u201d the woman said. \u201cIt is part of the old drainage system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was abandoned years ago!\u201d the man added.</p><p>The woman sniffed. \u201cAbandoned. Sealed after the horror of the yellow fever! But there were things that went on then that... I believe they thought if they could get the bodies out of the city through the sewer system, they would not infect others. They dug deep tunnels by the old hospital. But there was more that went on than was ever recorded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen anything there?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cShadows at night. By day, who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople move around,\u201d the old woman said. \u201cThere is an alley behind the first mausoleum. Sometimes a tall figure goes there...and does not come back. But there are many of us here. Many, many walk the city. Our kind. We are like shadows. And shadow-walkers may be restless by night. So what we\u2019ve seen...I am not sure. But we will watch for you,\u201d she said anxiously. \u201cIf you wish, we will watch for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy son...he fought bravely in the War of 1812. Please. His marker should read \u2018Lieutenant Josiah Beckwith, born April 9, 1790. Died for his country, September 12, 1814, at the Battle of North Point during the War of 1812. Beloved son, husband and father. A patriot.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see to it,\u201d Abby said, jotting the details on a small notepad. She prayed she could keep her promise.</p><p>The man\u2019s arm was around his wife\u2019s shoulder. He started to offer his hand, but let it fall. \u201cI am Edgar Beckwith. This is my wife, Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi Gordon,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cAnd Abigail Anderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnderson?\u201d the woman said, looking at her. \u201cAre you related to the family that owns the tavern?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYour family are good people, Ms. Anderson.\u201d</p><p>She thanked them, and Malachi took her arm. They left the old couple gazing sadly at their son\u2019s tombstone. Abby saw two young women standing by a red brick aboveground grave\u2014watching her and Malachi. She felt her cheeks growing red.</p><p>As she glanced at Malachi, embarrassed, he smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey think we\u2019re crazy, that we talk to imaginary friends,\u201d Abby muttered.</p><p>Malachi laughed. \u201cThese days? Everyone looks crazy because half the time they have headsets on or they\u2019re on the phone and they seem to be talking to themselves. So...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the Beckwiths really saw something in the alley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they did and that they\u2019ll lead us where we\u2019d eventually have gotten\u2014except we\u2019ll get there more quickly now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack beneath the ground,\u201d he said.</p><p>10</p><p>Malachi called David, asking him to send a few officers to the alley. Then he called Jackson, suggesting he get someone to do historical and architectural research on the area.</p><p>In the meantime, he told Jackson, he and Abby would drive back to the hospital to talk to Helen.</p><p>\u201cAny word on Bianca Salzburg?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He repeated her question to Jackson; no, Bianca hadn\u2019t appeared.</p><p>He and Abby got into the car and headed back to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you want to stop at the cemetery and talk to that couple?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He sent her a warm smile. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you talked to the Mortons and then told me how you envied them, I started to think about these two in the cemetery. They\u2019re there for the long haul. Some people don\u2019t care\u2014dead is dead. You move on. Others...well, honor was a big thing to them. They need that tombstone fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to convince city council and the staff in charge of the cemetery that I know how that gravestone should be corrected?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pull something out of a history book somewhere,\u201d Malachi assured her. \u201cOr some old record.\u201d</p><p>Abby stared ahead, looking tired and grim. He reached over and took her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Bianca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe holds his victims. We have time to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe assaults his victims,\u201d she said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see what Helen can tell us now that she\u2019s a little more removed from the situation,\u201d he told her.</p><p>At the hospital they learned that Helen was resting comfortably. Kat had been sitting with her; when Abby and Malachi came, she rose and stretched. \u201cI\u2019m off for a bit\u2014walk around, maybe grab some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay until you get back,\u201d Malachi said. As she moved toward the door he asked quietly, \u201cHas she given you any information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been asleep for the past hour. I suggested she try to remember details, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s telling us everything she remembers\u2014or what she thinks she saw. Maybe you can get more.\u201d</p><p>Kat left, and Abby sat beside the hospital bed. Helen\u2019s eyes flickered open and, for a moment, they registered fear\u2014until she saw Abby. \u201cHey,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Dirk came to see me.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWith Aldous and Bootsie. Aldous is a sweetheart. He told me he\u2019s been so worried, he almost grew back some hair.\u201d</p><p>Abby laughed, then glanced at Malachi.</p><p>He nodded, letting her know she should do the talking for now.</p><p>Abby drew a deep breath. \u201cHelen, we think he\u2019s taken another woman.\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s eyes closed; she went gray, trembling visibly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can help us.\u201d</p><p>Helen shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d she said, her voice raspy. \u201cI just...don\u2019t.\u201d Her eyes opened and she stared at Abby. \u201cI never believed in ghosts before. And I know he was supposed to be a gentleman pirate, and that Errol Flynn and Johnny Depp made pirates seem cool, but...it was Blue, Abby. I know it was Blue Anderson. He\u2019s dead, but somehow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen, it wasn\u2019t Blue. And even if he came back as a ghost, he\u2019d never do anything like this. It\u2019s someone dressing up as Blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Helen. You know that has to be true.\u201d</p><p>Malachi stepped forward, dragging a chair closer to Helen, across from Abby. \u201cHelen, you were hurt. You were hit on the head. You were abused and kept in a dark place. You\u2019re being wonderful, but what we need you to do is try to remember every little detail. What happened right before Abby pulled you out of the water?\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s forehead wrinkled with her effort. \u201cI remember hearing water. I remember it being dark, and I remember the man...Blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Blue. It was someone dressed as Blue,\u201d Malachi said again. Abby frowned at him, but Helen let out a breath.</p><p>\u201cSomeone dressed as Blue,\u201d she agreed listlessly. \u201cI\u2014I only saw him briefly. He put something on my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe blindfolded you?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember him being in the room,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cWhat kind of room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was...I think it was a cabin.\u201d Tears welled in Helen\u2019s eyes. \u201cTouching me,\u201d she said with a whisper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to remember that part right now,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cBut did he wear cologne or aftershave? Do you remember anything about his voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was gruff\u2014like a pirate\u2019s voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember any other sounds? Did you ever hear people?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>Abby glanced at him and set a gentle hand on Helen\u2019s. She carefully avoided the IV dripping fluids into a vein in Helen\u2019s arm, but tried to comfort the young woman.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear people...\u201d Helen said. Then she bit her lip. \u201cYes, once...but it was early on. I thought I heard people. Maybe music. And tapping. A rhythmic tap...tap...tap. Only sometimes. Maybe it was a band...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Helen,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Malachi took over again. \u201cWhat do you remember about being held captive?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Helen shuddered; Abby reached over and smoothed down a lock of her hair.</p><p>\u201cI was in the bed...the bunk...whatever. It wasn\u2019t comfortable. He said I was a captive who\u2019d fallen in love with him. But he repulsed me. He...he made me want to vomit. I gagged or choked and then...then he was angry. He told me I was a bad captive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen, was he with you all the time?\u201d Malachi asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know. I remember lying there...my hands were bound and my feet were tied to something and I couldn\u2019t move. He\u2019d go away...and then he\u2019d be back. And then he\u2019d touch me again. So...so disgusting. I couldn\u2019t\u2014I couldn\u2019t pretend. I couldn\u2019t be what he wanted, couldn\u2019t even pretend to be in love with him. He was very angry. My hands were still bound, but then...then he untied my feet...my ankles, I guess. He jerked me up and wrenched my hand around and...I felt one of his hands holding mine down on a table or something and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off with a sob.</p><p>\u201cHe cut you,\u201d Abby said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe cut off my finger!\u201d Helen sobbed. \u201cI can still hear the sound. There was a whoosh...and then I felt the slam of it...and I felt the pain. I was still blindfolded but I knew...I knew it was my finger.\u201d She continued to sob.</p><p>\u201cOh, Helen!\u201d Abby said, stroking her cheek gently. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Malachi apologized to Abby with his eyes but she obviously understood that he had to press forward. \u201cHelen, he took your finger while your blindfold was on. What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe dragged me along the floor,\u201d Helen began. \u201cMaybe...maybe there was music again. I heard a beat...tap, tap, tap. And I thought I heard laughter across the water. I\u2014I felt the night air on my skin. I knew he had a knife and I thought he was going to stab me. But he cut the ropes\u2014and then I was in the water. I was suddenly in the water, and I was trying so hard to swim, but I was in pain, and my arms...they were so stiff. I got the blindfold off. I...I don\u2019t know what happened to it. I don\u2019t even know what it looked like. I couldn\u2019t swim. I felt so heavy, I was all tangled up in something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were found wearing a wench costume,\u201d Malachi told her. \u201cDo you recall changing into it, or when you were changed into it?\u201d</p><p>Helen shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I should just be grateful to be alive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Abby said. \u201cYou were assaulted, you were nearly killed. That\u2019s a terrible trauma, and you\u2019ll probably need counseling to get over it. But don\u2019t worry now. You\u2019re safe here, protected by people who\u2019d die before they let anything else happen to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you both my life,\u201d Helen said.</p> <p>\u201cYou owe your life to your own will and strength, Helen,\u201d Malachi said firmly. \u201cYou are a survivor. You\u2019re going to be fine. And don\u2019t apologize for the pain you feel, and don\u2019t ever apologize for crying. You have real inner strength, and you\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d</p><p>Helen managed a shaky smile.</p><p>There was a knock at the door. A tall, brawny male nurse was there; Malachi wondered if he\u2019d been specially chosen to watch over Helen, just in case there was trouble. He didn\u2019t doubt that Jackson Crow might have seen to such a thing.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few people out here asking to see Ms. Long,\u201d the nurse announced.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them only two at a time. There\u2019s a fellow out here named Roger English and a couple of others\u2014Jack Winston and Blake Stewart.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cEarlier, they said it was fine for Mr. Johansen to see her with his friends. But I was told to check with whoever\u2019s here from enforcement.\u201d</p><p>Malachi could see that Abby was about to get up and prevent anyone from coming near Helen.</p><p>\u201cAbby, could you talk to Roger for a minute? Tell him Helen\u2019s had it very rough and that he shouldn\u2019t push her. I think it\u2019s okay for the other two gentlemen to come in right away. But, of course, that\u2019s up to Helen.\u201d He turned to her.</p> <p>Helen nodded. \u201cYes, of course. I want to see my friends, but I\u2014 Abby? Would you run that brush through my hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Abby hastened to do as she was asked.</p><p>When she was finished, Helen said, \u201cHow silly\u2014I\u2019m lucky to have my life and I\u2019m worried about how I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not silly,\u201d Malachi assured her. \u201cThat\u2019s life-affirming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you look beautiful,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cWenches are supposed to be tough, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Helen asked.</p><p>Abby smiled, glanced at Malachi and hurried out. A minute later, the two young actors who worked for Dirk came into the room. Malachi studied them. They looked very different from the way they had when he\u2019d seen them on the Black Swan.</p><p>Jack Winston, the older and more confident of the two, was dressed in a T-shirt that advertised Guinness and a pair of stylishly threadbare jeans. He was well-built and had a naturally cocky way about him, but his eyes were filled with tenderness as he walked in. Blake was younger and his heart appeared to be prominently displayed on his sleeve as he followed Jack. Tall and lanky, he wore jeans as well, but had on a polo shirt.</p><p>\u201cHelen!\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Blake greeted her. Jack kissed Helen on the cheek; Blake stood awkwardly beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two!\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t seem to recognize Malachi. He walked over to him and thrust out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jack Winston and this is Blake Stewart. We work with Helen. We\u2019ve been worried sick. We, uh, called the hospital and they said it was okay to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Helen needs to see her friends,\u201d Malachi said, shaking hands with Jack. Blake seemed confused, as if he should know him but didn\u2019t. Malachi smiled. \u201cMalachi Gordon. I\u2019m a private investigator working as a consultant with the federal unit down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, great,\u201d Blake said. Still confused, he turned back to Helen.</p><p>Jack did the talking; he was a good bedside guest. He regaled her with tales of kids who\u2019d been on the ship and told her how much she\u2019d been missed. Blake listened, just staring at Helen, his infatuation evident.</p><p>He sat down, taking the place Abby had been in before. \u201cHelen...oh, God. Oh, Helen, we missed you so much! We\u2019re so glad... Anything, anything you need or want, you let us know. We\u2019ll get it for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be okay, Blake. Abby and this gentleman here, Mr. Gordon\u2014they saved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it had been me, Helen!\u201d Blake said passionately. \u201cI wish I could have saved you. If I ever find out who did this, I swear, I\u2019ll kill him!\u201d</p><p>His words hung in the air for a minute. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that,\u201d Helen told him. \u201cYou...you have to let the law take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cI understand how you feel, Blake. But she\u2019s right. You have to leave this in the hands of the law.\u201d</p><p>Blake didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Jack placed a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019ll get him, Blake. They\u2019ll get him. Don\u2019t upset Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Helen said softly. Malachi thought she was; seeing how Blake felt meant something to her. His affection made her stronger.</p><p>Just then, Abby came back into the room with Roger English, Roger looking duly chastised. He went over to Helen and bent down\u2014then straightened abruptly and asked, \u201cIs it all right if I kiss your cheek? It won\u2019t hurt you or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love a kiss on the cheek,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay, Helen.\u201d Roger kissed her cheek with great care.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Roger.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, stepped back and looked at Malachi. He didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>Malachi rose. \u201cCome on, Roger, let\u2019s go get some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Helen, we\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll be back with us soon. I mean, we want you to get rich and famous in a zombie movie, but we\u2019d like you back with us, too,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Roger came forward again. \u201cHelen, he\u2019s taken another girl. Her name is Bianca Salzburg. You might have met her.... She took some of the local tours and she might have been on the Black Swan. Helen, you have to remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! Leave her alone!\u201d Blake said.</p><p>Malachi got up, stepping between the two of them and glancing at Abby.</p><p>He clapped Roger on the back. \u201cKat should be back soon,\u201d he told Abby.</p><p>He was done at the hospital; he\u2019d gotten from Helen everything he thought he could, and it was time to start going over what she had said, and trying to put the pieces together. Now, Helen deserved a little peace.</p><p>As soon as he was outside the room with Roger, he said, \u201cYou were very good in there\u2014at first. But we already told Helen that another woman is missing. She wants to help. I\u2019m glad you came to see her, but badgering her won\u2019t help. Abby explained that to you.\u201d</p><p>Roger was red-faced but he nodded dully. \u201cThey haven\u2019t found Bianca yet. She hasn\u2019t been back to her B and B, and she isn\u2019t answering her cell.\u201d</p><p>Malachi didn\u2019t tell him he was sure the police had put a trace on the phone. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can\u201d was all he said.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell Helen I\u2019m sorry?\u201d Roger asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t. She\u2019s had enough for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Roger said. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a walk. See if you can think of anything. If you do, call me.\u201d Malachi presented a card. It had nothing on it but his cell phone number.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even have a name on this,\u201d Roger told him.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t need it. You have my name. Call if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded and glanced wistfully toward Helen\u2019s hospital room. The uniformed officer on duty by the door stood there with his arms crossed looking at Roger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Roger muttered, heading toward the elevator. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll check out the Dragonslayer.\u201d</p><p>Malachi watched him leave. As he did, an elevator door down the hall opened and Kat stepped off. She tried to keep the doors from closing but she didn\u2019t move quickly enough. She apologized to Roger, who mumbled something, pushed the call button and stood there, waiting.</p><p>Kat came down the hall. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d she asked Malachi.</p> <p>Malachi nodded, still watching Roger. \u201cI think Helen\u2019s had all the visitors she can handle for the day,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe has visitors in there now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and Blake\u2014the pirate actors she works with on the Black Swan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. You let them in on purpose, I take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuspects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think they\u2019re just friends. No ulterior motives. But we can\u2019t be sure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the nurse to shoo them out. He\u2019s a great guy and a major help. His name is Byron. He\u2019ll do twelve-hour days\u2014switching with Bruno, another nurse Jackson found here\u2014and one who fits his name well,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Malachi nodded, keeping an eye on Roger, who continued to wait by the elevator. \u201cLeave it to Jackson Crow,\u201d he said, and smiled. \u201cDid Will see or hear anything on board the Black Swan?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but he got along famously with Dirk,\u201d Kat said. \u201cAnd with his buddies, Bootsie and Aldous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he back at the house on Chippewa now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpelling Angela on the cameras, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like him to follow Roger English,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cYou think Roger is responsible for all this?\u201d Kat asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t he the one who\u2019s going crazy looking for Bianca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s a killer. But he\u2019d be interesting to watch. He\u2019s in love. And he knows the city. He may lead us someplace he suspects might be a haven for the killer. He may even have an idea he isn\u2019t willing to share. He doesn\u2019t feel any of us wants to find Bianca Salzburg with the same desperation he does.\u201d</p><p>Kat pulled out her phone. Malachi waited while she put through the call to Will, who promised to get to the tavern quickly and start following Roger. Kat spoke for another minute or so and hung up.</p><p>\u201cJackson was about to call you. He\u2019s at a place near the river called the Wulf and Whistle. It\u2019s by that alley you told him about. He wants you to go there as soon as you can,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on it.\u201d Malachi paused. \u201cKat, what do you think the killer is using to hack off fingers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very sharp object, one with some heft. He\u2019s taking them cleanly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, maybe something like an old pirate\u2019s boarding ax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Kat reached for the door to Helen Long\u2019s room. \u201cI\u2019ll send Abby out\u2014and sic Byron on our visitors.\u201d</p><p>Soon after, Abby joined him in the hall.</p><p>\u201cHelen is doing fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI told Roger we\u2019d talked to her and that she\u2019d given us everything that she could. I warned him not to push her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Come on. Jackson asked us to meet him at the Wulf and Whistle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in front of the alley our ghosts pointed out to us this morning.\u201d Abby hesitated. \u201cMalachi, what do you think she heard\u2014aside from the music. If she was on the river, she might\u2019ve heard the entertainment from any of the tourist boats. But the sound she heard, like a beat. She didn\u2019t say it was drums, exactly, but something like that.\u201d</p><p>Tap, tap, tap.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know, but he felt he should. It was there, hidden somewhere in the back of his mind.</p><p>The Wulf and Whistle was in one of Savannah\u2019s historic buildings; it had gone up about ten years before the yellow fever epidemic. Abby had been inside many times. Businesses owners in the city could be a tight group; what was good for the city was good for everyone, and Gus had been close with the people he saw as his colleagues rather than competitors. Right now, the restaurant and bar was owned by Samuel Mason, who lived in Florida. His manager, however, was Steve Rugby, a man in his mid-forties who ran the place with friendly ease. Abby had always liked Steve and the Wulf and Whistle.</p><p>When the building had first gone up, it had been a tavern with apartments above it.</p><p>It was still a tavern with apartments above it. Peanuts were served in shells, the walls were decorated with old advertisements and the feel of the establishment was warm and congenial.</p><p>As soon as they entered, the hostess directed Abby and Malachi down to the rum cellar. Once, it had probably housed little more than rum. Now, it still held the old casks, but there were also endless rows of wine, and cases and stacks of fine bourbons, whiskeys, rums, gins and other alcohol, too.</p><p>Steve, a barrel-chested balding man, was there with Jackson Crow, David Caswell and a number of other officers. The shelves had been removed from one wall and Steve had been showing the police and Jackson a section of that wall.</p><p>Jackson and David hailed Abby and Malachi when they arrived.</p><p>\u201cWe sent some officers out on a door-to-door,\u201d Jackson explained. \u201cAnd Steve called to tell us about the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there is a tunnel here?\u201d Abby asked. \u201cI never knew about this one, either!\u201d</p><p>Steve joined the conversation. \u201cNone of us knew about it. We did some renovations down here about three months ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we did, we had engineers in\u2014you know, you have to make sure these old places are safe. Anyway, they were looking at the pilings and found that we had a false wall here. They knocked it down. My assistant did some research for me, and we\u2019re putting the info on our new menus,\u201d he added proudly. \u201cThe owner during the War Between the States was a heartfelt abolitionist, and this place was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Anyway, they must have kept the entrance hidden behind rum casks back then. And by the time we got to it, the false walls had been painted over again and again. But, like I was showing the police, we had our entrance here sealed as part of the renovation.\u201d</p><p>It might have been sealed before, Abby thought, but not anymore. The police had taken sledgehammers to it.</p><p>Now, a dark hole gaped before them, running beneath the earth. The artificial light from the cellar faded into the far reaches. David Caswell held a large searchlight and started moving slowly into the dank tunnel.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Jackson asked, pulling out a flashlight, as well.</p><p>Abby felt Malachi\u2019s hand on the small of her back as he guided her forward.</p><p>Light played over the walls of the tunnel. There were places where the earth had fallen in and other places where plaster or wooden walls remained to shore it up.</p><p>They walked for about fifty feet and came to a dead end.</p><p>Jackson, David and Malachi tapped on the solid wall of earth they\u2019d reached, listening for a hollow sound that would indicate the tunnel had been blocked but continued. Malachi used the end of his light to dig at the earth. He hit more earth.</p><p>They tried, moving along, casting the light in different directions, tapping and searching, but an hour later, they remained frustrated.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn there\u2019d be something,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d David Caswell agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe can get some engineers down here tomorrow,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cand see if we\u2019re missing anything. For now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now we have to give it up?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cAn engineer will uncover what we can\u2019t,\u201d Malachi told her.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Abby felt deflated; she\u2019d been so certain they\u2019d find something.</p><p>They trudged back out of the tunnel. Steve and the other officers remained in the cellar.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call it a night and get someone in here tomorrow,\u201d David announced.</p><p>Jackson stepped forward to thank Steve for all his help. \u201cHey, it\u2019s my city,\u201d Steve said. \u201cAnd it tears at my heart to hear about the bad things that are happening. Whatever I can do...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about wrecking the wall,\u201d Jackson reminded him.</p><p>\u201cEasy to fix,\u201d Steve assured them. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>They left, going up to the tavern and out to the street, where David, Jackson, Malachi and Abby stood together, looking at one another.</p><p>They resembled kids who\u2019d been playing in the mud, Abby thought. \u201cWell,\u201d David said with a wry grin. \u201cTime to hit the showers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianca Salzburg hasn\u2019t surfaced, has she?\u201d Abby said. It wasn\u2019t really a question.</p><p>Bianca, her disappearance, had to be the reason for tonight\u2019s exertions.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d David admitted. \u201cShe\u2019s still missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has her,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>David turned to Jackson. \u201cWe traced her cell phone. The signal disappeared somewhere around here. That\u2019s why we needed to tear everything up at the restaurant. But I have men on the riverfront. We might go broke on overtime, but we\u2019re leaving nothing unturned. We have police vessels out on the river and the coast guard, too. We\u2019re doing everything we possibly can.\u201d</p><p>Abby nodded. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to quit for tonight,\u201d Jackson said decisively. \u201cEveryone needs to sleep.\u201d</p><p>They wished one another a good night. Then Abby and Malachi returned to the Dragonslayer.</p><p>Grant Green was at the desk when they walked in. \u201cMy God!\u201d he said, staring at the two of them, mouth agape. Guests were still having dinner in the dining rooms; a few people\u2014along with the trio of Bootsie, Aldous and Dirk\u2014were at the bar. Grant hurried around the host stand to meet them. \u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying in the dirt,\u201d Abby said facetiously.</p><p>\u201cOkay, never mind.\u201d Grant sighed. \u201cHow\u2019s Helen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about the other girl? The one Roger was seeing?\u201d Grant asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows yet,\u201d Malachi told him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014that bastard!\u201d Grant sputtered. \u201cHe takes a new one the minute he...loses one. Can\u2019t you stop him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe will stop him,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting any closer?\u201d</p><p>No! Abby wanted to scream. How is he doing this? How is he eluding this kind of manhunt?</p><p>\u201cI believe we are,\u201d Malachi responded. \u201cThanks to Abby, one girl is alive. And with the police prowling the river now and all the searches taking place out there...he\u2019ll be caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon, I hope!\u201d Grant said.</p> <p>\u201cEvery criminal makes a mistake at some point,\u201d Malachi insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you might want to clean up first,\u201d Grant said, looking pointedly at Abby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going upstairs now. Oh, Grant, can you ask the chef to make us something to eat?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou can send it up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d Malachi interrupted, \u201cwe can eat at the bar. Join Dirk, Bootsie and Aldous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Abby said. \u201cBut first, a shower.\u201d</p><p>Malachi came with her, but didn\u2019t seem to notice that she was shrugging out of her muddy clothing as they entered the apartment. He repeated his inspection, making sure no one was inside, under the beds, in the closets. He headed back to the bank of computer screens to watch what was going on in the restaurant.</p> <p>Abby cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m hopping in the shower,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He nodded; he didn\u2019t even glance up. So much for her appeal.</p><p>Hot water had seldom felt so good. Well, other than the night before, after she\u2019d plunged into the river...</p><p>It felt sensuously good. Despite everything they were frantically doing in their desperate new search to find another young woman, she wished Malachi would join her.</p><p>She almost needed him.</p><p>She pictured him walking into the bathroom, stripping off his clothing, imagined the sleek feel of his naked flesh and his hands on her breasts.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t come in.</p><p>She emerged, feeling a little embarrassed. When she returned to the living room area, having donned jeans and a T-shirt to head back down for dinner, Malachi was still studying the screens, fixated on them. But he immediately sensed her standing behind him.</p> <p>\u201cThe soap... You smell wonderful,\u201d he told her. There was a husky note in his voice and a darkening in the hazel of his eyes as he watched her; it made her knees tremble.</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve been welcome to join me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled, an ironic twist to his lips. \u201cI had to know that this apartment was safe.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. He stood and started to touch her but drew back. \u201cGo down and join our friends at the bar. Try to casually find out what they\u2019ve been doing all day.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to argue with him. Bootsie, Dirk and Aldous\u2014these men were bulwarks in her life. They couldn\u2019t be guilty of anything. Will Chan had been watching Dirk and the Black Swan. Bootsie was old. Aldous...</p><p>Aldous was healthy and fit\u2014and not all that old. He\u2019d always looked like a pirate with his gleaming bald head and single gold earring.</p><p>He had money. Enough money to do whatever he wanted. His business was a shipping company; he had ships and boats at his disposal.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but Malachi gave her another rueful smile. \u201cI see your mind working,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAldous?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your FBI friends have checked out everything they possibly can on him. As far as I know, he\u2019s never even had a parking ticket.\u201d</p><p>His grin deepened at that. \u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s actually a fed at the moment,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>Abby rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs,\u201d she said, and left him in the apartment. She was grateful to see that Grant had ordered dinner for her and Malachi. Two covered plates were set on the bar, next to Bootsie. Aldous was sitting between him and Dirk.</p><p>Abby kissed the three of them on the cheek, hitched herself onto the bar stool beside Bootsie\u2019s and took the cover off her food. Chicken potpie. It smelled wonderful.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay?\u201d Bootsie asked her, his eyes grave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just feeling sick that this killer may have taken another young woman,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said, lifting a glass of ale to her, \u201cyou saved Helen. She seems to be doing just fine\u2014minus a finger, unfortunately. But you can live perfectly well with one less finger. I should know. I\u2019ve lived most of my life without a leg.\u201d</p><p>Dirk bent over the bar to speak to her across the other men. \u201cDid you see Helen again tonight? She\u2019s really doing well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really doing well,\u201d Abby assured them. \u201cSo, what about you gentlemen? What have you been up to today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went with Dirk to see Helen,\u201d Aldous said, looking at her as if she should have realized that.</p><p>\u201cThat was this morning,\u201d Abby said. \u201cHow about later? Have you been sitting on these chairs all day?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Dirk surveyed the restaurant and said, \u201cAbby, you know I\u2019ve been back on the Black Swan. That handsome young Asian fellow, or whatever he is, has been working with me. You know that,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWill Chan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Will. He\u2019s a good guy. A great performer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know him but I have heard he\u2019s a pretty talented magician, as well,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s something else. He pulls doubloons out of kids\u2019 ears, has \u2019em laughing. Wish I could keep him,\u201d Dirk said. \u201cHe was with me for the afternoon tour. I assume he\u2019s keeping an eye on me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn eye on the guests, the river...everything, Dirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like I\u2019m a suspect!\u201d Dirk said, sounding a little bitter.</p><p>Sullivan walked up to Abby. \u201cWater? Beer, soda\u2014anything to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust water, thanks, Sullivan,\u201d Abby told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd not to worry\u2014these old barflies haven\u2019t been here all day!\u201d Sullivan said, grinning. \u201cThey\u2019ve only been back for about three hours now.\u201d</p><p>Three hours. So, ever since Dirk had berthed the Black Swan. There\u2019d been at least three hours when they could\u2019ve been doing anything. Separately or together.</p><p>And of course, there were two hours between sailings on the Black Swan. Right around lunchtime...</p><p>Right around the time Bianca Salzburg had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cIs your food okay?\u201d Sullivan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s fine. I just started talking and got distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s your colleague,\u201d Sullivan said. He waited as Malachi, fresh from the shower, came to join her.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Dirk said in greeting. The others echoed him.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen.\u201d Malachi took his seat next to Abby.</p><p>\u201cCops, FBI people wasting their time watching me and God knows who else,\u201d Dirk muttered. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve come up with...nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes a killer\u2019s never caught,\u201d Aldous reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d better catch this one, or Savannah will run out of women,\u201d Bootsie commented.</p><p>Malachi turned on his bar stool to face them. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel the police are doing everything they can?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cKiller hasn\u2019t been caught,\u201d Bootsie said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re hounding good people, like our friend Dirk here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019ll catch this killer,\u201d Malachi spoke with all the confidence he could muster. Grant had moved over toward the bar. Sullivan remained where he\u2019d been, right behind it. All five men stared at him. \u201cThis killer...well, he\u2019s pretending to be Blue Anderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard. The media got hold of Helen Long\u2019s story about being attacked by a \u2018pirate,\u2019\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cSo he\u2019s pretending to be Blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Malachi went on. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking out of line. The police want some of Helen\u2019s information out there to prevent other women from being taken. The man who lured her to the abandoned church had given her a business card with the name Christopher Condent on it. I\u2019m sure you gentlemen know who the real Christopher Condent was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pirate. A brutal pirate who got away with it,\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>\u201cHe died in France, right?\u201d Dirk asked.</p><p>\u201cRich as Midas, from what I\u2019ve read,\u201d Aldous added.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think our killer believes he can do whatever he wants, get away with it and then sail off into the sunset. Christopher Condent. Students of piracy or local history might know the name, but it\u2019s not like Blackbeard or any of the really well-known names. So, he amuses himself by using the name and the business cards, but then dresses up as Blue. Everyone in this area knows what Blue looks like. There are dozens of paintings of him, including the replica of him right here in the dining room. But there\u2019s a problem with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bootsie asked. \u201cOther than the guy getting his pirates confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Blue, of course.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stared at Malachi. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aldous asked.</p><p>\u201cI mean the real Blue won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d</p><p>Bootsie began to laugh. Dirk let out a choked cough that became a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cBlue Anderson\u2019s been dead for two and a half centuries!\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>\u201cBlue is here in spirit,\u201d Malachi told them all.</p><p>\u201cYep\u2014in all the spirits behind this bar,\u201d Sullivan said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, my friends. Don\u2019t kid yourselves. Blue is very much here, in every brick and beam of this tavern. And his anger will grow\u2014and when it does, the killer had best beware.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cI bet they\u2019ve decided the FBI has brought in a certifiably crazy person as a consultant,\u201d Abby said as the door to the apartment closed behind them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malachi smiled, shrugged and immediately pulled her to him and into his arms.</p><p>She felt... The only word was melting.</p><p>They needed to talk, of course. His words downstairs had been met with laughter, then blank stares and awkwardness. Sullivan had started cleaning the bar. Grant had cleared his throat and walked away. Dirk said he\u2019d had enough to drink for the night, and Aldous and Bootsie had quickly agreed. They were out the door before Abby and Malachi had made it to the stairs.</p> <p>But now...</p><p>Nothing seemed to matter. Her body\u2019s memory kicked in, a physical memory that resided in her skin, her muscles, her very cells. Sliding against him, she felt guilty for a millisecond, but she was doing everything she possibly could to assist the police and Krewe unit in finding the killer. Jackson had said they needed sleep. But she needed this more than she needed sleep.</p><p>And Malachi obviously wasn\u2019t giving a second\u2019s thought to Jackson\u2019s advice.</p><p>They began to shed their clothing, their lips meeting as shoes and fabric went flying. They touched, then broke away, helped each other and moved slowly down the hall, still kissing. Soon they were back in the bedroom, tangled in the sheets, and she wasn\u2019t thinking about anything but this man\u2014the taste of his flesh, the feel of his lips and hands upon her. His kisses warmed her where they fell; her body sparked to life with the brush of his fingers. The pressure of his body was vital and arousing, and she returned his passion with an urgent hunger of her own. The thundering of her heart seemed shockingly loud.</p><p>They moved, then kissed again. They looked at each other, and they whispered words that meant everything, although they were intelligible. They broke apart to deliver hot wet kisses, then arched together, teasing and arousing, until he thrust into her and their pace became frantic. Moments later, it slowed, building to a sweet crescendo, exploding fiercely, and taking them into an even sweeter spiral of release. Their bodies gradually relaxed, and the glow of completion merged with the indefinable sensation of being with someone who meant so very much....</p> <p>This pleasure, being in such a state, feeling like this with another person, was nothing she\u2019d ever encountered before. Abby smiled; she pushed away the thought that they hadn\u2019t even known each other until this had begun, that their homes were in different places and that she had no idea what the future would hold. But life seldom had such perfect moments and she was going to cling to these.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what she expected him to say. Maybe something about its being damned good sex, if not something more intimate and personal, like, My God, that was the most extraordinary experience I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>Maybe that was her line. The words whispered silently in her head.</p><p>Malachi raised himself up on one elbow and looked down at her, a smile playing on his lips as he quizzically said, \u201cCertifiably crazy?\u201d</p><p>Shift gears! she told herself.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not certifiably crazy. I just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to think,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never cease to amaze me. I\u2019ve been warned my whole life not to mention the fact that I see a ghost, and it sounds like you\u2019ve never said anything, either\u2014and then you announce to a bunch of murder suspects that the ghost of Blue Anderson is wandering around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it was a good idea?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThey all looked at you as if you\u2019d lost your mind,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re innocent, of course, they\u2019ll figure I\u2019m crazy. But if the guilty party was among them, then that guilty party will start thinking. Because I planted it in his mind, he\u2019ll start to worry that ghost of Blue just might be around,\u201d Malachi told her. \u201cHe\u2019ll start looking over his shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s a method to your madness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a method to my madness.\u201d Dark hair fell in a swath across his forehead. She thought he was more endearing, lying there, than any male could be. \u201cSadly, however, there\u2019s little method to my social skills,\u201d he said. He bent over and kissed her lips with a lingering wistfulness. \u201cYou\u2019re...incredible. That\u2019s lame. But you are.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIncredible isn\u2019t so lame.\u201d</p> <p>He lay back down, pulling her against his chest. She felt cherished, and yet...</p><p>She felt respected, as well. He would want to shield her from danger, she knew. But she sensed that he would also have faith in her.</p><p>But as happy as she was with her personal situation, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what was going on. She wanted to jump out of bed and find the young woman who\u2019d probably been taken. She felt she should rush to the river again, run up and down the street, do anything rather than nothing. And yet she knew that such feelings were worthless; she\u2019d learned about patience, being precise, following clues\u2014controlling the impulse to become so emotionally involved that you couldn\u2019t act. Or acted recklessly.</p><p>Trust was important. She had to trust that David Caswell was a good cop and that Jackson Crow knew what he was doing.</p><p>And still her mind raced.</p><p>\u201cTap...tap, tap, tap,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was thinking,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She rose up to meet his eyes. He stroked her hair thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cIt means something,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep thinking that, soon enough, I\u2019ll figure out what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you still include Dirk and Roger in your suspect list?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cI do. If they make any movements tonight, we\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill\u2019s been keeping an eye on Roger since he left the tavern this afternoon. He didn\u2019t stay here long, had a quick drink, then took off.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI believe his emotion is real. If it turns out he\u2019s our killer, I\u2019m losing my touch. But, for now, don\u2019t worry. Lie down. We have officers out there watching and searching. On the riverfront. Cruising around city hall...down the east and the west sides of the city. There are people out there, Abby. Let them do their jobs.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she lay back down beside him.</p><p>Music. Helen had heard music. She\u2019d been thrown into the water not long before Abby saw her.</p><p>That meant the killer had been out on the water. He\u2019d been within their grasp.</p><p>Tap, tap, tap.</p><p>She felt Malachi stir and moved deeper into his arms.</p><p>She dreamed of making love again.</p><p>They fell asleep.</p><p>Malachi lay awake, smiling when he heard Abby\u2019s easy breathing. She was exhausted. There was an emotional toll in all of this, especially since it came right after her grandfather\u2019s death. She hadn\u2019t really had time to mourn his passing before a connection between his death and that of the recent victims had become plausible and apparent to her\u2014and now the body count was adding up. He rolled onto his side and turned to watch her sleep, studying the contours of her face. He found himself wondering why certain people fell into such a profound attraction, why the physical act could mean something so different, depending on how you felt about that person. He reached out, just to touch her hair, but started when he heard his phone ringing.</p><p>He scrambled from the bed and searched for the jeans he\u2019d discarded somewhere. He hurried down the hall until he found them and dug into his pocket.</p><p>The caller was Will Chan.</p><p>\u201cRoger English is on the move,\u201d Will said. \u201cI\u2019m following him now. He left his house and he\u2019s headed toward Bay Street if you want to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he seen you?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t made me yet. He was walking fast but then he stopped, pulled out his phone, looked at it\u2014muttered to himself\u2014and then began walking again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a few minutes!\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>He started to slide back into his clothing. Hopping into his jeans, he turned and nearly crashed into Abby. Her hair was a tangle; her eyes were wide. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter Roger.\u201d</p><p>She frowned but said no more. He had to hand it to her; she could dress fast. She was dressed\u2014slipping her Glock into her waistband\u2014while he was still tying his shoes.</p><p>The Dragonslayer was silent as they crept down the stairs. It was after the night crew had left, before the morning crew came in. They hurried out and he waited to make sure Abby locked the front door.</p><p>He took her hand as they ran across the parking lot and toward Bay Street. He saw no one there, and Malachi quickly drew his phone from his pocket and called Will back.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn front of city hall, on the river,\u201d Will replied. \u201cHe\u2019s pacing by the water. Keeps looking out at it. Pulls his phone in and out of his pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he told Abby, catching her hand again.</p><p>They ran up onto the embankment to reach the river walk and crossed by closed stores, restaurants and taverns, staying close to the shop fronts to meld with the shadows. As they moved silently closer, someone stepped out from the buildings.</p><p>Will. He beckoned to them and they joined him behind a pillar.</p><p>The three stood there silently as they observed Roger English.</p><p>Roger paced and then stood still and stared out at the river. Malachi looked down the length of shops. There were other people in the shadows, he realized.</p><p>True to his word, David Caswell had officers on surveillance. Watching the river.</p><p>And now, watching Roger.</p><p>Was he about to call someone\u2014someone out on the river who had a captive?</p><p>They waited what seemed to be a very long time while Roger walked up and down, continuing to stare out at the water.</p><p>He clutched the cell phone and pulled something from his pocket, then stuffed it back. He began to dial.</p><p>Who was he calling?</p><p>Malachi jumped as he felt his phone buzz in his pocket. Stepping back, he looked at it.</p><p>Roger was calling him.</p><p>He glanced at the others and hurried a distance away, then answered his phone.</p><p>\u201cRoger?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me,\u201d Roger said. As Malachi watched, Roger glanced at his phone, as if trying to figure out how Malachi had known it was him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t given this number to many people,\u201d Malachi explained.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Well, thanks. Look, I\u2019m sorry to wake you. I know what time it is but...you said to call. I\u2019m down on the riverfront, right near city hall. Dumb, I know. But I couldn\u2019t stand it. I couldn\u2019t stand doing nothing. And I realize there are cops out here, too\u2014I believe someone is on this 24/7\u2014but I think I can see something out on the water. I think it\u2019s a rowboat. There\u2019s nothing else out there, but can you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Give me two minutes. I\u2019m up and I\u2019m close. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d A rowboat. He thought of what Blue had said.</p> <p>Roger turned; Malachi didn\u2019t know how, but he seemed to home right in on his location.</p><p>He walked toward him. \u201cMalachi?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Malachi walked toward Roger at the same time. \u201cYou said it. People are watching the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen anything?\u201d Roger asked.</p><p>Will and Abby came out of the shadows, coming over to join them. \u201cEverybody\u2019s watching the river?\u201d Roger asked. Malachi wasn\u2019t sure if he felt reassured, stalked or just mystified.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it you saw?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cCome here. Come straight to the edge and you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s moving with the current,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Jackson.\u201d Will stepped aside to make the call.</p><p>\u201cDo you see it?\u201d Roger demanded.</p><p>Malachi did; it was dark out on the water and the current was moving, but every few seconds, the moonlight touched down on something. He understood why Roger had stared out at the water for so long. It was there, and then it seemed to disappear in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go out there and get it,\u201d Roger said.</p> <p>Abby put a hand on his arm. \u201cWill\u2019s calling for a boat to tow it in, to find out what\u2019s going on. Maybe you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould what?\u201d Roger shouted. \u201cGo home? I can\u2019t, Abby. Come on\u2014you know I can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Roger. You\u2019re right. We\u2019ll just stay here and wait.\u201d She came to him as a friend and slipped an arm around him, standing by his side.</p><p>Only seconds later, they saw a marine patrol boat with lights flashing streak along the river. They saw it slow down and circle the object. The moon went behind a cloud and as it reappeared, they saw an officer tossing out a towrope.</p><p>Malachi\u2019s phone rang. He answered immediately.</p><p>Roger stared at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rowboat and there\u2019s nothing in it,\u201d he told Roger. \u201cPossibly, it just broke away from a dock. They\u2019ll tow it in. It might have no connection to the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmpty,\u201d Roger repeated dully. Then he grew animated again. \u201cThat could mean that...she\u2019s in the river. Tell them...tell them they have to search the water. They have to search the water until they find her! Like when Abby saw Helen. What if he threw her out of that rowboat? If he did, she\u2019s in the water somewhere!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRoger,\u201d Malachi said, placing his hands on the man\u2019s shoulders and focusing on his eyes. \u201cThere had to be someone in the rowboat to throw someone else in the water. There was no one in the boat.\u201d</p><p>Roger seemed to deflate. His shoulders slumped. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. I guess you\u2019re right. But...but she could be out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is the patrol,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Roger said. \u201cI\u2019ve got other people running my tours for me. I\u2019m available if there\u2019s anything I can do. I mean, hell, I\u2019m here whether you want anything from me or not. I\u2019ll be walking around. I\u2019ll be looking. I can\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRog, how well did you know Bianca?\u201d Abby asked. \u201cI mean, everyone\u2019s on the lookout because of what\u2019s been happening, but she could have lost her phone or decided not to...pursue the relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might\u2019ve just met her,\u201d Roger said, \u201cbut there was something there, Abby. I don\u2019t believe Bianca blew me off and disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Abby murmured.</p><p>Mollified, Roger looked back at the river. \u201cI guess...I guess I\u2019ll go home for a while. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s all walk back,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cYou guys don\u2019t need to babysit me,\u201d Roger protested. \u201cYou sure don\u2019t need to go out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying at Abby\u2019s house on Chippewa,\u201d Will told him. \u201cI\u2019ll walk back with you, Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place is just past Abby\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Will said. \u201cThen we\u2019re going the same way.\u201d</p><p>The two of them started walking ahead, but Roger stopped and turned back. \u201cI thought you all were watching the river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShift is over. New crew coming on,\u201d Malachi said to him.</p><p>Roger nodded and then saw Abby. He came back and threw his arms around her in a warm hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLove ya, Rog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d He nodded, then turned, hurrying to catch up with Will. Malachi\u2019s phone vibrated; he grabbed it quickly and heard Jackson\u2019s voice. \u201cWhen you get back in the Dragonslayer, take a look at the footage on the computer screens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything wrong? Anything I should worry about?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing wrong. But a little bizarre. Interesting. Have a look, then get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Abby asked as Malachi slipped his phone into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Jackson\u2019s just checking in,\u201d he said.</p><p>He and Abby walked slowly behind Will and Roger, coming along the riverfront and then hiking over to Bay and down toward the Dragonslayer.</p><p>When the other two split off, heading to the center of the old town, Abby waved. \u201cI feel like such a jerk,\u201d she said. \u201cRoger and I went to school together from the time we were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re being a good friend. Remember, part of shadowing people is to clear them,\u201d Malachi reminded her.</p><p>As they returned to the Dragonslayer, he noticed that the sun was just coming up.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a few hours\u2019 sleep,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>Abby nodded. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>The morning crew had yet to arrive. Abby unlocked the door and they trudged up to the second-floor apartment. She started for the bedroom; he wanted to follow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to check the screens. I\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He sat down and looked at the various views of the Dragonslayer. Nothing. He ran the footage back, quickly at first. Then he reran it, closely studying the screen that showed the front of the Dragonslayer.</p><p>He saw himself and Abby leaving. They went out of view.</p><p>He glanced to see the time; they were gone about ten minutes when someone else approached the Dragonslayer.</p><p>Head down.</p><p>Most of the time when a person or persons couldn\u2019t be identified on video, it was because of a sweatshirt with a hoodie.</p><p>But this person wasn\u2019t in a hoodie. He wore a sweeping hat and a cloak. A long black cloak.</p><p>But the figure reached the Dragonslayer and seemed about to try the door, then abruptly stepped back. The hat still blocked any view of the face. \u201cLook up, you bastard!\u201d Malachi muttered.</p><p>But the person didn\u2019t look up. Apparently, something at the Dragonslayer had spooked him.</p><p>Malachi went through the footage of the bar area and saw a shadow appear just inside the front door.</p><p>\u201cBlue,\u201d Malachi whispered. \u201cBlue, you are watching over this place.\u201d</p><p>He typed a message to Jackson. Maybe Will could enhance the footage in the morning; maybe there was some information they could get.</p><p>Jackson was still at the computer in Abby\u2019s house.</p><p>Police closest to the area were dispatched. They were there in minutes but the person was gone, and out of camera range almost immediately.</p><p>While we were by the river.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Do you think the cameras scared him off?</p><p>Don\u2019t know. Camera would be pretty obvious if it was someone who knew the Dragonslayer.</p><p>Any hope of enhancing the footage?</p><p>I\u2019ll get Will on it later in the morning. Rowboat taken to the forensic lab. I\u2019ll report as soon as we learn anything.</p><p>OK. Grabbing a few hours sleep.</p><p>I\u2019m on for the next few hours here. Angela spells me at eight. Police know to call at any time. I\u2019ll keep you posted.</p><p>Malachi signed off and walked down the hallway to Abby\u2019s room. He went in and tiptoed over to the bed.</p><p>Abby was sound asleep. She\u2019d set her gun on the dresser\u2014hadn\u2019t even taken off her clothes. He pulled a blanket over her, stripped and lay down himself. He stayed awake for a few minutes, once again wondering about the mysterious noise Helen had reported.</p><p>Tap, tap, tap. He knew it meant something. But what?</p><p>Abby woke up with a jolt. It felt very late, and although the drapes were drawn, she could feel the warmth of the sun pouring in.</p><p>She dashed out of the room and found Malachi sitting at the computers.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen! We should be up and doing something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll notice that I am,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut when you\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll go back to the area around the cemetery and the Wulf and Whistle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I just have to send a few emails before we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, take your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake my time?\u201d Abby echoed. \u201cNo, no, I slept a lot. We have to get started! If this guy is following his usual timelines, Bianca doesn\u2019t have much longer. But if we\u2019re going back to the cemetery today, I have to live up to my promise about having that tombstone repaired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who to contact?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cI know a few people on the city council. I\u2019ll write the emails to get things started.\u201d She walked over to the desk near the balcony, where she\u2019d left her laptop, and then paused, looking at him. \u201cSo, how am I going to explain why I know all this? We don\u2019t really have an opportunity to research it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust say it came up when the bureau was investigating. They won\u2019t ask anything else if you do that. I\u2019ll tell Jackson. He really can get someone on the research,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>Abby nodded and she retrieved her notepad before she quickly sat down.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Lieutenant Josiah Beckwith,\u2019\u201d she read. \u201c\u2018Born April 9, 1790. Died for his country, September 12, 1814, at the Battle of North Point during the War of 1812. Beloved son, husband and father. A patriot.\u2019 I have it all\u2014yes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Abby looked through her list of email contacts, selected a few of the influential people she knew on city council and wrote something vague about finding the information while investigating the cemetery on an FBI case. She asked that the situation be rectified, that the gravestone defaced during the Civil War be repaired.</p><p>As she typed, Malachi walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cHow many people around here dress up as pirates?\u201d he asked. She realized that he was holding a cup of coffee for her, which she accepted gratefully.</p><p>\u201cLots of people dress up as pirates,\u201d Abby said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on back to the computers when you\u2019re done there,\u201d he told her. \u201cFinish your emails first.\u201d</p><p>She did, and when she approached the computer screens, she saw that Malachi had frozen a frame of the video. It showed someone standing in front of the Dragonslayer.</p><p>Someone who looked very strange.</p><p>She could see nothing of the actual person. A massive, plumed pirate hat hid the face, and a sweeping black cloak encompassed him to a degree that hid his size. If it was a him. Abby thought that it was\u2014the person appeared to be tall.</p><p>\u201cWhen was that?\u201d she asked Malachi.</p><p>\u201cAt 3:32 a.m.,\u201d Malachi told her.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were down by the river,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cHe was trying to get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I assume. But he stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he try the door? Or did he not even reach it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever tried it,\u201d Malachi said, leaning back. \u201cThey saw it on the screens at your house on Chippewa, too, of course. They called the police right away, but by the time a couple of officers arrived...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was already gone,\u201d Abby concluded with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cYup. And I don\u2019t think he was afraid of the cameras. I think he knew about them and that\u2019s why he was smart enough to keep his head down. I think he was afraid of Blue.\u201d</p><p>Abby stepped back. \u201cYou saw Blue? Was he on one of these screens?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Malachi told her. \u201cBut...here\u2019s an image the camera did pick up.\u201d</p><p>Abby looked over his shoulder as he replayed the footage of the host stand and bar area, along with the front of the restaurant.</p><p>A dark shadow appeared just behind the entry door.</p><p>\u201cIs that a trick of the video, of the light? Or is it...something?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Malachi mused. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo ghosts record this way?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t really know. But...I do believe that Blue is watching over this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe this...killer is someone who spends a lot of time in the Dragonslayer. And it\u2019s the guy in the plumed hat.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s head over to the cemetery. We\u2019ll see what our old folks have to say.\u201d</p><p>Macy was at the host stand, and Abby went over to her. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, Abby. What about you? How are you doing with all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Macy glanced past Abby at Malachi and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here\u2014all of you. For Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Macy,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cBy the way, do you remember much about the day before Gus\u2019s funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, it was pretty much a day like any other. We had the signs up, that the restaurant would be closed the next day. There was an announcement made at the service that the mourners were welcome to join us here after, and we wanted to limit it to the people who\u2019d known Gus well, not have casual tourists wandering in.\u201d</p><p>She seemed perplexed, uncertain about his reasons for asking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the time just after Helen Long left the restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you remember anyone who might\u2019ve left soon after she did? How about our barflies?\u201d</p><p>Macy looked at him blankly for a moment. Her lower lip trembled slightly. \u201cHelen\u2019s been found. Abby saved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but another young woman is missing and Helen hasn\u2019t been able to give us much information. I\u2019m hoping you can help us.\u201d He leaned on the host stand, meeting her eyes. He really had a curiously charming way about him, Abby thought. More so, perhaps, because he had no idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to help you!\u201d Macy said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t down here the whole time. I was going back and forth, between the restaurant and supply room. And we were so distracted that day, too. But...oh, I think both Aldous and Bootsie left in the early afternoon. And wait! Yes, I know Dirk left even before they did because he took his ship out. He worked the Black Swan\u2019s morning and afternoon shifts because he knew he wouldn\u2019t do either one the next day. But...I could be off on my times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific, Macy. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>Macy shook her head. \u201cNo, I was here. Later Sullivan went up to do an inventory to get our orders in, since we knew everyone would be preoccupied the next day. More than that, I can\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been very helpful, Macy,\u201d Malachi told her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s ever anything I can do...\u201d Macy\u2019s voice trailed off.</p><p>Malachi thanked her again and turned to leave; Abby followed. They walked the few blocks to Colonial Park Cemetery.</p><p>That day, Abby let herself really look around the cemetery and see. She saw the old couple, vigilant as ever on their bench. A young woman in a long white gown seemed to float behind a live oak that dripped with moss. A grinning soldier stood behind a group of tourists; he blew on a girl\u2019s neck and his grin broadened when she spun around, looking for the prankster. Across the way, hovering by one of the monuments, two young women in early-nineteenth century clothing seemed to be taking a casual walk through the stones.</p><p>Malachi, she thought, noticed them all. He was, however, fixated on the older couple.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, pausing by the bench.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, young sir,\u201d the man said, standing politely.</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to let you know that Abby has written the necessary people about your son\u2019s gravestone. We are in the process of getting the situation rectified,\u201d Malachi told him.</p><p>\u201cWe thank you sincerely.\u201d The man bowed. \u201cMy love,\u201d he said to his wife, \u201ca great dishonor will be set right.\u201d</p><p>The woman rose, as well. She looked at them, and Abby could almost believe there were real tears in her eyes.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t there. Except as...</p><p>Heart, soul, spirit?</p><p>\u201cI wish I could set every situation right.\u201d Abby decided not to add that, through the years, gravestones hadn\u2019t just been defaced, some had disappeared altogether. She wanted to tell them that cemeteries were really for the living. The dead remained alive in their loved one\u2019s memories.</p><p>\u201cWe found a tunnel in an old building,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cRight down the street, in the area you kindly pointed out to me. But it brought us to a dead end. Have you noticed anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked inside, not in the alley?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go back,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep looking. Inside and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a time, not long after the war\u2014the war that took our son\u2014when the dead were often taken beneath the ground. The dead and dying. The yellow fever...they did everything they could to fight it. And when it was over, I believe they tried to hide the epidemic and how many it claimed.\u201d He spoke thoughtfully. \u201cWe were the South. Our economy was cotton\u2014and the river. The cotton plantations, of course, depended on slaves. But there were those who hated slavery. Early on before the other war, I heard they began to use some of those tunnels to hide people who were escaping. We, my wife and I, we closed our eyes. I was a merchant here, and I knew how the plantations worked, but...in my heart, I also knew it was wrong. If I remember...\u201d He looked at his wife. \u201cIf I remember, we saw people in the night back then. Hurrying down the streets. Disappearing into the alley, into the darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Malachi went to shake the man\u2019s hand; Abby watched a ghostly hand touch Malachi\u2019s in return.</p><p>She lowered her head, smiling. He thought he was awkward with people. He wasn\u2019t. He was very good.</p><p>With the living and the dead.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Abby echoed. She and Malachi hurried across the cemetery to leave by the main entrance. They passed tour groups and couples, parents and children.</p><p>They walked back toward the Wulf and Whistle. The buildings on the street were flush with one another; space here was at a premium. But a narrow alley stretched between streets, an alley that was no longer passable by any kind of conveyance. A tree that had taken root blocked it at the sidewalk. Malachi and Abby crawled over the roots that sprouted through the concrete, and they stood in the narrow alley behind the Wulf and Whistle.</p><p>\u201cWho knows exactly what was going on when,\u201d Malachi murmured, studying the building. \u201cBut there was a tunnel in the Wulf and Whistle. Presumably, during the yellow fever epidemic, they were bringing the sick and the dead down to various tunnels and underground rooms. Then, when the Underground Railroad became active, they reopened the tunnels. After the war\u2014the Civil War, this time\u2014the local owners, aware of what went on at the cemetery, which was now under military rule, might have hurried and covered up their secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we went down into the Wulf and Whistle. You tapped all the walls in the tunnel there yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, but an entry from the tavern might have been sealed off. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t more tunnels beneath us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are we going to find one? And if it\u2019s all blocked off, how\u2019s a killer using it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer, obviously, knows where it is,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cAnd, somehow or other, he\u2019s opened it.\u201d</p> <p>Abby turned around in the little space. Behind the Wulf and Whistle was a wooden portico and a gate that sectioned off an area. She realized that was where the tavern kept their garbage.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she said.</p><p>She went to the gate and opened it. She saw a bin there and threw it open. Inside it was another bin that could be removed to dump the garbage.</p><p>\u201cMalachi!\u201d she called.</p><p>He hurried over to her. \u201cThey\u2019d never need to move this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey obviously always lift out the inner bin when they have to empty it. Steve must have some of his employees take it to the end of the alley for garbage pickup.\u201d</p> <p>Malachi walked around behind the giant bin. Planked grating supported the bin and stretched about two feet behind it. He bent down and raised the wooden planks.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hole,\u201d he said. \u201cA big black hole. Shall we?\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>The hole went straight down. At some point, Malachi thought, the tunnel must have been dug as part of a sewage system. Maybe those dealing with the yellow fever outbreak used it, and for the Underground Railroad any route was better than no route. It was good to think that there\u2019d been those willing to risk everything to help others, just as it was chilling to think about the fear escaping slaves must have felt when they slipped into the tunnels. He could imagine them praying that they\u2019d reach a ship, and that the ship would take them north without being stopped and searched.</p><p>The tunnel smelled dank. Malachi thought about death and disease and human misery as he crawled down the treacherous earth ladder that led to the floor below. Hitting the ground, he dug in his pocket for his flashlight, then shone the light over the length of the tunnel. Like the others, this one appeared to head straight for the river.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he told Abby. \u201cThe grips are old and weak.\u201d He set his flashlight on the ground and reached up to help her make her way down.</p> <p>\u201cPlus wet and nasty,\u201d Abby murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But let\u2019s see where this goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we have called it in?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. The killer could well have seen all the commotion going on at the Wulf and Whistle. He might be amused now, assuming we had it completely wrong. I don\u2019t want him to know we\u2019ve found this place. If he doesn\u2019t know, he might try to make use of it again.\u201d</p><p>Abby nodded. She had a small flashlight herself and she waved it before them, letting the light fall over the earth walls.</p><p>As they moved along the length of the tunnel, it began to narrow. Halfway down, they came across a break in one of the walls.</p><p>The fork and the main tunnel stretched ahead, both stygian in their darkness. They looked at each other in the eerie glow of the flashlights. \u201cNo splitting up,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t about to suggest it. Good agents trust in their partners and their backup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I say we go right.\u201d</p><p>Abby considered where she was for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out where we are\u2014where we\u2019d be if we were on street level. We\u2019d be heading back to the Dragonslayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The tunnel was narrow; in places, dirt was falling in. They walked for what Abby estimated was at least a block.</p><p>After that, they walked for the equivalent of another block. As they did, she heard their feet scraping on the rough ground. Malachi stopped and touched the walls.</p><p>\u201cAre these tunnels solid?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey seem to be. They were dug properly, support beams were set in...we\u2019re safe. They seem to be in better shape than half the new housing you\u2019ll see,\u201d Malachi remarked.</p><p>They kept walking, their flashlights illuminating the way. And then they came to a solid wall of earth.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is great,\u201d Abby complained.</p><p>\u201cActually, it is,\u201d Malachi said, stepping back.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know about where we are?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the Dragonslayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart at the very end, then back up. Feel the walls. Feel them, tap them...tell me when you feel something different. Let\u2019s put the lights down and shine them on the walls.\u201d</p><p>They did so, one light facing left, the other pointed toward the right.</p><p>Abby moved along the walls, testing them. They seemed to be earth, but the long-gone architects of the tunnels had given them support beams and arches. Dampness had damaged some of the wood that shored up the walls, but she assumed they would have used a hardwood that didn\u2019t easily decompose. After all, they\u2019d lasted this long.</p><p>She was so intent on her work that she was startled when she heard Malachi shout, \u201cAha!\u201d</p><p>She turned around. At first, all she saw was darkness and the glare of the light\u2014but then she realized that the light was creating shades of darkness. Malachi had found another fork in the tunnel.</p><p>\u201cHow... There was wall there before!\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cThat mud patch with the vine attached is like something I have at my house in Virginia. In the house, it\u2019s called a pocket door. The wall slides into a pocket in the rest of the wall.\u201d</p><p>Abby picked up her flashlight and stood by his side. She gasped. \u201cMalachi\u2014that\u2019s the end of the tunnel that leads from the Dragonslayer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, our killer\u2019s been able to access the Dragonslayer from the Wulf and Whistle, the Wulf and Whistle from the Dragonslayer and the river from either of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can shut off the bastard, cement him in,\u201d Abby said bitterly.</p><p>Malachi shook his head. \u201cNot if we want to find him while Bianca is still living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, we go back. We pretend we\u2019ve never been here\u2014and we get Will to bring in some cameras. We need to follow this killer wherever he\u2019s going. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll rescue Bianca.\u201d</p><p>Malachi stepped through the hole he\u2019d created in the tunnel wall. He inspected the pocket into which he\u2019d slid the wooden door that had originally seemed to be just more earth-and-hardwood tunnel wall. \u201cAt my house,\u201d he told Abby, \u201cthis kind of door was used to turn the place into a tavern by night\u2014a way stop for travelers\u2014and then back into separate rooms for working and sleeping. Thomas Jefferson\u2019s family had apparently been involved with the building of my house. I really have one of those places where you get to say \u2018Washington slept here.\u2019 But I believe this technique must\u2019ve been common during colonial days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess these tunnels were used at various times, for various reasons,\u201d she mused.</p><p>Malachi nodded. \u201cCity planners might have started them, pirates might have continued to use them\u2014to shanghai others or to effect their own escapes. And then they became important to the Underground Railroad during the Civil War. At other times, the city or property owners sealed up entrances, as well as these secret doorways from one tunnel to another. Remember, governments\u2014federal, state and municipal\u2014usually do whatever is cheapest. You don\u2019t need a tunnel, then seal up the entrance. If you know the city and you\u2019ve heard about its history all your life\u2014and studied it\u2014you might realize where to look for these entrances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the city!\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cYep, and you knew about the tunnel under the Dragonslayer because it was your tunnel. You knew about the hospital tunnels because their existence and the history of what went on during the yellow fever epidemic was recorded\u2014sketchily, yes, but there were records,\u201d Malachi said. He offered her a dry smile. \u201cSince you were never looking for a way to kidnap people and take them out on the river, you probably never tried to explore underground Savannah as thoroughly as our killer did. Come on, let\u2019s go back to where we came in. I don\u2019t want to use the Dragonslayer tunnel and the tavern stairs. The dining room will be full right now, and I don\u2019t want to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope nobody sees us crawling through the garbage,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Malachi agreed. \u201cI\u2019m going to give Jackson a call so he can arrange for someone to watch the entrance here. Someone in plain clothes who won\u2019t be noticed. Jackson will have to talk to David Caswell, get someone he trusts implicitly.\u201d He had his phone out, tried to call, then made a face at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was dumb. No signals down here. Come on. Let\u2019s go back up as smoothly as we can and get someone down here.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cAfter that, we need to shower again. Another reason I\u2019d rather not go to the Dragonslayer\u2014I don\u2019t want to be seen like this. We\u2019ll go to your house on Chippewa, okay?\u201d</p><p>Abby nodded. Malachi closed the pocket door, and they made their way back through the tunnel.</p><p>Abby\u2019s flashlight reflected off something on the floor. She instinctively started to pick it up and then didn\u2019t. She hunkered down and took a closer look; Malachi hunkered down next to her. \u201cGum wrapper,\u201d he said. \u201cOr part of a gum wrapper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFingerprints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible, yes,\u201d Malachi said. He glanced at her. Even in the eerie light, there was a beauty, a strength, in his face. Not only that, she couldn\u2019t remember being able to communicate with anyone as she could with him.</p><p>It was the ghost thing.</p><p>It was the sex.</p><p>It was whatever made him unique.</p><p>\u201cCertainly not an eighteenth-or nineteenth-century object,\u201d he said. He was prepared; he reached into his pocket and she saw that he had a little envelope. He turned it inside out to pick up the ripped gum wrapper, secured it without touching it and slid it into his pocket. He took her arm, drawing her up. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get out of here now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hoisted Abby up and out of the hole. She turned around to help him, but he\u2019d gotten a grip on the tenuous ladder to get himself up.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said, looking at her. \u201cLet\u2019s hope we don\u2019t run into anyone we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not easy here. I know a lot of people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just hang back for a minute. Let me call Jackson and get him talking to David. I\u2019ll tell him what we\u2019ve found and why we don\u2019t want to make it public yet.\u201d He put the call through to Jackson, who said he\u2019d be there soon, and then leaned against the wall as they waited. The alley smelled of rotting garbage.</p><p>\u201cGreat place to hang around,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Malachi grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve been in worse.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her and she asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou even look good festooned in dirt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo do you!\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but his smile faded. His mind, she realized, was always moving, often along a number of different tracks at once.</p><p>\u201cTiming is everything in a crime like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s difficult to get around. We\u2019ve been within blocks of the same area, so someone who needs to get from place to place with very little time can do it easily. But still, if we could just pinpoint who was where when... At least we could eliminate people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe that Roger is really in the clear?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI do. There isn\u2019t any proof.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Jackson Crow walked into the alley. He was with a man who was close to six feet with beautiful caf\u00e9-au-lait skin, thirty-five or so, and wearing an I Love Savannah T-shirt, the kind sold in dozens of tourist shops.</p> <p>\u201cOfficer Dale Kendrick,\u201d Jackson said, introducing him. \u201cHe\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the alley. And he transferred in from Atlanta recently, so it\u2019s not likely he\u2019d be recognized by anyone here.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands with Kendrick. Malachi handed the gum wrapper over to Jackson, who would bring it to Forensics. Will was back on the Black Swan, and Angela and Kat were spelling each other on the screens. Will had enhanced the footage showing the strange figure approaching the Dragonslayer the night before. But no matter how enhanced, the face was hidden. However, they could eliminate anyone under six feet. Jackson left them to head down to the station; he was due to meet with David at Forensics to see if anything had been discovered regarding the rowboat they\u2019d found in the river. He left them.</p><p>\u201cOn to Chippewa Square,\u201d Malachi announced.</p><p>He shook hands with Kendrick again, thanking him. \u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d Kendrick told him, waving as they walked off.</p><p>They hurried to the house, hoping no one would notice them in their dirty, disheveled state. Luckily, tourists were distracted by their own destinations or the beauty of the homes, the street and the moss-draped live oaks.</p><p>Angela came to the door and looked them up and down, a trace of amusement on her face. \u201cCute. You\u2019re like children out of a very dirty sandpile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something to think about,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Abby asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe dirt. This person has to come out of these tunnels dirty\u2014unless he\u2019s going all the way through, and not coming back until he\u2019s been out on whatever vessel he has on the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAnd, by the way, Will worked with the city and got a camera up on the exit to the riverbank from the Dragonslayer. They were careful setting it up so they weren\u2019t seen doing it. We won\u2019t want to scare anyone off. No one will be able to use that venue again without being instantly visible. Come into the dining room and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>They followed her. There\u2019d been another camera set up; it looked out over the embankment where Abby had plunged into the river to save Helen Long.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. See anything?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot of tourists,\u201d Angela said with a sigh. She smiled at Abby. \u201cSo, you\u2019re thinking about joining us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Abby asked, startled by the question.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already been through the academy. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re expecting an assignment when this is over. I believe Jackson intends to suggest you join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe\u2014be part of the Krewe?\u201d Abby stammered.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the bureau may talk about us behind our backs,\u201d Angela said, \u201cbut we\u2019re actually considered a pretty elite group.\u201d</p><p>Abby glanced at Malachi. He\u2019d known, she thought. He was watching her, waiting for her reaction.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should get through this first,\u201d Abby said. She turned quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll go up and shower,\u201d she said. \u201cOh.\u201d She looked at Malachi. \u201cI have a few clothes here. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi and Jackson are about the same size. It\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Angela said. \u201cIf it was, one of us would just run over to the tavern. So, go and shower. There\u2019s nothing like a shower to wash away dirt and to clear the mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s hoping,\u201d Abby said, and sped up the stairs to her own room.</p><p>She\u2019d given the Krewe carte blanche with her house; she noted that they\u2019d apparently recognized this room as hers and chosen other ones.</p><p>She looked around. She\u2019d rented it furnished and during her most recent visit, with the place empty, she\u2019d brought her old treasures back to this room, out of nostalgia more than practicality. Maybe because her life was on the verge of change... The bookshelves were filled with her beloved fiction\u2014and the books she\u2019d devoured on law enforcement, the FBI, profiling, unsolved cases and the minds of killers.</p><p>I must have been a pretty scary kid, she thought.</p><p>The guitar she\u2019d never quite learned to play sat, once again, in its stand near her closet. A stack of board games lay on a table in a corner. The room was still decorated in royal blue with black trim, nothing girly or frilly about it.</p><p>She had never owned a doll.</p><p>She examined her old CDs and DVDs, which she\u2019d arranged on one of the shelves. She\u2019d collected some weird and obscure music and some classics. She\u2019d been in love with the Traveling Wilburys and the various band members and their solo careers and work. She\u2019d watched everything ever done by M. Night Shyamalan.</p><p>She\u2019d also owned Blythe Spirit, which her father had taken her to see on Broadway, and Ghost, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir...</p><p>Because she had her own ghost?</p><p>She smiled a little bitterly. \u201cBlue, I do have my own ghost\u2014so where are you? It\u2019s you and me now, you know?\u201d</p><p>Her half smile cracked some of the dried mud on her face.</p><p>The shower. She went in and turned the spray on hot and hard. A shower felt great on the body and great for the mind, as Angela had suggested.</p><p>However, it didn\u2019t really do much for her mind. Although it did make her forget\u2014for the moment\u2014that they were in a battle against time if they were going to find Bianca Salzburg.</p><p>It made her wish she wasn\u2019t in the shower alone.</p><p>She winced.</p><p>She was becoming obsessed with Malachi. A good thing? Or not? What if they\u2019d just discovered each other simply because of the circumstances? What if what she felt wasn\u2019t real and what if their personal relationship fell apart and they both became part of the Krewe?</p><p>She needed to think carefully.</p><p>She still wished he was there in the shower with her.</p><p>A shower could clear the mind.</p><p>Malachi didn\u2019t really want his mind cleared; he wanted to put everything within it in order.</p><p>First. Theories he was convinced could be proven, or were, in effect, proven by what they knew.</p><p>Like his belief that the killer was someone who knew Savannah, knew it extremely well, and knew the history of the city.</p><p>Second. The killer thought he was a pirate or wished he was a pirate in days gone by. He\u2019d given Helen Long a card with a name on it, Christopher Condent, and Condent had been a brutal pirate who\u2019d never faced justice, eventually becoming a rich man.</p><p>Third. The killer was dressing up as Blue Anderson.</p><p>Because there were so many good images of Blue? Or because of the sweeping hat Blue had worn, his long dark hair and the facial hair that could hide a real identity? And did the motivation involve his theory that the killer wanted to discredit the real Blue Anderson? If so, was there any connection to the fact that the victims had all been to the Dragonslayer before they were abducted?</p><p>Fourth. A mental note, really. He thought he had the killer narrowed down; he\u2019d be shocked if he was wrong. It was someone close to Abby. Someone who was close to the Dragonslayer and had known Gus well. Someone familiar with the legends of Blue and other pirates, and, perhaps, someone in a solid business position. He\u2019d need a certain amount of money to move about easily, to join others at a bar, to appear to be part of the everyday community. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t young or attractive, but he would know how to make others think he was kind and nice. He was dressing up and proud of the fact that he was fooling people, including his own peers. No one knew him when he went into pirate mode to attack his victims.</p><p>Malachi got out of the shower. Angela had left him several pieces of Jackson\u2019s clothing. He didn\u2019t want to look like an agent but he wanted clothing that didn\u2019t advertise the fact that he was carrying a weapon. He chose jeans, a polo shirt and a navy windbreaker. He was going to drink with the barflies today, get them talking, learn more about them. And he\u2019d do it with Abby, who would know what was true and what wasn\u2019t and if any of the trio\u2014or even Sullivan, Macy or Grant Green\u2014behaved strangely.</p><p>Downstairs, he was glad to find Kat Sokolov at the dining room table, watching the screens that patrolled the Dragonslayer and now the river embankment, too.</p><p>\u201cKat, what about the victim from the tunnels? Have they identified her yet?\u201d</p><p>Kat shook her head. \u201cThey have her DNA and took dental X-rays, but there\u2019s nothing to compare them to. I received some possible candidates from the database, but nothing definitive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malachi sighed. \u201cA woman\u2019s murdered and we don\u2019t even know who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it would it help us find the young woman who may still be alive if we did know who the other victim is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. But the thing is we have three dead women, one who escaped and a dead man. We also believe Gus was a victim. We assume that both men were killed because they stumbled onto something. The women were new to Savannah, although Helen Long had been here for a while. They were all attractive\u2014all beautiful female captives. But I suspect the killer saw them, watched them, before he took them. I suspect he\u2019s looking for a woman to be the perfect mate in his life of pirate crime.\u201d</p> <p>Abby had come down and stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHe has a whole fantasy built up,\u201d Abby said, continuing Malachi\u2019s narrative. \u201cHe\u2019s the pirate who seizes a captive and the captive falls in love with him, eschews her old life and joins him on the high seas. Perhaps the killer thought he had the right woman with Helen\u2014but she kept saying she was repulsed by him. She didn\u2019t want him to touch her, and she couldn\u2019t pretend. That\u2019s what happens when he gets to the point where he feels rejected, he kills. And then he searches for another woman.\u201d</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>Abby lifted her hands. \u201cHow does this help us, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does help us. We watch for someone who...watches,\u201d Malachi told her. \u201cLet\u2019s head back to the Dragonslayer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re going to find the killer there?\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment. She was obviously trying to keep the bitterness out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we\u2019ll find him there.\u201d</p><p>It was late for lunch, but the Dragonslayer was still doing a booming business. Macy was at the host stand, and Bootsie and Aldous were at the bar. Abby got up onto the stool next to Aldous. He\u2019d just finished a plate of fish and chips, and while she affectionately called him a barfly, he wasn\u2019t drinking; he sipped from a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d he asked, nodding at Malachi, who sat beside Abby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Aldous. Just confused\u2014like everyone else. And scared. There\u2019s another girl out there somewhere, and I\u2019m hoping we can find her, as we did Helen. Alive, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, alive. It\u2019s a sorry thing, huh? And your friend Roger English\u2014is he broken up over it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. They\u2019d just started dating, but he felt he\u2019d found the \u2018one,\u2019\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Bootsie did have a beer in front of him. He let out a snort. \u201cRoger, ah, that boy! Well, she was\u2014sorry, is a pretty girl. But I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the one for him. Roger is falling apart now, but that boy is a passionate soul. He loves the city, he loves dress up and history. She\u2019s a little namby-pamby for him. He\u2019ll figure that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope he gets to figure that out,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope,\u201d Aldous repeated. \u201cHe\u2019s here now\u2014over there, at a table. With your other high school bud, Abby. What\u2019s that other kid\u2019s name? The one he works with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul Westermark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Apparently the girl playing Missy Tweed isn\u2019t available tomorrow\u2014she\u2019s up in Charleston for her mother\u2019s birthday. You said the show was to go on, so...I guess they\u2019re trying to come up with someone to fill in or rewrite or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a problem,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cThey have Abby. She\u2019s a wench at heart, the best wench ever, I\u2019d think. She\u2019s related to Blue Anderson. His descendent, I should say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was my great-great-great-whatever uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, the whole swashbuckling thing is in the genes,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cIt sounds like great fun. I\u2019d love to get in on it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLad, I\u2019m betting they\u2019d welcome you!\u201d Bootsie assured him. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like playing pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye-aye!\u201d Aldous said.</p><p>\u201cNot when you have to do it every day and make drinks in costume and wash these bleached cotton shirts all the time!\u201d Sullivan chimed in. He\u2019d finished preparing a tray of drinks for one of the waitresses but was listening to them and now walked down on his side of the bar to join them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really mind, do you?\u201d Abby asked him. \u201cThe pirate and wench outfits here have become tradition. Maybe I could spruce them up, though. We haven\u2019t changed in while. Maybe get you a nice new frock coat?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan laughed, running his fingers through his red hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, Abby. I\u2019m just bitching. Well, we could spruce up some of them. I\u2019m not sure I want a frock coat. It can be hot as hell in Savannah.\u201d He looked at Abby anxiously. \u201cWere you planning to make a lot of changes?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo, Sullivan. I love the Dragonslayer, and Gus handled it brilliantly by leaving things alone. I won\u2019t be here all the time, anyway. And Macy and Grant do a great job. But I\u2019ll okay new uniforms if we can improve on tradition.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan seemed pleased. \u201cCool. I love my job here. And I agree that the costumes add to the ambience. One day, I\u2019ll save enough to buy my own place. Oh, I\u2019m not going to compete with you\u2014it won\u2019t be pirate-themed! Maybe I\u2019ll go with a high-Victorian type of place. And it won\u2019t be for years.\u201d</p><p>Abby couldn\u2019t help laughing at his conciliatory tone. \u201cSavannah abounds with fine places and the Dragonslayer is only one of them. When you open your own place, Sullivan, we\u2019ll all celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make my bartenders dress to the nines! I know\u2014I\u2019ll have them look like the butler in Downton Abbey. Grant will love it\u2014whoops, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t steal him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Abby shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to worry about Rog over there, Abby,\u201d Bootsie murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s down in the dumps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, he\u2019s broken up about that girl,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him. She seemed to be nice. He was so pleased and proud to introduce her around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go talk to him.\u201d Abby slid off her bar stool. She walked over to the tables in the dining room with the Blue Anderson statue by the grate. Roger and Paul Westermark were there. She wasn\u2019t sure what they were talking about because they glanced up at her approach and grew silent. Paul quickly stood and gave her a hug. Roger did so more slowly. He looked at her anxiously.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, Roger. But the police are following new leads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew leads?\u201d he asked. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re inspecting the rowboat we found last night. They\u2019re still combing the river and the ships and boats. They will find her, Roger. You have to have faith and...and keep living your life,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cAbby just lost her grandfather,\u201d Paul reminded him. \u201cOne of the greatest old guys on earth. And she\u2019s doing things. She\u2019s not sitting around moping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly the same thing!\u201d Roger waved a hand in the air. \u201cBesides, Abby wanted to be a cop. Or an agent. She\u2019s good at this. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s good at worrying about someone they care about, Roger. It\u2019s a terrifying situation,\u201d Abby told him. \u201cBut you do have to keep on with your life while we\u2019re searching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, yeah, are we doing the street show tomorrow?\u201d Paul asked. \u201cWe did it every Saturday until...well, until Gus died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus would want it go on, of course. Yes\u2014and I\u2019ll be your Missy Tweed.\u201d</p><p>Paul sat back, grinning at her. \u201cWow. I was afraid you\u2019d come back here thinking you were above such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, this is my heritage we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember the lines and everything, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less. It\u2019s half ad-lib, anyway,\u201d Abby said, rolling her eyes. \u201cIt was never my favorite role. Missy Tweed just screams a lot and gets tossed from man to man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crowds love Missy Tweed. Look at me\u2014I get to play Scurvy Pete. I\u2019ve had people throw stuff at me,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I had such high Shakespearean hopes!\u201d</p><p>Abby smiled at that. \u201cPaul, you act beautifully and you always seem to have work, here or in commercials or with your singing. I heard you\u2019re going to start recording.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m planning on getting into a studio. A producer showed up at one of my performances in the Irish bar. He\u2019s going to finance it for me. I\u2019m pretty happy with that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI used to be happy,\u201d Roger moaned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had a few beers,\u201d Paul told Abby in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cDid you eat anything?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get into the wench costume and we\u2019ll do our pirate act,\u201d Abby said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make Gus proud, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, Abby. You bet.\u201d Paul nodded vigorously.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Abby, of course. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, just be strong,\u201d she told him. She gave them both a slightly grim smile and returned to the bar.</p><p>Things here had changed.</p><p>Aldous and Malachi were gone; Will Chan had come in with Dirk Johansen and they were now seated next to Bootsie.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Aldous and Malachi go?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Aldous has some business to check on. Malachi...I don\u2019t know. I think he was going upstairs. Or maybe he went outside. I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Bootsie said.</p><p>\u201cHow did everything go today?\u201d Abby looked past Dirk to Will Chan.</p><p>Chan\u2019s features gave away nothing of his thoughts; his smile and mannerisms were consistently pleasant. \u201cI\u2019m having a great time as a pirate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ship sails on as always, right, Dirk?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, Chan, you\u2019re an excellent addition.

Will Chan seemed to have the situation in hand. She told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to run upstairs and check on some paperwork. Unless anyone needs me for anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Abby, you are a delight!\u201d Bootsie said. \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s never been a better descendent of old Blue. Other than Gus, of course. I\u2019m always proud to have you at my side. But we\u2019re pretty used to you being gone now. We\u2019ll carry on\u2014Sullivan over there, Dirk and me. We\u2019ll carry on!\u201d</p><p>Abby glanced at Will, who nodded. She had a feeling that someone in the bar was a cop, following Roger. Will was sticking close to Dirk, and he couldn\u2019t possibly follow two men, no matter how good he was.</p><p>She rose, curious to find out where Malachi had gone, but when she ran upstairs, he wasn\u2019t in the apartment. She looked into the offices, the employee areas and the storeroom with its long rows of restaurant supplies, but he wasn\u2019t anywhere to be found.</p><p>He\u2019d gone out\u2014without leaving word.</p> <p>She quickly dialed his number from her cell.</p><p>When he answered, she asked, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d She tried not to sound anxious.</p><p>\u201cTailing Aldous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I would\u2019ve come with you. Me showing you the city might have kept you from looking obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t look obvious,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She realized she was a little lost without him, although she was the one who was actually an agent. But Malachi had real-world experience, as a cop and a private investigator, and as one\u2014</p> <p>As one who could see beyond the surface.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet he eventually ends up back at the Dragonslayer,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cBut right now, we\u2019re going toward the river. Seems like he\u2019s heading for a yacht. Nice piece of work. Beautiful boat. Looks like it\u2019s about thirty-three feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his pleasure craft. She\u2019s called the Lady Luck,\u201d Abby told him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m trying to keep up. I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>Abby bit her lip as he ended the call. The police, she knew, had already searched the Lady Luck when Malachi and Jackson insisted the Dragonslayer \u201cbarflies\u201d be investigated.</p><p>She walked back to her apartment and opened the door. As she did, she discovered that she hadn\u2019t locked it when she\u2019d gone to the storeroom.</p><p>As she shut it behind her, she saw someone standing by the windows that opened out onto the balcony.</p><p>Instinctively, she set a hand on her Glock.</p> <p>But the person turned. \u201cAbby,\u201d he said softly. And then, as if testing her name, \u201cAbigail Anderson.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Aldous walked with a determined pace, apparently oblivious, careless of whether anyone watched him or not. He seemed to have purpose and went straight from the Dragonslayer to River Street.</p><p>Malachi kept a careful distance as Aldous walked along the river and stopped at the private dock where the Lady Luck was docked.</p><p>He used his owner\u2019s key in the slot, as well as his code, to gain entry and only then did he turn around to see who else was nearby. Malachi had ducked behind a handy SUV.</p><p>It was still early; people were out in droves. That seemed to please Aldous. He walked onto his yacht, whistling.</p><p>Malachi waited to see if he intended to take the vessel out.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell; Aldous went down into the cabin.</p><p>Malachi put a call through to Jackson. Before he could explain what was happening, Jackson sprang some information on him. \u201cThey\u2019ve identified the rowboat we brought in last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s from the Lafayette\u2014a merchant ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she wind up in the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows. But we didn\u2019t need a warrant. The captain assured us we could search the ship and of course we did. He also told us she\u2019d already been searched. The cops have been on almost every ship, boat and floating anything on the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing? So it was just an unconnected accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. The Lafayette is owned by a giant parent company, and the CEO happens to be one of the Dragonslayer\u2019s main barflies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAldous Brentwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s why it was searched the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the riverfront watching him now. He just went out to his private yacht, the Lady Luck. He locked the gate behind him. I\u2019m going in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi, hold on. There are officers near you. I can be there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a dive, Jackson. If he does have her on that yacht, he\u2019s torturing her right now. Get here as fast as you can.\u201d</p><p>He hung up before Jackson could argue, then he moved to a public area, shed his jacket and shoes and dove in. He swam around hard and fast to the Lady Luck and caught hold of the mooring rope to swing himself up on deck.</p><p>Aldous was nowhere in sight. Malachi tiptoed around the deck to look down into the cabin, but it was a large one and his view was blocked. He had to take the steps.</p><p>The yacht was luxurious. The steps led to a galley and dining area, with a captain\u2019s chair and all kinds of electronic gadgets to the left.</p><p>Still no sign of Aldous. There was a hallway that stretched toward the aft. He followed it, then quietly opened the first door. The room was a head, complete with shower. The second door opened to an elegantly appointed cabin. Empty. He tried the door across from it. Also empty.</p><p>One cabin remained. The master storeroom. He strode the last two feet down the hallway and listened. Logic told him that no woman could be captive there\u2014unless she was dead. If she\u2019d cried out at any time, she\u2019d have been heard by someone on a nearby boat or even someone walking on River Street.</p><p>Tap, tap, tap.</p><p>Helen\u2019s words still haunted him.</p><p>There was no tapping, just the rhythmic lap of water against the hull. He could hear a band playing at a riverfront club, but that wasn\u2019t the noise he was listening for.</p><p>He heard the cabin door opening; he skirted back, sliding into the head, cracking the door slightly.</p><p>Aldous Brentwood walked down the hallway and went topside. Malachi couldn\u2019t see him, but it sounded as if he\u2019d hopped back onto the dock. He waited a moment longer and hurried down the hall to the aft.</p><p>He threw open the cabin door.</p><p>Abby stood still, wondering if she was really seeing what she thought she was. Maybe she wanted to see Blue so badly she\u2019d envisioned him there.</p><p>But Malachi saw Blue. In fact, Blue had spoken to him.</p><p>And now, he\u2019d actually spoken to her.</p><p>\u201cBlue.\u201d She said his name, wondering if he\u2019d disappear. But the image remained. The spirit of the man she\u2019d seen for the first time, years and years ago, when she and her grandparents and the Dragonslayer had been in danger.</p><p>He had led her to Gus; he had led her to save Helen.</p><p>She walked closer, but not too close.</p><p>\u201cYou helped me,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cOf course, but there is little I can do when no one sees. You see. Quite remarkable, Miss Abigail,\u201d he said. His voice was like a dry wind. He didn\u2019t speak often, she thought. She suspected it wasn\u2019t easy for him.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Gus...die?\u201d she asked him. \u201cAnd Helen\u2014how did you know? What have you seen? We need your help again, Blue\u2014we so desperately need your help.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and in that motion he seemed to impart great sadness.</p><p>\u201cI came upon Gus. I tried to keep watch after I realized someone had opened the grate and knew about the exit by the riverbank. I was too late to realize that the Dragonslayer was being used. I was too late with Gus\u2014but I began watching, walking a vigil around the Dragonslayer, up and down the tunnel, out to the river. I saw\u2014from a distance\u2014something. There was nothing I could do, no boat I could take. But you followed me, and the woman lived.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Hoping he\u2019d be able to give her a name had probably been too optimistic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still keeping watch,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you saw someone approach the Dragonslayer last night in the middle of the night, when we were out. You scared that person, Blue. You made him leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to see who it was. He left too quickly.\u201d Blue moved with a flourish of his frock coat; he was evidently indignant. \u201cHe wore a cape as I sometimes wore. He pretends to be me!\u201d He looked as if he\u2019d say more, as if he\u2019d unleash a spate of curses but determined not to\u2014not with a great-great-whatever niece standing there. He waved a hand in the air. \u201cThe young gentlemen pretend to be me in your theatricals, but I find that quite charming. I appear heroic and honorable, do I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery honorable,\u201d Abby assured him.</p><p>\u201cTo be depicted so is palatable. For a killer such as this coward to take on my persona\u2014that is beyond despicable. To torment and slay young women as he does... This is a monster. A monster, Abigail, and I will help you in every way that I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI continue to keep watch here. I watch over you as you sleep. I am here, in this hall, or below.\u201d It sounded as if he attempted to clear his throat. \u201cTimes have changed, of course. And yet heinous murder remains heinous murder. And few people are so cruel and brutal as this...this piece of human refuse.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be fading.</p><p>\u201cBlue,\u201d she called out. \u201cWhy have you never spoken to me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there was no need,\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew I was here. And you followed me each time, as I prayed you would. I...I need to rest now. This is...difficult for me. Perhaps one learns... Still, throughout the years, there are not so many who can see me, and fewer still who hear me. But, Abby, I am with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except, as he spoke the last words, he wasn\u2019t. He disappeared as if he\u2019d never been there.</p><p>Abby realized she was shaking.</p><p>She sat down on the chair in front of the computer screens. She gazed at them for a moment, her mind strangely blank and her hands still trembling. She clenched them into loose fists.</p> <p>The screens showed her that Sullivan remained behind the bar, Macy chatted with customers, Bootsie raised a beer to his lips.</p><p>Will Chan sat and watched.</p><p>In the dining room, Paul and Roger were still at the table. Paul was speaking earnestly to Roger; Roger nodded and kept drinking.</p><p>He was going to play an interesting Blue the following day if he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>She left the computer screens, knowing that someone at the house on Chippewa was always watching them. By the time she came downstairs, Bootsie and Will were gone. Sullivan worked behind the bar, putting away glasses.</p> <p>Macy was off-duty, and Grant Green had taken her position at the host stand.</p><p>\u201cHey, girl,\u201d Grant said to her. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. You getting any rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cNo luck on the missing girl, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cI\u2019m having the waitress bring a check to Paul and Roger. I\u2019m pretty sure Paul wants to get Roger out of here. At least the two of them won\u2019t be driving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank God for small mercies,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right to...hurry them out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant, yes of course. You\u2019re the manager. You can and should refuse to sell to anyone who appears inebriated. That includes my high school friends.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThanks. It\u2019s just kind of... Well, we\u2019re entering a new era at the Dragonslayer. We all need to adjust.\u201d</p><p>She refrained from telling him that, at the moment, the running of the tavern was the last of her concerns.</p><p>\u201cBut you know what? I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll take care of this,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She walked over to the table where Paul and Roger were still sitting. She slid in next to Roger and took his hands. \u201cLook at me, Roger.\u201d</p><p>When he did, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going home now. Go to bed and get some sleep. We\u2019re doing the pirate show for the crowd tomorrow. I need you to be in good shape. You and Paul. I\u2019m not an actor. I can only do it because I grew up here\u2014and because I have the two of you. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled at her a little blearily. \u201cYeah, you know about Missy Tweed, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was ransomed,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cBut she fell in love with Blue. She wanted to stay with him. He did save her\u2014he came back to his ship to find that bastard, Scurvy Pete, trying to attack her. Scurvy Pete told him she was a captive and they were pirates and he was being a fool. So Missy thought Blue was her savior. Of course, Blue had seized her off her father\u2019s ship, but that didn\u2019t stop Missy from loving him. He was a businessman, Abby. Blue was a businessman. He only attacked ships that belonged to England\u2019s enemies. He took her off her father\u2019s ship when he saved the crew because the ship had been caught in a storm and wrecked and began sinking. So...Blue actually saved Missy twice,\u201d he concluded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great story, Roger. And we\u2019ll do it well tomorrow. If you go home now.\u201d</p><p>Paul looked at her with gratitude. \u201cCome on, Roger. I\u2019ll get you home.\u201d</p><p>Paul helped him up and they left together, arm in arm. As Abby watched, a man in a colorful tourist shirt rose from his table and followed.</p><p>Abby smiled. The police were at work; she knew the man had to be a plainclothes officer, doing his job.</p><p>Following Roger English.</p><p>\u201cI busted into an empty cabin,\u201d Malachi told Jackson. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid I dripped water all over that beautiful yacht. But I did find this.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard anything in the cabin and hadn\u2019t really expected to find Bianca Salzburg. If she\u2019d been there, she would\u2019ve made some sound\u2014unless she\u2019d been gagged and Helen hadn\u2019t said anything about being gagged, just blindfolded.</p><p>So, no Bianca. But what he had found was more than a little suspicious.</p><p>Maybe not under normal circumstances. But under these circumstances...</p><p>He handed Jackson the scarf. It was a large pirate-themed scarf, the kind that was sold all over the city. It had been crumpled and kicked half under the bed. He wondered if it was used as a blindfold by someone.</p><p>Aldous?</p><p>The man was big and burly. He looked like a pirate. He was rich. He owned ships and a private yacht. He was in the prime of his health.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he go when he left here?\u201d Malachi asked, sitting on a bench to get his shoes back on as they spoke.</p><p>\u201cHe was followed to his house. There\u2019s an officer outside now,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cDid they get anything off that partial gum wrapper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTesting isn\u2019t in yet.\u201d</p><p>Malachi nodded. Fingerprints, if there were any, weren\u2019t necessarily easy to match, since they might not be in any law enforcement database.</p><p>Malachi stared out at the river. One of the big paddle wheelers was going by; the music and laughter traveled all the way to shore.</p><p>People looked at him curiously as they passed. On the riverfront, it was growing late. But tourists, in smaller numbers, were still passing by. The news of a missing woman\u2014and the murders\u2014was surely disconcerting to them. But if they traveled as couples or in groups, the horror was removed. They could sympathize, but this wasn\u2019t their home, and it wasn\u2019t their friend, lover or child who\u2019d been killed or was missing.</p><p>No person could embrace every tragedy. It would make life unbearable.</p><p>There was nothing Malachi could see on the river. Not then.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll call it a night.\u201d He turned to Jackson. \u201cThey\u2019ll watch him through the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be a man on his house at all times,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Malachi nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d Then he frowned, shaking his head. \u201cJackson, something is bothering me. Helen talked about a sound. Tap, tap, tap. Does that mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>Jackson looked tired. \u201cThey weren\u2019t taken by the ghosts of Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly,\u201d he said. \u201cTap, tap, tap. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll try to think of things that could make that kind of sound. And I\u2019ll see that the whole team is aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cSituations like this always are. But,\u201d he admitted, \u201cit\u2019s better when you work with others\u2014the right others.\u201d</p><p>Jackson managed a smile. \u201cSo, you\u2019re in? As more than a consultant?\u201d</p><p>Only if we find Bianca alive, Malachi thought.</p><p>\u201cAssuming we solve this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll solve it,\u201d Jackson vowed. \u201cWe have to. And we will. We have a perfect record so far.\u201d</p><p>They left the riverfront together, parting ways on Bay Street. Jackson had brought his car and Malachi didn\u2019t want a ride for the few blocks to the Dragonslayer. He could dry off enough walking back, then he\u2019d slink up the stairs before anyone noticed him.</p><p>The Dragonslayer was still open when he returned, but he didn\u2019t pause to speak to anyone; he just started up the stairs. Grant, at the host stand, saw him and waved, and he waved back. None of the barflies was present, nor did he recognize anyone at the tables.</p><p>When he entered the apartment, Abby came rushing over to him and threw herself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell you what happened!\u201d she said excitedly before drawing back. \u201cUgh. You\u2019re all wet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went swimming,\u201d Malachi said. He was sorry the moment he said the words. Hope sprang into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou found Bianca?\u201d she asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cNo. I dove into the river to get to Aldous\u2019s yacht.\u201d He inhaled. \u201cAbby, the rowboat Roger saw on the river\u2014it belonged to a ship owned by one of Aldous\u2019s companies. The police searched the ship, welcomed by the captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that prove anything?\u201d she asked. \u201cOther than that a rowboat from a big ship broke away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s all it is. But I also found a scarf on his yacht that might...that might\u2019ve been used as a blindfold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have been used as a blindfold. And that would hold up in court?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbby, we\u2019re searching for a killer. We\u2019re not in court. We\u2019re trying to find a young woman while she\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>Abby let out a breath. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, meeting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s been proven\u2014we\u2019re watching Aldous, Dirk, Roger, among others\u2014and keeping an eye on Bootsie, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s seventy!\u201d</p><p>Malachi nodded. \u201cBut we have to watch everyone, Abby. Everyone who was familiar with Gus\u2014and the Dragonslayer,\u201d he went on. \u201cGus knew something because of what he\u2019d seen here. There\u2019s no way out of that. Don\u2019t forget he found one victim\u2019s finger.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. She looked deflated but seemed to have accepted the truth. \u201cSo much time is going by. Bianca doesn\u2019t stand much of a chance, does she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s strong and resilient. She may be playing it just right,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cHe wants a captive who will fall in love with him. He\u2019s trying to live out a fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t give himself away somehow, we\u2019ll never find him,\u201d Abby muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Malachi said with assurance. \u201cHe was afraid when he came to the Dragonslayer the other night. Why he came when he did, I don\u2019t know. Maybe just to prove that he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only people with keys are\u2014\u201d</p><p>Malachi interrupted her. \u201cHow closely did Gus watch his keys around his friends?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She pursed her lips and then sighed. \u201cHe kept his keys on a hook behind the bar,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess anyone could have borrowed them and had copies made.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnyone who knew how casual he was with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the grate to the tunnel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas opened by someone who knew the combination.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least we have a new lock\u2014with a new combination.\u201d She frowned. \u201cBut if we\u2019re sure it was one of those three, why don\u2019t the police just bring them all in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe they\u2019ll bring Aldous in for questioning tomorrow. We\u2019re trying to be very careful.

He started to embrace her, remembered he was still soaked and stepped back. \u201cWhat? What was it you were going to tell me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlue,\u201d she said. \u201cBlue was in here, right after I talked to you on the phone. He spoke to me. He had a real conversation with me. But even though he\u2019s been haunting the tavern for years, he\u2019s not good at drawing whatever energy he needs to speak. I\u2019d hoped so badly that he knew something. But, like you\u2019ve said, ghosts or spirits seem to be the same as we are. They aren\u2019t omniscient. They only know what they\u2019ve seen. He didn\u2019t see what happened. He just knew that the tunnel was being used. But he promised me he\u2019s watching now.\u201d</p><p>Malachi touched her hair, brushing his fingers down the silky length of it. \u201cBlue is your ancestor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s you he cares about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have cared deeply about Gus. And the others who came before Gus and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did, but you\u2019re his focus now. He\u2019ll do anything to protect you\u2014and the Dragonslayer.\u201d He stepped back. \u201cI\u2019ll get in the shower.\u201d</p><p>He left her in the living room and walked down the apartment hallway to the bedroom, shedding his wet clothes. He went into her bathroom; the Dragonslayer might be old, but Gus had had the bathrooms modernized. The faucet released a hard spray of steaming hot water.</p><p>He let it pound down on him, just standing there for several minutes.</p> <p>And then he felt her. She\u2019d stepped in behind him. She held the soap in her hand and worked it slowly over his body.</p><p>A shower can clear the mind....</p><p>In a radiant spray of heat he became lost in the sheer sensual pleasure of being with this extraordinary woman while the water pulsed, hot and vibrant, searing into his muscles.</p><p>They more or less made love. They teased and aroused, and teased and aroused again as they left the shower and halfway dried themselves, then fell into bed together.</p><p>Being together like this was sweeter every time. There was nothing arbitrary about it, nothing that didn\u2019t seem to offer promise, nothing that brought back the pain of memory and the past.</p><p>He\u2019d never really thought it possible. He was falling in love again.</p><p>Abby had never really liked playing Missy Tweed. To her mind, Missy had been an idiot. History said she\u2019d fallen in love with Blue Anderson and that she\u2019d cried when she was returned to her father. She disappeared into history after that, but Abby always felt she\u2019d probably been a spoiled teenager and that, once home, she\u2019d simply fallen in love again.</p><p>But here she was...playing Missy Tweed.</p> <p>Paul, as Scurvy Pete, stood beside her on the platform. Roger, sober and seriously in \u201cBlue\u201d mode, was wearing his pirate best. They\u2019d drawn a huge crowd; the little reenactments and the way the players talked and related tidbits of history were well documented and well-known, a high point in most tour books for their area.</p><p>Will Chan had taken on the role of narrator that day, dressed as a swashbuckling pirate himself. He talked first about the history of the city of Savannah and the early days of piracy. He told the crowd that pirates had found their way into coastal cities, often snubbing their noses at a royal governor and whatever military or local law might be in effect.</p><p>He told the story of Blue as if he\u2019d been a true gentleman with the people of Savannah.</p><p>And then he told the story of the floundering of Missy Tweed\u2019s ship and how the crew had been saved\u2014and the damsel taken for a fair ransom. Blue believed that asking a ransom for Missy was well within the law; after all, he\u2019d saved the lives of an entire crew. And if asking for the ransom wasn\u2019t quite within the law, then so be it. He would still be paid. However, on his ship, every man knew that captives were not to be molested or harmed.</p><p>But Scurvy Pete had brought his own pirate ship flush with Blue\u2019s; he\u2019d wanted in on the action. And when he\u2019d seen the delectable Missy, he\u2019d wanted much more. Thus began the drama that the crowd was about to witness.</p><p>With a flourish, Will left the makeshift stage. Abby dutifully let out the scream of distress, which brought the pirates to action, Scurvy Pete accusing Blue of being less than a man and a blot on the rugged truth of piracy. Blue, in turn, ridiculed Scurvy Pete, telling him he was due to swing from a yardarm, that he wasn\u2019t just a blot on piracy but a blot on the entire human race.</p><p>Abby could see that the rest of the Krewe who were in Savannah were scattered through the crowd. They were there because their suspects were there, except for Dirk, who was out on the Black Swan. Dirk was not alone, although he undoubtedly thought he was. A plainclothes policeman was on board; Abby knew that Jackson and Malachi both believed they were drawing close to a resolution and that everyone needed to be watched.</p><p>\u201cYou fool! I will have your captive, and I will return the lass as I see fit!\u201d Paul told Roger. \u201cYou will fall beneath my steel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day I\u2019ll fall, but I will fall to the law on the high seas and not to the likes of you, Scurvy Pete!\u201d Roger said. \u201cI will go with my ship\u2014and not with the dregs of the sea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the death, Blue Anderson! To the death!\u201d Paul bellowed, and the two began to thrust and parry with their swords, to the delight of the crowd.</p><p>Abby screamed appropriately\u2014like a girl\u2014and fell back. Will Chan came to slip his arms around her and help her from the stage so the sword battle could continue.</p><p>The two men were very good at what they did. The crowd grew, with everyone entranced. Finally, Blue caught Scurvy Pete with a fatal blow.</p><p>Paul died, emoting dramatically. Will took to the stage again to do a follow-up, and then the crowd broke into applause.</p><p>Abby was immediately besieged by a number of children in the audience. She posed for pictures with them and answered what questions she could about Savannah and piracy.</p><p>She looked up at one point, aware that she was being watched. Malachi had been waiting for her to notice him.</p><p>She made her way through the crowd to approach him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to the station. They\u2019ve just brought Aldous in,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She felt her heart sink. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll join you there soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Jackson and I will question him. David will go in and out. We\u2019ll find out where he\u2019s hiding Bianca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but the evidence points to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they have anything definitive?\u201d</p><p>Malachi nodded. \u201cDNA on the scarf I found on his yacht,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDNA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom tears,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cThe scarf was around the eyes of Felicia Shepherd at some point before she was killed. They were able to extract DNA and it matched Felicia\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Malachi had to hand it to Aldous. When he\u2019d first been brought in, accused of the murder, he\u2019d been belligerent and angry. Then he\u2019d look incredulous.</p><p>Now, he looked scared.</p><p>\u201cYou want to take it for a few minutes?\u201d Jackson asked Malachi, who\u2019d been observing the interrogation. \u201cDavid thinks we can handle this better than he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Malachi walked into the room. Aldous Brentwood raised his head; he was pale. His bald head gleamed in the bright light overhead, his gold earring glittering.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Aldous muttered. He shook his head as if in disgust.</p><p>\u201cAldous, you shouldn\u2019t be aggravated with me. I didn\u2019t want to think you could be guilty of something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your rowboats was found out on the river. Forensic teams are going over it now. I believe we\u2019re going to find some organic matter that will prove the boat was used to dump the bodies of those who were killed.\u201d</p><p>Aldous leaned toward him. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Agent Gordon. You can\u2019t prove I ever had that rowboat. I own the ship, yeah, but I don\u2019t work on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an agent,\u201d Malachi told him. \u201cJust a consultant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsult yourself out of here. My attorney is going to make mincemeat out of all of you.\u201d Aldous sat back, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing on me. Does Abby know you\u2019ve brought me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows. And, Aldous, I\u2019m afraid we have more on you than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That I go to the Dragonslayer? That I was friends with Gus?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d have to arrest half the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t they tell you what this is?\u201d Malachi asked. A pirate scarf\u2014the one he\u2019d found half under the bunk in the yacht\u2019s master cabin\u2014was on the table between them, carefully folded in a plastic bag.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scarf in a plastic bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour scarf,\u201d Malachi said. He watched the man intently for his reaction. Aldous Brentwood didn\u2019t appear to be anything other than perplexed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t buy those stupid tourist scarves!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you did. This one was found on your yacht.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It was not! I let the police search my yacht. I\u2019ve cooperated since this whole thing began. I am not guilty of anything! Hell, what\u2019s the matter with you? I\u2019d never have hurt Helen. I was crazy about Helen. Am crazy about her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe you liked her too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick!\u201d Aldous spat.</p><p>\u201cAm I? You\u2019ve bought into the legend of pirates and their swashbuckling adventures since you were a kid. Look at your normal mode of appearance. You\u2019re not married and never were. You own all kinds of ships. You\u2019re rich, and you\u2019re rich because of the sea. You know the Dragonslayer, you know Savannah and the river. And you know your pirate history. Come on, Aldous. You want to live a fantasy. You probably imagined from the first that you could kidnap a girl and convince her you were a charming rogue, an Errol Flynn or a Johnny Depp. But you could never get the right girl.\u201d</p> <p>Aldous Brentwood\u2019s eyes widened with incredulity as he stared at Malachi. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about!\u201d he shouted. \u201cAnd I sure as hell don\u2019t know what this scarf\u2014that isn\u2019t mine\u2014means!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was used as a blindfold, Aldous,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cPoor Felicia cried\u2014cried in fear and terror and despair\u2014when she was bound in a cabin on one of your ships. She cried, and she left traces of her DNA to prove that you were her killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014and that wasn\u2019t on my yacht!\u201d Aldous protested. \u201cThe police were on my yacht.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t find anything there\u2014unless it was planted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlanted by the police?\u201d Malachi asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cBy the police,\u201d Aldous agreed energetically. \u201cOr...or someone!\u201d He pointed at Malachi. \u201cOr you. You! We don\u2019t know you\u2014you don\u2019t belong here. You\u2019re not one of us. Maybe you planted it on the yacht!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAldous, get over it. I was the one who found the scarf, but I wasn\u2019t in Savannah when this spree of kidnapping and murders began,\u201d Malachi told him.</p><p>\u201cBut you found it, right? You went on my boat illegally. I don\u2019t know the law all that well, but I know you can\u2019t use evidence in court when you got it illegally. And don\u2019t you get it? You\u2019re harassing the wrong person. I didn\u2019t do any of this. I\u2019m innocent\u2014I swear it!\u201d</p><p>Malachi decided wearily that he believed him. Aldous was passionate in his denial. But he pushed a little further.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not a cop. I\u2019m a civilian and I thought I heard you screaming on your yacht. I went out to see if you needed help. I saw that scarf, and took it in case you\u2019d been kidnapped or injured\u2014one victim was a man, you know\u2014and it meant something. I gave it to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest crock I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Aldous sneered.</p><p>Malachi shrugged. \u201cMaybe. We know you have all the right credentials\u2014and a rowboat and a scarf with a victim\u2019s DNA.\u201d</p> <p>Aldous shook his head. \u201cBut...it\u2019s not me. I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how did your rowboat wind up loose and how did the scarf wind up on your yacht?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! I\u2019m telling you, someone put them there,\u201d Aldous said. \u201cI swear to you, I know nothing about that scarf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else is on your yacht on a regular basis?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a cleaning crew that comes in once or twice a month.\u201d He paused. \u201cThere are ten berths there, so one of the other owners could have gotten on my yacht. And, then, of course\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aldous broke off. He looked ill.</p><p>\u201cAnd then, of course\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus, Bootsie and Dirk. The three of them had keys to the dock,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re my best friends. They were always welcome on my yacht.\u201d</p> <p>Something cold hardened inside Malachi. Aldous could be lying, trying to shift the blame.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t know; he didn\u2019t have a definite sense that yes, he was guilty, or no, he was innocent. He believed Roger, and even though he wasn\u2019t completely certain, he leaned toward believing Aldous.</p><p>That left Dirk or Bootsie.</p><p>Or...</p><p>Someone else who was always at the Dragonslayer, someone who knew everything about the way it ran, day in and day out.</p><p>Grant Green, Macy Sterling, Jerry Sullivan.</p><p>Macy? Doubtful\u2014unless she was someone\u2019s accomplice. Grant? Not around during the day. And yet, that could mean he was able to be anywhere else, without even having to slip away.</p><p>Jerry Sullivan, the bartender, friendly, ever listening, knowing everything and everyone. Always there from lunch until closing.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there any cameras around that river that might\u2019ve been aimed at my Lady Luck?\u201d Aldous asked him. \u201cI\u2019m telling you\u2014someone was on my boat and planted that scarf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it was planted, and the police didn\u2019t do it. Who would it have been?\u201d</p><p>Aldous shook his head, lost and dejected. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know. All I can tell you is that I\u2019ve never attacked anyone, I just happen to be bald, and I don\u2019t have any fantasies about being a pirate,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see what I can do for you, Aldous.\u201d Malachi got to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to let me go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask that you stay here for the moment. They\u2019ll get you some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, if it\u2019s going to clear me. I\u2019ll drink coffee and play Tiddlywinks all night if it\u2019ll make you people believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>Malachi was anxious to be on the move.</p><p>They only had one real connection to the killer. Helen Long. He had to talk to her again.</p><p>There had to be some clue in her story. There was something he should be seeing clearly, but couldn\u2019t, not yet. The answer to the riddle was in the back of his mind somewhere; he just hadn\u2019t figured it out.</p><p>Tap.</p><p>Tap, tap.</p><p>Tap, tap, tap.</p><p>14</p><p>\u201cPirates were really bad, right?\u201d a little boy asked Abby, his smiling mother beside him. She might have been portraying a girl who was an utter nitwit, but the audience seemed to have sympathy for the damsel in distress.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, yes, piracy is bad. There are still pirates out there today, and they\u2019re very bad,\u201d Abby said, crouching down to his height. \u201cBut Blue Anderson walked a middle ground. He started out as a privateer. That means, more or less, that he was asked to be a pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople can ask you to be a pirate?\u201d The towheaded boy stared at her, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cBack then, we weren\u2019t a country yet. We were a group of colonies governed by the English. England and Spain always seemed to be at war. So the king or queen of each country would allow men to seize ships\u2014as long as they were ships that sailed under the enemy\u2019s flag. So, Blue was a privateer to begin with. He never did seize an English ship. You remember the story in today\u2019s show? He actually saved the crew of a foundering ship, but kept Missy because he thought he was owed something for his work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Blue?\u201d the boy asked.</p><p>\u201cTyler, you\u2019re driving the lady crazy,\u201d his mother said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Abby assured her. \u201cBlue never begged for a pardon, but he wasn\u2019t a bad guy. Legend had it that the Royal Navy could have sunk his ship several times, but they let him sail by. Whether that\u2019s true or not, I don\u2019t know. One day he sailed out\u2014and he never came back. No one heard from him or any of his crew again, so history records that he was caught in a storm at sea and went down with his men and his ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, cool!\u201d Tyler said. Gripping his mother\u2019s hand, he asked, \u201cCan we go in there\u2014to Blue\u2019s tavern\u2014and have lunch? The menus for kids are supposed to be pirate hats!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaper pirate hats, but yes,\u201d Abby told him.</p><p>\u201cYes, lunch!\u201d his mother said. \u201cCome on now. Thank you...Missy.\u201d</p><p>Abby grinned. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Standing, she looked around. Will Chan was heading into the restaurant; Jackson Crow was keeping an eye on her and talking on the phone.</p><p>Roger and Paul were still talking to tourists.</p><p>Aldous, she knew, was at the police station.</p><p>She went into the restaurant herself\u2014and saw Dirk just ahead of her and glanced at her watch. The Black Swan would have finished the first tour of the day.</p><p>He was probably on his way to the bar for lunch before the second tour.</p><p>Abby quickened her pace. The show was over; she wanted out of Missy Tweed\u2019s voluminous gown and into her own clothing\u2014and she especially wanted her Glock.</p><p>She walked into the tavern. It took a moment for her eyes to adjust to the dimmer light.</p><p>Grant and Macy were at the host stand, talking. She assumed Grant had come in to make sure that their return to the Saturday-morning theatrical events went smoothly.</p><p>But, as she watched, Grant gave Macy a kiss on the cheek. Macy walked over to the bar where Bootsie and Dirk were now seated together. She sat down next to Dirk and let out a sigh.</p><p>\u201cHow was the show?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt went very well,\u201d Bootsie said. \u201cVery well. You and Grant are keeping everything moving along. Gus would be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved.\u201d Macy shrugged. \u201cWhy I thought anything would be different...I don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighed again. \u201cI miss Gus.\u201d</p><p>Abby hurried over to where Macy was sitting. \u201cWe all miss him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Abby! I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d Macy turned, touching Abby\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I mean we all miss Gus, but he was your grandfather. We don\u2019t have the same right to miss him that you do.\u201d</p><p>Abby smiled at that. \u201cMacy, you were just as much family. Miss him all you like\u2014and I\u2019m grateful that you do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you were staying around, Abby,\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me,\u201d Abby assured him.</p><p>Grant came striding over, watching the host stand as he did, but grinning. \u201cWe have to let her move on, you know!\u201d He lowered his voice to a whisper. \u201cI think love is in the air.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLove!\u201d Bootsie scoffed. \u201cLove?

Abby and that fed, they\u2019re both cops,\u201d Bootsie muttered.</p><p>\u201cCops fall in love,\u201d Macy said.</p> <p>Dirk winked. \u201cAnd everyone falls in lust from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Abby,\u201d Grant said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with the tall, dark and handsome G-man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Malachi?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope\u2014or else our girl\u2019s become a home wrecker,\u201d Dirk said. \u201cI get the impression that the cute little blonde G-woman is with tall, dark, exotic actor G-man. And the pretty blondish one is with tall, dark, handsome and Native American G-man. That leaves intriguing G-man who\u2019s staying up in the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, why would you be worried about my love life, anyway, huh?\u201d Abby asked Dirk, avoiding the question.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll always worry about you, Abs,\u201d Bootsie said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re like the great-uncles you\u2019re really glad you never had,\u201d Dirk told her, which made Abby laugh.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just the bartender,\u201d Sullivan said lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou guys know I dreamed about working for the federal government, that all my life I wanted to be an agent,\u201d Abby said. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll go back to work with a unit, wherever I\u2019m assigned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I looked this unit up,\u201d Grant said sagely. \u201cThey\u2019re the Krewe of Hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Bootsie asked.</p> <p>\u201cThey ask the dead questions\u2014and the dead help them find the killers,\u201d Grant explained.</p><p>Macy giggled at that. \u201cSeriously? Come on, Grant. The one woman is a medical examiner. If they could talk to the dead, she\u2019d just ask the corpses who...who turned them into corpses. Oh, I sound terrible\u2014I\u2019m concerned, really. I\u2019m grateful you found Helen, Abby, and praying that Roger\u2019s girlfriend will be found, as well. But it\u2019s not looking good for her, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any real answers,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Bootsie made a sound of derision. \u201cAll those feds and cops\u2014and nothing. You people, all that schooling\u2014and a pirate\u2019s walking all over you.\u201d He raised his beer. \u201cAsk the dead questions, my ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBootsie,\u201d Dirk remonstrated quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just us here,\u201d he said. He looked around. \u201cHey, where\u2019s our third? I haven\u2019t seen Aldous all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be around,\u201d Sullivan said, pushing away from the bar to get a drink order from one of the waitresses.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure he will,\u201d Macy agreed.</p> <p>\u201cHey, you make a great wench, Abby,\u201d Grant told her.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks. Which reminds me, I want to go and get out of this now.\u201d Abby turned but then paused, looking back. \u201cDo me a favor, will you, Macy? Why don\u2019t you and Dirk go out on a date instead of staring at each other all the time? It\u2019s not like you just met or anything.\u201d</p><p>Macy\u2019s face went bright red. \u201cAbby!\u201d</p><p>Dirk was silent.</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s a sensible question,\u201d Bootsie said. He gave Dirk a nudge. \u201cHere\u2019s your chance, boy. Ask her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d Dirk said.</p><p>Macy found her voice. \u201cDirk, I don\u2019t know what these people are doing, but don\u2019t you dare feel obliged to ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel obliged, Macy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...we should go out sometime. To a restaurant. We\u2019re in a restaurant. I mean, a different restaurant. One where you\u2019re not working. Or we could go dancing. Or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirk Johansen, are you asking me out?\u201d Macy demanded.</p><p>\u201cI guess I am. Except you don\u2019t have to feel obligated or anything. I\u2019m not trying to put you in a bad position\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to go out with you, Dirk!\u201d Macy said.</p><p>\u201cThank God! That\u2019s settled,\u201d Bootsie said. \u201cNow, can we get back to sitting around the bar and bitching about everyone we see? Macy, shoo! Go back to work.\u201d</p><p>Macy smiled and walked back to the host stand. Grant took a seat at the bar.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he announced, \u201cwas really cool. Good work, Abby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, thank you. Now, I\u2019m finally going to get out of this ridiculous outfit!\u201d</p><p>Leaving them at last, she ran up the stairs as quickly as she could, encumbered by the skirts that had defined her as Missy Tweed for a few hours.</p><p>Helen was doing much better.</p><p>When Malachi arrived, her police guard was seated in the hallway, reading the newspaper.</p><p>Angela Hawkins was in the room with Helen, as were her coworkers, Jack and Blake. They were still in their pirate attire from the morning sail of the Black Swan; Malachi assumed that, like Dirk, they usually took the two hours between sailings of the \u201cpirate\u201d vessel to either have lunch or get their errands done.</p><p>Helen seemed to be beaming; she was, he thought, maybe a year or two older than Blake\u2014the one who was so obviously\u2014and awkwardly\u2014in love with her.</p><p>But that afternoon, she was thrilled by his attention.</p><p>\u201cMalachi!\u201d she said, greeting him with a warm smile.</p><p>He bent down to kiss her cheek. \u201cHelen, you look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling good,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the doctor said I\u2019m doing well, right, Angela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said you\u2019re almost ready to go home.\u201d</p><p>Helen frowned. \u201cYou need to talk to me again, don\u2019t you, Malachi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a hint to the two of us, Jack, but that\u2019s okay,\u201d Blake said. He\u2019d been sitting by her on the other side of the bed. \u201cJack and I have to get back for the afternoon sail of the old Black Swan. We\u2019ll be back, Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not be. Hot date tonight.\u201d Jack grinned. \u201cWith a pretty, pretty\u2014and I do mean pretty!\u2014redhead who sailed this morning. She agreed to do me the honor of joining me for dinner this evening. So, my beloved colleagues, it might be tomorrow before I stop by. But I\u2019ll bring you delicious details!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here! If she\u2019s smart, there won\u2019t be that many details!\u201d Helen joked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here tonight,\u201d Blake promised.</p><p>\u201cThanks. You really help the time pass,\u201d Helen said softly.</p><p>Blake beamed. He and Jack left, waving as they walked out the door.</p><p>Malachi sat next to Helen. Angela sat on her other side, taking her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re very strong, Helen.\u201d Angela smiled, encouraging her. She looked over at Malachi. \u201cA therapist was in to see her. She\u2019s doing brilliantly, he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also said I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d Helen told him. \u201cAnd he said...he said I\u2019ll be able to go forward again, have a good time, even have a relationship again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will. We\u2019ll get him, and you\u2019ll know we did it because of you. You\u2019ll know you saved others. He had you, but you beat him, Helen,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>She gave him a weak smile. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. I always thought I was so liberal. But if I had a gun and he was in front of me, I\u2019d want to shoot him. I want him strung up, I want his skin flayed from his body...\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s human nature, Helen.\u201d Malachi spoke as reassuringly as he could.</p><p>\u201cIs it? I hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen, I\u2019m not a hypnotist or any kind of therapist. But I want you to try to relax when we talk,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cAngela is here. We\u2019re both here. You\u2019re protected. I know it hurts, that it\u2019s painful, but I really need you to try to remember every detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could remember more,\u201d she said. \u201cI went into the church...and I remember the searing pain in my head\u2014and then nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then, the lapping of water against a cabin. You were in a ship\u2019s cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Helen said.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you think it was a ship\u2019s cabin?\u201d Malachi asked.</p><p>\u201cThere was a lot of wood. Paneling. I was in a bunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig cabin or little cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTight...it was a tight cabin. When he was in it, I could feel him as soon as he came in.\u201d She kept her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you remember a sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTap, tap, tap?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYes, it was an odd sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he with you all the time when you heard it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...sometimes, he wasn\u2019t.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cBut...when I heard it, I was so afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt meant he was coming for me.\u201d</p><p>Up in the apartment, Abby turned on the television in the living area for company while she ran down the little hall to her room and changed out of her pirate clothing. She chose jeans, a T-shirt and finally a denim jacket\u2014a perfect way to hide the Glock she didn\u2019t intend to leave behind.</p><p>She was anxious to call Malachi and see what was going on. Had they found something that proved Aldous could be the killer?</p><p>Had Aldous confessed?</p><p>She felt shaky and weak considering the possibility. Aldous seemed like a good man, as well as a powerful one. He was rich, but he\u2019d always spent a lot of time working for various causes. How could a good man, who was willing to donate his money and his labor when needed, prove to be such a heinous criminal?</p><p>But it made her shake, too\u2014thinking that it could be someone she\u2019d known most of her life. That she might have gone to school with someone who\u2019d grown up to be a killer.</p><p>As she came down the hallway and went back into the living room area, she heard the television. She suddenly stopped; a newscaster, a sleek, attractive blonde, was speaking from an anchor desk while an insert on the screen showed a scene at the police station. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhile the Savannah police are not making any statements at this time, inside sources, choosing to remain anonymous, have stated that a suspect in the infamous River Rat murders is in custody and being questioned. The River Rat Killer\u2014so dubbed because of his ability to disappear on the water or under the ground\u2014is suspected to have taken the lives of one man and three young women, to have kidnapped and tortured a fourth young woman and may possibly be holding another captive, even as he\u2019s being questioned by the police. While our information has not been verified, it seems that the city of Savannah may soon breathe a huge sigh of relief. Our source has told us that the evidence in this case is based on hard science from the forensic lab. We\u2019ll be back with more information the minute it\u2019s available. Stay tuned.\u201d</p><p>Abby had to sit down. Aldous. It seemed impossible.</p><p>Her hands were trembling when she pulled out her cell phone to call Malachi. He answered immediately.</p> <p>\u201cHey, wench,\u201d he said. \u201cIs the show over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Where are you? What\u2019s going on? The media are announcing that the man suspected to be the killer is in custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe media have it already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I assume they\u2019re referring to Aldous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine. He\u2019s the only suspect. He\u2019s not really being held. So far, he\u2019s actually there voluntarily. I suggested to him that he didn\u2019t want to leave yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really think it\u2019s Aldous, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important that people\u2014especially the real killer\u2014believe the police are convinced the killer\u2019s in custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if the killer isn\u2019t in custody...or if he is, for that matter, Bianca is still out there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the hospital. I\u2019m on my way back, though. I may walk around for a while. I\u2019m trying to clear my head. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m in the apartment. I just got out of pirate-wench mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there, at the Dragonslayer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came up? Roger and Paul. They were still pirates, talking to diners. Bootsie and Dirk were at the bar, although Dirk will have to leave soon. Macy and Grant Green are both here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go down and be friendly, okay? They should start questioning the fact that Aldous isn\u2019t there. Isn\u2019t there a TV behind the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for games and events. It wasn\u2019t on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure it\u2019s on. See what happens when your patrons watch the news about the suspect who\u2019s being held. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>Abby ended the call. She stepped out of the apartment and carefully locked the door. Straightening her shoulders, she hurried down to the bar.</p><p>Macy was at the host station, Sullivan behind the bar.</p><p>Roger was seated at a table with a family, entertaining their three children. Paul was in the dining room as well, speaking with a young couple.</p><p>Neither Bootsie nor Dirk was at the bar.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are our favorite barflies?\u201d she asked Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Sullivan shrugged. \u201cI guess Dirk went back for the afternoon sailing of the Black Swan. Bootsie went with him. Maybe he\u2019s sailing with Dirk today. Aldous hasn\u2019t shown up, so he might have wanted to hang with a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d Abby nodded. \u201cCan you turn on the TV, Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Anything special?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. How about news?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan picked up the remote and switched on the flat-screen television that hung over the low etched mirror behind the call-brand whiskeys.</p><p>Abby had no idea how much good it was going to do, the two barflies who were supposed to see the news weren\u2019t there.</p><p>But the same newscaster came on, reporting that a suspect was being held in what was now called the River Rat case. She didn\u2019t have anything new to add, but she rephrased things so that it almost sounded as if she were telling her audience more.</p><p>Looking up at the screen, she could sense people walking up and crowding behind her. Roger and Paul were suddenly beside her; so was Macy. Abby hadn\u2019t even known Grant was still there, but he was with the group staring up at the screen.</p><p>\u201cThey caught him?\u201d Macy breathed.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re not revealing a name,\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bianca?\u201d Roger asked. \u201cThey\u2019re not saying anything about Bianca!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to really know anything,\u201d Grant commented. \u201cThey know the cops are holding someone and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo news about Bianca is good news, Roger,\u201d Macy said gently.</p><p>But Roger shook his head as he stared glumly up at the screen.</p><p>\u201cNo news... But they have to find her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they have a suspect, they can make him tell where he\u2019s keeping her,\u201d Sullivan said. He looked at Abby. \u201cRight? Hey, wait\u2014Abby, you must know who it is.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t comfortable lying but she had no intention of telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here playing wench. All I can do is connect with the feds and see what they know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, call Malachi!\u201d Macy insisted.</p><p>\u201cI just talked to him. He wasn\u2019t at the station,\u201d Abby said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t involved with what\u2019s going on there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s an FBI agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsultant,\u201d Abby corrected.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then you\u2019re an FBI agent!\u201d Grant said.</p><p>\u201cI just passed the academy. I don\u2019t have an official assignment,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Grant shook his head. \u201cThen you\u2019re running around helping those guys for free?\u201d Grant asked. \u201cGus should\u2019ve taught you to be a better businesswoman.\u201d</p><p>Abby frowned at him. \u201cGrant, business has nothing to do with it. I tried to get them down here because they\u2019re part of an elite unit who seem to solve situations no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need to hurry,\u201d Roger said, walking over to Abby. \u201cBianca\u2019s out there! She\u2019s not going to last much longer,\u201d he said dully. \u201cIf she\u2019s still alive, if she isn\u2019t floating somewhere we haven\u2019t found her yet. Or like that poor Jane Doe they\u2019ve got at the morgue. Shoved into an old crypt somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Abby very much wanted to say something reassuring to him. But the killer almost certainly had her. He\u2019d taken Helen, and attempted to kill her within a few days. She\u2019d failed to fall in love with him, failed to welcome him as her heroic lover.</p><p>How long could Bianca play the game before he got tired of trying to make her love him? Or before he realized that even if she was playing the game, she was lying and despised him?</p><p>The clock was ticking.</p><p>Malachi parked the car at the back of the Dragonslayer parking lot but he didn\u2019t go in. Abby was watching the Dragonslayer. He\u2019d just heard from Jackson, who was still at the police station. Will Chan was aboard the Black Swan.</p><p>A plainclothes detective had followed Dirk and Bootsie. Bootsie had returned to his own home, riverside of Colonial Park Cemetery; he\u2019d gone in and was still there.</p><p>Malachi began to walk along the river, back along Bay Street and then into the old section, where Oglethorpe had planned his original streets and squares.</p><p>What was he missing? Tap, tap, tap.</p><p>He started, quickly moving aside, as his distraction almost caused him to walk into a man. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, excuse me,\u201d he muttered. Then he paused as the man stopped\u2014and he realized he was looking at a soldier, a man in a Union uniform. It wasn\u2019t tattered and torn, so he must\u2019ve been wearing his parade best, dark blue adorned with gold braid.</p><p>Cavalry, Malachi thought, the analytical part of his mind making the first judgment.</p><p>Dead, was his second thought.</p><p>He was near the cemetery, but the last burial in Colonial Park Cemetery had been in 1853.</p><p>Then again, ghosts didn\u2019t usually haunt cemeteries. They haunted the places where they\u2019d lived and found happiness, where they feared for those who lived after them, or where they had met trauma.</p><p>He continued to stare at the ghost, incredulous and curious.</p><p>The young ghost stared back at him\u2014incredulous, too, and very curious.</p><p>A couple passed him on the street, clearly disturbed by the way he seemed to stare at some invisible entity. Maybe they felt a strange cold in the air, as well.</p><p>The woman shivered, looked at Malachi as if she feared there was something seriously wrong with him and the couple moved on. Malachi was alone with the young man under the shade of a live oak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you at first. Can I...can I do anything for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are talking to me?\u201d the ghost said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you see me. You hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My name is Malachi Gordon.\u201d</p><p>The ghost smiled. \u201cLieutenant Oliver Mackey. No, sir. There is nothing you can do for me. I was just going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear here?\u201d Malachi asked. \u201cNot Colonial Park Cemetery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat cemetery has been closed to burials for years, sir. I\u2019m sorry to say I died of a fever before ever proving my mettle in battle. While I was despised in life, sir, for my abolitionist views, I was, in death, returned to the arms of my family and laid to rest in my family plot.\u201d He pointed toward a house around the corner from the Wulf and Whistle. He shrugged, looking at Malachi. \u201cThe coffin was never opened here. The war had begun, so I might well have been stripped, tarred and feathered, even burned to ash, had they done so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe war is long over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know that the fight for real equality, which this country must stand for, continues.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBroke my heart not to be loyal to my state, but I couldn\u2019t help my beliefs. Slavery was morally wrong, against my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany people agree with you, Lieutenant. But the world is changing, although it changes slowly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLaws are one thing\u2014it\u2019s harder to change the human mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have faith in the future, but yes, you\u2019re right.\u201d He gestured at the cemetery. \u201cLieutenant, I didn\u2019t know there were still family vaults or burials in the city area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are not. They built over the few graves in my folks\u2019 yard years ago. I am afraid my bones and those of my wife are broken and scattered. Where the earthly remains of my parents and grandparents might be found...I have not yet discovered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>\u201cThey rest, sir, in a far better place. That I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why do you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stay...\u201d The young soldier started to speak and then broke off, as if perplexed himself. \u201cI stay because I wait to see a better world. Then I will rest.\u201d</p><p>You might well haunt these streets for eternity if you\u2019re waiting for all men to embrace one another, Malachi thought.</p> <p>But he said, \u201cNoble indeed, Lieutenant. I wish you well. I believe we are on the way. I honestly believe most men seek the right to life, liberty and happiness for all. But to end all prejudice\u2014the whole world has a way to go. Where one hatred dies, another often springs to life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d the lieutenant agreed. \u201cSir, it was a pleasure\u2014you cannot imagine what a pleasure\u2014to make your acquaintance.\u201d He tipped his cavalry hat and started to walk on.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, sir. Perhaps you could help me.\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant paused, looking at him. \u201cI would be happy, of course, to be of assistance to a visitor to my fine city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about the tunnels around here? Tunnels that lead to the river?\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant smiled broadly. \u201cI knew quite a bit. My wife, although scorned by society for doing it, still managed to help many a man and woman to escape via the river. Captain Emanuel Vance used to bring a ship in, laden with supplies. He pretended to run the blockade, but what he did was carry many to freedom.\u201d</p> <p>The question had brought out enthusiasm in the young lieutenant. \u201cThe Dragonslayer, of course, was known for its tunnels since the days of the pirates. As was the Pirates\u2019 House. But a network was dug during the yellow fever. I saw the morgue myself as a young lad. No longer in use at the time, of course, but the remnants were there. Still are, I believe. But what we used for the Underground Railroad, sir, were the tunnels through the vaults. The vaults do not exist anymore, but the tunnels do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat vaults?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery old burial vaults,\u201d the lieutenant said. \u201cThe one behind my house is gone, but it connected to a vault beneath a tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Wulf and Whistle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. You know the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I went down to the tunnel, which led to the Dragonslayer\u2014and from there, to the river.\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant smiled. \u201cOh, sir, there are other branches in that tunnel. Savannah\u2019s secret society of abolitionists knew that tunnels could easily be discovered. There are little pockets, twists and turns down there. Before the shelling of Fort Sumter, those who believed in freedom for all were secretly working down here. Some of the finest engineers in the country were below the ground, along with some of the finest engineers from Europe. Those tunnels are extensive. Explore, but take care. If you are buried in any kind of collapse, sir, I fear you will not come out.\u201d</p><p>Malachi thanked him, furious at his own stupidity.</p> <p>They\u2019d found the damned tunnel underneath the Wulf and Whistle. Why hadn\u2019t they broken down all the walls?</p><p>Malachi saw the young lieutenant off, then hurried back to the alley. A man in jeans and a polo shirt leaned against the wall, reading a tourist guide. Malachi walked up to him. \u201cOfficer?\u201d</p><p>The man looked at him quizzically; Malachi produced the ID Jackson had given him to use while working the case.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Shubart. Officer Mike Shubart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going down,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not back up in an hour, alert the troops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. You got it.\u201d</p><p>Malachi walked to the tunnel and phoned Jackson, telling him what he was about to do. He reached the wooden cover, moved it and crawled into the tunnel. Hitting the ground, he pulled out his flashlight.</p><p>He patted his side, making sure the Colt .45 that was his favorite weapon was exactly where it should be. Then he played his light over the darkness that swallowed even that glow. He proceeded slowly.</p><p>Abby couldn\u2019t get hold of Malachi. His cell went straight to voice mail and his recorded voice said, \u201cLeave your message, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Abby. A very annoyed Abby. Where are you? What\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded, and then ended the call.</p><p>Police work, any kind of law enforcement work, could be tedious. Much of it involved watching. And waiting. Endless waiting.</p><p>She was watching at the Dragonslayer. Could be worse, she tried to tell herself. If she got hungry, at least there was food. And the seats were comfortable. The climate was nice.</p><p>And there was enough coffee to keep her wired for a week.</p><p>But try as she might to stay calm, she grew increasingly anxious. She sat at the bar, watching. Waiting.</p><p>Roger and Paul seemed to have nothing to do that day. Maybe Roger was watching her as she watched him. He probably assumed that if anyone was going to know anything, it would be her.</p><p>Every so often, news about the suspect in the River Rat case came on. Everyone went still and stared at the screen.</p><p>And then they turned to Abby.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to reach my colleagues yet,\u201d she told them. That was true in a way. Malachi wasn\u2019t answering.</p><p>To escape them all, she returned to the apartment to make her next phone call. Still no answer when she tried Malachi.</p><p>So she called Jackson next. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I talked to him. He\u2019s searching the tunnel by the Wulf and Whistle again. Seems he met up with a Union soldier while walking, a man who had worked with the Underground Railroad. The tunnels go all over, according to the soldier. I\u2019m standing at the entrance to the river as we speak, watching from this end, waiting.\u201d</p><p>Watching and waiting. Of course. She hesitated. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here, in the Dragonslayer? A cop in plainclothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the cop of all cops on the way over to spell him. David Caswell is coming. For dinner, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Abby said. \u201cThank you, Jackson. If you hear from Malachi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get in touch right away, Abby. We keep close tabs on one another. It\u2019s what keeps us all alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>She left the apartment and came downstairs, to discover that David Caswell had arrived\u2014and Bootsie and Dirk Johansen were back. The Black Swan had finished her afternoon sail.</p><p>David was by the bar, being grilled. Dirk looked as if he were in despair. He turned to Abby, his eyes filled with sorrow. \u201cThey think it\u2019s Aldous!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Dirk,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Dirk shook his head. \u201cI know Aldous. He\u2019s one of the best men out there. I refuse to believe the worst of him. He never had to join the military because his family was always rich. He did his stint, anyway. He could\u2019ve sat back on his ass his whole life, but he gave money to charitable projects and worked on them, too. I won\u2019t believe he\u2019s a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would have known,\u201d Bootsie insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, young man,\u201d he told David Caswell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we have physical evidence against him,\u201d David said. \u201cBut this is America. Every man is innocent until proven guilty.\u201d He looked at Abby and inclined his head. She thought he\u2019d been called by Jackson Crow, therefore knew where Malachi had gone\u2014and what she was about to do.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see.\u201d Abby shrugged. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll take a stroll through and talk to a few of the guests.\u201d</p><p>She did. Most of the diners were tourists, and they were intrigued by the case going on in Savannah.</p><p>They were relieved the police had a suspect.</p><p>She made her way into the second dining room and over to the image of Blue. He stared at her with unseeing eyes.</p><p>But he was there somewhere, she knew. Watching.</p><p>That thought made her smile.</p><p>She pretended to adjust the image of Blue and then stepped inside the little fence that surrounded the grate.</p><p>She slipped down into the tunnel without a backward glance.</p><p>Malachi came to the fork in the tunnel; he knew that one path led to the Dragonslayer and then to the river.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought much about the other, because it didn\u2019t lead to the river.</p><p>Or, he realized, it didn\u2019t appear to lead to the river. He moved in the other direction, his light bouncing over the walls.</p><p>He came to a heap on the floor and paused, ducking down to look.</p><p>Bones.</p><p>Bones caught in fragments of cloth, with the remnants of feet in ancient boots.</p><p>This was no new murder victim. He couldn\u2019t really tell what he was seeing, the remains had been there for so long. They\u2019d almost returned to ashes and dust, as the saying went. But the fact that they were here was interesting; this was clearly a pathway someone had used at some time. There was little he could tell from the stained bits of fabric and crumbling bone, but he had a feeling this dead man had been here at least two hundred years. Had he been abandoned where he lay as a warning to others?</p><p>He tried to imagine the days of the Civil War lieutenant and the slaves who would have been led through the tunnels to escape. Perhaps, at that time, these bones had been left so that if the tunnel was discovered, it wouldn\u2019t be considered an escape route, and those who tried to use it would face the law\u2014or worse.</p><p>He straightened and kept walking.</p><p>His light revealed something else ahead of him, something white, like a woman\u2019s gown, an elegant nightgown. He hurried toward it.</p><p>Then, a grunt of astonishment burst through his lips. He took a step\u2014but there was no ground. He crashed down into a deep hole. His body slammed hard on the earth and rock below. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abby slowly walked the tunnel to the river; she saw nothing. It didn\u2019t seem anyone had been down recently. But of course they\u2019d kept the grate locked with a new combination lock since last week. She, Malachi and Jackson Crow were the only people who knew the combination to the new lock.</p><p>But she\u2019d learned that the tunnel from the Wulf and Whistle connected to this one. There\u2019d been a guard on at the Wulf and Whistle, though. No one could have used these tunnels since the situation was discovered\u2014not without being seen. And if she looked at it the way the police and Malachi and Jackson\u2019s Krewe were looking at it, all the suspects were currently accounted for. Aldous was at the station; the others were in the Dragonslayer.</p><p>It took her a few minutes to work the catch on the false or pocket door that led from tunnel to tunnel. She wished she\u2019d paid more attention when Malachi had opened it. But, eventually, she heard the catch give and then the pocket door gave, as well.</p> <p>She moved farther, running her light carefully over the walls. First, she retraced the steps they\u2019d taken when she came down with Malachi.</p><p>When she reached the junction, where the second tunnel branched off, she hesitated, casting her light to either side. She saw nothing. Then she heard a cry. Ragged, throaty.</p><p>\u201cHelp...help.\u201d</p><p>The sound was weak, but it seemed to ricochet off the tunnel walls.</p><p>\u201cMalachi?\u201d she called.</p> <p>No response.</p><p>She instantly took out her phone to call for help. Of course, there was no signal. She was so angry she nearly threw the phone against the wall but refrained, sliding it back into her pocket. \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d she shouted. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>Still no response. She was sure the sound hadn\u2019t come from behind her, so she started forward, into the second tunnel, calling out, \u201cMalachi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, stop!\u201d she heard him call back, but it wasn\u2019t with the same voice she\u2019d heard before.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move any farther. I\u2019m in some floor trap in the tunnel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you out,\u201d she said, moving carefully, step by step.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trap in the floor. I walked right into it,\u201d he said with disgust. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any holds here, anywhere. Get help. Go get Jackson. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>His voice had become clearer, louder. She must be almost on top of him. She fell to her knees and crawled ahead, carefully covering the distance, feeling the ground as she did so. She\u2019d just about reached him when she heard something behind her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a tap, tap, tap...</p><p>It was a thump, thump, thump.</p><p>\u201cAbby!\u201d she heard Malachi yell.</p><p>She started to turn, started to reach for her Glock.</p><p>That was when the object slammed into her head, and only then did it register exactly what the sound was.</p> <p>\u201cAbby!\u201d</p><p>Malachi heard the thud. Abby made a sound\u2014not a scream but a gasp of surprise and pain. He pulled out his gun but he was afraid to fire; he couldn\u2019t see from the depths of the hole and he was afraid he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>He shouted out instead. \u201cLet her be. We all know who you are now. It\u2019s over!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, me hearty young lad! No, no, I think not. They\u2019ll hang old Aldous for my sins, and it\u2019s a shame, but that\u2019s the fate of seamen such as ourselves!\u201d came the answer.</p><p>Malachi began to scrabble at the earth. The killer had her. He heard the soft thunk, thunk, thunk, as the killer moved away with Abby.</p><p>And Abby...</p><p>Abby hadn\u2019t let out another sound.</p><p>Swearing, Malachi scratched and clawed at the earth, desperate to find a handhold.</p><p>At some point while she was being jostled, Abby started to come to.</p><p>Bootsie had used the hard end of an old blunderbuss to strike her. She was astonished that she had come to, although her awareness was dulled by the sharp pain in her head.</p><p>Thump, thump, thump turned to tap, tap, tap, and then she felt herself thrown down. She was in a boat. Yes. Thump, thump, thump. The sound of Bootsie\u2019s peg leg. The sound she\u2019d been told about.</p><p>And now...a rowboat.</p><p>Blue had said something about a rowboat. When the rowboats were out...</p><p>She could hear laughter and conversation but it seemed to come from far away. She heard another sound\u2014the splash of oars. She was on the water.</p><p>She tried to open her eyes without betraying that she was awake. Raising her eyelids slightly, she could see the riverfront easing away from her. Bootsie was facing her as he rowed. She realized that he\u2019d tied her wrists together. He\u2019d used sailor\u2019s knots. Struggling would only tighten her bonds.</p><p>Police were all over the riverfront! Why hadn\u2019t they seen her?</p><p>She tried to calculate where she was. South on the river\u2014south, and that was why the sounds of life were so distant. They\u2019d come up well below the customary tourist area and she thought he must have kept the tiny boat beneath one of the docks. It wouldn\u2019t have been obvious, and therefore probably hadn\u2019t been searched. It was a rowboat, and there was nowhere to hide a woman in a rowboat.</p><p>He\u2019d easily eluded the police time and time again.</p><p>Not now, she told herself. Not now. He was caught. He hadn\u2019t stopped to kill Malachi. Maybe he thought Malachi would die in the hold. That no one knew he\u2019d gone below the earth. But Jackson and the Krewe did, and they\u2019d find him.</p><p>Before he killed her?</p><p>Bootsie. Her grandfather\u2019s old and dear friend. Bootsie.</p><p>A man she\u2019d known most of her life.</p><p>The killer...the River Rat...was Bootsie. Robert Lanigan.</p><p>Impossible. Bootsie was nearly seventy. He didn\u2019t fit any profile. What had suddenly turned him into a murderer? And when?</p><p>The questions that seemed to arise in a flurry didn\u2019t matter. Her life was at stake. Bootsie wasn\u2019t stupid; she was sure he\u2019d taken her Glock and her cell phone. What he\u2019d done with them, she had no idea.</p><p>That particular question was quickly answered. She heard two splashes in the water and knew her phone and Glock were about to meet the river bottom.</p><p>She feigned unconsciousness.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t bother Bootsie. He began to talk. \u201cAh, pretty girl, pretty girl! You always were the best wench, Abigail. I have been searching and searching, but I didn\u2019t see, didn\u2019t realize. You were the real beauty, the prize of the river\u2014of the whole vast sea. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ve searched for, Abigail. Aye, we\u2019ve only now to chuck the other. She wasn\u2019t worthy, so we\u2019ll toss her into the water. It will be a fitting end for such a one! Women, you see, can be evil. Protect the women and the children! Bah, vicious little bastards\u2014that be the children! And wicked, horrid creatures\u2014that be women. Most of them, anywise. But now, perhaps, we\u2019ll sail the seas together, eh, Abby? As it should be.\u201d</p><p>Chuck the other...</p><p>She hoped that meant Bianca was still alive.</p><p>And that he was taking her to wherever he had Bianca.</p><p>A moment later, the rowboat hit something. Hard. Opening her eyes a little, Abby saw that it wasn\u2019t a ship; they\u2019d come to a rickety old boathouse on the river.</p><p>Clip, clip, clip...</p><p>That was the sound Bootsie\u2019s peg leg made against the wood of the rowboat as he beached it and then grabbed her.</p><p>The sun was dying as he threw her over his shoulder and began to walk, his gait jagged as he sank a bit on the left side of his body each time he took a step.</p><p>She heard the bang of a door and they entered the shack. It was old\u2014Civil War era, she thought. He threw her down and she continued to feign unconsciousness. When he\u2019d hobbled off, she looked around. She was on a flat surface. Old boats in various stages of disrepair littered the ramshackle structure. There was a door that led to a room, an old office or such.</p><p>The cabin Helen Long had told them about?</p><p>That had to be it.</p><p>And somehow, she had to stop him before he drowned the other young woman.</p><p>Malachi didn\u2019t waste his breath screaming or shouting. He forced himself to be calm, trying to find anything that could serve as a grip.</p><p>He was startled when things started to fall on him.</p><p>Dirt...an old box...even the old bones...</p><p>He looked up. In the spill of light from his flashlight, lying on the ground by his feet, he saw a face appear before him.</p><p>He\u2019d hoped for a cop.</p><p>Or anyone living, for that matter.</p><p>It was Blue.</p><p>\u201cGet me help, Blue. I\u2019m begging you, get me some help. Find my friends from the agency\u2014they\u2019ll see you, Blue, they\u2019ll get me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time. He has Abigail,\u201d Blue said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuilding up the ground. He would not mind. The bones belong to Blackheart McCready. He went to the devil long ago, my friend. Use them, step on them, use everything you have.\u201d</p><p>Blue fell flat on the ground, pushing in more dirt, dirt and rocks.</p><p>Malachi understood what he was doing. Piling up all the refuse Blue sent down to him, picking up his flashlight to use as a tool as well as for whatever illumination it could provide, he set to work. He built the refuse up and clawed at the walls above, creating a handhold for himself. He created a foothold next, and gripped the earth wall with his toes. The bones of the long-dead pirate helped him dig into the earth walls. He hollowed out another hold and then another. Blue reached down to him; they both knew that the ghost had no real ability to grab him and yet...he felt as if he was helped, pulled upward.</p><p>He rolled onto the ground. \u201cWhich way, Blue? Where the hell is he taking them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way...and then...follow me!\u201d</p><p>He ran after Blue, who was speeding through the darkness as if he were a bolt of fire. They seemed to run forever, until they came to a series of steps dug into the ground many years ago. They were far down the river. Dusk had fallen, and he could see nothing on the water.</p><p>\u201cBlue, where?\u201d he said desperately.</p><p>\u201cHe comes out here... There are boats under that old dock.\u201d</p><p>Malachi stared at the river. And then he saw it\u2014an old boathouse on a jut of land that curved about fifty feet into the water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He began to run again.</p><p>Abby felt she must have been doing a decent job of feigning unconsciousness. Bootsie walked around\u2014tap, tap, tap, tap, tap\u2014muttering. She had to find a way to take him by surprise\u2014difficult when her hands were tied.</p><p>He was old, for God\u2019s sake, close to seventy. But he was in good shape, good health\u2014except for his mind, obviously\u2014and he was decked out with a blunderbuss and sword.</p> <p>How the hell had he gotten those weapons? Where and when had he changed into the frock coat and hat he was wearing?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have come from the Dragonslayer. David Caswell would have seen him\u2014would have followed him, would have stopped him.</p><p>She heard Bootsie still moving around, still muttering to himself. \u201cAch, I\u2019ll worry about this one later... We\u2019ll need time. Best wench, yes, I have Abby now, and she is the one. I should have known before, yes. This will work. But I must get the other one out of the cabin...get rid of her now, out in the river. Poor lass\u2014not good enough. She\u2019ll have to die....\u201d</p><p>He was going for Bianca. He walked toward the closed room in the boathouse. At this moment, she was alive. But he was going to take her out and kill her. Bootsie didn\u2019t keep more than one woman at a time. He had taken her that night, Abby thought, because he\u2019d had the opportunity.</p><p>Because he was losing control.</p> <p>Tap, tap, tap, tap...</p><p>He was going for Bianca.</p><p>She heard Bianca\u2019s muffled scream as the door was thrown open. Abby twisted around and got to her feet, looking for a weapon. At least he\u2019d tied her hands in front of her. If he\u2019d tied them behind her...</p><p>She could see nothing in the shadowy expanse of the old boathouse except a discarded fishing pole. It was better than nothing. With her head still pounding, she took a step and staggered. She froze, afraid he\u2019d heard her, willing herself to find her balance. Bianca screamed again. Bootsie must have reached her.</p><p>She hunkered down for the fishing pole and got it in her hands, then rushed for the door. Bootsie was inside, hauling Bianca over his shoulder.</p><p>He had powerful shoulders, a powerful physique he\u2019d maintained all the years she\u2019d known him.</p> <p>The room in the boathouse was just as Helen had described it\u2014small, paneled, like a cabin on an old sailing vessel of days long gone. A pirate\u2019s vessel, perhaps.</p><p>Bootsie started to turn; she slammed the fishing pole over his head with all her strength. He lurched backward, dropping Bianca. She struck him again with the fishing pole, and he fell against the wood, almost on top of Bianca.</p><p>But as Abby drew back, ready to strike again, Bootsie recovered his balance. Blood poured from a wound on his forehead and he was infuriated. He bellowed out a curse and came after her. Abby lifted the fishing rod again, but he caught it and wrenched it from her hands. She backed away, faltering only a little, watching him with the same fury.</p><p>\u201cAh, lass! I will break you, you will see!\u201d He walked toward her, bringing them to the main room of the boathouse. \u201cThere is no defying me! I am the king of the seas. Governments fall down before me, none may rule me. And you will obey me or you will die! I am Blue Anderson! I am Blue Anderson, and I will rule the seas from here to eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Blue! Blue didn\u2019t hurt anyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt! You\u2019re a captive, and you want to stay with me!\u201d he roared.</p><p>Abby stared at him in shock. But he seemed to believe what he was saying\u2014that he was Blue Anderson.</p><p>\u201cYou will. You will be the wench, and you will want me!\u201d</p> <p>He walked over to her; she raised her hands in self-defense. He was incredibly strong\u2014slapping her arms down and throwing her back to the floor. Again, the world seemed to spin. He wrenched her up, gripping her arms with viselike strength.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to scar you, lass, but I won\u2019t mind beating you within an inch of your life,\u201d Bootsie told her. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll have to be hog-tying you until I get rid of the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch her again and you\u2019re dead!\u201d</p><p>The threat rang out with cold assurance.</p><p>Relief filled Abby.</p><p>Malachi.</p><p>He was soaked and muddy; he\u2019d apparently crawled up to the boathouse from the river. He had his gun trained on Bootsie and his eyes were centered on the man.</p><p>But Bootsie didn\u2019t release her. He spun her around in front of him, whipping something from his pocket. She suddenly felt steel against her neck.</p><p>\u201cCan your bullet move fast enough to stop the blade of my knife, boy?\u201d</p><p>Malachi strode closer to Bootsie. \u201cLet her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFight for her. Fight for her like a man, Scurvy Pete! You won\u2019t take my woman!\u201d</p><p>Malachi frowned.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t fight you, Blue,\u201d Abby said. \u201cHe has no weapon with which to fight. Blue wouldn\u2019t fight him without a weapon. It\u2019s a pirate\u2019s honor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got himself a mighty pistol there,\u201d Bootsie said. She felt the knife scratch against her throat.</p><p>\u201cGive him a sword. He\u2019ll put the pistol down.\u201d</p><p>Malachi must have seen the madness in Bootsie\u2019s eyes. \u201cA sword! No pirate captain would claim his captive without a fair fight!\u201d He shoved his gun back into the shoulder holster. \u201cLeave your hostage. Play out the scene, Blue Anderson. Give me a sword!\u201d</p><p>Bootsie wasn\u2019t crazy enough just to let her go. He dragged her with him, backing toward one of the chests. \u201cHere\u2014take your sword. Throw the gun to the corner of the room and take up your sword, Scurvy Pete!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put the gun away,\u201d Malachi began.</p><p>\u201cNo! Throw it across the floor!\u201d Bootsie commanded.</p><p>Malachi took his weapon from the holster, bent down and let it slide across the floor to a corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cMy sword now, sir! Blue Anderson, it will be a fair fight.\u201d</p><p>Bootsie, still holding his knife against Abby\u2019s throat, thrust her away from the chest. \u201cGet your weapon, Scurvy Pete, get your weapon.\u201d</p><p>His eyes never leaving Bootsie\u2019s, Malachi reached into the chest, piled high with swords and knives. He chose a sword.</p><p>He stepped back, lifting the sword. Abby saw him judge her position and that of Bianca, who\u2019d sidled back against the cabin door and sat there now, eyes wide with shock, not making a sound.</p><p>\u201cShall we, Blue?\u201d</p><p>Bootsie pushed Abby from him, sending her to her knees. He turned. Malachi was ready, and still Bootsie went after him with a vengeance that was startling.</p><p>Malachi fought hard. She didn\u2019t know where he might have learned about this kind of sword fighting\u2014and perhaps he knew nothing. At first, he struggled just to defend himself from the fury of Bootsie\u2019s attack. And then, finally, he began to move forward, managing to attack rather than merely defend. The two men dodged and maneuvered about the room.</p><p>Abby rolled away from the action, coming at last to where Malachi\u2019s gun had ended up. He carried a Colt .45.</p><p>She got her hands around it. It was a larger gun than hers with a higher caliber bullet, but she wasn\u2019t afraid to fire it.</p><p>She tried to take aim; the men kept moving about.</p><p>Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap...</p><p>Bootsie could move fast with his peg leg; he could all but dance.</p><p>Malachi lunged forward, slamming Bootsie\u2019s weapon, and the sword went flying across the room. Malachi staggered back, wearied by the fight.</p><p>\u201cStand down, Blue, stand down!\u201d he cried.</p><p>Bootsie seemed to falter. Abby realized he was reaching down to his thigh\u2014to grab a knife from its sheath.</p><p>She had a clear shot.</p><p>She fired as he drew the knife, about to throw it into Malachi\u2019s heart.</p><p>The sound was deafening; the recoil sent Abby flying back, her arm in agony.</p><p>Bootsie froze. Then he crashed to the floor, his peg leg moving at an awkward angle as his twisted body fell.</p><p>Malachi rushed to Abby, drawing her into his arms, loosening the ties that bound her wrists. As he did, they heard sirens.</p><p>A floodlight suddenly lit up the interior of the boathouse.</p><p>\u201cYou are surrounded. Put down your weapons. Come out with your hands up!\u201d someone ordered over a megaphone.</p><p>Bianca gave a strangled sob and Malachi started toward her.</p><p>Thankfully he didn\u2019t have to leave Abby.</p><p>Police were pouring in, Jackson Crow and David Caswell at the head of the group.</p><p>Since Bootsie was dead, it was difficult to put together the complete history of what had happened\u2014where his madness had begun and exactly how he\u2019d managed all his feats of kidnapping, disappearances and murder.</p><p>David Caswell told them they might never know; it was sad to say, but there were people who might remain missing forever\u2014and there were bodies that might never be found.</p><p>A search of his house led them to a stairway, which went to the cellar. There they discovered a pocket door that opened into the labyrinth of tunnels\u2014and his hidden store of frock coats, breeches, hats and pirate weapons.</p><p>As the Krewe and David Caswell sat around the table at Abby\u2019s house on Chippewa, they learned that the police had been examining other unsolved cases they\u2019d had over the years. They couldn\u2019t be sure. But Bootsie might have started his murder spree as much as a decade before. Back then, he might have lived out his fantasies at a slower rate. His wife had been alive then; she\u2019d probably kept him from totally indulging in his longing to be a pirate captain who kidnapped women and tried to get them to fall in love with him. But they\u2019d always wonder about a number of other situations. They\u2019d uncovered a drowning victim in their records from ten years earlier. Foul play had been suspected, but the case had grown cold. Two years later, the body of a young woman, decomposed beyond recognition, had been found south of them, off North Hutchison Island in Florida. There were missing-person cases that had never been solved in the following years. So, yes, it was possible that Bootsie had begun killing slowly\u2014and had then escalated into his mad world of piracy, seizing young women and killing them at a more frantic rate.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Abby said. She was glad to be at the table; she\u2019d stayed at the hospital the night before because of the concussion she\u2019d received. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Helen recognize Bootsie? He approached her with a business card identifying him as a man named Christopher Condent. But Helen knew Bootsie. And he didn\u2019t use Blue\u2019s name. He used the name of a different pirate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was in the behavioral unit for years before the Krewe,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken so many courses on the human mind that I should have answers. But I don\u2019t believe any of us have ever gotten to the core of what can make a man\u2014or woman\u2014so twisted. How they can be insane and yet behave sanely. He dressed up and hid his identity so well she didn\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said there was something familiar about him\u2014that she felt she should have known him,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I suspected one of the men who hung around the Dragonslayer. That, and the fact that every victim had eaten at the tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Dirk would have been on the ship at the same time the so-called businessman, Christopher Condent\u2014aka Bootsie Lanigan\u2014was on board. And Dirk didn\u2019t recognize him, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat just goes to show how skilled he\u2019d become at disguise,\u201d David remarked.</p><p>\u201cBut Bootsie had a peg leg!\u201d Abby said. She looked at David and then murmured, \u201cOh. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d David said. \u201cHe had his peg leg, which he preferred to use. But we know he also had several newer prosthetics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that, too.\u201d Abby nodded. \u201cHe claimed to like his peg leg best, said he hated the newer so-called \u2018real\u2019 prosthetics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA peg leg is best for a pirate,\u201d Kat said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cPlayacting.\u201d Will shook his head. \u201cIt can become far too real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Bootsie\u2019s case, definitely,\u201d Kat said. \u201cAnd he was taking the fingers from his victims because it was part of\u2014of being a pirate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously we\u2019ll never be able to ask him,\u201d Jackson replied, \u201cbut whether much of what we hear is legend or not, it is known that Blackbeard\u2014among others\u2014didn\u2019t hesitate to cut off a man\u2019s finger when he wouldn\u2019t hand over a diamond ring. This might be a detail Bootsie added later on. The earlier potential victims weren\u2019t missing any fingers.\u201d</p><p>They all talked about their theories, what they could and couldn\u2019t have done.</p><p>David was remorseful over the fact that they searched ship after ship\u2014boat after boat\u2014and never thought to look in the old ramshackle boathouse. A records check, of course, showed that it belonged to a corporation owned by a holding company Bootsie was involved with.</p><p>\u201cAfter Abby pulled Helen Long from the water, and after Helen\u2019s testimony, we were all convinced he held the women on a boat or ship.\u201d Angela smiled at Abby. \u201cThanks to you, though, two women lived. Helen and Bianca.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah\u2014but I got myself hit on the head,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cOnly after I fell down a hole,\u201d Malachi reminded her dryly.</p><p>\u201cBianca will live. She\u2019s traumatized, and it\u2019ll take time. But Helen\u2019s already out of the hospital, and Bianca...well, at least she kept her finger,\u201d Kat murmured. \u201cAnd, hopefully, the police will soon discover the identity of the one girl who remains a Jane Doe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to know that, for Bianca, the future has real promise. For one thing, she has Roger, who hasn\u2019t left her side since he was allowed in,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take all the good we can get.\u201d</p><p>Abby felt her phone vibrate; she knew it signaled an email and meant to ignore it. She liked sitting here with the Krewe. They\u2019d be leaving soon, and although she\u2019d be happily accepting the position offered to her, she wouldn\u2019t reconnect with them for a while. They were in Savannah now, and she didn\u2019t want to be distracted.</p><p>She glanced at the new email, anyway\u2014and gave a little cry of delight. The others went silent.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSorry. I just got a note from a friend of mine on the city council. She had her assistant go into the records after I wrote to her, and they\u2019re going to see that the gravestone in Colonial Park Cemetery is repaired. The proper information will be carved on it. The name had been damaged when the stone was vandalized by soldiers when Savannah surrendered to General Sherman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Jackson said, a knowing smile on his lips. He looked at Malachi. \u201cPerhaps the two of you would like to go make that statement at the cemetery?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good. Let\u2019s take a walk,\u201d Malachi told Abby.</p><p>\u201cOne minute. I want to print out this email to bring to Josiah\u2019s folks,\u201d she said, hurrying off to do that.</p><p>She and Malachi left the group with the Krewe planning their last evening in Savannah; they\u2019d have a barbecue at the house on Chippewa Square. Will said he thought it was fine for Kat to shop for the barbecue, but someone else might want to do the cooking. Kat was indignant, and Angela did her best to mollify them both; while Jackson watched with amusement.</p><p>Abby and Malachi walked the few blocks to the cemetery. It was late afternoon, just as it had been when they\u2019d gone into the tunnels the day before.</p><p>It was a beautiful time of day. The live oaks dripped moss that stirred and moved in the breeze.</p><p>Abby was grateful to be alive.</p><p>On the one hand, she could still shudder, remembering the fear she\u2019d felt when she realized she\u2019d been taken. But fear wasn\u2019t entirely a bad thing. Jackson wanted them to feel fear\u2014not debilitating fear, but the kind that made them careful and smart. They had managed well, especially since they\u2019d never clearly identified a suspect. They\u2019d had to use what they knew about both the living and the dead to see the situation through to its conclusion. They\u2019d successfully played into the fantasy of a man who\u2019d become a homicidal psychopath. Abby was glad the rest of the Krewe seemed proud of her and Malachi. The Krewe had come to Savannah because Jackson Crow had recognized something in her plea to him. He\u2019d found Malachi and, together, they\u2019d found her. She knew the right future stretched before her now.</p><p>\u201cThere they are,\u201d Malachi whispered as they entered the cemetery. Josiah\u2019s parents were sitting on their customary bench, as if they mourned someone only recently gone. Perhaps, to them, the sorrow was as deep as if it had occurred yesterday.</p><p>Abby walked over to them, her printed email in hand. \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith,\u201d she greeted them.</p><p>Edgar Beckwith immediately stood, bowing to her. Elizabeth rose by her husband\u2019s side, clutching his arm and looking expectantly at Abby.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Edgar asked.</p><p>\u201cAbby will read it to you. This message is from someone with the power to help,\u201d Malachi said.</p><p>Abby smiled and read the email out loud. She saw that Edgar and Elizabeth Beckwith smiled, too, as they heard the news. Elizabeth stepped forward to touch Abby\u2019s face with a gentle hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be a little ceremony when the work is completed,\u201d Abby told them. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here for it.\u201d</p><p>They bade Edgar and Elizabeth Beckwith goodbye, leaving the couple to stand by the grave, expressions of happiness and relief on their faces.</p><p>\u201cThat felt wonderful,\u201d Abby told Malachi.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. And it had. But one thing still troubled her, and Malachi seemed to sense that.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked her softly.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019ve pulled a few good endings out of this, but...how did Bootsie kill Gus? The autopsy showed that Gus died of a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could give you a definitive answer. I can\u2019t. But here\u2019s what my instinct tells me. Gus was a fine man, the kind of man who cared about others. I believe he was searching the tunnel, that he suspected something,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cWhen he stumbled on Bootsie, his heart probably gave out when Bootsie attacked him. Gus died trying to save others, Abby.\u201d</p><p>Abby nodded. She knew it would be years before everything Bootsie had done was uncovered. And it was shattering to think that he\u2019d been killing people and coming to the Dragonslayer, becoming more and more convinced that he was the living embodiment of various pirates\u2014including Blue Anderson. Maybe he\u2019d tried out different roles at different times. Blackbeard, Christopher Condent. Henry Morgan. But above all, he\u2019d wanted to be Blue.</p><p>And she\u2019d kissed his cheek, cared about him, thought of him as Gus\u2019s dear old curmudgeonly friend...</p><p>He had come to Gus\u2019s funeral. Made himself at home in the bar afterward, just waiting to seize another woman.</p><p>She shuddered. It was still too hard to believe.</p><p>\u201cOne more question,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was certain we should be searching for Bianca on a boat or a ship. How did you figure out that he was hiding her in the boathouse?\u201d</p><p>Malachi turned to her. He smiled and told her, \u201cBlue. The real Blue Anderson.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>They\u2019d needed a change of scenery. And Jackson had given them two weeks. Actually, he\u2019d given Abby two weeks; she was already official. When the two weeks were up, Malachi would have to go through classes at the academy. That was just the way it was. Unless he preferred to stay a consultant, which had its up and downs. But Abby wanted him to be a full part of the Krewe, and he knew Jackson thought that was best, too. So what the hell? He\u2019d go through the academy.</p><p>But before that, they had two weeks.</p><p>So Malachi and Abby had packed up and come to his home southwest of Richmond and, as he\u2019d hoped, she loved the house and its surroundings. The area was remote, but she didn\u2019t mind. She appreciated the country around them, the richness of the trees and the beauty of the crystal rivers and streams. They spent their time hiking, playing in the lake down the hill from his property and exploring Virginia. They went to a Civil War reenactment and to Richmond to visit some of the sights, and they traveled down to Colonial Williamsburg and took a day to do something that was sheer fun\u2014Busch Gardens.</p><p>Abby was a glutton for roller coasters.</p><p>Mostly, they slept in mornings. They watched DVDs and listened to music. They indulged in each other and wondered if they\u2019d always feel the need to be so close and so intimate. He talked about his marriage, and she told him about her few relationships, and they\u2019d sympathized over their past experiences. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their time was drawing to a close late one night\u2014or early one morning\u2014when he woke to find that she wasn\u2019t at his side. Rising, he slipped into a robe and walked out to the hall. \u201cAbby?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, so he went down the stairs. And then he saw her. She was seated by the fire and she was deep in conversation. That was why she hadn\u2019t heard him.</p><p>Zachary was there, looking extremely pleased. Malachi hadn\u2019t seen him since he\u2019d come to the house with Abby. Knowing Zachary, he\u2019d been making his own judgments before presenting himself.</p> <p>Abby glanced up and saw him. She smiled. \u201cZachary and I have met. We\u2019ve been talking.\u201d</p><p>Zachary stood. \u201cShe\u2019s delightful!\u201d he said, gesturing at Abby.</p><p>Malachi walked over to Abby, who rose. He slid an arm around her. \u201cDelightful? Well, she\u2019s a crack shot, no-nonsense, a brilliant agent\u2014and she can play a great wench. I think I\u2019ll keep her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will, of course, be a perfect gentleman,\u201d Zachary said in a stern voice.</p><p>\u201cI can try, of course. And will,\u201d Malachi added hastily. \u201cBut she\u2019s stubborn, and she has her own mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like that in a woman. My dear Genevieve was always ready to share her opinion. We lived in difficult times and she was ready to rise to any occasion. In fact...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can make this work, I could perhaps move on,\u201d Zachary said. \u201cAnd join my dear Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, he wants me to ask if you\u2019ll marry me.\u201d Smiling, Malachi looked at her.</p><p>Abby laughed. \u201cWe have, indeed, discussed that possibility, Zachary. We think marriage might be right for us in the near future. I\u2019m not a big fan of diamonds, but we have talked about a lovely ring with an emerald\u2014one that belonged to Malachi\u2019s mother. It happens to be my birthstone. So, for the moment, we\u2019ll move forward, learning about our future, using what talents we have to help others. And when the time is right, there will be a lovely wedding. We\u2019ll have it in Savannah. I think Blue needs to give me away. It\u2019ll be interesting to see that with a crowd observing, but I\u2019ll know he\u2019s by my side and that\u2019s the important thing. So, Zachary, you\u2019ll have to come to Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavannah! A beautiful city. I\u2014 Yes, I will manage to do that, and then, perhaps...\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve waited these many years, trusting that someone like Malachi would come along, and now...knowing that what we\u2019ve had as a family will go on.\u201d</p> <p>Malachi wasn\u2019t sure how Abby did it; she stood on tiptoe at just the right height and moved just the right amount of distance. It appeared she placed a perfect kiss on Zachary\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cThe children are going to be beautiful!\u201d Zachary said happily.</p><p>\u201cBut no rushing us now!\u201d Abby insisted.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Zachary assured her. He turned to Malachi. \u201cI must go tell Genevieve!\u201d he said, and headed toward the family cemetery in back.</p><p>Abby looked at Malachi with amusement. \u201cI think he approved of me. It took him long enough to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZachary? Ah, yes, he can be difficult to impress, but he does seem bewitched,\u201d Malachi said. \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m grateful he does approve.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin and kissed her lips. \u201cWhat matters more is that you approve of me,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>She clasped his hand. \u201cI\u2019m wide-awake. If you want to follow me upstairs, I can tell you all about my approval. Or, rather, I can show you.\u201d She grew serious. \u201cThese moments, this time...all precious, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery precious. We have to value such precious moments,\u201d he said. \u201cThey define our lives.\u201d He kissed her again and they started up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThink they\u2019re going to like each other?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cZachary and Blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they will. They\u2019ll be like two wonderful old grandpas, shedding a few tears as we say our vows,\u201d Malachi said. They\u2019d reached the door to his room. \u201cFor now, however, back to showing me that approval...\u201d</p><p>She released his hand and walked into the room. He paused and watched her for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, turning back.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m just grateful that you\u2019re here, that you walked into my room.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, a sound that seemed to make the world right. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just grateful that you walked into my life.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
