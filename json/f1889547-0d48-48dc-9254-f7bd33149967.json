Trimp tramp! Trimp tramp! Trimp tramp! sounded their boots as they marched abreast, heads held high, looking neither to the left nor right. For so they had been taught to march, and it is not an easy thing to forget the ritual of many years. The wars and battles were over, but I do not know if our soldiers had won or lost them, and maybe it does not matter. Their clothes were tattered, their boots more holes than leather, and not one of the soldiers journeyed home the same man as had left it.</p><p>By and by, they came to a crossroads, and here they halted to consider their choices. One road led to the west, the way straight and well paved. One road trailed to the east into a dark and secret forest. And one road pointed north, where the shadows of lonely mountains lay.</p><p>\u201cWell, fellows,\u201d the tallest soldier said at last, taking off his hat and scratching his head, \u201cshall we toss a coin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNay,\u201d said the soldier to his right. \u201cMy way lies there.\u201d And he bid his companions adieu and marched off to the east, never looking back as he disappeared into the dark forest.</p><p>\u201cI am partial to that way,\u201d said the soldier to the left, and he gestured to the mountains looming in the distance.</p><p>\u201cAnd as for me,\u201d the tall soldier cried, laughing, \u201cI will take this easy road, for such has always been my choice. But what of you?\u201d he asked the last soldier. \u201cWhat road will you take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, me,\u201d that soldier sighed. \u201cI believe there is a pebble in my boot, and I will sit and take it out, for it has been plaguing me these many miles.\u201d He suited action to word and found a nearby boulder to rest against.</p><p>The tall soldier clapped his hat back on his head. \u201cThen it is decided.\u201d</p> <p>The remaining soldiers shook hands cordially and went their separate ways. But what adventures befell them and whether their travels led them safely home I cannot tell you, for this is not their story. This is the tale of that first soldier, the one who walked away into the dark forest.</p><p>His name was Iron Heart....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Now Iron Heart got his name from a very strange thing. Although his limbs and face, and indeed all the rest of his body, were exactly like every other man created by God, his heart was not. It was made from iron, and it beat on the surface of his chest, strong, brave, and steadfast....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p> <p>LONDON, ENGLAND</p><p>SEPTEMBER 1764</p><p>\u201cThey say he ran away.\u201d Mrs. Conrad leaned close to impart this bit of gossip.</p><p>Lady Emeline Gordon took a sip of tea and glanced over the rim of the cup at the gentleman in question. He was as out of place as a jaguar in a room full of tabby cats: raw, vital, and not quite civilized. Definitely not a man she would associate with cowardice. Emeline wondered what his name was as she thanked the Lord for his appearance. Mrs. Conrad\u2019s afternoon salon had been paralyzingly dull until he had sauntered in.</p><p>\u201cHe ran away from the massacre of the 28th Regiment in the colonies,\u201d Mrs. Conrad continued breathlessly, \u201cback in fifty-eight. Shameful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Emeline turned and arched an eyebrow at her hostess. She held Mrs. Conrad\u2019s gaze and saw the exact moment when the silly woman remembered. Mrs. Conrad\u2019s already pink complexion deepened to a shade of beet that really didn\u2019t become her at all.</p><p>\u201cThat is...I...I\u2014\u201d her hostess stammered.</p><p>This was what one got when one accepted an invitation from a lady who aspired to but didn\u2019t quite sail in the highest circles of society. It was Emeline\u2019s own fault, really. She sighed and took pity. \u201cHe\u2019s in the army, then?\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Conrad grasped the bait gratefully. \u201cOh, no. Not anymore. At least I don\u2019t believe so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Emeline said, and tried to think of another subject.</p><p>The room was large and expensively decorated, with a painting on the ceiling overhead depicting Hades pursuing Persephone. The goddess looked particularly vacuous, smiling down sweetly on the assembly below. She hadn\u2019t a chance against the god of the underworld, even if he did have bright pink cheeks in this portrayal.</p><p>Emeline\u2019s current prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jane Greenglove, sat on a settee nearby, conversing with young Lord Simmons, a very nice choice. Emeline nodded approvingly. Lord Simmons had an income of over eight thousand pounds a year and a lovely house near Oxford. That alliance would be very suitable, and since Jane\u2019s older sister, Eliza, had already accepted the hand of Mr. Hampton, things were falling into place quite neatly. They always did, of course, when Emeline consented to guide a young lady into society, but it was pleasing to have one\u2019s expectations fulfilled nevertheless.</p><p>Or it should be. Emeline twisted a lace ribbon at her waist before she caught herself and smoothed it out again. Actually, she was feeling a bit out of sorts, which was ridiculous. Her world was perfect. Absolutely perfect.</p><p>Emeline glanced casually at the stranger only to find his dark gaze fixed on her. His eyes crinkled ever so slightly at the corners as if he was amused by something\u2014and that something might be her. Hastily she looked away again. Awful man. He was obviously aware that every lady in the room had noticed him.</p><p>Beside her, Mrs. Conrad had started prattling, evidently in an attempt to cover her gaffe. \u201cHe owns an importing business in the Colonies. I believe he\u2019s in London on business; that\u2019s what Mr. Conrad says, anyway. And he\u2019s as rich as Croesus, although you\u2019d never guess it from his attire.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible not to glance at him again after this information. From midthigh up, his clothing was plain indeed\u2014black coat and brown-and-black-patterned waistcoat. All in all, a conservative wardrobe until one came to his legs. The man was wearing some type of native leggings. They were made from an odd tan leather, quite dull, and they were gartered just below the knees with red, white, and black striped sashes. The leggings split in the front over the shoes with brightly embroidered flaps that fell to either side of his feet. And his shoes were the strangest of all, for they had no heels. He seemed to be wearing a type of slipper made of the same soft, dull leather, with beading or embroidery work running from ankle to toe. Yet even heelless, the stranger was quite tall. He had brown hair, and as far as she could tell from halfway across the room, his eyes were dark. Certainly not blue or green. They were heavy-lidded and intelligent. She suppressed a shiver. Intelligent men were so hard to manage.</p><p>His arms were crossed, one shoulder propped against the wall, and his gaze was interested. As if they were the exotic ones, not he. His nose was long, with a bump in the middle; his complexion dark, as if he\u2019d lately come from some exotic shore. The bones of his face were raw and prominent: cheeks, nose, and chin jutting in an aggressively masculine way that was nevertheless perversely attractive. His mouth, in contrast, was wide and almost soft, with a sensuous inverted dent in the lower lip. It was the mouth of a man who liked to savor. To linger and taste. A dangerous mouth.</p><p>Emeline looked away again. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Conrad stared. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her hostess was delighted. \u201cWhy, my dear, that\u2019s Mr. Samuel Hartley! Everyone has been talking about him, though he has only been in London a sennight or so. He\u2019s not quite acceptable, because of the...\u201d Mrs. Conrad met Emeline\u2019s eyes and hastily cut short what she\u2019d been about to say. \u201cAnyway. Even with all his wealth, not everyone is happy to meet him.\u201d</p><p>Emeline stilled as the back of her neck prickled.</p><p>Mrs. Conrad continued, oblivious. \u201cI really shouldn\u2019t have invited him, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. That form, my dear. Simply delicious! Why, if I hadn\u2019t asked him, I would never have\u2014\u201d Her flurry of words ended on a startled squeak, for a man had cleared his throat directly behind them.</p><p>Emeline hadn\u2019t been watching, so she hadn\u2019t seen him move, but she knew instinctively who stood so close to them. Slowly she turned her head.</p><p>Mocking coffee-brown eyes met her own. \u201cMrs. Conrad, I\u2019d be grateful if you\u2019d introduce us.\u201d His voice had a flat American accent.</p><p>Their hostess sucked in her breath at this blunt order, but curiosity won out over indignation. \u201cLady Emeline, may I introduce Mr. Samuel Hartley. Mr. Hartley, Lady Emeline Gordon.\u201d</p><p>Emeline sank into a curtsy, only to be presented with a large, tanned hand on rising. She stared for a moment, nonplussed. Surely the man wasn\u2019t that unsophisticated? Mrs. Conrad\u2019s breathy giggle decided the matter. Gingerly, Emeline touched just her fingertips to his.</p><p>To no avail. He embraced her hand with both of his, enveloping her fingers in hard warmth. His nostrils flared just the tiniest bit as she was forced to step forward into the handshake. Was he scenting her?</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Emeline retorted. She tried to free her hand but could not, even though Mr. Hartley didn\u2019t seem to be gripping her tightly. \u201cMight I have my appendage returned to me now?\u201d</p><p>That mouth twitched again. Did he laugh at everyone or just her? \u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Emeline opened her mouth to make an excuse\u2014any excuse\u2014to leave the dreadful man, but he was too quick for her.</p><p>\u201cMay I escort you into the garden?\u201d</p><p>It really wasn\u2019t a question, since he\u2019d already held out his arm, obviously expecting her consent. And what was worse, she gave it. Silently, Emeline laid her fingertips on his coat sleeve. He nodded to Mrs. Conrad and drew Emeline outside in only a matter of minutes, working very neatly for such a gauche man. Emeline squinted up at his profile suspiciously.</p><p>He turned his head and caught her look. His own eyes wrinkled at the corners, laughing down at her, although his mouth remained perfectly straight. \u201cWe\u2019re neighbors, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve rented the house next to yours.\u201d</p><p>Emeline found herself blinking up at him, caught off guard once again\u2014a disagreeable sensation as rare as it was unwanted. She knew the occupants of the town house to the right of hers, but the left had been let out recently. For an entire day the week before, men had been tramping in and out of the open doors, sweating, shouting, and cursing. And they\u2019d carried...</p><p>Her eyebrows snapped together. \u201cThe pea-green settee.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved at one corner. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the owner of that atrocious pea-green settee, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cI confess it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith no trace of shame, either, I see.\u201d Emeline pursed her lips in disapproval. \u201cAre there really gilt owls carved on the legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll not argue the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She faced forward again.</p><p>\u201cI have a favor to ask of you, ma\u2019am.\u201d His voice rumbled somewhere above her head.</p><p>He\u2019d led her down one of the packed gravel paths of the Conrads\u2019 town house garden. It was unimaginatively planted with roses and small, clipped hedges. Sadly, most of the roses had already bloomed, so the whole looked rather plain and forlorn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHire me?\u201d Emeline inhaled sharply and stopped, forcing him to halt as well and face her. Did this odd man think she was a courtesan of some sort? The insult was outrageous, and in her confusion she found her gaze wandering over his frame, crossing wide shoulders, a pleasingly flat waist, and then dropping to an inappropriate portion of Mr. Hartley\u2019s anatomy, which, now that she noticed it, was rather nicely outlined by the black wool breeches he wore under his leggings. She inhaled again, nearly choking, and hastily raised her eyes. But the man either hadn\u2019t observed her indiscretion or was much more polite than his attire and manner would lead one to believe.</p><p>He continued. \u201cI need a mentor for my sister, Rebecca. Someone to show her the parties and balls.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emeline cocked her head as she realized that he wanted a chaperone. Well, why hadn\u2019t the silly man said so in the first place and saved her all this embarrassment? \u201cI\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d The words were soft, but there was an edge of command behind them.</p><p>Emeline stiffened. \u201cI take only young ladies from the highest ranks of society. I don\u2019t believe your sister can meet my standards. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He watched her for a moment and then looked away. Although his gaze was on a bench at the end of the path, Emeline doubted very much that he saw it. \u201cPerhaps, then, I can plead another reason for you to take us on.\u201d</p> <p>She stilled. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>His eyes looked back at her, and now there was no trace of amusement in them. \u201cI knew Reynaud.\u201d</p><p>The beating of Emeline\u2019s heart was very loud in her ears. Because, of course, Reynaud was her brother. Her brother who had been killed in the massacre of the 28th.</p><p>SHE SMELLED OF lemon balm. Sam inhaled the familiar scent as he waited for Lady Emeline\u2019s answer, aware that her perfume was distracting him. Distraction was dangerous when in negotiations with a clever opponent. But it was odd to discover this sophisticated lady wearing such a homey perfume. His mother had grown lemon balm in her garden in the backwoods of Pennsylvania, and the scent pitched him back in time. He remembered sitting at a rough-hewn table as a small boy, watching Mother pour boiling water over the green leaves. The fresh scent had risen with the steam from the thick earthenware cup. Lemon balm. Balm to the soul, Mother had called it.</p><p>\u201cReynaud is dead,\u201d Lady Emeline said abruptly. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019d do you this favor simply because you say you knew him?\u201d</p> <p>He examined her face as she spoke. She was a beautiful woman; there was no doubt about that. Her hair and eyes were dramatically dark, her mouth full and red. But hers was a complicated beauty. Many men would be dissuaded by the intelligence in those dark eyes and by the skeptical purse of those red lips.</p><p>\u201cBecause you loved him.\u201d Sam watched her eyes as he said the words and saw a slight flicker. He\u2019d guessed right, then; she\u2019d been close to her brother. If he was kind, he\u2019d not presume on her grief. But kindness had never gotten him much, either in business or in his personal life. \u201cI think you\u2019ll do it for his memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She didn\u2019t look particularly convinced.</p><p>But he knew otherwise. It was one of the first things he\u2019d learned to recognize in the import business: the exact moment when his opponent wavered and the scales of the negotiation tipped in Sam\u2019s favor. The next step was to strengthen his position. Sam held out his arm again, and she stared at it a moment before placing her fingertips on his sleeve. He felt the thrill of her acquiescence, though he was careful not to let it show.</p><p>Instead, he led her farther down the garden path. \u201cMy sister and I will only be in London for three months. I don\u2019t expect you to work miracles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother engaging my help at all, then?\u201d</p> <p>He tilted his face to the late-afternoon sun, glad that he was outside now, away from the people in the salon. \u201cRebecca is only nineteen. I am often occupied with my business, and I\u2019d like her to be entertained, perhaps meet some ladies of her own age.\u201d All true, if not the whole truth.</p><p>\u201cThere are no female relatives to do the duty?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her, amused by her unsubtle question. Lady Emeline was a small woman; her dark head came only to his shoulder. Her lack of height should\u2019ve made her seem fragile, but he knew Lady Emeline was no delicate piece of china. He\u2019d watched her for some twenty minutes in the damnably small sitting room before approaching her and Mrs. Conrad. In that time, her gaze had never stopped moving. Even as she\u2019d talked to their hostess, she\u2019d kept an eye on her charges as well as on the movements of the other guests. He\u2019d lay good money that she was aware of every conversation in the room, of who had talked to whom, of how the discussions had progressed, and when the participants had parted. In her own rarified world, she was as successful as he.</p><p>Which made it even more important that she be the one to help him gain entry into London society.</p><p>\u201cNo, my sister and I have no surviving female relatives,\u201d he answered her question now. \u201cOur mother died at Rebecca\u2019s birth and Pa only months later. Fortunately, my father\u2019s brother was a businessman in Boston. He and his wife took in Rebecca and raised her. They\u2019ve both passed on since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>She frowned up at him impatiently. \u201cWhat happened to you when both your parents died?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was sent to a boys\u2019 academy,\u201d he said prosaically, the words in no way conveying the shock of leaving a cabin in the woods and entering a world of books and strict discipline.</p><p>They had reached a brick garden wall, which marked the end of the path. She halted and faced him. \u201cI must meet your sister before I can come to any decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he murmured, knowing he had her.</p><p>She shook out her skirts briskly, her black eyes narrowed, her red mouth pursed as she thought. An image of her dead brother suddenly rose up in his mind: Reynaud\u2019s black eyes narrowed in exactly the same manner as he dressed down a soldier. For a moment, the masculine face superimposed itself over the smaller, feminine face of the sister. Reynaud\u2019s heavy black brows drew together, his midnight eyes staring as if with condemnation. Sam shuddered and pushed the phantom away, concentrating on what the living woman was saying.</p><p>\u201cYou and your sister may visit me tomorrow. I\u2019ll let you know my decision after that. Tea, I think? You do drink tea, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Will two o\u2019clock suit you?\u201d</p><p>He was tempted to smile at her order. \u201cYou\u2019re very kind, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him suspiciously a moment, then whirled to march back up the garden path, which left him to follow. He did, slowly, watching that elegant back and those twitching skirts. And as he followed her, he patted his pocket, hearing the familiar crinkle of paper and wondering, how best could he use Lady Emeline?</p><p>\u201cI DO NOT comprehend,\u201d Tante Cristelle pronounced that night at dinner. \u201cIf the gentleman did indeed wish the honor of your patronage, why did he not pursue you through the channels usual? He should compel a friend to make the introduction.\u201d</p><p>Tante Cristelle was Emeline\u2019s mother\u2019s younger sister, a tall, white-haired lady with a terribly straight back and sky-blue eyes that should\u2019ve been benign but weren\u2019t. The old lady had never married, and privately Emeline sometimes thought it was because the males of her aunt\u2019s age must\u2019ve been terrified of her. Tante Cristelle had lived with Emeline and her son, Daniel, for the last five years, ever since the death of Daniel\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he wasn\u2019t aware of how it\u2019s properly done,\u201d Emeline said as she perused the selection of meats on the tray. \u201cOr perhaps he didn\u2019t want to take the time to go through the customary maneuvers. He said they were to be in London only a short while, after all.\u201d She indicated a slice of beef and smiled her thanks as the footman forked it onto her plate.</p><p>\u201cMon Dieu, if he is such a gauche rustic, then he has no business attempting the labyrinths of le ton.\u201d Her aunt took a sip of wine and then pursed her lips as if the red liquid were sour.</p><p>Emeline made a noncommittal sound. Tante Cristelle\u2019s analysis of Mr. Hartley was accurate on the surface\u2014he had indeed given the appearance of a rustic. The problem was, his eyes had told another story. He\u2019d almost seemed to be laughing at her, as if she were the na\u00eff.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do, I ask you, if the girl is anything like the brother you describe?\u201d Tante Cristelle arched her eyebrows in exaggerated horror. \u201cWhat if she wears her hair in braids down her back? What if she laughs too loudly? What if she wears no shoes and her feet, they are so dirty?\u201d</p><p>This distasteful thought was apparently too much for the old lady. She beckoned urgently to the footman for more wine while Emeline bit her lip to keep from smiling.</p><p>\u201cHe is very wealthy. I discreetly inquired about his position from the other ladies at the salon. They all confirmed that Mr. Hartley is indeed one of the richest men in Boston. Presumably, he moves in the best circles there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTcha.\u201d Tante dismissed all of Boston society.</p><p>Emeline cut into her beef serenely. \u201cAnd even if they were rustics, Tante, surely we should not hold lack of proper training against the chit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon!\u201d Tante Cristelle exclaimed, making the footman at her elbow start and nearly drop the decanter of wine. \u201cAnd again I say, non! This prejudice, it is the foundation of society. How are we to discern the well-born from the common rabble if not by the manners they keep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I am right,\u201d her aunt retorted.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Emeline poked at the beef on her plate. For some reason, she no longer wanted it. \u201cTante, do you remember that little book my nanny used to read to Reynaud and me as children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBook? What book? Whatever are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Emeline plucked at the bit of gathered ribbon on her sleeve. \u201cIt was a book of fairy tales, and we were very fond of it. I thought of it today for some reason.\u201d</p><p>She stared thoughtfully at her plate, remembering. Nanny would often read to them outside after an afternoon picnic. Reynaud and she would sit on the picnic blanket as Nanny turned the pages of the fairy-tale book. But as the story progressed, Reynaud would creep unconsciously forward, drawn by the excitement of the tale, until he was nearly in Nanny\u2019s lap, hanging on every word, his black eyes sparkling.</p><p>He\u2019d been so alive, so vital, even as a boy. Emeline swallowed, carefully smoothing the raveled ribbon at her waist. \u201cI only wondered where the book could be. Do you think it\u2019s packed away in the attics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can say?\u201d Her aunt gave an eloquent and very Gallic shrug, dismissing the old book of fairy tales and Emeline\u2019s memories of Reynaud. She leaned forward to exclaim, \u201cBut again I ask, why? Why do you even think to agree to take on this man and his sister who wears no shoes?\u201d</p><p>Emeline forbore to point out that as of yet, they had no intelligence concerning Miss Hartley\u2019s shoes or the lack thereof. In fact, the only Hartley she knew about was the brother. For a moment, she remembered the man\u2019s tanned face and coffee-brown eyes. She shook her head slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly, except that he obviously needed my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but if you took all who need your help, we would be buried beneath petitioners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said...\u201d Emeline hesitated, watching the light sparkle on her wineglass. \u201cHe said he knew Reynaud.\u201d</p><p>Tante Cristelle set down her wineglass carefully. \u201cBut why do you believe this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just do.\u201d She looked helplessly at her aunt. \u201cYou must think me a fool.\u201d</p><p>Tante Cristelle sighed, her lips drooping at the corners, emphasizing the lines of age there. \u201cNo, ma petite. I simply think you a sister who loved her brother most dearly.\u201d</p><p>Emeline nodded, watching her fingers twist the wineglass in her hand. She didn\u2019t meet her aunt\u2019s eyes. She had loved Reynaud. She still did. Love didn\u2019t stop simply because the recipient had died. But there was another reason she was contemplating taking on the Hartley girl. She felt somehow that Samuel Hartley hadn\u2019t been telling her the whole truth of why he needed her help. He wanted something. Something that involved Reynaud.</p><p>And that meant he bore watching.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Iron Heart walked for many days in the dark forest, and during that time, he met neither human nor animal. On the seventh day, the wall of trees opened up, and he emerged from the forest. Directly ahead of him lay a shining city. He stared. Never in all his travels had he seen such a magnificent city. But soon his belly rumbled, waking him from his awe. He needed to buy food, and in order to buy food, he must find work. So off he tramped into the city. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But though he inquired high and low, there was no decent work to be found for a soldier returning from war. And this is often the case, I think. For though all are happy enough to see a soldier when there is a war to be fought, after the danger is past, they look upon the same man with suspicion and contempt.</p><p>Thus it came about that Iron Heart was forced to take the job of a street sweeper. And this he did most gratefully....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you come in late last night,\u201d Rebecca said as she placed some coddled eggs on her plate the next morning. \u201cAfter midnight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas it?\u201d Samuel replied vaguely. He was sitting at the breakfast table behind her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh, no. You didn\u2019t disturb me at all. That wasn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d Rebecca sighed inwardly and took the seat opposite her brother. She wanted rather badly to ask him where he\u2019d been last night\u2014and the night before that\u2014but shyness and a certain hesitation held her tongue. She poured herself some tea and strove to open a topic of conversation, always a bit hard in the morning. \u201cWhat are your plans for today? Are you conducting business with Mr. Kitcher? I...I thought if not, that we might go for a drive about London. I hear St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Samuel set his knife down with a clatter. \u201cI forgot to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca felt a sinking in the pit of her belly. It\u2019d been a long shot\u2014her brother was so often busy\u2014but she\u2019d hoped nevertheless that he\u2019d have time to spend with her that afternoon. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been invited to tea by our next-door neighbor, Lady Emeline Gordon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rebecca glanced involuntarily in the direction of the grand town house that adjoined their house to the right. She\u2019d glimpsed her ladyship once or twice and had been awed by their neighbor\u2019s sophistication. \u201cBut...but when did this happen? I didn\u2019t see an invitation in today\u2019s post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met her at the salon I attended yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Rebecca marveled. \u201cShe must be a very pleasant lady to invite us on such little acquaintance.\u201d Whatever would she wear to meet a titled lady?</p><p>Samuel fingered his knife, and if she didn\u2019t know better, she would\u2019ve said her older brother was uncomfortable. \u201cActually, I asked her to chaperone you to some gatherings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought you didn\u2019t like balls and social gatherings.\u201d She was pleased, of course, that he\u2019d thought of her, but his sudden interest in her schedule seemed rather odd.</p><p>\u201cYes, but now that we\u2019re in London...\u201d Samuel let his sentence trail as he drank some coffee. \u201cI thought you might like to go out. See the city, meet some people. You\u2019re only nineteen. You must be bored to death, rattling around this place with just me to keep you company.\u201d</p> <p>Well, that wasn\u2019t quite true, Rebecca reflected as she tried to think of a reply. Actually, she was surrounded by many other people\u2014servants. There seemed to be scores of servants in this London town house Samuel had rented. Just when she thought she\u2019d met them all, an odd maid or bootblack boy who she\u2019d never seen before would suddenly pop up. Indeed, right now there were two footmen standing by the wall ready to wait on them. One she thought was named Travers, and the other...fiddlesticks! She\u2019d quite forgotten the other\u2019s name, although she knew for certain that she\u2019d seen him before. He had jetty hair and amazing green eyes. Not, of course, that she should be noticing the color of a footman\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Rebecca poked at her cold eggs. She was only used to Cook and Elsie at home in Boston where she lived with Samuel. Growing up, she\u2019d eaten most of her suppers with Cook and the elderly maid, until she was deemed a lady and made to sit in the dining room with Uncle Thomas. Her uncle had been a dear, and Rebecca loved him, but dining with him had been rather a trial. His dinner conversation had been so flat when compared to the lively nightly gossip she\u2019d had with Cook and Elsie. The conversation at meals had improved a little when Samuel had come to live with her on the death of Uncle Thomas, but not by much. Samuel could be terribly witty when he wanted to, but so often he seemed distracted by business affairs.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d Samuel\u2019s question broke into her rambling thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>Her brother was frowning at her now, and Rebecca had the sinking sensation that somehow she\u2019d disappointed him. \u201cDo you mind that I\u2019ve asked Lady Emeline to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d She smiled brightly. Of course, she\u2019d rather that he\u2019d spent the time with her, but he was in London on business, after all. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you thought of me.\u201d</p><p>But this answer made him set down his coffee cup. \u201cYou say that as if I consider you a burden.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca dropped her gaze. Actually, that was exactly how she reckoned he thought of her. A burden. How could he not? She was much younger than he and brought up in the city. Samuel, in contrast, had been raised in the wilds of the frontier until the age of fourteen. Sometimes she thought the gulf that separated them was wider than the ocean. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t wish me to come on this trip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this before. I was happy to include you once I knew that you wanted to travel with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d Rebecca carefully straightened the silverware at her place, aware that her answer wasn\u2019t quite right. She peeked at him under her brows.</p><p>He was frowning again. \u201cRebecca, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The entrance of the butler interrupted him. \u201cMr. Kitcher has arrived, sir.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Kitcher was her brother\u2019s man of business.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Samuel muttered. He stood and bent to kiss her on the forehead. \u201cKitcher and I are to see a man about arranging to visit Wedgwood\u2019s showroom. I\u2019ll be back after luncheon. We are expected at her ladyship\u2019s house at two o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Rebecca replied, but Samuel was already at the door. He exited without another word, and Rebecca was left to contemplate her eggs all alone. Except, of course, for the footmen.</p><p>THE COLONIAL GENTLEMAN was even more imposing standing in her little sitting room. That was Emeline\u2019s first thought that afternoon when she turned to greet her guests. The contrast was stark between her pretty sitting room\u2014elegant, sophisticated, and very civilized\u2014and the man who stood so motionless at its center. He should\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the gilt and satin, should\u2019ve seemed na\u00efve and a little crude in his plain woolen clothes.</p><p>Instead he dominated the room.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Hartley.\u201d Emeline held out her hand, belatedly remembering their handshake of the day before. She held her breath to see if he\u2019d repeat that unorthodox gesture. But Mr. Hartley merely took her hand and quite properly brushed his lips in the air an inch above her knuckles. For a moment, he seemed to hesitate there, his nostrils flaring, and then he straightened. She caught the amused gleam in his eyes. Her own eyes narrowed. The scoundrel! He\u2019d known all along yesterday that he was supposed to kiss her hand.</p><p>\u201cMay I present my sister, Rebecca Hartley,\u201d he said now, and Emeline was forced to marshal her attention.</p><p>The young girl who stepped forward was pleasingly attractive. She had her brother\u2019s dark hair, but where his eyes were a warm brown, hers held sparks of green and even yellow. A most unusual color but very pretty nonetheless. She wore a simple dimity frock with a square neckline and a bit of lace at the sleeves and bodice. Emeline noted that the wardrobe could certainly be improved.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d she said as the girl made a passable curtsy.</p><p>\u201cOh, ma\u2019am\u2014I mean, my lady\u2014I\u2019m so pleased to meet you,\u201d Miss Hartley gasped. She had a pretty, if unpolished manner.</p><p>Emeline nodded. \u201cMy aunt, Mademoiselle Molyneux.\u201d</p><p>Tante Cristelle was sitting at her left, perched at the very edge of her chair so that several inches of air was between her ramrod-straight back and the chair\u2019s back. The older woman inclined her head. Her lips were pinched, but her eyes were staring at the hem of Miss Hartley\u2019s dress.</p><p>Mr. Hartley smiled, his mouth twisting rather raffishly at the corners as he bowed over her aunt\u2019s hand. \u201cHow do you do, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, I thank you, monsieur,\u201d Tante said crisply.</p><p>Mr. Hartley and his sister sat, the girl on the yellow and white damask settee, her brother on the orange wing chair. Emeline settled in an armchair and nodded at Crabs, the butler, who immediately disappeared to order the tea.</p><p>\u201cYou said yesterday that you were in London on business, Mr. Hartley. What kind?\u201d she asked her guest.</p><p>Mr. Hartley flicked the skirt of his brown coat aside to set one ankle across the knee of the opposite leg. \u201cI deal in the import and export of goods to Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Emeline murmured faintly. Mr. Hartley seemed not at all self-conscious to admit engaging in trade. But then what else could one expect from a colonial who wore leather leggings? Her gaze dropped to his crossed leg. The soft leather fit closely to his calf, outlining a lovely masculine form. She averted her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI hope to meet Mr. Josiah Wedgwood,\u201d Mr. Hartley said. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of him? He has a marvelous new crockery factory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrockery.\u201d Tante Cristelle employed her lorgnette\u2014an affectation that she used mainly when she wished to cow others. She peered first at Mr. Hartley and then returned to her fascination with Miss Hartley\u2019s lower skirts.</p><p>Mr. Hartley remained uncowed. He smiled at Emeline\u2019s aunt and then at Emeline. \u201cCrockery. Amazing how much crockery we use in the Colonies. My business already imports earthenware and such, but I believe that there is a market for finer stuff. Things that a fashionable lady might have at her table. Mr. Wedgwood has perfected a process to make creamware more delicate than anyone has ever seen. I hope to persuade him that Hartley Importers is the company to best bring his goods to the Colonies.\u201d</p><p>Emeline raised her eyebrows, intrigued despite herself. \u201cYou will market the china for him there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It will be the usual exchange. I will buy his goods and then resell them across the Atlantic. What\u2019s different is that I hope to have the exclusive right to trade his goods in the Colonies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are ambitious, Mr. Hartley,\u201d Tante Cristelle said. She did not sound approving.</p><p>Mr. Hartley inclined his head to her aunt. He didn\u2019t seem perturbed by the old woman\u2019s disapproval. Emeline found herself reluctantly admiring his self-possession. He was foreign in a way that had nothing to do with being American. The gentlemen of her acquaintance didn\u2019t deal in commerce, let alone discuss it so bluntly with a lady. It was rather interesting to have a man regard her as an intellectual equal. At the same time, she was aware that he would never belong in her world.</p><p>Miss Hartley cleared her throat. \u201cMy brother has informed me that you have kindly agreed to chaperone me, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>The entrance of three maids bearing laden tea trays prevented Emeline from making a suitable retort\u2014one that would wing the brother and not the girl. He\u2019d taken her assent for granted, had he? She noticed, as the maids bustled about, that Mr. Hartley was watching her quite openly. She raised an eyebrow at him in challenge, but he only quirked his own back at her. Was he flirting with her? Didn\u2019t he know that she was far, far out of his reach?</p><p>When the tea things had been settled, Emeline began to pour, her back so straight that she put even Tante to shame. \u201cI am considering championing you, Miss Hartley.\u201d She smiled to take the sting out of the words. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll tell me why you have\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She was interrupted by a whirlwind. The sitting room door slammed against the wall, bouncing off the woodwork and putting yet another chip in the paint. A tangle of arms and long legs lunged at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emeline jerked the hot teapot away with the ease of long practice.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019man! M\u2019man!\u201d panted the demon child. His blond curls were quite deceptively angelic. \u201cCook says she has made currant buns. May I have one?\u201d</p><p>Emeline set down the teapot and drew in a breath to castigate him, only to find Tante talking instead. \u201cMais oui, mon chou! Here, take a plate and Tante Cristelle will pick out the buns most plump for you.\u201d</p><p>Emeline cleared her throat, and both boy and elderly aunt looked at her guiltily. She smiled meaningfully at her offspring. \u201cDaniel, would you be so kind as to put down that bun clutched in your fist and make your bows to our guests?\u201d</p> <p>Daniel relinquished his rather squashed prize, and then regrettably wiped his palm on his breeches. Emeline took a breath but refrained from commenting. One skirmish at a time. She turned to the Hartleys. \u201cMay I present my son, Daniel Gordon, Baron Eddings.\u201d</p><p>The imp made a very correct bow\u2014beautiful enough to cause her bosom to swell with maternal pride. Not, of course, that Emeline let her satisfaction show; no need to make the boy vain. Mr. Hartley held out his hand in the exact same gesture that he\u2019d given her yesterday. Her son beamed. Grown men didn\u2019t usually offer their hands to eight-year-olds, no matter their rank. Gravely, Daniel took the much larger hand and shook it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you, my lord,\u201d Mr. Hartley said.</p><p>Daniel bowed to the girl, and then Emeline handed him a bun wrapped in a cloth. \u201cNow run away, dear. I have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely your son can stay with us, ma\u2019am,\u201d Mr. Hartley interrupted her.</p> <p>Emeline drew herself up. How dare the man interfere between her and her child? She was on the point of giving him a set-down when he caught her eye. Mr. Hartley\u2019s eyes were wrinkled about the edges, but instead of amusement, they appeared to reflect sorrow. He didn\u2019t even know her son. Why, then, would he feel pity for the boy?</p><p>\u201cPlease, M\u2019man?\u201d Daniel asked.</p><p>Her consternation should\u2019ve only grown stronger\u2014the boy knew better than to beg once she\u2019d made a decision\u2014but instead something inside her melted.</p><p>\u201cOh, very well.\u201d She knew she sounded like a grumpy old woman, but Daniel grinned and took a seat near Mr. Hartley, wiggling back in the too-big chair. And Mr. Hartley smiled at her with his coffee-brown eyes. That sight seemed to make her breath come short, which was a ridiculous reaction from a mature woman of the world.</p><p>\u201cSo, then, this is most pleasant,\u201d Tante Cristelle said. She winked at Daniel, and he squirmed in his chair until he caught his mother\u2019s eye. \u201cBut now, I think, we must discuss Mademoiselle Hartley\u2019s clothing.\u201d</p><p>Miss Hartley, who had just taken a sip of tea, seemed to choke. \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d</p> <p>Tante Cristelle nodded once. \u201cIt is atrocious.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley set his teacup down carefully. \u201cMademoiselle Molyneux, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>The old woman rounded on him. \u201cDo you wish your sister to be laughed at, eh? Do you want the other young ladies to whisper behind their fans? For the young men to refuse to dance with her? Is this what you aspire to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Mr. Hartley said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Rebecca\u2019s dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Emeline set down her own dish of tea. \u201cNothing at all if Miss Hartley only wants to visit the parks and some of the sights of London. I\u2019m quite sure what she\u2019s wearing now is sufficient even for the fashionable of Boston in your colonies. But for the London haut ton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have the frocks very elegant!\u201d Tante Cristelle exclaimed. \u201cAnd also the gloves and the shawls and the hats and the shoes.\u201d She leaned forward to thump her stick. \u201cThe shoes, they are most important.\u201d</p><p>Miss Hartley glanced at her slippers in alarm, but Mr. Hartley only looked faintly amused. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Tante Cristelle peered at him shrewdly. \u201cAnd all of these things, they will cost a pretty penny, non?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t add that he would be providing a wardrobe for Emeline as well. It was understood in London society that this was the way in which Emeline would be recompensed for her time spent chaperoning his sister.</p><p>Emeline waited for some type of protest from Mr. Hartley. Evidently he hadn\u2019t realized the expense involved in a young chit\u2019s season. Most families saved for many years for the event; some even went into debt purchasing a girl\u2019s costumes. He might be a very rich man in Boston, but how did that translate to London wealth? Would he be able to afford such an unexpected outlay? She was oddly disappointed at the thought that he might have to abandon the entire endeavor.</p><p>But Mr. Hartley merely took a bite from a bun. It was Miss Hartley who made the protest. \u201cOh, Samuel, it\u2019s too much! I don\u2019t need a new wardrobe, truly I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A very pretty speech. The sister had given the brother an honorable out. Emeline turned to Mr. Hartley with raised eyebrows. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed that Daniel used the opportunity of the adults\u2019 distraction to filch another bun.</p><p>Mr. Hartley took a long swallow of tea before speaking. \u201cIt seems you do need a new wardrobe, Rebecca. Lady Emeline says so and I think we must rely on her advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the expense!\u201d The girl looked truly distressed.</p><p>The brother did not. \u201cDon\u2019t worry over it. I can bear it.\u201d He turned to Emeline. \u201cWhen shall we go shopping, then, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to accompany us,\u201d Emeline said. \u201cYou may simply give us a letter of credit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d enjoy escorting you ladies,\u201d the colonial interrupted her smoothly. \u201cSurely you\u2019ll not deny me so simple a pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Emeline pressed her lips together. She knew he\u2019d be a distraction, but there was no polite way to discourage him. Her smile was tight. \u201cOf course, we would be glad to have your company.\u201d</p><p>He gave the impression of grinning without actually changing his expression, the lines deepening on either side of his mouth. Extraordinary man! \u201cThen I repeat, when shall we make this expedition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Emeline replied crisply.</p><p>His sensuous lips curved slightly. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>And she narrowed her eyes. Either Mr. Hartley was a fool or he was richer than King Midas himself.</p><p>HE WOKE IN the night, covered in sweat from the nightmare. Sam held himself still, his eyes straining in the darkness as he waited for the thundering in his chest to quiet. The fire had gone out, dammit, and the room was cold. He\u2019d told the maids to bank it well, but they never seemed to do so adequately. By morning, his fire was usually mere embers. Tonight it was entirely dead.</p><p>He swung his legs out of the bed, and his bare feet hit the carpet. He stumbled through the blackness to the window and pulled the heavy drapes aside. The moon hung high over the roofs of the city, its light cold and pale. He used the dim glow to dress, shedding his drenched nightshirt and donning breeches, shirt, waistcoat, leggings, and his moccasins.</p><p>Sam stole out of his room, the soft moccasins making his steps nearly silent. He padded down the great marble staircase and into the lower hall. Here he heard footsteps advancing toward him, and he merged into the shadows. Candlelight flickered closer, and he saw his butler dressed in a nightshirt and holding a bottle in one hand, the candlestick in the other. The man walked past, only inches from where he hid, and Sam caught a whiff of whiskey. He smiled in the dark. How the servant would start if he knew his master was lurking in the gloom. The butler would think him mad.</p><p>Sam waited until the glow of the butler\u2019s candle had disappeared and his footsteps faded. Another minute ticked by as he listened, but all was quiet. He drifted from his hiding place and stole through the empty back kitchen to the servant\u2019s entrance. The key was kept on the mantelpiece of the great fireplace, but he had a duplicate. He let himself out, the latch clicking closed behind him. It was pleasantly chill outside, and he repressed a shiver. For a moment, he lingered in the shadows by the back door, listening, watching, and scenting. All he caught was the scurrying of a rodent in the bushes and the sudden mewl of a cat. No human nearby. He slid through the narrow walled garden, brushing by mint and parsley and other herbs whose scents he couldn\u2019t name. Then he was in the mews, checking for a minute here as well.</p><p>He began to run. His footfalls were as quiet as the cat\u2019s, but he kept to the edge of the dark shadows near the stables. He hated to be found out when he stole into the night. Perhaps that was why he didn\u2019t bother with a valet.</p><p>He passed a doorway, and the stink of urine wafted into his nose, making him veer away. He\u2019d never seen a city\u2014a small town, really\u2014until he\u2019d been ten years old. Three and twenty years later, he could still recall the shock of the smell. The terrible stink of hundreds of people living too close together with no place to dispose of their piss and shit. As a boy, he\u2019d nearly heaved when he\u2019d realized that the trickle of brown water in the middle of the fine cobblestone street was an open sewer. One of the first lessons Pa had taught him as a lad was to hide his waste. Animals were canny. If they smelled the odor of people, they\u2019d not venture near. No animals, no food. It had been as simple as that in the great forests of Pennsylvania.</p><p>But here, where people lived cheek by jowl and let their waste pile into corners, where the reek of man seemed to hang like a fog that had to be fought through, here in the city it was more complicated. There were still predators and prey, but their forms had warped, and sometimes it was impossible to tell the two apart. This city was far more dangerous than any frontier with wild animals and raiding Indians.</p><p>His feet carried him to the end of the mews and to an intersection. He dipped across the lane and continued running down the street. A young man was entering the gate of a town house\u2014a servant returning from an assignation? Sam passed him not a foot away, and the man didn\u2019t even turn. But Sam inhaled the smell of ale and pipe smoke as he ran by.</p><p>Lady Emeline smelled of lemon balm. He\u2019d caught the scent again as he\u2019d bent over her white hand this afternoon. It wasn\u2019t right. Such a sophisticated woman should have worn patchouli or musk. He\u2019d often found himself overwhelmed by the smell\u2014the stink\u2014of society ladies. Their perfumes hung about them like a fog until he\u2019d wanted nothing more than to cover his nose and choke. But Lady Emeline wore lemon balm, the scent of his mother\u2019s garden. That dichotomy intrigued him.</p><p>He loped across the entrance of an alley and jumped a foul puddle. Someone lurked here, either for shelter or in ambush, but Sam was past before the form had time to react. He glanced over his shoulder and saw the lurker peering after him. Sam grinned to himself and picked up his pace, his moccasins brushing soundlessly on cobblestones. This was the only time he almost liked the city\u2014when the streets were deserted and a man could move without fear of bumping into another person. When there was space. He felt his leg muscles begin to warm with his exertion.</p><p>He\u2019d deliberately chosen the rented house next to Lady Emeline when they\u2019d come to London. He\u2019d had a need to find out how Reynaud\u2019s sister had fared. It was the least he could do for the officer he\u2019d failed. When he\u2019d discovered that the lady enjoyed introducing young girls into society, asking for her help with Rebecca had seemed like the natural thing to do. Of course, he hadn\u2019t told her the real reason that he was interested in London society, but that hadn\u2019t mattered to him. At least until he\u2019d actually met the lady.</p><p>Because Lady Emeline wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected. Somehow, without realizing it, he must\u2019ve imagined her to be tall like her brother and with an equally aristocratic air. The aristocratic air was indeed there, but he was hard-put not to smile when she attempted to look down her nose at him. She couldn\u2019t be more than a couple of inches over five feet. Her shape was nicely rounded, the type that made a man want to cup her arse in his hands just to feel the feminine warmth. Her hair was black and her eyes just as dark. With her rosy cheeks and snappish voice, she might\u2019ve been a saucy Irish maid, ripe for a flirtation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Sam swore softly and halted. He braced his palms on his knees as he panted, trying to catch his breath. Lady Emeline might look like an Irish maid, but in her elegant clothes and with an accent that could cut ice, no one in his right mind would mistake her for one. Not even an unsophisticated backwoodsman from the frontiers of the New World. His money could buy a lot of things, but a woman from the highest tiers of the English aristocracy wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>The moon was beginning to set. Time to go home. Sam looked around. Small shops lined the narrow street, their overhanging upper stories looming above. He\u2019d never been in this part of London before, but that wouldn\u2019t stop him from finding his way back. He started at a slow jog. The return journey was always the hardest, his initial freshness and energy blown away. Now his chest labored to draw breath, and his muscles began to ache at the continued exertion. Then, too, the areas where he\u2019d been wounded made themselves known, throbbing as he ran. Remember, the scars groaned, remember where the tomahawk sawed your flesh, where the ball burrowed next to bone. Remember that you are forever marked, the survivor, the living, the one left to bear witness.</p><p>Sam ran on, despite aches and memories. This was the point that separated those who would continue from those who fell by the wayside. The trick was to acknowledge the pain. To embrace it. Pain kept you awake. Pain meant that you still lived.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know how much longer he ran, but when he again ducked into the mews behind his rented house, the moon had set. He was so weary that he almost didn\u2019t see the watcher in time. A man lurked, big and solid, beside the corner of the stables. It was a measure of Sam\u2019s tiredness that he nearly ran by him. But he didn\u2019t. He stopped and slid into the shadows of his neighbor\u2019s stables. He peered at the watcher. The man was barrel-shaped and wore a scarlet coat and a battered tricorne, fraying gray about the edges. Sam had seen him before. Once today, across the street as he and Rebecca had left Lady Emeline\u2019s house, and yesterday as Sam had entered his rented carriage. The shape and the way the man stood was the same. The man was following him.</p><p>Sam took a few seconds to steady his breath before drawing two lead balls from his waistcoat pocket. They were small things, no bigger than his thumb, but they were useful for a man who enjoyed running the streets of London in the dark. He curled his right fist around the balls.</p><p>Silently, Sam rushed at Scarlet Coat, catching the bigger man\u2019s hair from behind with his left hand. He punched the man swiftly in the side of his head. \u201cWho sent you?\u201d</p><p>Scarlet Coat was fast for a big man. He twisted and tried to elbow Sam in the belly. Sam punched him again, once, twice, his fist connecting each time with the other man\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSod it!\u201d Scarlet Coat gasped. His London accent was so thick, Sam could hardly make out the words.</p> <p>The man aimed a fist at his face. Sam leaned to the side, and the blow glanced off his chin. He punched quick and hard at the man\u2019s exposed armpit. Scarlet Coat groaned, bending over his hurt side. When he straightened, he had a wicked blade in his hand. Sam circled, his fists held ready, looking for another opening. Scarlet Coat struck with his knife, but Sam knocked the man\u2019s arm aside. The knife spun to the ground, moonlight gleaming on what looked like a white bone handle. Sam feinted to the left, and when the other man lunged, he caught his right arm and pulled the man in toward himself.</p><p>\u201cYour employer,\u201d Sam hissed as he wrenched the man\u2019s arm.</p><p>The man twisted violently and caught Sam a second blow to his chin. Sam staggered and that was all Scarlet Coat needed. The other man was off, running away down the mews. He ducked and grabbed his knife as he ran past it, and then he disappeared around the end of the mews.</p><p>Sam started after him instinctively\u2014the predator always pursues a fleeing prey\u2014but he stopped before the mews spilled onto the cross street. He\u2019d been running for hours now; his wind was no longer fresh. If he did catch Scarlet Coat, he\u2019d be in no condition to make the other man tell him what he knew. Sam sighed, pocketed the lead balls, and headed back to his own house.</p><p>The dawn was already breaking.</p><p>Chapter Three</p> <p>One day as Iron Heart was sweeping the street, a procession rode by. There were running footmen dressed in gilt livery, a brace of guards mounted on snow-white chargers, and finally a gold carriage with two footmen clinging behind. Iron Heart could do naught but gape as the carriage came closer. When it was directly beside him, the curtain shifted and he saw the face of the lady within. And what a face it was! She was perfectly formed, her complexion so white and smooth she might\u2019ve been ivory. Iron Heart stared after her.</p><p>Beside him a voice cackled. \u201cDo you think Princess Solace beautiful?\u201d</p><p>Iron Heart turned and found a wizened old man standing where before there had been no one. He frowned, but he had to admit that the princess was most lovely.</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d said the old man, leaning so close that Iron Heart could smell the stink of his breath, \u201cwould you like to marry her?\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>Emeline stepped into the afternoon sunshine and gave a sigh of pleasure. \u201cThat was a most satisfying shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Miss Hartley panted beside her, \u201cdo I really need all those frocks? Won\u2019t one or two ball gowns do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Miss Hartley\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, please, won\u2019t you call me Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>Emeline tempered her stern tone. The girl was terribly sweet. \u201cYes, of course. Rebecca, then. It is most important that you be properly attired\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn gold leaf, if possible,\u201d a masculine voice cut into Emeline\u2019s homily.</p><p>\u201cOh, Samuel!\u201d Rebecca exclaimed. \u201cYour chin looks even worse than this morning.\u201d</p><p>Emeline turned, carefully smoothing out her brow. She didn\u2019t want Mr. Hartley to see either her vexation at the interruption or the odd flutter of excitement she felt low in her belly. Surely, such tumult wasn\u2019t altogether becoming in a woman of her age.</p><p>Mr. Hartley\u2019s chin was indeed a darker shade of plum than it\u2019d been since Emeline had last seen him. Apparently, he\u2019d run into a doorway sometime in the night. An oddly clumsy accident for such a graceful man. He was now leaning against a lamppost, his booted feet crossed at the ankle, looking like he\u2019d been there for quite some time. And he had if he\u2019d been waiting in this way since the ladies had entered the dressmaker\u2019s three hours ago. The awful man couldn\u2019t have been standing out here the entire time, could he?</p><p>Emeline felt a twinge of guilt. \u201cMr. Hartley, you do know that it\u2019s quite acceptable for you to leave us whilst we finish our shopping?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows, and the sardonic expression in his eyes said that he knew perfectly well the niceties of a ladies\u2019 shopping day. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of abandoning you, my lady. I apologize if my presence is irksome.\u201d</p><p>At her side, Tante Cristelle clicked her tongue. \u201cYou talk like a courtier, monsieur. I do not think it becomes you.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley grinned and bowed to her aunt, not at all put out. \u201cI am suitably reprimanded, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Emeline interjected. \u201cI think the glover\u2019s next. Just down here is the most wonderful shop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you ladies would like some refreshment?\u201d Mr. Hartley asked. \u201cI\u2019d never forgive myself if you fainted away from the exertion of your labors.\u201d</p><p>Emeline was forming a suitably regretful reply when Tante Cristelle spoke first. \u201cSome tea would be very welcome.\u201d</p><p>Now Emeline couldn\u2019t decline him without looking churlish, and the dratted man knew it. The corner of his mouth curled as he watched her with warm brown eyes.</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cThank you, Mr. Hartley. You\u2019re very kind.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head, straightened away from the lamppost, and held out his arm to her. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Why did the man only remember the proprieties when it suited him? Emeline smiled stiffly and placed her fingertips on his sleeve, conscious of the muscle beneath the fabric. He glanced at her hand and up at her, cocking an eyebrow. She tilted her chin and began walking, Tante Cristelle and the girl following behind. Her aunt seemed to be lecturing Rebecca on the importance of shoes.</p><p>Around them, the fashionable Mayfair throng ebbed and flowed. Young bucks loitered in doorways, gossiping and eyeing the grandly dressed ladies. A dandy strolled past in a pink-powdered wig, his long walking stick extravagantly employed. Emeline heard a snort from Tante Cristelle. She inclined her head to the Misses Stevens as they passed. The elder girl nodded most properly. The younger, a pretty if vacuous redhead in overwide panniers, giggled into her gloved hand.</p><p>Emeline lowered her brows in disapproval at the girl. \u201cHow do you find our capital, Mr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowded.\u201d He dipped his head close to hers as he spoke. She caught a pleasing scent on his breath but couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>\u201cYou are used to a smaller city?\u201d She lifted her skirt as they approached a puddle of something noxious. Mr. Hartley drew her closer to him when they skirted it, and for a moment she felt the warmth of his body through wool and linen.</p><p>\u201cBoston is smaller than London,\u201d he replied. They separated and she was chagrined to realize that she missed his warmth. \u201cBut it is just as crowded. I\u2019m not used to cities at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were raised in the countryside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like the wilderness.\u201d</p><p>She turned in surprise at his answer just as he must\u2019ve leaned toward her again. Suddenly his face was only inches from hers. Fine lines surrounded his coffee-colored eyes, deepening as he smiled at her. She noticed that a thin, pale scar lay under his left eye.</p><p>Then she looked away. \u201cWere you raised by wolves, then, Mr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d His voice was amused, despite the sharpness of her words. \u201cMy father was a trapper on the Pennsylvania frontier. We lived in a cabin he\u2019d built from logs that still had the bark on them.\u201d</p><p>This sounded very primitive. Actually, she had trouble imagining his home, it was so foreign to what she knew. \u201cHow were you educated until you went to the boys school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother taught me reading and writing,\u201d Mr. Hartley said. \u201cI learned about tracking, hunting, and the woods from my father. He was a very good woodsman.\u201d</p><p>They passed a bookshop with a bright red sign hanging so low that it nearly brushed Mr. Hartley\u2019s tricorne. Emeline cleared her throat. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cMy world back then is a far cry from this.\u201d He nodded at the noisy London street. \u201cCan you imagine a forest so quiet you can hear the leaves fall? Trees so big a grown man cannot wrap his arms about their girth?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to picture. Your woodlands sound very strange to me. But you left those woods, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He was watching the flow of the crowd about them as they walked, but now he glanced down at her.</p><p>She drew in a breath, staring into his dark eyes. \u201cThat must have been quite a change, leaving the freedom of the forest for a school.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth tilted up, and he looked away. \u201cIt was, but boys are adaptable. I learned how to follow the rules and which boys to stay away from. And I was big, even then. That helped.\u201d</p><p>Emeline shuddered. \u201cThey seem so savage, boarding schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys are savage little beasts, by and large.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of the teachers?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMost are competent. Some are unhappy men who dislike boys. But there are others who truly love their profession and care for the children.\u201d</p><p>Emeline knit her brows. \u201cWhat a very different childhood you and your sister must have had. You said she grew up in the city of Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d For the first time, his voice sounded troubled. \u201cSometimes I think our childhoods were too different.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d She watched his face. His expressions were so subtle, so fleeting, that she felt like a diviner when she caught them.</p><p>He nodded, his eyes hooded. \u201cI worry that I don\u2019t give her all that she needs.\u201d</p><p>She stared ahead as she tried to think of a reply. Did any of the men she knew worry about the women in their lives this way? Had her own brother cared about her needs? She thought not.</p><p>But Mr. Hartley took a breath and spoke again. \u201cYour son is a spirited boy.\u201d</p> <p>Emeline wrinkled her nose. \u201cToo spirited, some would say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou employ a tutor for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Smythe-Jones. He comes in daily.\u201d She hesitated, then said impulsively, \u201cBut Tante Cristelle thinks I should enroll him in a school like the one you attended.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at her. \u201cHe seems too young to leave home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but many fashionable families send their sons away, some much younger than Daniel.\u201d She realized that she was twisting a bit of ribbon at her throat in her free hand, and she stopped and carefully smoothed the piece of silk. \u201cMy aunt worries that I will tie him to my apron strings. Or that he will not learn how to be a man in a house of women.\u201d Why was she telling a near stranger these intimate details? He must think her a ninny.</p><p>But he only nodded thoughtfully. \u201cYour husband is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Daniel\u2014my son is named for his father\u2014passed away five years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, you have not married again.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer, and she recognized the scent she smelled on his breath. Parsley. Strange that such a domestic scent would seem so exotic on him.</p> <p>He spoke softly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why a lady of your attraction would be left to languish for so many years alone.\u201d</p><p>Her brow creased. \u201cActually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere is a tea shop,\u201d Tante Cristelle called from behind them. \u201cMy bones ache most terrible from this exercise. Shall we rest here?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley turned. \u201cI am sorry, ma\u2019am. Yes, indeed we\u2019ll stop here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBon,\u201d Tante said. \u201cLet us compose ourselves for a time, then.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley held open the pretty wood and glass door, and they entered the little shop. Small, circular tables were placed here and there, and the ladies settled themselves while Mr. Hartley went to purchase the tea.</p><p>Tante Cristelle leaned forward to tap Rebecca\u2019s knee. \u201cYour brother is very solicitous of you. Be grateful; not all men are so. And those who are do not often stay in this world overlong.\u201d</p><p>The girl knit her brows at Tante\u2019s last remark, but she chose to reply to the first. \u201cOh, but I am very grateful. Samuel has always been kind to me when I saw him.\u201d</p> <p>Emeline smoothed a lace ruffle on her skirt. \u201cMr. Hartley said that you were raised by your uncle.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca\u2019s eyes dropped. \u201cYes. I only saw Samuel once or twice a year, when he came to visit. He always seemed so big, even though he must\u2019ve been younger than I am now. Later, of course, he enlisted and wore a magnificent soldier\u2019s uniform. I was quite in awe of him. He walks like no other man I know. He strides so easily, as if he could keep up his pace for days on end.\u201d The girl looked up and smiled self-consciously. \u201cI describe it badly.\u201d</p><p>But oddly Emeline knew exactly what Rebecca meant. Mr. Hartley moved with a graceful confidence that made her think he knew his own body and how it worked better than other men did theirs. She turned to watch Mr. Hartley now. He waited for his turn to buy the tea. In front of him, an older gentleman frowned and impatiently tapped his toe. There were other customers as well, some tapping their feet, some shifting their weight restlessly. Only Mr. Hartley was perfectly still. He looked neither impatient nor bored, as if he could stand thus, one leg bent, his arms crossed at his chest, for hours. He caught her eye, and his eyebrows slowly rose, either in question or in challenge, she couldn\u2019t tell. Her face heated and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cYou and your brother seem very close,\u201d she said to Rebecca. \u201cDespite your childhood apart.\u201d</p><p>The girl smiled, but her eyes seemed uncertain. \u201cI hope we\u2019re close. I think that we are close. I admire my brother greatly.\u201d</p><p>Emeline watched the girl thoughtfully. The sentiment was correct, to be sure, but Rebecca phrased the words almost as a question.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Mr. Hartley said, suddenly at her side.</p><p>Emeline started and glanced at the man in exasperation. Had he crept up beside her on purpose?</p><p>He smiled that maddeningly cryptic smile of his and held out a plate of pink sugared sweets. Behind him, a girl brought the tray of tea things. Mr. Hartley\u2019s coffee-brown eyes seemed to chide Emeline for her pettiness.</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cThank you, Mr. Hartley.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cMy pleasure, Lady Emeline.\u201d</p><p>Humph. She tasted a candy and found that it was tart and sweet at once. Just right, in fact. She glanced at her aunt. The older lady had her head close to Rebecca\u2019s, talking intently.</p><p>\u201cI hope my aunt is not lecturing your sister,\u201d she commented as she poured the tea.</p><p>Mr. Hartley glanced at Rebecca. \u201cShe is made of sterner stuff than she looks. I think she will survive whatever travails your aunt may throw at her.\u201d</p><p>He was leaning casually against the wall not two feet away from her, all the chairs having been already taken. Emeline sipped at her tea as her gaze fell to his strange footwear.</p><p>Without thinking, she voiced her thoughts. \u201cWherever did you come by those slippers?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley extended one leg, his arms still crossed at his chest. \u201cThey\u2019re moccasins, made from American deerskin by the women of the Mohican Indian tribe.\u201d</p><p>The ladies at the next table got up to leave, but he made no move to sit down. The bell rang over the shop door as more people came in.</p><p>She frowned at Mr. Hartley\u2019s moccasins and the leggings above them. He\u2019d gartered the soft leather just below his knees with an embroidered sash and let the ends hang down. \u201cDo all white men wear this attire in the Colonies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not all.\u201d He crossed his legs again. \u201cMost wear the same shoes or boots as gentlemen wear here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you choose to sport such strange footwear?\u201d She was aware that her voice was sharp, but somehow his insistence on unconventional clothing was unbearably irritating to her. Why did he do it? If he wore buckle shoes and stockings like every other gentleman in London, no one would notice him. With his wealth, he could perhaps become an English gentleman and be accepted into the ton. He\u2019d be respectable.</p><p>Mr. Hartley shrugged, patently unaware of her inner turmoil. \u201cHunters wear them in the woods of America. They\u2019re very comfortable and much more useful than English shoes. The leggings protect against thorns and branches. I\u2019m accustomed to them.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, and in his eyes she somehow saw that he was aware that she wished he was conventional and more like the usual English gentleman. He understood and it made him sad. She stared into his warm, brown eyes, not knowing what to do. There was something there, something they communicated between them, and she didn\u2019t quite understand the subtleties.</p><p>Then a male voice spoke from behind her. \u201cCorporal Hartley! What are you doing in London?\u201d</p><p>SAM TENSED. THE man hailing him was slender and of average height, perhaps a little below. He wore a dark green coat and brown waistcoat, perfectly respectable and ordinary. In fact, he would\u2019ve looked like a thousand other London gentlemen if it weren\u2019t for his hair. It was a bright, orangey-red and clubbed back. Sam tried to place the stranger and couldn\u2019t. There\u2019d been several redheaded men in the regiment.</p><p>The man grinned and stuck out his hand. \u201cThornton. Dick Thornton. I haven\u2019t seen you in, what? Six years at least. What\u2019re you doing in London?\u201d</p><p>Sam took the proffered hand and shook it. Of course. He could place the other man now. Thornton had been one of the 28th. \u201cI\u2019m here on business, Mr. Thornton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed? London is a long way for a backwoods tracker from the Colonies.\u201d Thornton smiled as if to take the insult from his words.</p><p>Sam shrugged easily. \u201cMy uncle died in sixty. I mustered out of the army and took over his import business in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Thornton rocked back on his heels and glanced inquiringly at Lady Emeline.</p><p>Sam felt an odd reluctance to make the introduction, but he shook it off. \u201cMy lady, may I present Mr. Richard Thornton, an old comrade of mine. Thornton, this is Lady Emeline Gordon, Captain St. Aubyn\u2019s sister. Also, this is my sister, Rebecca Hartley, and Lady Emeline\u2019s aunt, Mademoiselle Molyneux.\u201d</p><p>Thornton bowed showily. \u201cLadies.\u201d</p><p>Lady Emeline held out her hand. \u201cHow do you do, Mr. Thornton?\u201d</p><p>The other man\u2019s expression sobered as he bent over Lady Emeline\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, my lady. May I say that we were all grieved when we heard of your brother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>No distress showed on Lady Emeline\u2019s face, but Sam felt her stiffen, even though several feet separated them. He could not explain how this was possible, but it was as if there was a change in the very air between them.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew Reynaud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We all knew and liked Captain St. Aubyn.\u201d He turned to Sam as if for confirmation. \u201cA gallant gentleman and a great leader of men, wasn\u2019t he, Hartley? Always ready with a kind word, always encouraging us as we marched through those hellish woods. And at the last, when the savages attacked, ma\u2019am, it would\u2019ve done your heart proud to see the way he stood his ground. Some were fearful. Some thought to break ranks and run\u2014\u201d Thornton suddenly stopped and coughed, looking guiltily at Sam.</p><p>Sam stared back stonily. Many had thought he had run at Spinner\u2019s Falls. Sam hadn\u2019t bothered explaining himself then, and he wasn\u2019t about to start doing so now. He knew that Lady Emeline was looking at him, but he refused to meet her eyes. Let her damn him like the rest, if that was what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cYour memories of my nephew are very welcome, Mr. Thornton,\u201d Mademoiselle Molyneux said, breaking into the awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Thornton straightened his waistcoat. \u201cIt was a long time ago, now. Captain St. Aubyn died a hero\u2019s death. That\u2019s what you should remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know of any other veterans of the 28th here in London?\u201d Sam asked the other man softly.</p><p>Thornton blew out a breath as he thought. \u201cNot many, not many. Of course, there were few survivors to begin with. There\u2019s Lieutenant Horn and Captain Renshaw\u2014Lord Vale, he is now\u2014but I hardly move in the same exalted circles as they.\u201d He smiled at Lady Emeline as if to acknowledge her rank. \u201cThere\u2019s Wimbley and Ford, and Sergeant Allen, poor blighter. Terrible what he\u2019s become. Never recovered from losing that leg.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019d already questioned Wimbley and Ford. Sergeant Allen was harder to track. He mentally moved his name to the top of the list of people he needed to speak to.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your comrades from the regiment?\u201d he asked. \u201cI remember that there were five or six of you who used to share the same fire at night. You seemed to have a leader, another redheaded man, Private...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacDonald. Andy MacDonald. Yes, people used to have trouble telling us apart. The hair, you know. Funny, it\u2019s the only thing some people remember about me.\u201d Thornton shook his head. \u201cPoor MacDonald took a ball to the head at Spinner\u2019s Falls. Fell right beside me, he did.\u201d</p><p>Sam kept his gaze steady but could feel a drop of sweat slide down his backbone. He didn\u2019t like thinking of that day, and the crowded London street had already made him uneasy. \u201cAnd the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead, all dead, I think. Most fell at Spinner\u2019s Falls, although Ridley survived for a few months after\u2014before the gangrene finally took him.\u201d He grinned ruefully and winked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam frowned. \u201cDo you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Hartley, I believe we still have the shoemaker\u2019s to visit,\u201d Mademoiselle Molyneux cut in.</p><p>Sam broke eye contact with Thornton to look at the ladies. Rebecca was watching him with confusion in her eyes, Lady Emeline\u2019s face was blank, and the old lady merely appeared impatient. \u201cMy apologies, ladies. I didn\u2019t mean to bore you with the reminisces of long-ago events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize as well.\u201d Thornton made another beautiful bow. \u201cIt was most pleasant meeting you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMight I have your address?\u201d Sam asked hastily. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you again. Few remember the events of that day.\u201d</p><p>Thornton beamed. \u201cYes, of course. I, too, enjoy reminiscing. You may find me at my place of business. It\u2019s not too far from here. Only continue down Piccadilly to Dover Street and you will find me. George Thornton and Son, Bootmakers. Founded by my father, don\u2019t you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Sam shook hands once again and watched as Thornton made his farewells to the ladies and walked off. His red hair could be discerned in the crowd for some time before he disappeared.</p><p>He turned to Lady Emeline and offered his arm. \u201cShall we?\u201d And then he made the mistake of looking into her eyes. There was no way she wouldn\u2019t have figured it out. She was an intelligent woman, and she\u2019d heard the entire conversation. But he still felt a sinking in his chest.</p><p>She knew.</p> <p>MR. HARTLEY WAS in London because of the massacre at Spinner\u2019s Falls. His questions to Mr. Thornton had been too pointed, his attention to the replies too intense. Something about the massacre of the 28th Regiment bothered him.</p><p>And Reynaud had died at Spinner\u2019s Falls.</p><p>Emeline placed her fingertips on his forearm, but then couldn\u2019t restrain herself. She gripped the muscle of his arm in clenched fingers. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>They had started walking, and his face was in profile to her. A muscle in his cheek twitched. \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she hissed at him. Tante and Rebecca were right behind, and she didn\u2019t want them to hear. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend to misunderstand. I\u2019m not a fool.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her then. \u201cI would never think you a fool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen don\u2019t treat me like one. You served in the same regiment as Reynaud. You knew my brother. What are you investigating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He hesitated. What was he thinking? What was he hiding from her? \u201cI don\u2019t want to bring up unpleasant memories. I don\u2019t want to remind you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me! Mon Dieu, can you believe that I have forgotten the death of my only brother? That I would need a word from you to make me think of him? He is with me every day. Every day, I tell you.\u201d She stopped because her breath was coming too roughly, and her voice was beginning to tremble. What idiots men were!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI did not mean to make light of your loss\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snorted at that.</p><p>He continued over her interruption. \u201cBut credit me with some sensitivity. I didn\u2019t know how to speak about your brother. About that day. My sin is one of stupidity, not deliberate maliciousness. Forgive me, please.\u201d</p><p>Such a pretty speech. She bit her lip and watched as two young aristocrats sauntered by, dressed in the height of fashion. Lace spilled from their wrists, their coats were made of velvet, and their wigs were extravagantly curled. They probably hadn\u2019t yet attained their twentieth year, and they walked with all the arrogance of money and privilege, confident in their place in society, confident that the woes of the lesser classes would never touch them. Reynaud had walked like that once.</p><p>She looked away, remembering black, laughing eyes. \u201cHe wrote about you.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at her, his brows raised.</p><p>\u201cReynaud,\u201d she clarified, although she could hardly be speaking of anyone else. \u201cIn his letters to me, he wrote about you.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley stared straight ahead. She saw his Adam\u2019s apple dip as he swallowed. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, pretending interest in the window of a lace shop as they passed. It had been years since last she\u2019d pored over Reynaud\u2019s letters, but she knew the contents of every single one by heart.</p><p>\u201cHe said that an American corporal had been assigned to his regiment, that he admired your tracking ability. He said that he trusted you above all the other scouts, even the native Indians. He said that you showed him how to discern the difference between the native tribes. That the Mohicans wore their hair in a bristle at the top of their head and that the Wy-Wy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWyandot,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cWyandot were fond of the colors red and black and favored a long piece of cloth worn in front and back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA breech clout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so.\u201d She looked down. \u201cHe said he liked you.\u201d</p><p>She felt the movement of his chest against the back of her hand as he inhaled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. There was no need to ask what he thanked her for. \u201cHow long did you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the Battle of Quebec, I was attached to the 28th informally. I was only supposed to march with them until they reached Fort Edward, help scout the way. I knew your brother for a couple of months, maybe a little more. Then, of course, we came to Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>He had no need to say more. Spinner\u2019s Falls was where they had all died, caught in the cross fire from two groups of Wyandot Indians. She\u2019d read the accounts that were written in the newspapers. Few survivors of the massacre actually wanted to talk of it. Fewer still were willing to discuss it with a woman.</p><p>Emeline inhaled. \u201cDid you see him die?\u201d</p><p>She felt him turn to stare at her. \u201cMy lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>Emeline twisted a ruffle at her waist until she felt silk tear. \u201cDid you see him die?\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath, and when he spoke, his voice was tight. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She let the bit of fabric go. Was it relief she felt?</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask? Surely it does no good to hear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want\u2014no, I need\u2014to know what it was like for him at the last.\u201d She glanced at Mr. Hartley\u2019s face and knew from the slight indent between his brows that he was puzzled. She gazed sightlessly ahead as she tried to find the words for her thoughts. \u201cIf I can understand, perhaps feel, just a little of what he went through, I can be closer to him.\u201d</p><p>He was frowning harder now. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. I doubt that your brother would want you to brood thus over his death.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, but it came out a dry exhalation of air. \u201cBut as you say, he is dead. What he would or would not want no longer matters.\u201d</p><p>Ah, now she had shocked him. Men were sure that ladies were to be shielded from life\u2019s harsh realities. Men, poor dears, were so naive. Did they think childbirth was a stroll before luncheon?</p><p>But he rallied fast, this strange colonialist. \u201cPlease explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do this for myself, not Reynaud.\u201d She puffed out a breath. Why did she even bother? He wouldn\u2019t understand. \u201cMy brother was so young when he died, just eight and twenty, and there were many things left undone in his life. I have only a finite number of memories of him. There will never be any more.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, still gazing sightlessly at the street ahead. He didn\u2019t speak. This was a personal matter. She shouldn\u2019t talk about it to a comparative stranger. But he\u2019d been there in that foreign place where Reynaud had died. If only in a small way, he was part of Reynaud.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThere was a book of fairy tales we used to look at together as children. Reynaud loved those stories. I can\u2019t remember what they were about exactly, but I keep thinking if only I could read it again...\u201d She was suddenly conscious that her conversation was meandering. She glanced up at him.</p><p>Mr. Hartley stared back, his head tilted in interest toward her.</p><p>She waved a hand impatiently. \u201cBut the book is neither here nor there. If I can find out how his last hours were, then he lives just a little longer in my memory. It doesn\u2019t matter that they are awful moments, do you see? They are Reynaud\u2019s moments, and thus precious. They bring me closer to him.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head as his brows drew together. \u201cI think I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? Do you truly?\u201d If he did, he would be the first to understand her. Not even Tante Cristelle could fully comprehend her need to find out everything that had happened to Reynaud in his last days. She watched him in amazement and with a dawning awareness. Maybe he truly was unlike other men. How odd.</p><p>He looked up then and caught her eye. That sensuous lower lip curved. \u201cYou\u2019re a frightening woman.\u201d</p><p>And Emeline realized to her horror that she could come to like Samuel Hartley. Come to like him too much. She hastily looked straight ahead and took a deep breath. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He no longer pretended that he didn\u2019t know what she asked. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find out why Spinner\u2019s Falls happened. The Wyandot didn\u2019t find our regiment by accident.\u201d He turned to look at her, and she saw that his eyes had hardened to iron\u2014strong, determined, and resolute. \u201cI think we were betrayed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The old man was dressed in dirty rags. It hardly seemed likely, so Iron Heart thought, that such a one would hold the key to marrying a princess.</p><p>But as he started to turn aside, the old man caught his arm. \u201cListen! You will live in a marble castle with Princess Solace as your bride. You will have silk clothes to wear and servants to wait upon your every need. All you must do is follow my instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are your instructions?\u201d Iron Heart asked.</p><p>The old wizard grinned\u2014for naturally he was a wizard to know so much. \u201cYou must not speak for seven years.\u201d</p><p>Iron Heart stared. \u201cAnd if I am unable to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you utter one word\u2014even one sound\u2014you will be returned to rags and Princess Solace will die.\u201d</p><p>Now, this may not seem such a wonderful bargain to you or me, but remember that Iron Heart was presently employed as a street sweeper. He looked down at his feet, shod in tattered leather, then over at the gutter where he would make his bed that night, and in the end he did the only thing he could. He agreed to the wizard\u2019s price....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>Tonight the moon was curtained by clouds. Sam glanced at the sky as he paused beside a dark doorway. The moon was waning, anyway, so even when it came out from behind the clouds, its light was thin. He welcomed the thick shadows. It made the night perfect for hunting.</p><p>Sam slid now into an alley, moving swiftly past a bundled shape hunched against a wall. The bundle didn\u2019t stir, but a cat sitting by its side paused in her bath to watch Sam with glowing eyes. There was a row of fine stables farther on, nearly twice the size of the ones behind his own rented house. Sam snorted. What did one man need with so many beasts?</p><p>A light appeared at one of the stable doors, and a short, sturdy man holding a lantern emerged. Sam froze, drifting back into the shadows. The man set his lantern down on the cobblestones in the mews while he dug in a pocket; then he withdrew a long clay pipe and lit it from the lantern\u2019s flame. Puffing contentedly, he picked up his lantern again and disappeared around the corner of the stables.</p><p>Sam grinned. He waited a moment more and then followed in the man\u2019s wake. There was a wall here with a gate, separating the mews from the back garden of the house, that was his target. He passed by the gate. It was too exposed, too likely to have a guard or a lightly sleeping groom nearby. He continued into the shadows beneath a tree that overhung the wall. Eyeing the bricks, he backed a pace and then leapt. The wall was about eight feet tall, and he was just able to fling his arms over the top. Swiftly, he levered himself up, rolled over the top, and landed in a crouch on the other side. He didn\u2019t pause but used his jump\u2019s momentum to run along the wall and duck under a bush several paces away. Here he dropped to the ground and lay on his belly, carefully watching the dark garden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a large, rectangular town garden, planted with small ornamental trees and bushes in a severely geometric pattern. A gravel path led from the mews wall to the back of the house, where no doubt there would be separate servant and master entrances. At the moment, nothing moved in the garden.</p><p>Sam got to his feet and made his way to the back of the house, eschewing the graveled walk for fear of the sound. As he approached the house, he saw that the servant\u2019s entrance was partly belowground; there was a well with steps leading down to the door. Above was a kind of balcony or terrace with a low, ornamental wall and French doors. A light flickered behind the French doors. Sam crept up the curving granite stairs and close to the glass doors. The man within had not bothered to draw the curtains, and he was as well lit as if he stood on a stage.</p><p>Jasper Renshaw, Viscount Vale, half sat, half lay on a great red velvet wing chair. One long leg draped over the chair\u2019s arm and swung absently as he turned a page in the great book on his lap. A large buckle shoe lay overturned beside the chair; the foot on the swinging leg was clad only in a stocking.</p><p>Sam snorted softly and crouched by the window, enjoying the fact that the man never knew he was being watched from without. Vale had commanded the Light Company of the 28th. Where the other former soldiers he\u2019d talked to had aged and changed in the six years since he\u2019d seen them, Renshaw\u2014now Viscount Vale\u2014was the same. His face was long and thin, with deep lines bracketing a wide mouth and a too-large nose. He wasn\u2019t a handsome man, and yet his face was impossible to dislike. The eyes drooped at the corners, rather like a hunting dog\u2019s, appearing always slightly sad, even when he was in good cheer. The rest of Vale looked like he\u2019d never outgrown the lankiness of adolescence. His arms and legs were long and bony, his hands and feet overlarge as if he still waited for his limbs to fill out. Yet Vale was the same age as Sam. As Sam considered him, Vale licked his thumb and turned another page in his book; then he picked up a crystal glass with ruby liquid and sipped from it.</p> <p>Sam remembered Vale as a good officer, though not as commanding as Reynaud. He\u2019d been too relaxed to bother instilling respect in the men. Instead, he\u2019d been the one who others had gone to with their problems and their petty arguments. Vale was as likely to dice with the common soldiers as dine with the officers. He\u2019d always been in a good mood, always ready to tell a joke or play a prank on his fellow officers. It\u2019d made him a favorite of the troops. He wasn\u2019t the type of man anyone would think could betray an entire regiment.</p><p>And yet if Sam\u2019s information was true, someone had. He patted his pocket, feeling the paper within. Someone had alerted the French and their Wyandot Indian allies, told them exactly where the 28th would be. Someone had conspired to massacre an entire regiment of his fellow soldiers at Spinner\u2019s Falls. That possibility had driven Sam to England. He had to find the truth. Find if there was a reason for so many to have died that fall day six years ago. And when he found the man responsible, maybe then he could reclaim his soul, reclaim the life he\u2019d lost at Spinner\u2019s Falls.</p><p>Was Vale the right man? The viscount had been in debt to Clemmons, and Clemmons had died in the massacre. But Vale had fought bravely, gallantly, at Spinner\u2019s Falls. Could such a brave officer murder an entire regiment just to get rid of one man? Wouldn\u2019t he be marked? Wouldn\u2019t he bear the scars of his depravity on his face? Or would he, six years later, be sitting contentedly in his library reading a book?</p><p>Sam shook his head. The officer he thought he\u2019d known six years ago would never have done such a thing. But he\u2019d only been with the 28th for a little over a month. Maybe he\u2019d never really known Vale. His instinct was to confront Vale, here and now, but he would get no answers that way. Better to approach him obliquely at a social gathering. That was why he\u2019d sought the services of Lady Emeline. On the thought of that lady, Sam withdrew, making his way back through the dark garden. What would Lady Emeline think if she found out his true reason for asking for her help? She still grieved for her brother, but would she want to upset her social standing to accuse a peer? He grimaced as he went over the mews wall again.</p><p>Somehow he thought that Lady Emeline would not be happy with the course he\u2019d set.</p> <p>\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d Emeline exclaimed the next morning.</p><p>Rebecca froze, her foot half lifted, her expression terrified. They were in Emeline\u2019s town house ballroom where she was attempting to teach the American girl a few of the newer dance steps. Tante Cristelle assisted at the harpsichord, which had been especially carried into the room by two burly footmen. The ballroom floor was parquet, polished to a high gleam, and mirrors lined one entire wall. Rebecca, with her raised foot and terrified expression, was reflected countlessly in the mirrors. Emeline took a deep breath and tried to modify her own expression, pasting on a smile.</p><p>Rebecca didn\u2019t look reassured.</p><p>Emeline sighed. \u201cYou must move easily. Gracefully. Not like a...a...\u201d She searched for a phrase that would not involve the word elephant.</p><p>\u201cDrunken sailor.\u201d Samuel Hartley\u2019s voice echoed in her ballroom. He sounded amused.</p><p>Rebecca lowered her foot with a thump and glared at her brother. \u201cThank you very much!\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Hartley shrugged and strolled into the room. He was neatly turned out in brown and black, but the bruise on his chin was turning yellowy-green, and he had dark circles beneath his eyes.</p><p>Emeline narrowed her own eyes. What activities were keeping the colonial from sleeping at night? \u201cWas there something you needed, Mr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he replied. \u201cI find I have an urgent need to come supervise my sister\u2019s dancing lesson.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca harrumphed at his words, but a shy smile crept over her lips. She was obviously pleased at her brother\u2019s attention.</p><p>Emeline was not. Merely the presence of the man in her ballroom disrupted her concentration. \u201cWe are very busy here, Mr. Hartley. There are only two days remaining before Rebecca\u2019s first ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He bowed with ironic precision. \u201cI understand the gravity of the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhem!\u201d Tante cleared her throat with a horrible grinding noise. Both Emeline and Mr. Hartley turned to stare at her. \u201cThe child and I need a short rest from our exertions. A walk about the garden, perhaps? Come, ma petite, I will instruct you on elegant conversations when strolling in so boring a garden.\u201d She held out her hand to Rebecca.</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d Rebecca replied weakly as she followed the older lady.</p><p>Emeline waited, her foot tapping, as her aunt and Rebecca walked to the door and exited the room; then she whirled on Mr. Hartley. \u201cYou\u2019ve interrupted this morning\u2019s lesson. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows and stepped so close, his breath brushed her cheek. \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare?\u201d She opened her mouth, closed it, and then opened it again. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that I care; it\u2019s simply\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a bad mood.\u201d He pursed his lips and tilted his head as if he were examining a suspect piece of fruit. \u201cYou\u2019re often in a bad mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in a bad mood yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in a bad mood when first I met you at Mrs. Conrad\u2019s salon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd while your mood was not precisely bad when we came to tea, it certainly could not be termed good.\u201d He smiled kindly at her. \u201cBut perhaps I have the case wrong. Perhaps you\u2019re usually a lady with a sunny disposition, and it\u2019s only my advent into your life that has turned you sour.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him\u2014actually gaped, her mouth hanging ajar like the greenest debutante. How dare he? No one spoke to her in this manner! He had turned away now and was idly plinking the harpsichord in a very annoying manner. She caught him glancing slyly at her, his mouth curving at the corner; then he went back to watching his fingers abuse the harpsichord.</p><p>Emeline took a deep breath and twitched her skirts straight. She hadn\u2019t been the belle of innumerable balls for nothing.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized my voice was so sharp, Mr. Hartley,\u201d she said as she wandered closer to where he stood. She kept her eyes downcast and worked to look woebegone\u2014not a very familiar expression. \u201cHad I known the distress my unladylike surliness would cause you, I would have died a thousand deaths rather than acted so. Please accept my apology.\u201d</p><p>She waited. It was his turn. Now he would be covered in shame because he\u2019d made a lady apologize so abjectly. Perhaps he would even stutter. She tried not to smirk.</p><p>Instead there was only silence. His long fingers played on the harpsichord keys without any notion of music. If he continued much longer, she would go mad.</p><p>Finally, she looked up.</p><p>Mr. Hartley wasn\u2019t even paying attention to his hands. Instead he was watching her with a faintly amused expression. \u201cWhen was the last time you apologized to a man?\u201d</p><p>Oooh! He was the most provoking oaf!</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cYears, perhaps.\u201d She stepped closer and placed her hand on the keys beside his. Then she looked up at him and slowly let her mouth curve into a very small smile. \u201cBut I do know he was most satisfied with my apology.\u201d</p><p>His hands stilled, the room suddenly hushed. His eyes were intent in an almost frightening way. For the life of her, Emeline could not look away from him. She watched as his gaze drifted over her face, coming finally to rest on her mouth. Without even thinking, her lips parted. His eyes narrowed and he took a step toward her, closing the space between them and raising his arms\u2014</p><p>The door to the ballroom opened.</p><p>\u201cWe are ready now, yes?\u201d Tante Cristelle said. \u201cAnother hour, I think, no more. My hands, they will be crippled if I play longer at that instrument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Emeline gasped. Her face was probably as red as a boiled beet. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw that Mr. Hartley had somehow contrived to place himself on the other side of the harpsichord\u2014a distance that was more than respectable. When had he done that? She hadn\u2019t even seen him move.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Lady Emeline?\u201d the girl asked innocently. \u201cYou look hot.\u201d</p><p>Oh, these terrible colonials with their blunt ways! Emeline saw the horrid man smirk, though she doubted anyone else caught his expression.</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d Emeline twitched her left sleeve forward. \u201cShall we begin again with those dance steps? Mr. Hartley, this will no doubt bore you to tears. We give you leave to go about your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, Lady Emeline, had I any.\u201d Mr. Hartley settled into a chair and crossed his leg at the ankle as if he planned to stay into the night. \u201cBusiness, that is. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m quite free all afternoon.\u201d</p><p>No sane person could expect her to actually smile at this news.</p><p>\u201cAh. Then we will naturally enjoy your company,\u201d she replied stiffly.</p><p>Tante glanced at her sharply, eyebrows raised in either question or censure; it was hard to tell. Reprimanded, Emeline schooled her features, and her aunt began to play. Emeline watched Rebecca practice the steps for nearly a second before her mind turned to her embarrassing exchange with Mr. Hartley.</p><p>What in the world had possessed her? Everyone knew that gentlemen liked a lady to be soft and gently spoken. Wasn\u2019t that the one lesson that was drummed into a girl\u2019s head right from the cradle? Well, that and preserving one\u2019s virginity for marriage, but that hardly applied in her case. She couldn\u2019t even claim intoxication from the wine at luncheon as an excuse. It had been regrettably over-watered, as Tante had been sure to point out.</p><p>And the insidiously suggestive words she\u2019d spoken to Mr. Hartley at the last! She blushed again just thinking of them. But perhaps he hadn\u2019t understood the double entendre? Emeline glanced at Mr. Hartley. He was watching her, his eyelids half lowered and a smile playing about his mouth. He caught her look and quirked one eyebrow upward. Emeline hastily looked away. Quite obviously, he had indeed understood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I just can\u2019t!\u201d Rebecca suddenly stopped in midturn. \u201cThese steps are so slow. I feel like I\u2019ll overbalance and fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you need a partner,\u201d Mr. Hartley said. He rose and made a lovely bow to his sister. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>The girl blushed very prettily. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you stomp on my toes.\u201d He grinned down at Rebecca.</p> <p>Emeline blinked. Mr. Hartley was exceedingly handsome when he smiled. Why hadn\u2019t she noticed it before?</p><p>\u201cThe only problem,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that I\u2019m in as much need of tuition as you.\u201d He looked expectantly at Emeline.</p><p>Devious. Emeline nodded briskly and stepped forward so that she and Rebecca now flanked Mr. Hartley in a line. She held out her hand to him. He took her fingertips, quite properly, but his hand felt hot on hers.</p><p>Emeline cleared her throat. She raised their joined hands to shoulder height and faced forward. \u201cVery well.\u201d She pointed her right toe. \u201cWe begin on three. One and two and three.\u201d</p><p>For the next quarter hour, they practiced various dance steps together. Mr. Hartley sometimes partnered his sister, sometimes her. And Emeline, though she would never have admitted it even if put on the rack, rather enjoyed herself. She was amazed that such a big man could be so light and graceful on his feet.</p> <p>Then somehow, Rebecca made a false step, and she and her brother ended up tangled. He caught his sister about the waist as Emeline hastily stepped away from the mess. \u201cCareful there, Becca, or you\u2019ll have your partner on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m terrible at this!\u201d the younger girl cried. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair! You never danced this way as a boy and yet you can follow the steps.\u201d</p><p>Emeline looked between brother and sister. \u201cIn what way did Mr. Hartley dance as a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBadly,\u201d he said.</p><p>While at the same time his sister said, \u201cHe jigged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJigged?\u201d Emeline tried to imagine Mr. Hartley\u2019s tall form bouncing up and down in a country jig.</p> <p>\u201cThe peasants about the ch\u00e2teau where I grew up used to dance so,\u201d Tante remarked.</p><p>\u201cI would like to see you jig,\u201d Emeline mused.</p><p>Mr. Hartley shot her an ironic look. Emeline smiled back. For a moment, their gazes were locked and she couldn\u2019t quite discern the look in his brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe was wonderfully fast,\u201d Rebecca said, warming to her theme. \u201cBut then he got old and stiff, and he doesn\u2019t jig anymore.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley broke eye contact with Emeline to mock frown at his sister. \u201cA challenge if I ever heard one.\u201d</p><p>He took off his coat and, in shirtsleeves and waistcoat, struck a pose, hands on hips, head held high.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll really do it?\u201d Rebecca was laughing openly now.</p><p>He sighed theatrically. \u201cIf you\u2019ll keep time.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca began clapping and Mr. Hartley leapt. Emeline had seen men jig before\u2014peasants celebrating or sailors on shore leave from their ships. Usually such dancing was characterized by the clumsiness of the movements, legs and heels kicking everywhere, hair and clothing flying in the air like a puppet on a string. But when Mr. Hartley jigged, it was different. He was contained, for one thing, his movements precise and intentioned. And he was graceful. It was extraordinary. He was jumping about, his moccasined feet stomping on the parquet floor, and yet somehow he contrived to be graceful and quick. He grinned at her, a wholly joyful look, his strong, white teeth flashing against his brown skin. Emeline clapped to the beat along with everyone else, including Tante.</p><p>He darted forward and drew Rebecca into his wild dance, spinning her in a circle until she staggered away, laughing and out of breath. Then he caught Emeline. She found herself whirled in strong, sure hands. The mirrored walls and the faces of Rebecca and Tante flew past, and she felt her heart speed until she thought it might burst from her chest. Mr. Hartley grasped her about the waist and lifted her high over his laughing face, and she found that she was laughing, too.</p><p>Laughing with joy.</p><p>THAT NIGHT, SAM wore black, the better to slide into the shadows between the buildings. It was well past midnight, and the moon hung high overhead, casting a colorless glow on the earth below. He was on his way home, having already been to see Ned Allen\u2014or what was left of the man. The ex-sergeant had been incoherent with drink. Sam hadn\u2019t been able to get any information from him; he\u2019d have to try again later, perhaps catch the man earlier in the day. Trying to question Allen had been a waste of time, but stalking the shadows was invigorating nevertheless.</p><p>He carefully watched the street. A carriage was rumbling closer, but there was no other sign of life. Visiting Ned\u2019s crib had made Sam remember Scarlet Coat. Had his follower given up the chase? He\u2019d not seen the big man again. Strange. What had the man been\u2014</p><p>\u201cMr. Hartley!\u201d</p><p>Sam closed his eyes for a moment. He knew that voice.</p><p>\u201cI say, Mr. Hartley! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been the best tracker in the Colonies during the war. It wasn\u2019t vanity that said so; his commanders had told him. Once, he\u2019d snuck right through a camp full of sleeping Wyandot warriors and not a one had been the wiser. And yet one small woman found him out. Could she see in the dark?</p><p>\u201cMr. Hartley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he hissed, emerging from the dark doorway he\u2019d been lurking in. He approached the grand carriage. It was stopped in the middle of the road, the horses blowing impatiently. Lady Emeline\u2019s head appeared disembodied, sticking out from the dark curtains that covered the carriage\u2019s window.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cGood evening, Lady Emeline. Fancy meeting you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cI can\u2019t think what you\u2019re doing out alone so late. Don\u2019t you know how dangerous London can be for a man by himself? But perhaps you are used to the more benign streets of Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s probably it,\u201d he said wryly as he climbed inside her elegant carriage. \u201cAnd may I ask what you\u2019re doing out so late, my lady?\u201d He rapped at the roof before taking the seat across from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m returning from a soiree, of course,\u201d Lady Emeline said. She smoothed the shawl that covered her knees. The carriage lurched forward as they started again.</p><p>It was dim inside the carriage, the only light a single lantern by her face, but he could see that she was dressed very grandly. She wore a flame-red frock with some type of pattern in yellow. The skirt had been drawn aside to reveal a petticoat in yellow and green. Above, her bodice was square and very low, her breasts pushed up until they formed two soft, white mounds that nearly glowed in the lamplight. Heat seemed to radiate off her, warming his bones.</p><p>\u201cIt was rather dull, so I came away early,\u201d the lady continued. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe, but the punch was gone by ten, and there was hardly much for a midnight supper\u2014only a few meat pies and fruit. Quite scandalous. I can\u2019t think what Mrs. Turner was about, serving such poor refreshments to everyone who matters. But the woman always has been a wigeon. The only reason I attend her parties is in the hope of seeing her brother, Lord Downing. He is a terrible gossip.\u201d</p><p>She paused, probably because she\u2019d run out of breath. Sam stared at her, trying to figure out why she was speaking so fast. Had she been drinking spirits at her party? Or was she...? He felt a smile forming and worked to suppress it. No, it couldn\u2019t be. Was Lady Emeline nervous? He\u2019d never thought to see the sophisticated widow out of sorts.</p><p>\u201cBut why were you about so late?\u201d Lady Emeline asked. Her hands, which had been busy playing with the lace that trimmed her bodice, stilled. \u201cOr, perhaps that is none of my business.\u201d Even in the dim light, he could see the blush that stained her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t your business,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut not for the reason you think.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d been a little black hen, her feathers would\u2019ve ruffled. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean to imply by that, Mr. Hartley. I am sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ve been to see a whore.\u201d He smiled and slid lower in the carriage seat, canting his legs to the side so that he might cross them. He slipped his fingers into his waistcoat pockets, enjoying himself. \u201cAdmit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do no such thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that blush on your cheeks says otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He tutted. \u201cYour thoughts are very lewd. I am shocked, my lady, quite shocked.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, all she could do was sputter; then her eyes narrowed as she recovered. Sam braced himself. God, he liked sparring with this woman.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less how you conduct yourself after dark,\u201d she said primly. \u201cYour affairs are of absolutely no importance to me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d made an entirely proper statement and was obviously uncomfortable on this ground. If he was a gentleman, he\u2019d let it\u2014her\u2014go, turn the conversation to something dull and polite such as the weather. The problem was that once the prey was within his grasp, it was so very difficult to let go.</p><p>Not to mention that polite conversation had always bored him. \u201cMy affairs should be of no importance to you, but they are, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together as she opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAh. Ah.\u201d He held up a finger to forestall her denial. \u201cIt\u2019s past midnight, and we\u2019re alone in a dark carriage. What\u2019s said here will never see the light of day. Humor me, lady, and be frank.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply and sat back, her face entirely hidden by shadows now. \u201cWhat difference does it make to you if I do find your affairs to be of interest, Mr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>He smiled wryly. \u201cTouch\u00e9, my lady. I\u2019m sure a sophisticated gentleman of your society would deny it to his death if he was moved by your interest, but I am made of simpler stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d The words were whispered in the dark.</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cSo I tell you: I am moved by your interest. I am moved by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you admit the same?\u201d</p><p>She gasped and for a moment, he thought he\u2019d gone too far and that she\u2019d retreat from this dangerous game. She was a lady of standing, after all, and there were rules and boundaries in her world.</p><p>But she slowly leaned forward, her face emerging into the small pool of light cast through the window. She looked him full in the face and arched one black eyebrow. \u201cAnd if I did?\u201d</p><p>And he felt something within his chest leap that she dared to pick up his gauntlet\u2014something like joy. He grinned at her. \u201cThen, my lady, we have a point of mutual interest that bears further discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d She sat back against her plush red cushions. \u201cWhat were you doing out on the streets this late at night?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, smiling slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me.\u201d The carriage was slowing now.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He glanced at the window. They were outside her town house. It blazed in the night with lit lanterns. He looked back at her. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t with a woman; I give you my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you presume too much, Mr. Hartley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A footman opened the carriage door. Sam stepped down and then turned to offer her his hand. She hesitated a moment, as if considering whether to let him help her or not. She was surrounded by the dark interior of the carriage, her pale face and bosom glowing as if lit by a fire from within. She placed her small gloved hand in his. He tightened his fingers over hers as he drew her into the light by the walk.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and tugged at her hand.</p><p>He stared down at her dark eyes, aware that he didn\u2019t want to let her go. But in the end, he opened his hand and let hers slip away. There was no other choice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He bowed. \u201cGood night, my lady.\u201d</p><p>And he walked away into the darkness.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The wizard winked once, and Iron Heart found himself within the castle\u2019s walls. He was dressed as the king\u2019s own guard, and there, not two paces away, sat the king himself on his golden throne! Well, you can imagine how surprised he was. He opened his mouth to exclaim when he remembered the wizard\u2019s words. He must not speak, else he would return to rags and the princess would die. So Iron Heart shut his mouth and vowed not to let a sound pass his lips. His vow was soon tested, for what should happen next but seven burly knaves rushed into the throne room, bent on killing the king. Iron Heart leapt forward into battle, swinging his sword left and right. The other guards shouted, but by the time they drew their swords, all seven assassins lay dead on the floor....</p> <p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>\u201cSamuel Hartley is the most irritating man,\u201d Emeline said late the next morning.</p><p>She was in the little sitting room with Melisande Fleming. This room was one of her favorites; the walls were papered in yellow and white stripes with a thin scarlet line that occasionally repeated. The furnishings were not as new as the ones in her formal sitting room, but they were done in lush reds and oranges in lovely damasks and velvets. One felt just like a cat in the room, as if it would be easy to stretch out on the rich fabrics and purr. Not, of course, that she would do anything so uninhibited, but still, the feeling was there. In actual fact, she and Melisande sat quite properly by the windows. Or rather, Melisande sat and Emeline paced as her friend calmly drank tea.</p><p>\u201cIrritating,\u201d Emeline muttered, and straightened a tasseled pillow on the settee.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said before,\u201d Melisande replied. \u201cFour times since I arrived.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave I?\u201d Emeline asked vaguely. \u201cWell, but it\u2019s true. He doesn\u2019t seem to have the first idea of social manners\u2014he danced a jig in this very house just the other day\u2014he always has a bit of a smile on his face, and his boots have no heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorrors,\u201d Melisande murmured.</p><p>Emeline shot Melisande, who had been her very good friend since nearly the beginning of time, an exasperated look. She sat as she always did, as if she strove to occupy as little space as humanly possible. Her back was straight and prim, her arms almost clapped to her sides, her hands folded in her lap\u2014when she wasn\u2019t drinking tea\u2014and her feet placed neatly side by side on the carpet. She probably never felt an urge to lounge in the pillows piled up on the flame settee. Also\u2014and this was something of a point of contention between the friends\u2014Melisande always wore brown. Sometimes, it was true, she strayed from brown and was seen in gray, but that could hardly be called an improvement, could it? Today, for instance, she was in an impeccably cut sack dress that was an awful shade of dirt brown.</p><p>\u201cWhy ever did you have that gown made in that fabric?\u201d Emeline asked.</p><p>Another lady might look down at herself. Melisande picked up the teapot and calmly poured herself more tea. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t show dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s the same color as dust.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>Emeline stared at her friend critically. \u201cWith your fine, blond hair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dust-colored, too,\u201d Melisande murmured wryly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just that you have very subtle coloring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDust-colored hair, dust-colored eyes, dust-colored complexion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour complexion is not dust-colored,\u201d Emeline said sternly, then winced when she realized her gaffe. She hadn\u2019t meant to imply that the rest of her friend was dust-colored.</p><p>Melisande shot her an ironic look.</p><p>\u201cIf you would just wear more vibrant colors,\u201d Emeline said hastily. \u201cA lovely dark plum, for instance. Or crimson. I long to see you in crimson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you shall have to pine away,\u201d her friend said. \u201cYou were telling me about your new neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite irritating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have mentioned that before.\u201d</p><p>Emeline ignored that. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what he does at night.\u201d</p><p>Melisande looked at her. One eyebrow rose almost imperceptibly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Emeline fluffed a pillow rather overhard.</p><p>\u201cI am relieved,\u201d Melisande replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m wondering what Lord Vale thinks of this colonial.\u201d</p><p>Emeline stared. \u201cJasper has nothing whatsoever to do with Mr. Hartley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Would he approve of your association with the man?\u201d</p><p>Emeline wrinkled her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss Jasper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must say, I\u2019m outraged on Lord Vale\u2019s behalf,\u201d Melisande said without heat as she plunked a spoonful of sugar into her tea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Jasper would be flattered if he only knew.\u201d Emeline sat on the edge of a beautiful gold velvet chair. Her mind immediately reverted to her original theme. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I ran across Mr. Hartley last night quite late. I was coming home from Emily Turner\u2019s soiree\u2014you were right; I never should have gone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ve just said so.\u201d Emeline bounced a little in her chair. Melisande could be so didactic sometimes. \u201cAnyway, there he was, skulking in a quite suspicious manner in a dark alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he makes his living as a footpad,\u201d Melisande said. She was examining the tray of sweets that the maid had left them.</p><p>Emeline frowned. It was very hard sometimes to tell when her friend was jesting and when she was not. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow reassuring,\u201d Melisande said, and chose a tiny pale yellow cake.</p><p>\u201cAlthough he does seem to move very quietly,\u201d Emeline mused, \u201cwhich I would think would be most helpful if one was a footpad.\u201d</p><p>Melisande had popped the cake into her mouth, and she merely raised her eyebrows now.</p><p>\u201cBut no. No.\u201d Emeline shook her head decisively. \u201cMr. Hartley isn\u2019t a footpad. So that leaves the question, What was he doing walking about so late?\u201d</p><p>Melisande swallowed. \u201cThe most obvious answer is an assignation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Emeline didn\u2019t know why her friend\u2019s suggestion so nettled her. It was, as she said, obvious. Emeline took a steadying breath. \u201cI asked and he said most explicitly that he had not been to see a lady.\u201d</p><p>Melisande coughed dryly. \u201cYou asked a gentleman if he was returning from a tryst with a female.\u201d</p><p>Emeline blushed. \u201cYou always make things sound so awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely repeated your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that at all. I made an inquiry; he replied most properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, dearest, don\u2019t you see that he would deny an assignation to you in any case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t lie to me.\u201d Emeline knew she spoke too vehemently. Her face and neck were hot. \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Melisande looked at her with eyes that were suddenly weary. This was a sore point for her friend. Melisande was nearly eight and twenty and had never married, despite having a very respectable dowry. She\u2019d been engaged once, nearly ten years ago, to a young aristocrat whom Emeline had never really liked. And her dislike had proven well founded. The cad had thrown Melisande over for a dashing titled widow, leaving Melisande with an unnaturally cynical view of gentlemen in general.</p><p>Yet, despite her own views, Melisande merely nodded now at Emeline\u2019s rather silly assertion that a gentleman she hardly knew would tell her the truth about so private a matter.</p><p>Emeline smiled in gratitude. Brown or not, Melisande was the dearest friend imaginable.</p><p>\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t returning from an assignation,\u201d Melisande said thoughtfully, \u201cthen perhaps he\u2019d been to a gaming hell. Did you ask him where he\u2019d been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t tell me, but I really don\u2019t think it was anything as prosaic as a gaming hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Melisande stared out the window. The little sitting room was at the back of Emeline\u2019s town house and overlooked the garden. \u201cWhat does your aunt think of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Tante.\u201d Emeline wrinkled her nose. \u201cShe is worried that his sister might not wear shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she wear shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a relief,\u201d Melisande murmured. \u201cTell me, is your Mr. Hartley a tall gentleman with lovely brown hair, unpowdered and clubbed back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Emeline stood and moved to the window. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I believe he is doing something gentlemanly in his back garden.\u201d Melisande nodded out the window.</p><p>Emeline looked and felt an odd little nervous jolt when she saw Mr. Hartley\u2019s form just over the wall that divided the gardens. He was handling a very long gun.</p><p>At that moment, a small form catapulted down her own garden path, followed more slowly by a thin little man. Daniel had come out for his morning walk.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he is about with that great gun?\u201d Melisande asked idly.</p><p>Mr. Hartley had put down his gun again and now seemed to be peering into the barrel\u2014a position that appeared inherently dangerous.</p><p>\u201cLord knows,\u201d Emeline muttered. She had a great desire to abandon her very good friend and find some pretext to go into her garden. Wigeon! \u201cSomething masculine, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. And Daniel out there so near to him.\u201d Melisande looked at her over a cup of tea, her eyes amused. \u201cA concerned mama might very well go out to see what her neighbor was doing.\u201d</p><p>SAM WAS AWARE of the boy well before he actually saw him. The brick wall between the gardens was six feet tall, but the sounds of a boy could easily be heard\u2014a skipping run in dry leaves, a panting cry to \u201ccome see!\u201d and finally the scrabbling of boots on tree bark as the lad scrambled up a tree. There was a relative silence then, broken only by the sound of heavy breathing as the boy watched him.</p><p>Sam sat on a marble bench beneath the wall, his Kentucky rifle laid across his knees. He took a long piece of wire from his pocket and threaded it through the touchhole, working it back and forth to scrape out any corrosion. Then he blew into the tiny hole and sighted down the barrel.</p><p>The boy broke. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleaning my gun.\u201d Sam didn\u2019t look up. Sometimes an animal was braver when it didn\u2019t think the tracker was interested.</p><p>\u201cI have a gun.\u201d There was the sound of rustling leaves as the boy shifted.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelonged to my uncle Reynaud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Sam got up and stood the gun on its butt. He slid the ramrod out from under the barrel.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019man says I can\u2019t touch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help you clean your gun?\u201d</p><p>Sam paused at that and squinted up at the boy. Daniel lay on a branch two feet over his head, arms and legs dangling. He had a scratch on one cheek and a streak of dirt on his white shirt. His blond hair hung over his forehead, his blue eyes sparkling with excitement.</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cWould your mother mind if I let you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d the boy said instantly. He began inching out on the limb, closer into Sam\u2019s yard.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, there.\u201d Sam set aside his rifle and went to stand underneath the boy in case he fell. \u201cWhat about your tutor?\u201d</p><p>Daniel craned his neck, looking back into his own garden. \u201cHe\u2019s sitting on the bench under the rose arbor. He always falls asleep there when we take our walk.\u201d He inched forward again.</p><p>\u201cHold it there,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>The boy froze, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cThe branch won\u2019t bear your weight if you go much farther out. Swing your legs down and I\u2019ll help you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daniel grinned in relief and let both legs dangle off one side of the branch, holding on by his arms. Sam caught the boy by the waist and lowered him to the ground.</p><p>Immediately, Daniel ran to the gun. Sam watched carefully, but the boy didn\u2019t touch the weapon; he merely examined it.</p><p>Daniel whistled through his teeth. \u201c\u2019Pon my word, that\u2019s the longest gun I ever did see.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled and hunkered down next to the boy. \u201cIt\u2019s a Kentucky rifle. Settlers use it on the frontiers of Pennsylvania in the Colonies.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel glanced sideways at Sam. \u201cWhy\u2019s it so long? Don\u2019t that make it hard to carry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. It\u2019s not that heavy.\u201d Sam picked up the gun and sighted down the barrel again. \u201cAim\u2019s better. Shot\u2019s better. Here, take a look.\u201d</p><p>Daniel eagerly stood beside him as Sam held the gun. \u201cZounds!\u201d the boy whispered. He squinted down the barrel, one eye shut, breathing through his mouth. \u201cCan I shoot it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Sam replied. He lowered the gun. \u201cHop on the bench and you can help me.\u201d</p><p>The boy scrambled to stand on the bench.</p> <p>\u201cTake this.\u201d Sam handed him a thick rag. \u201cNow hold the gun steady and don\u2019t drop it. The water\u2019s hot. Ready?\u201d</p><p>The boy grasped the barrel of the rifle in both hands, the rag underneath to keep his hands from burning. His brow creased with concentration. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>Sam picked up a steaming kettle of water from the ground and carefully poured a thin stream of boiling water down the barrel. Dirty black water bubbled out of the touchhole.</p><p>\u201cZounds,\u201d Daniel breathed.</p><p>Sam glanced at him and smiled. \u201cHold it there a minute.\u201d He set down the kettle and picked up the ramrod, wrapping a bit of rag around the end. He inserted the ramrod into the barrel and shoved it halfway down. \u201cWant to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoo! Would I?\u201d The boy grinned at him, and Sam saw that although his coloring must come from his father, his smile was all his mother\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cThen go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Sam held the barrel while the boy worked the ramrod.</p><p>\u201cGood. Push it up and down. We need to get every bit of powder out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The boy frowned as he labored to shove the ramrod.</p><p>\u201cA dirty gun isn\u2019t safe.\u201d Sam watched, but Daniel was doing a good job. \u201cMight not fire. Might misfire and take the shooter\u2019s nose off. A man should always keep his gun clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d the boy grunted. \u201cWhat do you hunt with it? Eagles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s too big for birds, even one as large as an eagle. The woodsmen hunt game\u2014deer, mostly\u2014but it comes in handy if a man comes across a bear or a catamount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever come across a catamount?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly once. I walked around a bend in a trail and there stood one, big as you please, in the middle of my path.\u201d</p><p>Daniel stopped his ramming motion. \u201cWhat did you do? Shoot it?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t have the chance. That big cat took one look at me and ran the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Daniel seemed a little disappointed at his answer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Sam said, indicating the rifle. \u201cNow let\u2019s pour in more water.\u201d</p><p>Daniel nodded, eyes intent and serious on the gun.</p><p>Sam withdrew the ramrod with the rag, now black, and picked up the kettle of water again. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>This time the water bubbled out gray.</p><p>\u201cHow many times must we do the water?\u201d Daniel asked.</p><p>\u201cUntil it runs clear.\u201d Sam handed the boy the ramrod with a new rag on the end. \u201cRemember to always use boiling water, too, so that the barrel dries well and doesn\u2019t rust.\u201d</p><p>Daniel nodded as he drove the ramrod into the barrel of the gun.</p><p>Sam nearly smiled. What for him was an easy chore took quite a bit of effort on the boy\u2019s part, but Daniel never complained. He simply put his back into working the ramrod up and down. Sam became aware of a rustling over the wall. The scent of lemon balm drifted in the air. He didn\u2019t look up, but his entire body was suddenly on the alert, anticipating when the woman would make herself known.</p><p>\u201cHow much more?\u201d Daniel asked.</p><p>\u201cThat should do it.\u201d Sam helped him withdraw the ramrod.</p><p>Daniel watched him handle the metal rod. \u201cDid you fight in a war?\u201d</p><p>Sam hesitated for a moment and then continued unwrapping the dirty rag from the ramrod. \u201cYes. I fought the French in the Colonies. Ready?\u201d</p><p>The boy nodded. \u201cMy uncle Reynaud fought in that war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sam was silent as he poured the steaming water into the barrel.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill anyone in the war?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked at the boy. He was watching the water stream from the touchhole. The question had probably been an idle one. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe water\u2019s clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Sam wrapped a dry rag around the ramrod and gave it to Daniel.</p><p>Daniel started working the ramrod. \u201cDid you shoot them with this gun?\u201d</p><p>The rustling on the other side of the wall had long since stopped. She might\u2019ve wandered away again, but Sam didn\u2019t think so. He had the feeling that Lady Emeline waited, breathless, just out of sight, for his answer.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYes. At the battle of Quebec, when we seized the city. A French soldier ran at me. He had his bayonet fixed to the end of his rifle. It was already stained with blood.\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s little body froze. He looked at Sam.</p><p>Sam held his gaze. \u201cSo I shot him dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d the boy whispered.</p><p>\u201cTake the ramrod out and we\u2019ll oil the barrel.\u201d</p><p>Lady Emeline\u2019s voice floated from over the wall. \u201cDaniel.\u201d</p><p>Sam took care not to spill the oil he was pouring on a clean rag. What did she think of his tale? It wasn\u2019t filled with the glory so many expected in stories told about war. Then, too, she must\u2019ve heard the rumors about him. Did she think him a coward because of Spinner\u2019s Falls?</p><p>Daniel twisted around. \u201cM\u2019man, come look! Mr. Hartley has the longest gun in the world, and I\u2019m helping him to clean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d Lady Emeline\u2019s head appeared at the top of the wall. She must have been standing on a bench on the other side. Her eyes didn\u2019t meet his.</p><p>Sam wiped his fingers carefully on a clean rag. \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d Perhaps he\u2019d disgusted her.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t see how I am to examine this wonderful gun. There is no gate in the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClimb over,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Lady Emeline looked first at her son and then the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you allow me?\u201d Sam asked Daniel\u2019s permission gravely.</p><p>The boy nodded.</p><p>He turned back to Lady Emeline who was now eyeing him with an inscrutable expression. \u201cCan you climb higher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d She glanced down at her side of the wall and then climbed on something so that now she was visible from the waist up.</p><p>Sam raised his eyebrows and stepped onto the bench on his side. He looked over the wall. Lady Emeline stood quite primly on a tree branch. He suppressed a grin and reached for her. Her eyes widened as he placed his hands about her waist, and he felt his own breath catch. \u201cIf I may?\u201d</p><p>She nodded jerkily.</p><p>He lifted her over the wall. The old wound in his side ached as his muscles pulled under her weight, but he didn\u2019t let his discomfort show on his face. He brought her down slowly, letting her slide a little against his chest. He was taking advantage of the situation, but he enjoyed her warmth and the scent of lemon balm, anyway. Her gaze met his as he held her for a fraction of a second with her face level with his own. Her black eyes were heavy-lidded, her color heightened. He was conscious of her quickened breath against his lips. Then he set her down.</p><p>She bent her head as she fussed with her skirts. \u201cThank you, Mr. Hartley.\u201d Her voice was husky.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>It was a good thing he\u2019d kept his face straight, because she glanced at him sharply. She flushed a deeper pink and bit her lip. He watched her, wondering what it would be like to feel those sharp little teeth on his bare skin. She was an ornery creature. He\u2019d wager she\u2019d like to bite.</p><p>\u201cCome see, M\u2019man,\u201d Daniel repeated impatiently.</p><p>Lady Emeline walked over to the gun and eyed it. \u201cVery nice, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to help us oil it?\u201d Sam asked innocently.</p><p>She shot him a warning look. \u201cI think I\u2019ll simply observe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Sam took the oily rag and wrapped it about the ramrod. \u201cShove it down the barrel good, Danny. Every inch must be oiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Daniel took the ramrod and did as instructed, his brows knit seriously.</p><p>Sam wet another rag with the oil and began rubbing it over the outside of the barrel. \u201cMy sister says that you\u2019ll accompany us to a ball tomorrow evening, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her nod. \u201cThe Westerton soiree. Quite a grand event, usually. It took a bit of work to get an invitation for the two of you. Luckily, you\u2019re something of a novelty, Mr. Hartley. Quite a few hostesses have indicated their interest on that basis alone.\u201d</p><p>Sam ignored that. \u201cWill Rebecca be ready for this ball in your estimation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She leaned closer, apparently peering down the barrel. Daniel still worked the ramrod. \u201cBut a smaller event would certainly be easier for her first introduction to London society.\u201d</p><p>Sam was silent. He concentrated on the brass cheekplate on the butt of the rifle and tried to ignore the guilt worming in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cRebecca mentioned that you were the one to insist on that particular ball.\u201d Her deep pink skirts brushed his knee. \u201cI wonder why?\u201d</p><p>EMELINE WATCHED MR. Hartley\u2019s back stiffen. He knelt at her feet, head bent down as he gently stroked a cloth over his extraordinary gun. It was a long weapon but oddly light-looking, the barrel very narrow. The wood was a beautiful pale burl, the grain swirling all along the stock. She pursed her lips. Only a man would make a weapon so lovely. On the base was a brass plate, cut out in curls and polished to a high gleam. Mr. Hartley\u2019s hands were large and brown against the white cloth, but they moved with a gentle, almost loving rhythm.</p><p>She looked away. The feeling of irritation\u2014an almost physical itching on her skin\u2014had started the moment she\u2019d heard his voice. And the irritation had only intensified when she\u2019d watched him over the wall. He\u2019d taken off his coat and waistcoat\u2014very improperly, even in the privacy of his own garden. Gentlemen never, never took off an article of clothing, except in the most extreme of circumstances. Emeline refused to believe that the rules could be any different even in the wilds of America.</p><p>So now he worked in only his shirt. The crisp, starched linen was stark white against his tan. He\u2019d rolled up the sleeves, revealing the dark hairs on his forearms, and even though Emeline knew she was being ridiculously sensitive, she was terribly aware of those bare forearms. She longed to touch his arm, run her finger along the lean muscle there and feel the brush of those dark hairs.</p><p>Damn him!</p><p>\u201cWas there a particular reason you chose the Westerton soiree?\u201d she asked now in a voice that was shrewish, even to her own ears.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He still didn\u2019t look up. His queue swung over his shoulder as he shifted to rub a different part of the gun. That, too, was annoying. The sunlight showed lighter streaks of brown in his dark hair.</p><p>Emeline narrowed her eyes at him. He gave no outward sign, but she knew he was lying to her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Mr. Hartley said, and for a moment she thought he spoke to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Daniel straightened and grinned. \u201cIs it clean now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell and truly clean.\u201d The colonial stood, rising so close to her that they nearly touched.</p><p>Emeline checked an impulse to step back. He was so tall. It was really quite rude of him to tower over her in such a manner.</p><p>\u201cNow may I try it?\u201d Daniel asked.</p> <p>She opened her mouth to give a resounding No!, but Mr. Hartley spoke first. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the place to shoot a gun. Think of all the things\u2014and people\u2014we might accidentally hit.\u201d</p><p>Her son\u2019s lower lip puckered out in a pout. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel,\u201d Emeline said in warning, \u201cyou mustn\u2019t badger Mr. Hartley when he has been so kind as to let you help him with his gun.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley frowned as if she\u2019d said something wrong. \u201cI was very pleased to have Danny\u2019s help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Daniel.\u201d The words were out before she could check them. Her tone was too sharp.</p> <p>He stared at her, his mouth thinning.</p><p>She glared back, thrusting out her chin.</p><p>He said slowly, \u201cDaniel worked well today. He isn\u2019t bothering me.\u201d</p><p>Her son beamed as if he\u2019d been given the most extravagant praise. She should be grateful that Mr. Hartley was so kind, that he knew exactly what to say to a small boy. Instead, she was vaguely peeved.</p><p>Mr. Hartley smiled back at Daniel and then bent to pick up the cloths and oil. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably be busy tomorrow morning, preparing for the ball.\u201d</p><p>Emeline blinked at the abrupt change of subject. \u201cWhy, no. There are many preparations if one is throwing a ball, but as we are simply attending\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He glanced up, his brown eyes laughing, and Emeline suddenly realized she\u2019d walked straight into a trap. \u201cThen you\u2019ll be able to accompany me to view Mr. Wedgwood\u2019s pottery. I should like a feminine perspective on what to order.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to say something that she\u2019d no doubt regret later but was saved by the voice of Mr. Smythe-Jones.</p><p>\u201cMy lord? Lord Eddings?\u201d</p><p>Daniel hunched his shoulders and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t tell him I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Emeline frowned. \u201cNonsense. Go to your tutor at once, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest to do as your mother says,\u201d Mr. Hartley said quietly.</p><p>And miraculously, her son shut his mouth. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d He went to the wall and called over, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>They heard the thin voice of the tutor. \u201cWhatever are you doing over there? Come down at once, Lord Eddings!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley leapt onto the marble bench that sat against the wall. For such a big man, he moved lithely. \u201cDanny was visiting me, Mr. Smythe-Jones. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Startled murmuring came from over the wall.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Danny.\u201d Mr. Hartley made a step with his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a leg up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Daniel stepped into the big hands and Mr. Hartley gently lifted him up. The boy scrambled to the top of the wall and then onto the big crab-apple branch that lay just over it. In a moment he was gone.</p><p>Emeline looked at the toes of her shoes as she listened to the tutor remonstrating with her son, his voice fading as they walked back to the house. She twisted a bit of ribbon on her overskirt. Then she looked up.</p><p>Mr. Hartley was watching her from atop the bench. He jumped lightly to the ground, landing just a little too close to her, his coffee-brown eyes intent. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to call your son Danny?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cHis name is Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Danny is the nickname for Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a baron. He will sit in the House of Lords one day.\u201d The ribbon was digging into the soft pads of her fingers. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need a nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed it, no.\u201d He stepped even closer to her so that she was forced to look up in order to continue meeting his eyes. \u201cBut what harm does a nickname do a little boy?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled, realizing as she did so that she could smell him, a combination of gunpowder, starch, and gun oil. The scent should have been repulsive, but she found it strangely intimate instead. And the intimacy was arousing. How awful.</p><p>\u201cIt was his father\u2019s name,\u201d she blurted. The ribbon broke.</p><p>He stilled, his big body poised as if to pounce. \u201cYour husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt reminds you of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d She waved the suggestion away. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He began a slow prowl around her. \u201cYou miss him, your husband.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, fighting down the urge to twist and face him. \u201cHe was my husband for six years. It would be very odd if I didn\u2019t miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, it doesn\u2019t follow that you would miss him.\u201d He had meandered behind her and now spoke over her shoulder. She imagined that she could feel his breath against the spot behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is not a consideration in a fashionable marriage.\u201d She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cNo? Then you do not miss him.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and remembered laughing blue eyes that had teased. Soft, pale hands that had been unbearably gentle. A tenor voice that had talked and talked about dogs and horses and phaetons. Then she remembered that pale face, unnaturally drawn, all the laughter gone, lying against black satin in a casket. She didn\u2019t want those memories. They were too painful.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She turned blindly to the house and a way out of this too-close garden and the man who stalked her. \u201cNo, I do not miss my husband.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Well! The king was very grateful to the guard who had saved his life single-handedly. All hailed Iron Heart as a hero, and he was immediately made the captain of the king\u2019s guard. But though everyone asked the valiant captain his name, he would not say a word. This stubborn refusal to speak rather vexed the king, who was a man used to having his own way in such matters. However, even that little worry was put aside when one day the king was out riding and a terrible troll decided to make the king his lunch. Clang! Thump! Iron Heart charged forward and soon separated the troll\u2019s head from his body....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>Emeline awoke to the curtains being pulled back on her bed. She blinked sleepily up into the face of Harris, her lady\u2019s maid. Harris was a wooden-faced woman of at least five decades with a large, bulbous nose that dominated the rest of her more-petite features. Emeline knew of many ladies who complained that their personal maids spent too much time gossiping and flirting with the menservants in the household.</p><p>Such was not the case with Harris.</p><p>\u201cThere is a Mr. Hartley waiting in the downstairs hall for you, my lady,\u201d Harris said stonily.</p><p>Emeline glanced blearily at her bedroom window. The light seemed quite pale. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says that he has an appointment with you, and he will not leave until he sees you.\u201d</p><p>She sat up. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>Harris pursed her lips. \u201cA quarter of eight, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord. Whatever is he about?\u201d Emeline threw back the covers and searched for her slippers. \u201cHe must be mad. No one comes calling at eight o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d Harris bent to help her with her slippers.</p><p>\u201cNot even nine o\u2019clock,\u201d Emeline muttered, thrusting her arms into the wrapper Harris held for her. \u201cReally, anything before eleven is suspect, and I myself would never bother before two o\u2019clock. Quite, quite mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Emeline became conscious now of tuneless whistling. \u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Hartley is whistling in the downstairs hall, my lady,\u201d Harris said.</p><p>For a moment, Emeline stared at her maid, speechless. The whistling crested on a particularly horrific note. Emeline rushed from her room and out into the upper hall. She marched down the hall and to the banister that overlooked the downstairs entry. Mr. Hartley was standing with his hands behind his back, holding his tricorne. As she watched, he idly rocked back on his heels and whistled through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cHist!\u201d Emeline leaned over the banister.</p><p>Mr. Hartley whirled and looked up at her. \u201cGood morning, my lady!\u201d He gave a little bow. The man looked fresh and alarmingly alert for so early in the morning.</p><p>\u201cHave you gone stark, raving mad?\u201d Emeline demanded. \u201cWhat are you doing in my hall this early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to take you to Wedgwood\u2019s business offices to help me order pottery.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cI never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to dress.\u201d His gaze wandered to her chest. \u201cNot that I mind your present attire.\u201d</p><p>Emeline slapped a hand to her bosom. \u201cHow dare\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here, shall I?\u201d And he began that awful whistling again, this time even louder.</p><p>Emeline opened her mouth, realized that he wouldn\u2019t be able to hear anything over the noise coming out between his lips, and shut it again. She gathered her skirts and stomped back to her room. Harris had already laid out a flame-colored watered silk, and Emeline was clothed and coiffed in scandalously little time. Even so, Mr. Hartley was peering at the hall clock when she descended the stairs.</p><p>He glanced at her rather perfunctorily. \u201cTook you long enough. Come on, I don\u2019t want to be late to see Mr. Bentley\u2014Mr. Wedgwood\u2019s partner.\u201d</p><p>Emeline frowned as he hustled her out the door. \u201cWhen is your appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine o\u2019clock.\u201d Mr. Hartley handed her into the waiting carriage.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him when he sat across from her. \u201cBut you came for me before eight o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it might take you a while to get ready.\u201d He smiled at her, his coffee-brown eyes crinkling at the corners. \u201cAnd I was right, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d He rapped on the roof.</p><p>\u201cYou take too much for granted,\u201d Emeline said frostily.</p><p>\u201cOnly with you, ma\u2019am. Only with you.\u201d His voice was low and soft and disconcertingly intimate.</p><p>Emeline glanced out the window so she wouldn\u2019t have to meet his eyes. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>There was a silence and for a moment she thought he might avoid the question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you affect me like this,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI think you\u2019d as well ask a catamount why it runs after a fleeing deer as ask me why I quicken when you\u2019re near.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze jerked around to his. He watched her with a purely male gaze, frank and assessing. It should\u2019ve made her afraid, being the subject of such a perusal. Instead it thrilled her. \u201cThen you admit it.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s purely instinctive, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>She twitched at a ribbon on the front of her gown. \u201cYou must be quite at a loss if your instincts cause you this problem whenever you\u2019re near a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you, remember?\u201d He leaned forward and wrapped his hand around her fingers, stilling her agitated teasing of the ribbon. \u201cThis happens only with you.\u201d</p><p>Emeline looked down at their fingers. She should snap at him. Set him down properly and let him know that he\u2019d gone too far with his familiarity. But the sight of his brown fingers wrapped around and cradling her own smaller, white ones was mesmerizing somehow. The carriage bumped around a curve, and he withdrew his hand.</p><p>She smoothed out the ribbon. \u201cHaven\u2019t you a man of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Kitcher. But he\u2019s a rather dry old man. I thought you\u2019d be better company.\u201d</p><p>She snorted softly at that. \u201cWhere are these offices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve rented part of a warehouse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hands were trembling, and she clasped them together in her lap. \u201cMr. Wedgwood and Mr. Bentley haven\u2019t showrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re relatively new to the trade. Part of the reason I hope to get a bargain from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Emeline looked at him curiously. Mr. Hartley\u2019s eyes were narrowed and alert as if he were readying for battle. \u201cYou like this.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>She waved a hand vaguely. \u201cTrade. Doing business. The hunt of finding a good bargain.\u201d</p><p>His sensuous lips curved. \u201cOf course. But I trust you won\u2019t give me away to Bentley.\u201d</p><p>Then the carriage was drawing up next to a warehouse. Mr. Hartley jumped down as soon as the steps were set and turned to help Emeline.</p><p>She looked at the plain brick and wood building doubtfully. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimply give me your opinion.\u201d He tucked her hand into his elbow as a gentleman in curled wig and rust-colored coat came out of one of the warehouse\u2019s doors.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Hartley?\u201d the man exclaimed in a Northern accent. \u201cAn honor, sir, an honor to meet your acquaintance. I am Thomas Bentley.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley took Mr. Bentley\u2019s hand and shook it. This close, Emeline could see that Mr. Bentley was younger than she had thought\u2014probably not much above thirty years. His face was florid and his middle just a little stout. Mr. Hartley introduced her, and the pottery merchant\u2019s eyes widened when he heard her title.</p><p>\u201cLady Emeline. Why, this is an honor, ma\u2019am; it is indeed. Won\u2019t you take a dish of tea? I\u2019ve just purchased some from India that\u2019s quite nice.\u201d</p><p>Emeline smiled at the man, murmuring her assent, and Mr. Bentley showed them into the warehouse. The building soared overhead, dark and cool. She could smell sawdust and damp bricks. Half the space was packed with barrels and crates, but Mr. Bentley led them into a smaller office off the main room. The office was just large enough for a wide desk, some chairs, and a stack of boxes against the wall. In one corner was a small hearth with a kettle already steaming.</p><p>\u201cHere we are, then,\u201d he said cheerfully as he held a chair for Emeline. \u201cI\u2019ll just get the tea, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Mr. Wedgwood be joining us?\u201d Mr. Hartley asked. He had chosen to remain standing.</p> <p>\u201cAh, no,\u201d Mr. Bentley said as he squinted over the pot of tea. \u201cMr. Wedgwood is the master potter, whilst I am the businessman. He is presently overseeing the making of the pottery in Burslem. There we are.\u201d Mr. Bentley said this last as he set the tea on the desk. He\u2019d had to stack several ledger books on the floor to make room. The man blinked nervously at Mr. Hartley.</p><p>But the American merely nodded and raised a brow at her. Emeline sat forward to pour the tea. She wasn\u2019t sure, exactly, of the undercurrents of this meeting, and she didn\u2019t want to upset Mr. Hartley\u2019s position. At the same time, she was intrigued by how he would act in this, his own world. Right now he seemed very still, his expression relaxed but giving nothing away. Mr. Bentley, in contrast, was beginning to look worried. Emeline hid a smile as she sipped her tea. She had the feeling that Mr. Hartley was deliberately making his opponent unsure of his position.</p><p>For the next several minutes, the two gentlemen and Emeline took tea and made small talk. She knew that Mr. Hartley must be impatient to see the pottery he wanted to buy, but he didn\u2019t let his impatience show on his face. He leaned on a corner of the desk and sipped his tea as pleasantly as if he were visiting a maiden aunt.</p><p>Mr. Bentley shot him several worried looks and then finally put down his teacup. \u201cWould you like to see some of our pottery, sir?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hartley nodded and set aside his own teacup. The pottery merchant went to one of the wooden boxes against the wall and opened the lid, revealing a mass of straw.</p><p>Emeline couldn\u2019t help but lean forward. She\u2019d never before thought much about the plates she used\u2014save that they be of the newest design\u2014but now pottery seemed a most important affair. Mr. Hartley shot a glance at her behind Mr. Bentley\u2019s back. He almost imperceptably shook his head once. Emeline wrinkled her nose at him, feeling as if she\u2019d been reproved like a small child. However, she sat back and smoothed her features into an expression of ennui. Mr. Hartley\u2019s mouth twitched as if he found her enthusiasm amusing, and he winked at her. Emeline tilted her nose away from him. She\u2019d have to set the man down. Later.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Bentley had carefully removed a layer of straw. Underneath was a lidded jar in the shape of a pineapple with a dark green glaze. Mr. Bentley handed the jar to Mr. Hartley, who took it and examined it without speaking. He brought the jar over and stood it on the desk in front of Emeline, watching as she bent to examine it.</p><p>Mr. Bentley was unearthing more pottery, teapots, dishes, cups, bowls, and tureens. Indeed, all manner of pottery soon filled the desk, most glazed a deep green and many in the shapes of cauliflowers or pineapples.</p> <p>Mr. Hartley cocked an eyebrow at Emeline while Mr. Bentley\u2019s back was turned. She elevated her own eyebrows in return. The fact was that the pottery was all very nice and well made, but nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>Mr. Hartley gave a slight nod and turned to the other man. \u201cI believe that Mr. Wedgwood has some newer pieces?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bentley paused, still bent over the crate. \u201cAh, I\u2019m not sure....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told that he is working on some very fine creamware.\u201d Mr. Hartley met the pottery merchant\u2019s eyes and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, as to that...\u201d Mr. Bentley darted a look at a small crate by itself in the corner of the office. He cleared his throat. \u201cMr. Wedgwood is indeed experimenting with a creamware, but he is not yet ready to show it publicly. He hopes, in fact, to present it to the queen first.\u201d</p><p>Emeline clapped her hands. \u201cReally, Mr. Bentley, how exciting!\u201d</p><p>The merchant\u2019s face became even ruddier. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am. It is indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t you let us see this wonderful pottery?\u201d Emeline leaned a little forward, letting her bosom swell over her square-cut bodice. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>The man turned red, and Emeline nearly grinned. She would never admit it in a million years, but she was enjoying this whole exchange enormously. Who knew trade could be such a battle of wits?</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Mr. Bentley took out a handkerchief and swiped it nervously over his glistening brow. He shrugged. \u201cWhy not? If it pleases you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it does.\u201d</p><p>Having made up his mind, the merchant went to the small box in the corner and pried off the lid. He reached inside and took out something with great care before turning with it in his hands. Emeline held her breath. The teapot was very plain. As its name proclaimed, it was a rich cream color, almost yellowish, with straight classical lines and a pretty little spout.</p><p>Emeline held out her hands. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>The merchant placed it in her hands, and Emeline felt the lightness of the piece; the clay was thinner than she was used to. She turned it over to look at the maker\u2019s mark. Wedgwood was stamped on the bottom.</p><p>\u201cThis is quite elegant,\u201d she murmured softly.</p><p>She looked up in time to see Mr. Hartley watching her, and her breath caught. His eyes were hooded, his lips straight, but he had a possessive air about him. Somehow she knew: It pleased him that she shared in the discovery of the creamware teapot. Just as much as it pleased her. She and Mr. Hartley made an extraordinarily well-matched team. The thought made her uneasy. She shouldn\u2019t enjoy bargaining. She shouldn\u2019t like knowing that he valued her opinion.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t care at all.</p><p>Mr. Hartley\u2019s eyes had narrowed. There was no pity there. Not one trace of compassion. It was as if a tame tomcat suddenly showed the catamount that lurked always beneath the purring facade. As if she was his prey.</p><p>He nodded once and turned to discuss terms with Mr. Bentley. The civilized veneer was back in place, but Mr. Bentley was having to marshal all his wits to keep up with the American\u2019s hard bargaining, and the sums of money that Mr. Hartley so casually mentioned were enough to raise even Emeline\u2019s eyebrows. She had no doubt that this was the man who had made a fortune out of his uncle\u2019s business in only four years.</p><p>As the men haggled, Emeline bent over the teapot, tracing its elegant lines, and thought about the ladies of the Colonies who would pour tea from the pretty little spout. And she wondered: Why exactly had Mr. Hartley brought her here?</p><p>What had he meant to show her besides a beautiful teapot?</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S JUST THAT I\u2019m not sure about the neckline.\u201d Rebecca stared into the mirror and tried without success to tug up the material at her bodice. There seemed to be a vast amount of her own skin revealed in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right, miss.\u201d Her maid, Evans, didn\u2019t even glance up as she bustled about the room, collecting the debris from Rebecca\u2019s toilet.</p><p>Rebecca tugged one more time at her bodice and then gave up. Evans had been personally recommended by Lady Emeline, and if the maid said it was required that Rebecca go to her first London ball nude, Rebecca would follow her suggestion. She\u2019d been to many dances and social events in Boston, of course, but Lady Emeline had made it quite clear that a London ball was an entirely different matter.</p><p>All this trouble over her only served to make Rebecca feel guilty. It\u2019d been she who had badgered Samuel into taking her on this trip. Now, he apparently felt obliged to spend great sums of money on her so she\u2019d be entertained in London. It wasn\u2019t exactly what she\u2019d had in mind when she begged to accompany him. All she\u2019d wanted was to spend some time with him. Perhaps learn to know her older brother just a little better. Rebecca wandered over to a chair as she thought.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the maid called.</p><p>Rebecca froze in an unladylike half-crouch over the chair.</p><p>Evans gave a strained smile. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wrinkle our skirts, do we?\u201d</p><p>Rebecca straightened. \u201cBut when I sit in the carriage, surely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be helped, can it?\u201d the maid chirped. \u201cMore\u2019s the pity, really. I don\u2019t know why these clever gentlemen don\u2019t invent a method for a lady to travel to a ball standing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d Rebecca murmured faintly.</p><p>Evans was a small, dark-haired woman who was dauntingly fashionable. Her panniers were so wide, she could hardly do her duties as maid. Actually, Rebecca was rather terrified of her.</p><p>Although the maid seemed to be trying to be friendly. \u201cPerhaps we can go downstairs and rest in the small sitting room? Not in the hallway, of course. A lady should never be seen to hang about waiting for her carriage to arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Rebecca turned to the door, feeling rather relieved.</p><p>\u201cRemember, we mustn\u2019t sit!\u201d her maid caroled after her.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if we will be allowed to use the necessary,\u201d Rebecca muttered to herself as she negotiated the stairs in her wide skirts.</p><p>She looked about guiltily to see if anyone had overheard her crass remark. The only person she could see was a single footman\u2014the black-haired one\u2014in the downstairs hall, and he stared straight ahead, apparently deaf to all that went on around him. Rebecca blew out a breath of relief. She continued down the stairs without incident until she came to the last step. There she somehow caught her heel on her hem and had a bad moment when she teetered ungracefully until she caught the banister with both hands. She froze, still clutching the wooden ball at the end of the stair banister, and glanced over at the footman. He was now looking at her, one foot forward as if he\u2019d been about to leap to her rescue. When their gazes met, he withdrew his foot and resumed staring forward woodenly.</p><p>Oh, how embarrassing! She couldn\u2019t even walk in her own skirts without falling down the stairs in front of the servants. Rebecca carefully placed both feet on the marble hallway and released the banister. She took a moment to smooth her skirts and then walked determinedly toward the doors to her right. The doors were tall and made of dark wood, and the handles were proportionately large. Rebecca grasped one and pulled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Sweat broke out at her hairline. The black-haired footman would think she was an absolute ninny. Why did the man have to be so lovely? It was one thing to make an ass of oneself in front of an old, balding man, and quite another\u2014</p><p>He cleared his throat directly behind her.</p><p>Rebecca yelped and swung around. The footman\u2019s beautiful green eyes were wide and startled, but he merely said, \u201cIf I might, miss?\u201d</p> <p>He reached around her and pushed open the door.</p><p>Rebecca stared past the open door and into the library. Oh, Lord. \u201cActually, I believe I\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019d like the sitting room, please.\u201d And she pointed behind him like a small, slightly backward child.</p><p>Fortunately, he didn\u2019t seem to find her at all odd. \u201cAye, mum.\u201d He pivoted and opened the door across the hall.</p><p>Rebecca held her head high and swanned across the hallway, but as she neared the footman, she could see quite plainly that his gaze was not where it should be. She stopped dead and slapped her hands over her bosom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too low, isn\u2019t it? I knew I shouldn\u2019t have listened to that maid. She might not mind her boobies hanging out for all to see, but I just can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Her brain suddenly caught up with her mouth. She removed her hands from her bosom and slapped them over her awful, awful, awful mouth.</p> <p>And then she just stared at the gorgeous black-haired footman, who was staring back at her. There really wasn\u2019t anything else to do, except possibly die right here in her brother\u2019s London town house hallway, and that option, unfortunately, seemed very unlikely at the moment.</p><p>Finally, he cleared his throat again. \u201cYou\u2019re the fairest lass I\u2019ve ever seen, mum, and in that gown, you look just like a princess, you do.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca blinked and cautiously removed her hands. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear on me mam\u2019s grave,\u201d he said earnestly.</p><p>\u201cOh, is your mother dead, too?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pity, isn\u2019t it? My mother died when I was born, and I never knew her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe mam died two years ago this Michaelmas,\u201d he said in a soft kind of burr.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He merely shrugged. \u201cAfter me youngest sister was born. Eldest of ten, that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound like the other servants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m Irish, mum.\u201d His green eyes seemed to twinkle at her.</p><p>\u201cThen, why\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she was interrupted by her brother\u2019s voice. \u201cAre you ready to leave, Rebecca?\u201d</p> <p>She jumped and spun for the second time that night. Samuel stood three risers above her on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d make some sort of noise when you move,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows, his gaze flicking to the footman. Rebecca followed his look and found that the black-haired footman stood against the wall again, his eyes straight ahead. It was as if he were a magical creature who\u2019d turned back into wood.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Hare, will you get the door?\u201d Samuel asked, and for a moment Rebecca wondered to whom he spoke.</p><p>Then the black-haired footman jumped forward. \u201cSir.\u201d He opened the door and held it as they walked outside.</p><p>Rebecca looked into his face as they passed, but his expression was perfectly blank, and the twinkle was gone from his green eyes. She sighed and laid her hand on Samuel\u2019s arm as he led her down the steps to the carriage. If she didn\u2019t know better, she\u2019d think that she\u2019d imagined her conversation with O\u2019Hare the footman.</p><p>They settled into the carriage, and she noticed her brother\u2019s attire for the first time. He wore a perfectly respectable dark green coat and breeches with a gold brocade waistcoat. Unfortunately, he\u2019d chosen to wear his usual leggings and moccasins over his breeches.</p><p>\u201cLady Emeline will not approve of your leggings,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>He glanced at his legs, and his lips quirked. \u201cNo doubt she\u2019ll make her opinion known.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his face, and a funny thought entered her head. Samuel smiled the same way O\u2019Hare the footman did: with his eyes.</p><p>LADY EMELINE CONTAINED herself for fully a minute after entering the carriage, which was a minute longer than Sam had estimated.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking to wear such things?\u201d She scowled at his feet and legs.</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ve told you before that they\u2019re comfortable.\u201d Probably she would scowl harder if she knew that he thought the expression was adorable. She wore an elaborately embroidered pale red gown with a yellow underskirt. The colors were gentler than those she usually employed, and although they became her, he preferred the flame reds and bold oranges.</p><p>She was an elegant lady of the London ton tonight, far removed from the woman who had accompanied him to a warehouse to inspect pottery. What had she thought of their outing? She\u2019d seemed interested in his business transaction, but was it merely the novelty? Or did she perhaps feel the same communion of mind as he did?</p><p>Lady Emeline shook her head at him now, oblivious to the direction of his thoughts. Maybe she was beginning to realize the futility of arguing over his leggings. She turned on Rebecca instead. \u201cNow, remember that you must not dance with anyone I have not expressly approved. Nor may you talk to anyone that I have not introduced you to. There will be men\u2014I do not call them gentlemen\u2014who have been known to break these rules, but you must not let them.\u201d</p><p>Sam wondered if she was thinking of himself. She turned a gimlet eye on him, and he was made certain. He grinned back at her, his little ruffled hen. Lady Emeline sat beside her aunt, both ladies ramrod straight, although the older woman was nearly a head taller than her niece. The carriage rattled around a corner, making everyone inside sway. Beside him, Rebecca had wrapped her arms about herself.</p><p>He leaned close. \u201cYou look splendid. I hardly recognized you when I came down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca bit her lip and peeked up at him, and he was suddenly reminded of her as a little girl. She had looked at him thus when he\u2019d visit her at their uncle\u2019s house in Boston. He remembered her in a white cap and apron, standing shyly in Uncle Thomas\u2019s dark hallway, waiting to greet him. He\u2019d never known what to say to her when he\u2019d visited\u2014he\u2019d come to Boston once or twice a year. His little sister had seemed such a foreign creature, a girl child brought up in the prim civilization of Boston society. All the things he knew\u2014the forest, hunting and trapping, and eventually the army\u2014were completely strange to her.</p><p>He blinked now, realizing that Rebecca had spoken to him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She leaned close, her brown eyes vulnerable. \u201cDo you think anyone will dance with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to beat them off with a stick.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and for a moment that little girl in the white cap shone in her eyes.</p><p>Mademoiselle Molyneux cleared her throat. \u201cWe are almost there, ma petite. Compose yourself so that you may present an appearance of gentility.\u201d The old lady sent a sharp look at Rebecca\u2019s skirts. \u201cYou have remembered to wear the shoes, yes?\u201d</p><p>Rebecca blinked. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBon. And here is the mansion.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked out the window and saw a line of carriages creeping toward the Earl of Westerton\u2019s town house. Lady Emeline was right: This was too grand a ball to be Rebecca\u2019s first. But introducing his sister to society was only part of the reason he\u2019d chosen this particular ball tonight. The other, more important half, was that he was on the hunt.</p><p>He waited patiently as their carriage crawled forward in line, listening with only a fraction of his attention to the female chatter within the carriage. Even now, when his entire being strained toward his goal, he was aware of Lady Emeline in particular. Without turning his head, he followed the cadence of her speech, the pauses and dips in tones. He knew when she glanced his way and could feel her puzzled curiosity in her gaze. She still wanted to know why he\u2019d chosen this particular ball. He could tell her. It involved her brother as well. But something within him shrunk from revealing his true purpose.</p><p>The carriage door was flung open by a footman he didn\u2019t know, and Sam\u2019s eyes narrowed at the servant. That was a matter he must watch as well. He hadn\u2019t missed how close O\u2019Hare had stood to Rebecca earlier in the hallway. Sam met the footman\u2019s gaze. This man immediately lowered his eyes, something O\u2019Hare had failed to do. Sam admired courage, but he wondered how long a man could last as a servant with such a spirit.</p><p>Sam stepped down onto the cobblestones in front of the Westerton house and turned to help his sister and Mademoiselle Molyneux out. Only Lady Emeline remained in the carriage. She hesitated in the doorway, eyeing him suspiciously.</p><p>He smiled and held out his hand. \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cMr. Hartley.\u201d</p><p>But she laid her hand in his, and Sam had the pleasure of wrapping his fingers around hers. She descended the steps regally and attempted to withdraw her hand. Instead, he bowed over her hand, brushing his lips against fine kid, the scent of lemon balm bathing his face.</p><p>Then he straightened. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>But her expression had softened somehow in the interval that he\u2019d bent over her hand. He stilled, the people around him, his sister, even the hunt, fading into the background as he stared at Lady Emeline. Her lips were parted, red and wet, as if she\u2019d just licked them, and her eyes were uncertain. Had they been alone, he would have caught her, drawn her into his arms until her body met his, and lowered his head to\u2014</p><p>\u201cSamuel?\u201d</p><p>He jerked his head and his attention to his sister. Rebecca. God! \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She looked confused. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He held out his arm to Mademoiselle Molyneux, who took it with a thoughtful look at him. He braced himself and turned to Lady Emeline, his voice deepening. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>His words were the same as moments before, but their meaning had changed fundamentally. Her eyes widened, and he saw her sweet breasts expand as she inhaled.</p><p>Then she met his eyes and her chin lifted. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Which left him to ponder, as he escorted the ladies up the steps, what exactly Lady Emeline had meant by those two innocuous words.</p><p>Inside the great double doors, Westerton House was ablaze with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of candles. Even the entry hall was warm, giving an unpleasant taste of the heat that would lurk in the ballroom itself. Why anyone would voluntarily attend an event such as this was truly a puzzle to him. He felt sweat start at the base of his spine. He hated crowds. He\u2019d always had, but since Spinner\u2019s Falls...He pushed the thought from his mind, concentrating on his reason for being here.</p><p>The ladies surrendered their wraps to a footman, and the articles of clothing were whisked away. Then they were at the entrance to the ballroom itself, and a footman with a magnificent wig was announcing them. The room was cavernous, but that didn\u2019t help the heat, for it was overflowing with people. They literally stood shoulder to shoulder so that one had to wait for an opening to move forward.</p><p>Sam caught his arms twitching and had to consciously still the movement. This was his idea of hell. The heat, the shuffle of bodies against bodies, the noise of scores of voices laughing, talking, complaining. He felt a bead of sweat slide down his back. Mademoiselle Molyneux had already found a crony and slipped away into the mass of bodies. Someone bumped against Lady Emeline, still on his right arm, and he found himself baring his teeth at the man. He saw a startled look on a reddened face and then that man, too, was lost. Sam closed his eyes for a moment to try to control the panic that rose in his chest, but with his eyes shut, the worst part nearly overwhelmed his senses.</p><p>The smell.</p><p>Oh, God, the smell of burning wax, foul breath, and sweating bodies. Male sweat. That strong acid stink, that rank musk, that rotten armpit odor. They shoved around him, trying to get past, trying to run away. Some old enough to be grandfathers, some too young to shave, all fearing for their lives, all wanting just to live another day. That was what he smelled: the terror of death. He gasped, but all the air had been sucked into babbling lungs, and he inhaled only the fear of battle and the smell of sweat and blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMr. Hartley. Samuel.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was near, and he felt a cool hand on his cheek. With an effort, he opened his eyes.</p><p>Her black eyes were staring into his, and he latched on to the sight, trying to focus on only her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He opened his mouth and formed the word carefully, speaking the truth because that was all he could do. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes left his for a moment, and he grasped her shoulders to keep his balance. \u201cWhat is wrong with him, do you know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen him like this,\u201d Rebecca said.</p><p>Her black eyes returned to his, and he felt relief. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his throat working convulsively, and stumbled after her like a drunken man. Their progress was slow, and he knew that sweat was running down his cheeks. He kept her constantly in his vision, a guideline to sanity. Then, suddenly, there were doors, and he tumbled out into cool, fresh air. It was a veranda with a low rail. He made it to one end before spewing over the rail and into the bushes.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s ill,\u201d Sam heard Rebecca say as he gulped great breaths of air. \u201cMaybe he ate something spoiled. We should send for a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice emerged a strangled rasp. He cleared his throat, fighting to sound normal. \u201cNo doctor.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Rebecca made a sound of distress. He wished he could face her, reassure her that nothing was wrong.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hartley,\u201d Lady Emeline murmured very close to him. She laid her hand on his shoulder. He hunched it. Shameful for any woman to see him like this, let alone her. \u201cYou\u2019re ill. Please satisfy your sister\u2019s worry and let us send for a physician.\u201d</p><p>Sam closed his eyes, willing his body to stop shaking, to stop betraying him with phantom fears. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her hand fell away. \u201cRebecca, can you wait with your brother whilst I fetch some wine? Perhaps that will revive him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, certainly,\u201d Rebecca replied.</p><p>And then Lady Emeline started to leave him. He heard a low groaning and realized dimly that it was himself, but he couldn\u2019t stop the sound, nor the urge to make her stay by his side. He turned, meaning to keep her there, but instead he was brought up short by what he saw.</p><p>Lord Vale stood in the doorway to the ballroom.</p><p>JASPER SHUT THE French doors behind him, smiled his careless, charming smile, and said, \u201cEmmie! Godsblood, hadn\u2019t expected to see you here.\u201d</p><p>All Emeline could think was, How am I to get him out of the way? Hardly a kind sentiment for a man she\u2019d known all her life, but there it was. It was imperative to get Samuel away before Jasper saw how bad his condition was. Somehow she knew that Samuel would hate to have another man see him like this.</p><p>It had happened so suddenly in the ballroom. She\u2019d felt him stiffen as they\u2019d entered the house but thought nothing of it. Many would be nervous at such a gathering of the ton. But he\u2019d slowed as they\u2019d advanced into the ballroom. Even allowing for the awkwardness of moving through the crowd, Samuel had walked oddly. Until she had at last looked up into his face and had seen he was in agony. What kind of agony\u2014whether mental or physical\u2014she did not know, but everything about him, from the closed eyes to the pale and sweating face to the way he suddenly clutched her hand bespoke great pain. The idea that this strong man was in pain made her almost paralyzed. It was as if she\u2019d felt a corresponding pain deep within her own being. She\u2019d led him out of the ballroom as quickly as possible, the whole time aware of his silent agony.</p><p>And now she must deal with Jasper.</p><p>Emeline squared her shoulders and assumed her most haughty expression\u2014the one she\u2019d learned in the nursery growing up the daughter of an earl. But as it turned out, there was no need. Jasper wasn\u2019t even looking at her. His eyes were fixed behind her, presumably on Samuel.</p> <p>\u201cHartley? I say, it is Corporal Hartley, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The single word was clipped out from behind her.</p><p>Emeline turned and saw that Samuel was upright now, no longer leaning against the railing, although his face was still pale and shone with sweat. He was unmoving, as though waiting for something. Beside him, Rebecca hovered hesitantly, looking from one man to the other, her expression clearly confused.</p><p>Jasper took a step closer. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since...\u201d His voice trailed off as if he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say the name.</p><p>\u201cSince Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d All the usual amusement was gone from Jasper\u2019s face, and without it, Emeline saw the lines carved beside his long nose and too-wide mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you know we were betrayed?\u201d Samuel asked softly.</p><p>That startled Jasper. He drew his hairy brows together. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone betrayed the regiment. Do you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p><p>Samuel shrugged. \u201cYou were in debt to Clemmons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeeply in debt. Every veteran of the regiment that I\u2019ve talked to since my arrival in England remembers that fact clearly. You were in danger of being drummed out of the army, stripped of your rank, disgraced.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s head reared back as if he\u2019d been hit. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe massacre at Spinner\u2019s Falls saved you from having to pay that debt.\u201d</p><p>Jasper slowly flexed his fingers, and Emeline felt a prickle on the back of her neck at the aggression in the air. \u201cWhat exactly are you implying, Hartley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a reason to betray us,\u201d Samuel stated softly.</p><p>\u201cYou think I sold my men to the French?\u201d Jasper\u2019s tone was almost casual, but his face was graven.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Samuel said in a voice so low it was nearly a whisper. He swayed slightly where he stood\u2014he wasn\u2019t as recovered as he\u2019d like them to think. \u201cOr to the Wyandot Indians. The same result in either case. They knew we would be there at Spinner\u2019s Falls. They knew and they waited, and when we came, they killed us all\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s big fists balled, and he took a step toward Samuel.</p><p>Emeline knew she had to intervene before the men came to blows. \u201cStop it, Samuel! Stop saying these things.\u201d</p><p>He never took his eyes from the other man. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Samuel, come away from Jasper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Samuel finally turned his eyes, glancing quickly from her to Jasper. \u201cWho is he to you?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cA friend. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Jasper spoke for himself. \u201cI\u2019m her fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>All lauded the captain of the guard for his bravery, strength, and loyalty, although many wondered why such a man would stubbornly refuse to speak even one word. But what really put the feather in Iron Heart\u2019s cap was when he saved the king\u2019s life a third time. The castle was attacked by a fire-breathing dragon, and Iron Heart fended off the loathsome beast with great swings of his sword. After this, the king pronounced that there was only one award fit for such a gallant man. He must guard the king\u2019s most precious possession\u2014the princess royal herself....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>\u201cFianc\u00e9?\u201d Sam felt as if he\u2019d taken a fist to the gut.</p><p>His lungs deflated, the breath leaving his body with a whoosh as he slowly turned his head and met Lady Emeline\u2019s sweet black eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t formally announced it yet, but we\u2019ve had an understanding for ages,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>How could this woman be engaged to another man and he not know it? It was as if he\u2019d suddenly lost something that he\u2019d not fully been aware of wanting in the first place. Which was lunacy. She was a titled aristocrat, the daughter, sister, mother, and widow of titled aristocrats. Her world was so far outside of his that he might as well be a child trying to grasp the moon in the night sky.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>But he had no more time for further thoughts on Lady Emeline. This was the wrong place, anyway. If he\u2019d not been made ill by the smell of other men\u2019s bodies, if he\u2019d not had that overpowering memory of the massacre, he never would\u2019ve chosen to accuse Vale here. But having done it, there was no point in regrets.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t betray us,\u201d Vale said. He was standing casually now, yet the man looked as if he were ready to attack.</p><p>Sam tensed.</p><p>At the same time, Rebecca touched his shoulder. \u201cCome away, Samuel. Please come away.\u201d And he saw that she was trying not to cry. God, what had he done?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem insane six years ago when I knew you,\u201d Vale said conversationally. \u201cWhat makes you think we were betrayed?\u201d</p><p>Sam eyed him. Vale had the type of face that one instinctively trusted, a funny, open countenance habitually wrapped in a smile. Of course, Sam had known several men who smiled when they killed. \u201cYou were in debt to Lieutenant Clemmons. Everyone knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Clemmons died in the massacre, effectively nullifying the debt.\u201d</p><p>Vale gave an incredulous bark of laughter. \u201cYou think I killed two hundred and forty-six men so I wouldn\u2019t have to pay my debt to Clemmons? You are mad.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he was. Rebecca stood crying behind him, and Lady Emeline was watching him warily as if he might suddenly try to climb the walls. Vale stared at him with no fear in his eyes.</p><p>Sam remembered how the viscount had looked that day, astride his horse, trying to reach Colonel Darby through the mess of fighting men. The bay had been shot out from under Vale, and Sam had seen him jump clear of the falling horse. Stand and open wide his mouth in a battle cry Sam hadn\u2019t heard, swing his sword savagely, and watch in despair as Darby was pulled from his own horse and killed. And then Vale had continued fighting even as the battle was clearly lost.</p><p>Sam should be apologizing to Vale and backing away. This man couldn\u2019t be the traitor. But something inside whispered, A brave man isn\u2019t necessarily an honest man. MacDonald had been a brave soldier, too, before his arrest. Deep in his belly, Sam needed to find out the truth of Spinner\u2019s Falls.</p><p>Lady Emeline shook herself as if coming out of a trance and marched to the doors, her small back militantly straight. A footman was lingering there, gawking at the spectacle, and she pointed at him. \u201cYou. Bring some wine and biscuits, please. Thank you.\u201d And she firmly closed the doors on his face.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you have?\u201d Vale asked. \u201cMy gambling debts led you to believe that I\u2019d betrayed our regiment, then had myself captured by Indians and Reynaud killed?\u201d</p><p>Lady Emeline flinched. Vale didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>Sam hadn\u2019t wanted to speak of this in front of her, but now it was inevitable. \u201cThere was a letter detailing our plans to march to Fort Edward. It included a map with drawings that could be deciphered by the Indians.\u201d</p><p>Vale leaned against the rail. \u201cHow do you know about this letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca had stopped crying and now said wonderingly, \u201cThat\u2019s why you wanted me to attend this ball, isn\u2019t it? It had nothing to do with me at all. You wanted to meet Lord Vale.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Sam stared at his younger sister. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOr me,\u201d Lady Emeline said. Her words were quiet, but Sam knew not to take that as a sign she wasn\u2019t angry. \u201cReynaud was killed because of that battle. Didn\u2019t you think I had a right to know?\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned. His head hurt, his mouth tasted like acid, and he didn\u2019t want to deal with the women in his life. This was man\u2019s business, although he wasn\u2019t such a fool as to say that aloud.</p><p>Apparently, Vale had no such qualms. \u201cEmmie, this will only open old wounds for you. Why don\u2019t you and Miss...\u201d He looked uncertainly at Rebecca. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is Miss Hartley,\u201d Lady Emeline said coolly. \u201cMr. Hartley\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Hartley.\u201d Vale nodded, urbane even when accused of treason. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two go back into the house and enjoy the ball?\u201d</p><p>Sam nearly groaned. Didn\u2019t Vale know anything about women?</p><p>Lady Emeline smiled tightly, her lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cI believe I will stay here.\u201d</p> <p>Vale opened his mouth again, the fool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay, too,\u201d Rebecca said before Vale could speak.</p><p>Everyone swung in her direction. Rebecca\u2019s cheeks pinkened, but she tilted her chin defiantly.</p><p>Lady Emeline cleared her throat. \u201cWe\u2019ll just sit here.\u201d</p><p>She marched to a marble bench set against the railing. Rebecca followed her. Both ladies sat down, crossed their arms, and assumed nearly identical expressions of expectation. In any other circumstances, it would\u2019ve been funny. Damn. Sam raised an eyebrow at Vale.</p> <p>Who shrugged helplessly. God only knew where the man got his reputation as a rake.</p><p>The footman returned with a glass of wine on a tray. Samuel took it and sipped. He spat the first mouthful over the rail into the bushes before downing the rest of the glass, feeling marginally better.</p><p>Vale cleared his throat when the footman had left. \u201cYes, well. Where did this letter you have come from? How are we to know it wasn\u2019t forged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not forged,\u201d Sam said. He felt more than saw Lady Emeline purse her lips. How dare she sit in judgment of him? \u201cI received it from a Delaware Indian\u2014he\u2019s part English on his mother\u2019s side. The man is a friend I\u2019ve known for many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat strange little Indian who came to visit you at your place of business last spring!\u201d Rebecca exclaimed. \u201cI remember now. He was in your office when I went to bring you your luncheon.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. His offices were near the docks in Boston, a place his sister didn\u2019t usually visit. But that day he\u2019d forgotten the basket that Cook had packed for his luncheon, and Rebecca had fetched it for him.</p> <p>\u201cYou were so distracted afterward,\u201d Rebecca murmured. She looked at him as if seeing him for the first time. As if he were a stranger. \u201cAnd angry. You were in a black mood for days. Now I know why.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned, but he couldn\u2019t address his sister\u2019s worry right now. He looked at Vale. \u201cCoshocton\u2014the Indian\u2014obtained the letter from a French trader who had been living among the Wyandot. It was the Wyandot who attacked us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Vale retorted. \u201cBut how do you know it was someone from our side who wrote the blamed thing? It could\u2019ve been a Frenchie or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sam shook his head. \u201cIt was written in English. And besides, whoever wrote it knew too much. You remember that our march to Fort Edward was secret. Only the officers and a few of the trackers knew we marched instead of taking canoes down Lake Champlain.\u201d</p><p>Vale stared. \u201cThe lake passage was the more usual way, I remember.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cAnyone hearing where we were headed would assume we went by water, not land.\u201d</p><p>Vale pursed his lips, then seemed to come to a decision. \u201cSee here, Hartley. My debt was high, I don\u2019t deny it, but I was quite able to pay it.\u201d</p><p>Sam narrowed his eyes. \u201cWere you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. In fact, I did.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quietly paid the debt to Clemmons\u2019s estate.\u201d Vale glanced away as if embarrassed. His voice was gruff. \u201cLeast I could do, don\u2019t you know, under the circumstances. Doubt any of the men you talked to knew that, but you can contact my solicitors if you wish. I\u2019ve got the papers to prove it.\u201d</p><p>Sam closed his eyes. His head was pounding, and he felt like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cWho else had reason to betray the company of soldiers besides Jasper?\u201d Lady Emeline asked quietly. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve known Jasper all my life, and I cannot believe he would do something that would end in Reynaud\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Viscount Vale grinned. \u201cThank you, Emeline, although I notice you don\u2019t acquit me of treason.\u201d</p><p>She merely shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s right.\u201d Vale sobered. \u201cI didn\u2019t betray the regiment, Hartley.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at the aristocrat. He didn\u2019t want to believe him; he\u2019d come all the way to England because he\u2019d been looking for answers. He\u2019d hoped Vale would be the key to everything. That he could finally put Spinner\u2019s Falls to rest. But any motive for Vale to have betrayed the regiment seemed to have evaporated. Besides, he knew now in his gut that Vale wasn\u2019t the traitor. And if he hadn\u2019t had his gut telling him Vale was innocent, there was Lady Emeline. She trusted the man, damn him.</p><p>Lady Emeline got to her feet and shook out her skirts. \u201cI believe that means someone else is the traitor, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU SHOULD RETURN to the festivities,\u201d Emeline told Jasper. \u201cRebecca and I are more than ready to return home.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t include Samuel in her words, but he was the one she was most worried about. He no longer wavered as he stood, but his face was still pale and shining with sweat.</p><p>But she made sure not to look at him as she addressed Jasper. She knew that Samuel wouldn\u2019t welcome her solicitation in front of another man. \u201cI don\u2019t think it wise to go through the ballroom again\u2014Rebecca has had enough excitement for the night. I\u2019ll send word to Tante Cristelle to meet us in front of the house, and we can walk around by the mews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon.\u201d</p><p>Emeline jumped and whirled at the single word. Her nerves were obviously more ragged than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Tante Cristelle stepped from the shadows near the doors. \u201cInside they whisper of two gentlemen arguing.\u201d She scowled at the gentlemen, though only Jasper had the grace to look ashamed. \u201cTherefore, I shall remain and put the gossip to rest. I shall have a footman summon the carriage to the mews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how will you return home?\u201d Emeline asked.</p><p>Tante gave an expressive shrug. \u201cI have many of the friends, do I not? It will not be so hard to find a carriage.\u201d She darted a glance at Rebecca, who had begun to look wilted. \u201cYou go and put all right at home, ma petite.\u201d</p><p>Emeline smiled in weary gratitude at the old lady. \u201cThank you, Tante.\u201d</p><p>Tante Cristelle snorted. \u201cIt is you who have the harder part, I think, to manage these two bulls.\u201d She nodded and slipped back inside the ballroom.</p><p>Emeline squared her shoulders and turned back to her bulls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll escort you to your carriage.\u201d Jasper was already holding out an arm for her, and she took it, chiding herself not to feel hurt that Samuel did not do the same.</p><p>She was quiet as Jasper led her down the Westerton garden and out into the mews, conscious all the while that Samuel trailed her with his sister. As they made a streetlamp on the side road, she glanced up at Jasper. \u201cThank you. Make sure you don\u2019t stay out too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Jasper grinned down at her. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to be tucked into bed before midnight. Wouldn\u2019t want to turn into a pumpkin.\u201d</p><p>Emeline wrinkled her nose in exasperation at Jasper\u2019s careless reply. That only made him smile wider. The carriage came rattling around the corner.</p><p>Emeline said hastily, \u201cI\u2019d like you and the Hartleys to come to tea tomorrow at my house so we can discuss all of this further.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a very graceful invitation; she didn\u2019t even look at Samuel or Rebecca, though they must have heard.</p><p>Jasper quirked an eyebrow at her. He might act comical at times, but that didn\u2019t mean he took orders from her. For a moment, she held her breath.</p><p>Then he smiled again. \u201cOf course. Sleep well, my sweet.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and brushed his lips over her temple. Jasper had kissed her like this dozens, perhaps hundreds of times, in the years they\u2019d known each other. But this time, Emeline was conscious that Samuel was standing somewhere behind her in the dark, watching. She felt strangely flustered, which was nonsense. She owed the colonial nothing\u2014less than nothing since it appeared that Jasper had been his target all along.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Jasper.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and then turned to Samuel. \u201cTomorrow, then?\u201d</p><p>Samuel didn\u2019t smile, but he inclined his head. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jasper gave an ironic salute and then strolled off down the street. Despite her admonition to return to the ball, apparently he had other plans. But that was none of her business. Emeline shrugged and turned, only to find that Samuel was much closer behind her than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cMay we leave now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He stepped aside and gestured to the waiting carriage steps.</p><p>Emeline was forced to brush against him to climb the steps. Which was what he intended, no doubt. Men could be so transparent when they wanted to show mastery. As she mounted the first step, she felt his hand grasp her elbow. His body was right behind hers, almost indecently near. She darted a look at him, and his mouth twitched.</p><p>Awful man.</p><p>Emeline settled herself in the carriage seat and watched as he knocked on the roof and sat down next to his sister.</p><p>She looked thoughtfully at the fading bruises on his jaw. \u201cYou were in a fight recently.\u201d</p><p>He merely raised his eyebrows.</p><p>She pointed with her chin. \u201cThose marks on your jaw. Someone hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel?\u201d Rebecca was staring at her brother, too, now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou keep so much of yourself hidden from me, don\u2019t you?\u201d Rebecca whispered. \u201cMost of yourself, in fact.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows drew together. \u201cBecca\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She turned her face to the window. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to argue tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rebecca gave a great sigh as if the weight of the world rested on her shoulders. \u201cI didn\u2019t even get to dance.\u201d</p><p>Samuel looked at Emeline as if for help, but she was no more in sympathy with him than his sister. She stared out the black window, watching her own reflection. She noticed that the small lines about her mouth made her look particularly old tonight.</p><p>They traveled the remainder of the journey home in silence, the carriage rocking and swaying as it rattled through the nighttime London streets. By the time they pulled up in front of her house, Emeline felt stiff and sore and as if she\u2019d be quite happy never to attend another ball in her life. The carriage door opened, and the footman pulled down the metal steps. Samuel got out and helped his sister descend. Rebecca didn\u2019t wait but immediately ran up the steps to her brother\u2019s town house and disappeared inside. Samuel stared after her, frowning, but didn\u2019t move to follow. He held out his hand to Emeline.</p><p>She inhaled and carefully placed her fingertips in his. Despite her precaution, he pulled her close as she stepped down.</p><p>\u201cAsk me in,\u201d he murmured as she passed him.</p><p>Cheek! She made the cobblestones in front of her own home and attempted to withdraw her hand. He wouldn\u2019t let her. She raised her head and met his eyes. His were slightly narrowed, his mouth a determined horizontal line.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hartley,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cWill you come inside for a moment? I have a painting in my sitting room that I would like to have your opinion on.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and released her hand. But he followed her closely as she mounted the steps to her house, as if he suspected a trick.</p><p>Inside, Emeline gave her wrap to Crabs. \u201cPrepare the sitting room, please.\u201d</p><p>Crabs had been with her since before her marriage, and in all those years, Emeline had yet to see him surprised. Tonight was no different.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d The butler snapped his fingers, and two footmen ran to begin lighting candles and setting the fire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emeline glided after them. She went straight across the dark room and stood by the window, pretending to look out, although of course all she could see was her own ghostly reflection. After a while, the bustling behind her died and she heard the door shut. She turned.</p><p>Samuel was stalking toward her, his face quite grim in the candlelight. \u201cWhy Vale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He continued coming, his footsteps disconcertingly silent on the sitting room carpet. \u201cVale. Why marry him?\u201d</p> <p>She clutched the fabric of her overskirt in her right hand and tilted her chin up. \u201cWhy not? I\u2019ve known him since childhood.\u201d</p><p>He halted in front of her finally, much, much too close, damn him, and she was forced to crane her neck up in order to meet his eyes.</p><p>His angry eyes. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>His nostrils flared, but that was his only reaction. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed. \u201cOf course I love him. Jasper is like a brother to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave a nasty bark of laughter. \u201cWould you make love to your brother?\u201d</p><p>She slapped him. The sound echoed in the room, and her hand stung. She drew back in appalled shock at her own violence, but before she could say anything\u2014even think to say anything\u2014he\u2019d grasped her.</p><p>He pulled her close and lowered his head until she felt his breath brush her cheek. \u201cHe kisses you like a brother. As if you meant no more to him than the maid who brings his tea in the morning. Is that what you really want from your marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She glared up at him, so intimately close. Her hands had nowhere to go but his shoulders, and she clutched him as if they embraced. As if they were lovers. \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I want. A civilized man. An Englishman who knows the rules of society, an aristocrat to help me with my son and my lands. We are perfectly suited, Jasper and I. We are as alike as two peas in a pod.\u201d</p><p>She saw the hurt in his eyes. It was very subtle, few other people, perhaps no other person, would understand it, but she saw and comprehended. She was hurting him.</p> <p>So she drove the knife home. \u201cWe will be married soon, and I will be very, very happy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn you,\u201d he growled, and then he kissed her.</p><p>His mouth ground down over hers, smashing her lips against her teeth until she tasted blood. She tried to twist away, but he clutched her harder and lifted her from the ground so she had no purchase. She arched her head and he followed, walking with her until her back was against the wall. And then she truly had nowhere to go. She should\u2019ve given up then\u2014she knew he would never really hurt her\u2014but something inside her refused to admit defeat. She opened her mouth, and when he hesitated for a fraction of a second, she took advantage.</p><p>She bit him.</p><p>He reared back and grinned at her, his beautiful lower lip bloody. \u201cCat.\u201d</p><p>She would\u2019ve hit him then\u2014again\u2014if he didn\u2019t already have control of her arms.</p><p>And then it was too late. He\u2019d bent his head to hers. This time his lips were soft, brushing over hers delicately, lightly. Teasing, as if he had all the time in the world. She pushed her face forward, to deepen the contact, but he moved aside. Perhaps he was afraid she\u2019d bite him again. Perhaps he was merely toying with her. She couldn\u2019t think anymore, and it didn\u2019t seem to matter, anyway. He returned, like a moth alighting on her lips. Softly, sweetly, as if she were made of spun glass, a delicate, fragile creature instead of the cat he\u2019d just called her.</p><p>In the end, she couldn\u2019t hold out. She parted her lips as shyly as a virgin, as if she\u2019d never been kissed before. Maybe she hadn\u2019t\u2014not like this, anyway. The tip of his tongue darted into her mouth and out again, and her tongue followed. She pursued him into his mouth, and he sucked at her, gently, oh, so gently, biting. His entire weight was pressed against her, holding her upright against the wall. And she wished, desperately, that there were not so many layers of fabric between them. That she could feel that hardness\u2014feel him. She moaned, a whispering, light sound, entirely unlike herself, and he stilled.</p> <p>He lowered her gently to the ground and took his mouth, his hands, and himself away from her. She stared at him, completely at a loss for words.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cGood night.\u201d And he left the room.</p><p>Her legs were shaky, and for a moment she simply leaned against her sitting room wall, not even attempting to walk to the settee for fear her legs would collapse beneath her. As she leaned there, she licked her lips and tasted blood.</p><p>Whether his or hers she could not tell.</p><p>A CIVILIZED MAN. Sam shouldered past the gawking footmen and out of Emeline\u2019s town house. A civilized man. He ran down the steps and continued running, the familiar feel of his muscles lengthening and warming a comfort.</p><p>A civilized man.</p><p>Of all the words that could be used to describe him, civilized was the last anyone would use. He rounded a corner and had to dodge a group of drunken riffraff. The men scattered apart in surprise at his appearance. By the time they started yelling insults, Sam was yards away. He continued down the street, ducking on a whim into a dark alley. His feet pounded rhythmically against cobblestones, each footfall a silent jolt to the body. With every step, his body grew looser, more well oiled, until he ran almost without volition, almost without effort. The momentum built until he flew. He could run like this for miles, hours, days if he had to.</p><p>There was no point in lusting after a woman who didn\u2019t want him. In Boston he was a well-respected figure, a leader of the trading community, thanks to his uncle\u2019s business and the wealth he\u2019d amassed since inheriting it. In only the last year he\u2019d been approached twice by keen fathers, making it known that Sam would be a welcome son-in-law. The ladies in each case were pleasant enough, but there\u2019d been no spark. Nothing to make him single them out as special. He\u2019d begun to think that his standards were too high. That a man in his position should settle on good family and a pretty face as adequate for a contented marriage.</p><p>Sam cursed and quickened his pace, leaping over a pile of trash. And now he felt a stupid, wholly uncontrollable yearning for a woman he simply could not have. A woman who wanted a civilized man. Why her? Why this prickly aristocrat who didn\u2019t even like him?</p><p>He halted, placing his hands on the small of his back to stretch it. It was all a joke of the cosmos, it must be, for it all to come together at once as it had tonight. His nightmares about the massacre, made real and terribly tangible in the ballroom. His confrontation with Vale. The horrible revelation that she was engaged to that aristocratic prig. He threw back his head and laughed at the night and the black sky and his world that was trembling around him, about to fall. A cat startled and scurried into the shadows, howling its displeasure.</p><p>And then he ran again.</p><p>EMELINE TOUCHED ONE finger to the green baize book cover. A fine dusting of rot fell to the tabletop. She\u2019d found the fairy-tale book that Reynaud and she had spent so many hours poring over as children. It had necessitated an extensive search of the attics all this morning, accompanied by much sneezing and filth, and she\u2019d had to take a hot bath afterward, but she\u2019d found the book. Now she\u2019d placed it on a table in her sitting room as she contemplated her find.</p><p>What she hadn\u2019t expected was that it would be in such terrible condition. In her memory, the book was pristine and new, Reynaud\u2019s long, slim fingers deftly turning the pages. In truth, the worms and moths had evidently been at the book. The binding was warped, the pages yellowed and falling out. Quite a few were stained from damp and mold. Emeline frowned as she traced the embossing on a corner of the cover. It depicted a pike or staff laid against a worn soldier\u2019s pack, as if a soldier home from war had set the items by his front door.</p><p>She sighed and turned back the cover to reveal the other unfortunate surprise. The book was in German\u2014something she\u2019s completely forgotten from her youth. She\u2019d barely begun to read when she and Reynaud looked at the book, and she\u2019d spent most of the time examining the illustrations.</p><p>At least she thought the language was German. On the frontispiece was the title in ornate, nearly illegible letters and beneath was a crude woodcut illustration. It showed four soldiers in tall m\u00e9tier hats and gaiters marching side by side. Nanny had been a Prussian \u00e9migr\u00e9, having crossed the Channel when she was a little girl. The book must have originally been hers. Had Nanny told the stories from memory or had she translated them into English as she turned the pages?</p><p>Voices came from the hallway outside the sitting room door, and Emeline straightened away from the table, walking several paces from it. For some reason, she didn\u2019t want to share her find just yet with her guests.</p><p>The door opened to reveal Crabs. \u201cLord Vale and Mr. Hartley are here, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Emeline nodded. \u201cShow them in.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to hide her surprise. She\u2019d invited them to tea this morning, but it had never occurred to her, after last night\u2019s disagreement, that they\u2019d arrive together. Yet here they came, Jasper first in a striking scarlet coat with yellow trim and a cobalt blue waistcoat that caught the color of his eyes. His dark mahogany hair was clubbed back in an unpowdered queue that no doubt had been quite neat when he\u2019d left his valet this morning. Now, however, curling locks rioted about his temples. Emeline knew quite a few girls who\u2019d cheerfully kill their nearest and dearest for hair like Jasper\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMy sweet.\u201d Jasper advanced and caught her a careless kiss somewhere near her left ear. Emeline, looking over Jasper\u2019s shoulder, met Samuel\u2019s enigmatic gaze. The colonial was in brown again today, and, although the handsomer man, standing next to Jasper, he appeared like a crow in the shadow of a peacock. The viscount stepped back and threw himself into one of her setting-sun orange chairs. \u201cHartley and I have come hat in hand like petitioners before a queen. What would you have with us? Do you mean to broker a peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Emeline smiled quickly at Jasper and then turned to Samuel, bracing herself for the contact. \u201cWill your sister join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Samuel laid his long fingertips against the back of a chair. \u201cShe sends her apologies and pleads a migraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d Emeline gestured to a chair. \u201cPlease. Won\u2019t you sit, Mr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head and sat. His hair was tightly braided in a military queue today, every strand contained and controlled, and the sight made her perversely want to take it apart. To let his hair stream round his shoulders and run her fingers through it until it pulled at his scalp.</p><p>The maids bustled in with tea at that moment, and Emeline was glad to take the chance to calm herself. She sat and oversaw the placement of the tea things and kept her eyes down, away from the wall and away from him. Just last night he\u2019d kissed her in this very room. He\u2019d pressed her against the wall beside the window, and he\u2019d traced her lips with his tongue, and she\u2019d bit him. She\u2019d tasted his blood.</p><p>Her teaspoon clattered as Emeline\u2019s hand trembled. She glanced up, right into Samuel\u2019s dark stare. His face looked carved from stone.</p><p>She cleared her throat and glanced away. \u201cTea, Jasper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d he replied cheerfully.</p><p>Was he completely oblivious to the undercurrents between her and Samuel? Or perhaps he was aware and chose not to notice. They had a very civilized understanding, after all. She didn\u2019t expect him to live like a monk before marriage\u2014or indeed afterward, if it came to that\u2014and perhaps he was equally tolerant.</p><p>She handed the teacup to Jasper and asked without looking up, \u201cMr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>There was a silence. Jasper noisily stirred sugar into his tea\u2014he had a horrible sweet tooth\u2014and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cTea, Mr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>She stared at her fingers curled around the teapot handle until she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Jasper must surely know something was wrong. She looked up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Samuel still watched her. \u201cYes. I\u2019d like some tea.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t what his deep voice said.</p><p>She shuddered, actually felt the tremor run through her, and knew she was embarrassingly hot. The teapot rattled against the cup as she poured. Abominable man! Did he want to humiliate her?</p><p>Meanwhile, Jasper had his dish of tea balanced precariously on one knee. He seemed to have forgotten it after a couple of sips, and now the cup sat, just waiting for a sudden movement to crash to the floor.</p><p>\u201cSam said something earlier about a Dick Thornton, Emmie,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t recall a Thornton. \u2019Course with over four hundred men in the regiment originally, one didn\u2019t know them all by name. Most by sight, but not by name.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel had placed his own cup on a side table next to his chair. \u201cAfter Quebec, there were less than that.\u201d</p><p>Emeline cleared her throat. \u201cMr. Thornton was a common soldier? I never would have guessed from meeting him the other day. His speech was quite clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThornton was a private when we knew him in the war,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cHe was great friends with another soldier, MacDonald\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe redheaded twins!\u201d Jasper exclaimed. \u201cAlways together, always up to a bit of mischief.\u201d</p><p>Samuel nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>Emeline looked from one man to the other. They\u2019d seemed to have made some strange male accord without any help from her. \u201cYou know this MacDonald as well?\u201d</p><p>Jasper sat forward, nearly upsetting the cup of tea. \u201cDamn me, now I remember. Bad business, that. Weren\u2019t MacDonald and his friend Brown brought up on charges of murder and\u2014ahem!\u201d He cut off the rest of his sentence with a cough and an embarrassed glance at Emeline.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. From the look the gentlemen exchanged, whatever the bad business was about, it must be horrible enough that they deemed it unsuitable for her ears. She sighed in frustration. Men were so silly sometimes.</p><p>\u201cDid MacDonald survive the massacre?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>Samuel shook his head. \u201cNo. Thornton said he saw MacDonald fall, and Brown must\u2019ve died in the assault as well. We would\u2019ve heard of his court-martial if he had survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t know for certain about Brown.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ought to ask Thornton, see if he knows,\u201d Jasper mused.</p><p>Samuel elevated his eyebrows. \u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked like a little boy embarrassed\u2014an expression Emeline was familiar with from childhood. It was one he often used to get his own way without too much argument. \u201cI thought I might help you in your inquiries, since I\u2019m not the traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved you have acquitted yourself,\u201d Samuel began rather stiffly, \u201cbut I\u2019m not so sanguine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come, Samuel!\u201d Emeline burst out. \u201cYou know Jasper isn\u2019t the traitor. Admit it.\u201d She glared at him, only belatedly realizing that she\u2019d used his Christian name.</p><p>Samuel made a pretty, overshowy bow to her. \u201cAs my lady wishes.\u201d He turned to Jasper. \u201cI admit your innocence, if only to appease your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Jasper smiled with exposed teeth.</p> <p>Samuel bared his teeth back.</p><p>Emeline straightened determinedly. \u201cSo it is decided, then. You will investigate the massacre and its aftermath. Together.\u201d</p><p>Jasper raised his eyebrows at Samuel.</p><p>Who nodded grimly. \u201cTogether.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Day after day and night after night, Iron Heart guarded Princess Solace. He stood behind her as she ate her meals. He followed her as she paced the royal gardens. He rode beside her as she hunted with her falcons. And he listened with a grave face as she told him her thoughts, her feelings, and the deepest secrets that lay hidden in her heart. It is a strange fact, but a true one nonetheless: a lady may come to love a man though he speak not a word....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>Rebecca cracked the door to her room and peered out. The hall outside seemed deserted. Moving quietly, she tiptoed into the hall and shut the door behind her. She was supposed to be lying down with an aching head. Evans had already supplied her with a scented cloth and the instructions to keep it on her forehead for the next half hour. But since the headache had only been an excuse in the first place, Rebecca didn\u2019t feel any guilt about not following orders. What she did feel was a sneaking fear of her own maid. Hence her furtive movements.</p><p>She crept down the stairs and headed toward the back of the house, to the door that led out to the garden. She\u2019d been so frightened when Samuel had had that fit in the ballroom the night before. Her elder brother always seemed so solid, so strong and in control. To see Samuel suddenly shivering and white had terrified her. Samuel was the rock she leaned on. Without him, who would be her support?</p><p>Voices came from above, and Rebecca paused. The voices coalesced into two maids arguing over the cleaning of the fireplace grates, and she relaxed. The back passage was dark, but the door was just ahead. It was ridiculous, after the fear she\u2019d felt for her brother in the ballroom, to then feel betrayed when he revealed his real reason for coming to England. She had been the one to beg to come on this trip. She\u2019d been so happy\u2014so grateful\u2014when he acquiesced to her pleas. Now, her disappointment was in proportion to her initial happiness.</p><p>Rebecca pushed open the door that led into the back garden and fled into the sunlight. Perhaps because the true owners rented the town house out, its garden had a dismal air of neglect. There were no flowers, at least none in bloom. Instead, there were a few gravel paths bordered with shoulder-height hedges. Here and there, an ornamental tree grew, and sometimes the hedges parted to reveal a square or circle with miniature hedges cut into intricate patterns. Benches lined the path at frequent intervals in case the walker became tired of this monotonous scenery.</p><p>Rebecca wandered down one of the paths, letting her hand idly brush the scraggly hedges as she passed. Her emotions for Samuel were overwrought, she knew. She felt as if she were always nagging him for his attention, like a little child, instead of a grown woman. Why she should feel this way, she wasn\u2019t clear. Perhaps\u2014</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca started at the voice and swung around. The hedge parted to her right to reveal another one of the little square openings, and a man rose from the bench inside. He was red-haired, and for a moment she couldn\u2019t place him. He stepped forward, and she realized that it was Samuel\u2019s army friend, the one they\u2019d met in the street. She couldn\u2019t remember his name.</p><p>\u201cOh! I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, revealing lovely white teeth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d There was a pause, and she glanced around the otherwise deserted garden. \u201cUm...why...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be wondering what I\u2019m doing in your lovely garden.\u201d</p><p>She nodded gratefully.</p><p>\u201cWell, actually I came to call upon your brother,\u201d he said with a wry, confiding smile. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t in, so I came out here to wait for his return. I\u2019d hoped we could catch up a bit, your brother and I. I don\u2019t see many men from the old regiment anymore. Most died, you know, in the massacre, and the ones who didn\u2019t were scattered to other regiments immediately afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpinner\u2019s Falls,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The name of the battle was engraved on her brain now. Samuel had never mentioned it to her. She\u2019d had no inkling how important the event was to him until the ball last night.</p><p>Impulsively, she leaned toward the man. \u201cCan you tell me about Spinner\u2019s Falls? What happened there? Samuel doesn\u2019t talk of it.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up, but he nodded. \u201cOf course, of course. I understand exactly.\u201d</p><p>He clasped his hands behind his back and began strolling, his chin against his chest as he thought.</p><p>\u201cThe regiment was marching back from Quebec,\u201d he began. \u201cAfter taking the fort from the Frenchies. Quebec was well fortified, and there\u2019d been a long siege all that summer, but we\u2019d prevailed in the end. Then it was autumn, and it was thought best by those in command to retire before the weather became inclement in winter. We began marching south, toward Fort Edward. None but the officers knew our route. The Indians lurked in the woods all around us. Our commander, Colonel Darby, wished to make the fort without alerting the savages to our presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Rebecca said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sighed. \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t. The regiment was attacked in the second week. We were marching only two abreast, and the line was strung out over almost half a mile when we were ambushed.\u201d He stopped talking.</p><p>Rebecca waited, but he didn\u2019t resume. They\u2019d come to the far end of the garden by the back gate that led into the mews. She stopped and looked at Samuel\u2019s friend. What was his name? Why was she so terrible at remembering names?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>He tipped his head up to squint at the sky, then darted a look at her from the corner of his eye. \u201cThey attacked from both sides, and most of the men were killed. You know that the savages liked to cut off the scalps of their victims with their hatchets, as a kind of war trophy. You can imagine my dismay\u201d\u2014he patted his hair ruefully\u2014\u201cI actually heard one fellow shout to another that he wanted my scalp, it was so pretty.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca looked at the tips of her shoes. She wasn\u2019t sure if she was happy now to have finally heard something of what her brother had endured. Perhaps it would\u2019ve been better to remain in ignorance.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d Samuel\u2019s friend was still speaking, \u201cMacDonald wasn\u2019t so fortunate.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca blinked and glanced up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He smiled a friendly smile and patted his hair again. \u201cMacDonald. Another soldier, a friend of mine. His hair was as gingery as mine. The Indians took his scalp clean off, poor sod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU NEVER TOLD her how St. Aubyn died, did you?\u201d Sam asked that afternoon. They rode in Vale\u2019s carriage, heading into the east end of London. Thornton hadn\u2019t been at his place of business, and so now they had decided to try Ned Allen, the surviving sergeant. Sam only hoped he was sober.</p><p>Vale turned from the window. \u201cEmmie?\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course I didn\u2019t tell her that her beloved brother was crucified and then burned alive.\u201d Vale flashed a grim smile. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sam held the other man\u2019s gaze, feeling a reluctant gratitude that Vale had stood firm against what had probably been a determined assault by Lady Emeline for information. He\u2019d seen how the lady worked. Once she set her mind to it, only a very strong man would be able to hold out against her. Vale obviously was such a man. Damn him.</p><p>The viscount grunted and nodded. \u201cThen we don\u2019t have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might.\u201d</p><p>Vale raised his eyebrows.</p><p>The carriage lurched around the corner, and Sam grabbed the leather strap hanging by his head. \u201cShe wants to know what happened. How Reynaud died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Vale closed his eyes as if in pain.</p><p>Sam looked away. He realized now that a craven part of him had been hoping the other man didn\u2019t care about Lady Emeline. That their engagement was a purely practical matter. Obviously that wasn\u2019t so.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t tell her,\u201d Vale was saying. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for her to live with that image in her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Sam growled.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re in accord.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded once.</p><p>Vale looked at him and started to say something, but the carriage lurched to a stop. He glanced out the window instead. \u201cWhat a lovely part of London you\u2019ve brought me to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were in the East End stews. The crumbling buildings were packed so closely together that sometimes only a walkway wide enough for a man separated them. They\u2019d have to make the rest of the journey on foot.</p><p>Sam raised his eyebrows politely. \u201cYou can stay behind in the carriage if you\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>The other man snorted.</p><p>The door opened and a footman set the step. The servant watched them with a knitted brow as they descended. \u201cShall I come with you, my lord? \u2019Tisn\u2019t safe hereabouts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Vale clapped the man on the shoulder. \u201cStay and guard the carriage until our return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Sam led the way down a dark alley.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Vale said behind him. \u201cDo we really need to visit Ned Allen?\u201d</p><p>Sam shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t have many others to question. There weren\u2019t a lot of survivors, as you know. And Allen was an officer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHardly any survivors at all,\u201d Vale muttered. There was a splash and he swore.</p><p>Sam hid a grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your lieutenant? Horn, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthew Horn. He\u2019s traveling the continent, last I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the naturalist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMunroe?\u201d Vale\u2019s voice was casual, yet Sam knew he\u2019d somehow won the other man\u2019s complete attention.</p> <p>They entered a tiny courtyard, and Sam cast a swift glance around. The buildings here looked like they\u2019d been erected hastily after the great fire and were already in the process of decaying. They leaned ominously into the small courtyard, which, judging from the smell, was also the local privy.</p><p>\u201cThe man who survived with you,\u201d Sam said. There had been a civilian naturalist attached to the 28th, a quiet Scotsman who had been one of the men taken captive by the Wyandot.</p><p>\u201cAlistair Munroe\u2019s up in Scotland, last I heard. He has a great drafty castle and doesn\u2019t go out much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of his wounds?\u201d Sam asked softly. They ducked into the alley that led to the house Allen had a room in. Vale hadn\u2019t answered. Sam looked back.</p><p>Vale\u2019s eyes held demons, and Sam had the uneasy feeling that they might mirror his own. \u201cYou saw what those savages did to him. Would you want to go out with scars like that?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked away. It had taken almost a fortnight for the rescue party to track the Wyandot Indians back to their camp, and in that time, the captured soldiers had been tortured. Munroe\u2019s wounds had been particularly gruesome. His hands...Sam pushed the thought aside and kept walking, keeping a keen eye on the doorways and shadows they passed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Vale nodded. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWe ought to write him a letter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried. He never writes back.\u201d Vale quickened his steps until he was breathing down Sam\u2019s neck. \u201cWho are you watching for?\u201d</p><p>Sam glanced at him. \u201cI was followed the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Vale sounded cheerful. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And that fact disturbed him.</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve stirred something\u2014or someone\u2014up. Who had you been to see?\u201d</p><p>Sam stopped beside a low lintel. \u201cNed Allen lives through here.\u201d</p><p>Vale merely looked at him and raised his shaggy eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d talked to three soldiers,\u201d Sam said impatiently. \u201cBarrows and Douglas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remember them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. They were just foot soldiers and probably spent most of the massacre cowering under one of the supply wagons. They didn\u2019t seem to know anything. The third soldier was a pioneer in the army\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the fellows who cleared trees and such to make way for the marching column.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sam grimaced. \u201cHe described how he used his ax to decapitate one of the attacking Indians. He was quite proud of himself. He didn\u2019t tell me much beyond that. And I\u2019d tried to talk to Allen, but he was too drunk the first time I tracked him down. I doubt either Allen or the pioneer sent my follower.\u201d</p><p>Vale smiled. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Sam ducked to enter the building. Inside, it was cold and dark. He made his way mostly by feel and memory.</p><p>Behind him, Vale swore.</p><p>\u201cAll right back there?\u201d Sam drawled.</p><p>\u201cFine. Enjoying the quaint scenery,\u201d the viscount shot back.</p><p>Sam grinned. They climbed a series of stairs, and then he led the way to Allen\u2019s room. It was much as it had been before\u2014smelly and small. Ned Allen lay in a corner, reduced to a bundle of rags.</p><p>Sam sighed and approached the man. The smell grew worse as he neared.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d Vale muttered as he followed. He toed Allen. \u201cStinking drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Sam hunkered by the prone man and rolled him to his back. The man turned all of apiece, as if he were made of wood. A knife stuck out of his chest, the handle made of white bone. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Vale crouched beside him and stared. \u201cDamn me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Sam rose swiftly and wiped his hands against his breeches.</p><p>The room was suddenly too small, too close, too smelly. He turned, stumbling, and nearly ran from the room. He tumbled ungracefully down the stairs and out into the light. Even this grimy courtyard was better than the death room upstairs. Sam took deep breaths, trying to still the rolling nausea in his belly, aware as he made his way back into the narrow alleyway that Vale clattered behind him.</p><p>\u201cHe could\u2019ve been killed by anyone, living in this cesspit,\u201d the viscount panted.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Sam felt a grudging gratitude that the other man didn\u2019t mention his ignoble retreat. \u201cOr perhaps I was followed here before. The man who was trailing me had a bone-handled knife.\u201d</p><p>Vale sighed. \u201cThen Sergeant Allen must\u2019ve known something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Sam stopped. \u201cI should\u2019ve come back sooner.\u201d</p><p>Vale looked at him a moment and then tipped his head back to stare at the small patch of blue overhead. \u201cThere were so many.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember Tommy Pace?\u201d</p><p>A memory of a young lad\u2014too young to have told the truth about his age\u2014came to Sam. Freckled cheeks, dark hair, a small wiry frame.</p><p>\u201cHe used to pretend to shave,\u201d Vale said dreamily. \u201cDid you know that? He probably had all of three whiskers on his chin, and every morning he\u2019d be stropping his razor, so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won the razor off Ted Barnes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Vale looked at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cIn a card game. It was part of the reason Tommy was so proud of the thing.\u201d</p><p>Vale chuckled. \u201cAnd Barnes had such a heavy beard. That\u2019s irony for you.\u201d</p><p>There was silence as they both contemplated this old gossip. A rodent scurried into the shadows near a doorway.</p><p>\u201cAnd now they\u2019re both dust in the ground,\u201d Vale said softly, \u201calong with all the rest.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing to say to that, so Sam pivoted and resumed walking back to the carriage.</p><p>Vale strolled a little behind him. The alley wasn\u2019t wide enough for two men to walk abreast.</p><p>\u201cIf they were betrayed, we\u2019ll avenge them. All of them,\u201d Vale said conversationally.</p><p>Sam nodded, keeping his eyes straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go now?\u201d Vale asked.</p><p>\u201cDick Thornton. Perhaps he\u2019s returned to his place of work. We need to question him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you agree.\u201d The viscount whistled a few merry notes and then cut himself off. \u201cDid you see MacDonald\u2019s body, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d They rounded the corner, and the carriage came into view, the footmen and driver standing around it looking nervous. \u201cI never went back. I was too busy running to Fort Edward and then guiding the detachment with the ransom. That was one of the things I wanted to ask Allen: who among the regiment survived?\u201d</p><p>Vale nodded, probably busy with his own terrible memories as they made their way back to where the carriage waited.</p><p>The footmen looked relieved when they came into sight. Vale nodded to his men, and Sam entered the carriage and settled into the seat across from the viscount. The carriage lurched forward.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever thank you?\u201d Vale asked. He was watching out the window, apparently engrossed in the dismal neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sam lied. In fact, Vale had been in shock by the time the rescue party had ransomed the surviving officers at the Wyandot Indian camp. All of the captured men had run the gauntlet\u2014a double line of whooping Indian men and women who had pummeled the victim as he ran by. Then, too, from what Sam heard, Vale had been made to watch St. Aubyn\u2019s death and the torture of Munroe and the others. Vale had been in no condition to thank anyone when they\u2019d eventually rescued him.</p><p>Vale was frowning now. \u201cSo we only have Thornton\u2019s word that MacDonald is dead.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked at him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook here, if anyone had a reason to make sure the regiment never got to Fort Edward, it was MacDonald.\u201d Vale sat forward. \u201cThe man was in chains as we marched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve been hung at the fort,\u201d Sam said. \u201cRape and murder. His court-martial would\u2019ve been very short.\u201d</p><p>MacDonald had been a nasty piece of work. He and another soldier named Brown had looted a French settler\u2019s cabin, raping and killing the settler\u2019s wife when she surprised them. Unfortunately for MacDonald and his companion, the French settler\u2019s wife had turned out to be an Englishwoman\u2014and the sister of a British colonel. Looting and rape were hanging offenses, but ones that some officers might turn a blind eye to, as long as they weren\u2019t wholesale. The rape and murder of an Englishwoman was a crime that couldn\u2019t be swept under the rug. There had been a hunt within the British army, and soon soldiers had come forward with the information that Brown had drunkenly boasted of the crime. Once under arrest, Brown had soon betrayed MacDonald, and both men had been marching in chains when the 28th Regiment of Foot had been attacked.</p><p>That thought made Sam grimace. \u201cBrown might also be the traitor.\u201d</p><p>Vale nodded. \u201cMacDonald seemed to be the leader of that little gang, but you\u2019re right; Brown had just as much reason to stop the march as MacDonald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they might\u2019ve been in it together.\u201d Sam shook his head. \u201cBut in either case, how would they have known the route we\u2019d take?\u201d</p><p>Vale shrugged. \u201cWasn\u2019t Brown friends with Allen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They often shared their fire with Ned Allen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as an officer, Allen would\u2019ve known the route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might\u2019ve carried a message, if they\u2019d bribed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely not to a Frenchie?\u201d Vale\u2019s eyebrows had shot up.</p><p>\u201cNo. But all they needed was an intermediary who could take a message to a neutral Indian, and as you know, there were plenty who either switched sides or dealt with both French and English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Allen talked to someone about the route the regiment took, it would certainly be a motive to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Sam thought of the pathetic bag of bones they\u2019d just found, and grimaced. \u201cYes, it would.\u201d</p><p>Vale shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019re holes to that theory, but in any case, we need to talk to Thornton again and determine what he remembers.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned. Thornton had made him uneasy from the first. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s wise? Bringing Thornton in on this? For all we know, he\u2019s the traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to confide in him. If he thinks we trust him, he\u2019s more likely to slip.\u201d Vale touched his lips with a long, bony finger. Then he smiled, almost sweetly. \u201cKeep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>EMELINE PAUSED JUST inside Samuel\u2019s town house garden. What was Rebecca doing with Mr. Thornton\u2014alone?</p><p>\u201cYou may go now,\u201d she said absently to the butler who had shown her the way through the town house and into the garden.</p><p>She\u2019d come calling in the hopes of finding Rebecca better. Perhaps they could go hunting for a pair of dancing slippers. New slippers always cheered Emeline up, and she felt the poor girl might need some reviving after the events of last night.</p><p>It seemed Rebecca was already revived.</p> <p>Emeline squared her shoulders. \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca jumped back from Mr. Thornton and turned a woefully guilty face toward Emeline.</p><p>Mr. Thornton, in contrast, pivoted smoothly. \u201cLady Emeline, how pleasant to meet you again.\u201d</p><p>Emeline narrowed her eyes. It was a point in the man\u2019s favor that he\u2019d been properly introduced to Rebecca, but it still didn\u2019t excuse his t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with an unattended maiden. And in any case, it seemed odd to find Mr. Thornton in the garden with Rebecca so soon after talking about him with Samuel and Jasper. Very odd.</p><p>\u201cMr. Thornton.\u201d Emeline inclined her head. \u201cHow...unexpected to meet you here. Do you have business with Mr. Hartley?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled wider at her pointed question. \u201cYes, but it seems Mr. Hartley isn\u2019t at home. I was waiting here in the garden when Miss Hartley joined me and made my wait so much easier.\u201d He finished his pretty speech with a courtly little bow in Rebecca\u2019s direction.</p><p>Humph. Emeline linked her arm with Rebecca and began to stroll. \u201cI believe you said you were in trade, Mr. Thornton.\u201d</p><p>The garden path was narrow, and the man was forced to trail behind the ladies. \u201cYes, I make boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoots. Ah, I see.\u201d Emeline didn\u2019t bother looking around. The town house garden was mediocre, but she kept her pace slow as if she might actually be interested in dying foliage.</p><p>\u201cBoots are very important, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Rebecca said, coming to Mr. Thornton\u2019s defense, which was not at all what Emeline had intended.</p><p>\u201cI supply them to His Majesty\u2019s army,\u201d Mr. Thornton called from in back.</p> <p>\u201cQuite.\u201d It occurred to Emeline that Mr. Thornton might very well be rich. She had so little knowledge of the workings of the army, but she could imagine the piles of boots that would be ordered from Mr. Thornton.</p><p>\u201cAre they made here in London?\u201d Rebecca asked. She craned her neck a little to try to see him.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I have a workshop on Dover Street and employ thirty-two fellows there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do not make the boots yourself?\u201d Emeline inquired sweetly.</p><p>Rebecca gasped, but Mr. Thornton replied cheerfully enough, \u201cNo, my lady. I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t even know where to start. Father used to, of course, when he began the business, but before long he\u2019d hired other fellows to do the work for him. I might\u2019ve learned when I was young, but I had a falling-out with Pater\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you joined the army?\u201d Rebecca interrupted. She stopped and turned to face Mr. Thornton, and Emeline was forced to halt as well.</p><p>Mr. Thornton smiled, and Emeline realized that he was rather handsome in a bland sort of way. He wasn\u2019t the type of man one would notice in a crowd, but perhaps that made him all the more dangerous.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid I took the king\u2019s shilling in a fit of callow pique. Left Pater and my wife\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d Emeline cut in.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mr. Thornton\u2019s expression sobered. \u201cPoor Marie died not long after I returned home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! I am so sorry,\u201d Rebecca murmured.</p><p>Emeline looked back down the path. Someone was coming.</p><p>\u201cIt was a terrible blow,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. \u201cShe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmie! Ah, there you are.\u201d Jasper was striding up the path, his long, horsey face beaming.</p><p>Mr. Thornton stopped and turned at the sound of Jasper\u2019s voice, his features going curiously blank. But Jasper wasn\u2019t who she had expected. Confusion and a kind of disappointment shot through her, and then she saw him. Behind Jasper, Samuel followed, his eyes hooded, his expression sober.</p><p>Emeline held out her hands. \u201cWhy, Jasper, I did not expect you back until nightfall, if at all. Have you been successful in your investigations?\u201d</p><p>Jasper took her hands and bent over them, brushing a kiss against her knuckles. \u201cWe lost the trail, alas, and went hunting Mr. Thornton instead. Except he wasn\u2019t at his business, and we retired here in defeat only to find you have supplied the man we looked for.\u201d</p><p>By this time, Samuel had caught up to Jasper. \u201cLady Emeline, Rebecca.\u201d He nodded at them and then held out a hand to his guest. \u201cMr. Thornton, it is good to see you, although I confess some surprise at finding you at my house.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thornton grasped Samuel\u2019s hand in both of his. \u201cYou are no more surprised than I, Mr. Hartley. I had not intended to presume upon your hospitality, but I was in the area, and my feet led me to your house whether I willed it so or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Samuel cocked his head, watching the other man.</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe it was our reminiscences of the war the other day. I...\u201d He hesitated a moment, looking down before raising his gaze to stare frankly in Samuel\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou will think me an imaginative fellow, but I had the sensation when we talked that you did not think what happened at Spinner\u2019s Falls occurred by happenstance.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence as both men looked at each other. Samuel was fully a head taller than the other man, but there were certain similarities otherwise that were hard to overlook. They were both self-made men who worked in trade. They both carried themselves with a certain raw confidence, an ability to look a higher-born gentleman in the eye and dare him to make comment. And, Emeline sensed, to have succeeded in what they did, both men would have had to be daring. They were men who could see a chance and seize it, knowing the consequences might very well be dangerous.</p><p>At last, Samuel glanced sideways at her and Rebecca. He cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps if the ladies permit, we gentlemen should retire to my study inside to discuss this in private.\u201d</p><p>Emeline arched an eyebrow. Did he really think she could be fobbed off that easily? \u201cOh, I\u2019m most interested in what you have to say to Mr. Thornton. Please. Continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say, Emmie,\u201d Jasper began rather nervously.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at Jasper, her eyes holding Samuel\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s the least you can do, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She saw a muscle in his jaw flex, and he certainly didn\u2019t look happy, but he nodded before turning to Mr. Thornton. \u201cWe were betrayed.\u201d</p><p>Emeline felt a flicker of satisfaction. Samuel treated her as an equal, and that kind of trust was curiously heady.</p><p>Then Mr. Thornton blew out a breath. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Samuel asked softly.</p><p>\u201cAt the time, no.\u201d Mr. Thornton looked grim now. \u201cBut there were so many circumstances that had to align correctly for us to have been attacked at that point, and the fact that the Indians numbered so many\u201d\u2014he shook his head\u2014\u201cthe thing must have been planned by someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like,\u201d Jasper finally spoke. \u201cWe had meant to ask you if you were certain that MacDonald and Brown were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacDonald?\u201d For a moment, Mr. Thornton looked confused; then he glanced quickly at the ladies and nodded. \u201cOh, of course. I see where your thoughts lie, but I\u2019m afraid both men were quite dead. I helped bury them.\u201d</p><p>Emeline pursed her lips, wondering for a moment what the men weren\u2019t saying about MacDonald. She\u2019d have to ask Samuel later, in private.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Jasper muttered. \u201cIf it\u2019d been MacDonald, it would\u2019ve wrapped this up neatly. Nevertheless, we have a few more questions to make of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should adjourn inside,\u201d Samuel said. He held his arm out to his sister, but Rebecca ignored it and took Mr. Thornton\u2019s instead. Samuel\u2019s lips thinned.</p><p>Emeline hated to see him hurt. She laid her hand on Samuel\u2019s sleeve. \u201cWhat a good idea. I\u2019d enjoy some tea.\u201d</p><p>Samuel glanced from her eyes to her hand and back again. His brows rose almost imperceptibly. She tilted her chin at him. But the others were moving toward the back of the town house now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can be of any use,\u201d Mr. Thornton was saying ahead of them. \u201cThe man you really ought to talk to is Corporal Craddock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Samuel called to him.</p><p>Mr. Thornton looked over his shoulder. \u201cHe gathered the wounded after Spinner\u2019s Falls, after you\u2019d...Well, you\u2019d run into the woods. I guess you could say he was the officer in charge.\u201d</p><p>Emeline felt Samuel\u2019s arm stiffen under her fingers, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Jasper seemed not to have noticed that Mr. Thornton had nearly called Samuel a coward to his face. \u201cIs he here in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I believe he retired to the country after the war. I could be wrong, of course; one hears so many things. But I think he\u2019s in Sussex, near Portsmouth.\u201d</p><p>Emeline thought she hid it well, but Samuel must\u2019ve felt her start nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he murmured without taking his eyes from the path ahead.</p><p>She hesitated. She\u2019d just sorted her stack of invitations this morning, trying to determine the social events that would be best to attend in the upcoming month.</p><p>He looked at her, his brows drawn. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Really, what choice did she have? It was almost as if the Fates had arranged the trap, and she was the unlucky hare that had run straight into it. Was there any point in struggling at all?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been invited to the Hasselthorpe estate in Sussex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Jasper had halted and turned.</p><p>\u201cLord and Lady Hasselthorpe, dear. Remember? They invited us weeks ago, and their house isn\u2019t far from Portsmouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn me, you\u2019re right.\u201d The furrows next to Jasper\u2019s nose and mouth stretched into arcs as he grinned. \u201cWhat a stroke of luck! We can all go to this house party and then call on Craddock. That is...\u201d He looked worriedly at Mr. Thornton. Rebecca and Samuel were easily included in the invitation as friends of Emeline\u2019s. A bootmaker\u2014even a very rich one\u2014was a different matter.</p><p>But Mr. Thornton grinned and winked. \u201cNever fear, I can continue our inquiries here in London whilst you talk to Craddock.\u201d</p><p>And like that, Emeline knew that it was all decided. Her breath seemed to grow short as if her chest were being squeezed. Oh, they would argue and discuss the details back and forth, and she would need to petition Lady Hasselthorpe for invitations for the Hartleys, but in the end, it would all work out. She would be attending a house party with Samuel.</p><p>She looked up, knowing that he was watching her, and as her eyes met his warm coffee-brown ones, she wondered, Did he know what went on at house parties?</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Now, of all the things in the world that the king loved, he loved his daughter most of all. He so doted on her that whenever she asked for a thing, he did his utmost to see that she received it. Which is why, when Princess Solace begged the king for permission to marry her own guard, instead of being a trifle tetchy as most royal parents might, he simply sighed and nodded. And that is how Iron Heart came to marry the most beautiful maiden in the land and a princess to boot....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>\u201cWill you be gone a very long time?\u201d Daniel asked a week later.</p><p>He was lying on Emeline\u2019s bed, head hanging off one end, both feet in the air, completely in the way of Harris, who was packing.</p><p>\u201cProbably a fortnight,\u201d Emeline said briskly. She sat at her pretty little dresser trying to decide which jewelry to bring to the Hasselthorpe house party. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA fortnight is fourteen days. That\u2019s a terrible long time.\u201d Daniel swung a foot and got it tangled in the bed curtains.</p><p>\u201cLord Eddings!\u201d Harris exclaimed.</p><p>Really, one ought not to miss one\u2019s own offspring. She knew that. Many mothers of her rank hardly saw their children at all. Yet she hated leaving him. It was just so heart-wrenching to say good-bye.</p><p>\u201cThat will be all,\u201d Emeline told her lady\u2019s maid.</p> <p>\u201cBut, my lady, I haven\u2019t half finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Emeline smiled at Harris. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working so hard, you must be in need of refreshment. Why don\u2019t you take some tea in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Harris pursed her lips, but she knew better than to contradict her mistress. She set down the pile of clothes she\u2019d been holding and marched out of the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Emeline got up and went to the bed, shoving aside the mound of petticoats laid out on the surface to make a space. Then she sat, her back against the great oak headboard, her legs straight in front of her on the bed. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Daniel scrambled toward her like an eager puppy. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p> <p>He squirmed against her, smelling of little boy sweat, his knobby knees digging into her hip.</p><p>She stroked his blond curls. \u201cI know, darling. But I shan\u2019t be gone overlong, and I shall write you every day.\u201d</p><p>More silent squirming. His face was hidden against her breast.</p><p>\u201cTante Cristelle will stay here with you,\u201d Emeline whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you shall have any currant buns or sticky sweets or pies at all whilst I\u2019m gone. You\u2019ll have quite wasted away by the time I return and look like a stick boy and I shan\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><p>Breathy giggles came from her side until his blue eyes surfaced once again. \u201cSilly. Tante will give me lots of sweets.\u201d</p><p>Emeline feigned shock. \u201cDo you think so? She\u2019s very severe with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fat when you come back.\u201d He puffed out his cheeks to show her.</p><p>She laughed appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cI can talk to Mr. Hartley, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>Emeline blinked, startled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, darling, but Mr. Hartley and his sister will be at the house party as well.\u201d</p><p>Her son\u2019s lower lip protruded.</p><p>\u201cHave you been talking to Mr. Hartley often?\u201d</p><p>He darted a look at her. \u201cI talk to him over the wall, and sometimes I go to visit him in his garden. But I don\u2019t bother him, really I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Emeline was skeptical about this last. Right now, though, her mind was more taken up with the notion that Daniel and Samuel seemed to have formed a bond without her even knowing it. She wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about that.</p> <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by the squirming imp beside her. \u201cCan you sing me my song?\u201d he asked in a small voice.</p><p>So she stroked his hair and sang \u201cBilly Boy,\u201d changing the name to Danny as she had since he was a baby, making it his song.</p><p>Oh, where have you been,</p><p>Danny Boy, Danny Boy?</p><p>Oh, where have you been,</p><p>Charming Danny?</p><p>And as she sang, Emeline wondered what the next fortnight would bring.</p><p>THE RENTED CARRIAGE was not as well-sprung as Lady Emeline\u2019s vehicle, and Sam was beginning to regret deciding to ride inside with Rebecca instead of renting a horse for himself. But he and Becca had hardly talked in the week since the disastrous Westerton ball, and he\u2019d hoped that the enforced time together would break the spell.</p><p>So far, it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Rebecca sat across from him and stared out the window as if the view of hedges and fields were the most fascinating in the world. Her profile wasn\u2019t a classic one, but it was very pleasing to him. Sometimes, when he caught sight of her out of the corner of his eye, he\u2019d have a flash of recognition. She looked a little like their mother.</p><p>Sam cleared his throat. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a dance, I think.\u201d</p><p>Becca turned and wrinkled her brow at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say, I think there\u2019ll be a dance. At the house party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d She didn\u2019t seem particularly interested.</p><p>He\u2019d thought she\u2019d be delighted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ruined the last one for you.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath as if exasperated. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me, Samuel?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a moment, trying to understand what she meant. Then a horrible chill crept through his belly. Surely she wasn\u2019t talking about...\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d Her lips crimped in her frustration. \u201cYou never talk to me; you never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not saying anything!\u201d She spoke the words too loudly and then looked chagrined. \u201cYou never say anything, even when people make terrible accusations about you. Mr. Thornton came close to calling you a coward to your face when we were in the garden last week, and you never said a word to him. Why can\u2019t you defend yourself at least?\u201d</p><p>He felt his lip curl. \u201cWhat people like Thornton say isn\u2019t worth replying to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather remain silent and let yourself be condemned?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. There was no way to explain his actions to her.</p><p>\u201cSamuel, I\u2019m not those people. Even if you won\u2019t justify yourself to them, you must talk to me. We are the only family we have left. Uncle Thomas is dead, and Father and Mother died before I could ever know them. Is it so wrong that I want to be closer to you? That I want to know what my brother faced in the war?\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to stare out the window now, and he swallowed bile. There seemed to be the smell of men\u2019s sweat in the close carriage, but he knew that it was his brain playing abominable tricks on him. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to talk of war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I\u2019ve heard other men do so,\u201d she said softly. \u201cCalvary officers bragging of charges and sailors talking of battles at sea.\u201d</p><p>He frowned impatiently. \u201cThey\u2019re not...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what?\u201d She leaned forward over her knees as if she would will the words from him. \u201cTell me, Samuel.\u201d</p><p>He held her gaze, although it caused him physical pain to do so. \u201cThe soldiers who have seen close action, the soldiers who have felt another man\u2019s breath before taking it from him...\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cThose soldiers hardly ever speak about it. It\u2019s not something we want to remember. It hurts.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence, and then she whispered, \u201cThen what can you talk about? There must be something.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, and a rueful smile curved his lips at a memory. \u201cThe rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it rains on a march, there\u2019s nowhere to hide. The men and their clothes and all the provisions get wet. The trail turns to mud beneath your boots, and the men begin to slip. And once one falls, it\u2019s a rule, it seems, that half a dozen will fall next, their clothes and hair all over mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely you can pitch a tent when you stop for the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can, but the tent will be wet as well by then and the ground underneath a sea of mud, and in the end, one wonders if it would be better to simply sleep in the open.\u201d</p><p>She was smiling at him, and his heart lightened at the sight. \u201cPoor Samuel! I never dreamed you spent so much time in the mud as a soldier. I always imagined you performing heroic feats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heroic feats mostly involved a kettle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kettle?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, relaxing against the carriage seat now. \u201cAfter a day\u2019s march in the rain, our provisions were always wet, including the dry peas and meal.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cWet meal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWet and sticky. And sometimes we\u2019d have to make it last another week, wet or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it mold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery often. By the end of that week, the meal might be mostly green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She covered her nose as if she could smell the rotten meal. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and whispered, \u201cAh, this is quite the secret. Many in the army wanted to know what I did with my little kettle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teasing now. Tell me what you did with a kettle that was so heroic.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged modestly. \u201cOnly fed my entire camp with rotten meal. I found that if I rinsed the meal three times and then threw it in with a kettle full of water, it made a nice soup. Of course, it was better on the days I\u2019d caught a rabbit or squirrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow absolutely awful,\u201d his sister said.</p><p>\u201cYou did ask.\u201d He grinned at her. She was talking to him, and he\u2019d bore her to death with silly stories of army life if it made her happy.</p><p>\u201cSamuel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, dear?\u201d His heart squeezed at her uncertain expression. She was right; they were their only family left to each other. It was important that she not grow distant. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, and he was reminded of how young she was. \u201cDo you think they will converse with me, all these titled English ladies?\u201d</p><p>He wished in that moment that he could smooth the way for her, make sure that she was never hurt for the rest of her life. But he could only tell the truth. \u201cI think most will. There\u2019s bound to be a girl or two who will have their noses in the air, but those are the sort who aren\u2019t worth talking to, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m so nervous. I never seem to know what to do with my hands, and I wonder if my hair has been properly done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve that maid Lady Emeline found for you. I\u2019ll be there and Lady Emeline as well. She at least will not let you go out with your hair improperly done. And I think you perfect in any case.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, her cheeks tinting a delicate pink. \u201cDo you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I shall remember that my brother was the best rotten meal soup maker in His Majesty\u2019s army, and I shall hold my head high.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and she grinned back. The carriage bumped over something in the road, and Sam looked out the window to see that they were crossing a narrow stone bridge, the carriage\u2019s sides nearly scraping the walls.</p><p>Rebecca\u2019s gaze followed his. \u201cAre we coming to a town?\u201d</p><p>He pushed aside the curtain to peer farther ahead. \u201cNo.\u201d He let the curtain drop and looked at her. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be much longer now, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness. I am sore.\u201d She shifted restlessly in her seat. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity poor Mr. Thornton could not come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d She wrinkled her brow. \u201cIt does seem hypocritical, doesn\u2019t it? I mean, that he\u2019s not been invited just because he makes boots? You\u2019re in trade, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the Colonies, I don\u2019t think we would make such a fine distinction.\u201d She frowned down at her hands.</p><p>Sam was silent. The fact was, these kinds of distinctions between men\u2019s rank bothered him as well.</p><p>\u201cIt seems so much harder, here in England, for a man to raise himself purely by merit alone.\u201d Rebecca was nibbling her lip now, still staring down at her hands. \u201cEven Mr. Thornton had his father\u2019s business, small though it might have originally been. A man who hadn\u2019t even that\u2014who was perhaps a servant\u2014could he ever become respectable?\u201d</p><p>Sam narrowed his eyes, wondering if she was thinking of a particular servant. \u201cPerhaps. With a bit of luck and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not likely, is it?\u201d She looked up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t very likely that a man who labors as a servant will become a man of means in England. Most will live and die a servant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lips parted as if she would say something further. Then she closed them firmly and gazed out the window instead. They were silent again, but this time the silence was a companionable one. Sam closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the seat. He wondered sleepily just how much his sister\u2019s questions were prompted by O\u2019Hare the footman.</p><p>He dozed a bit, and when he next woke, the carriage was turning into an enormous drive.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very large, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Rebecca said in a small voice.</p><p>Sam had to agree. The Hasselthorpe home was more a rolling mansion. It squatted complacently at the end of the gravel drive, in the middle of a vast field of mown grass, all the better to reflect its glory. Several generations had obviously been at work on the gray stone structure. Here were gothic windows, there, Tudor chimneys; the different styles jumbled together only gave notice that the family that lived here had been in residence for centuries. In front, the drive circled and there were already four carriages there, depositing gentlemen and ladies of the ton.</p> <p>Samuel straightened and gave a reassuring smile to Rebecca. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS A perfect day for an outdoor picnic, Emeline reflected the next morning. The sun shone and the sky was bright blue with fluffy white clouds. There was a tiny little breeze, just enough to play with the ribbons on the ladies\u2019 hats, but not so much that it blew their hats off. The gentlemen looked handsome and manly. The ladies pretty and delicate. The grass was still green and the view lovely: rolling hills with a few sheep to give it interest. One couldn\u2019t ask for more.</p><p>Or rather one shouldn\u2019t have to ask for more, because unfortunately, Lady Hasselthorpe had forgotten the wine. To be fair, the lack of drink was technically the fault of the housekeeper, but every lady knew that the servant reflected the mistress. A good chatelaine hired a competent housekeeper. An absentminded chatelaine made do with a housekeeper who forgot to pack the wine.</p><p>Emeline sighed. It was funny how thirsty one became the moment it was discovered that there wasn\u2019t anything to drink. The first footman had already sent back several of his fellows for the wine, but as the luncheon party had walked over half an hour to find this lovely spot, it would take some time.</p><p>Lady Hasselthorpe flitted about her guests, her cheeks pink, her hands fluttering helplessly. She was a great beauty with golden hair, a wide, smooth forehead, and a tiny rosebud mouth, but alas, her intellect did not nearly match her looks. Emeline had once spent an excruciating twenty minutes in her company at a ball, trying to make conversation, only to realize that her companion was incapable of following her thoughts to a logical conclusion.</p> <p>Emeline wished very much that Melisande were here, but Melisande wouldn\u2019t arrive until tomorrow. A burst of overloud laughter drew her gaze. Jasper was in the midst of a group of gentlemen, and as she watched, he set them all roaring with laughter again with something he said. In contrast, Lord Hasselthorpe stood in grave conversation with the most illustrious guest, the Duke of Lister. Both Hasselthorpe and Lister were important members of Parliament, and Emeline suspected that their host had even higher political ambitions. She watched Lister send Jasper an irritated glance, which her fianc\u00e9 never even noticed. The duke was a tall, balding man of middling years well known for his ill humor.</p><p>\u201cWill you stroll with me?\u201d Samuel\u2019s deep voice came by her side.</p><p>Emeline turned, unsurprised. She\u2019d known the moment he started walking toward her. It was strange but she found that she always seemed to be aware of his movements. \u201cI thought you were angry with me, Mr. Hartley.\u201d</p><p>Where another man might have prevaricated, Samuel met her head-on. \u201cNot angry so much as disappointed that you plan to marry for convenience instead of passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t understand why you would wish to stroll with me, if you\u2019re so insulted by my choice.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time they\u2019d been able to speak alone since the argument with Jasper, over a week ago now, and that disastrous kiss afterward. She glanced at Jasper. Her fianc\u00e9 was in the midst of some sort of story, his long face animated, and he wasn\u2019t looking their way at all.</p> <p>Samuel bent his head toward hers. \u201cDon\u2019t you? I think you\u2019re quite sophisticated enough to understand my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, I don\u2019t like to stroll with a gentleman insufficiently in control of his temper.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close, his eyes searching hers, and while there was a small smile playing about his lips for the benefit of the other house party guests around them, she knew that he wasn\u2019t at all amused. \u201cQuit attempting to start an argument and walk with me.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hasselthorpe turned in their direction at that moment. For some reason, their hostess had chosen to wear exceedingly wide panniers draped with lavender and orange satin for a ramble in the countryside. Now her fashionable skirts swayed incongruously, the hem sweeping against the grass.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lady Emeline, do say you aren\u2019t disappointed in me! I can\u2019t think what became of the wine. I shall have to dismiss Mrs. Leaping immediately on our return. Except\u201d\u2014she twisted her hands at her waist in a pretty, confused, and altogether useless way\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know where else I\u2019ll find a housekeeper. They are so dear about these parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding a good housekeeper is always a problem,\u201d Emeline murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd look, that woman is all by herself.\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe indicated a strikingly handsome blond woman in a green frock that showcased an amazing bosom. \u201cShe\u2019s the duke\u2019s special friend, you know. He insisted we invite her, and naturally no other lady will speak to her.\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe knitted her brow fretfully. \u201cAnd with no wine! Whatever am I to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we investigate the progress of bringing back the wine?\u201d Samuel asked gravely before Emeline could say anything.</p> <p>\u201cOh, will you, Mr. Hartley, Lady Emeline? I\u2019d be ever so grateful.\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe glanced about vaguely. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to be the one to talk to Mrs. Fitzwilliam. Won\u2019t that just be daring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, my lady.\u201d Samuel bowed. \u201cMeanwhile, we\u2019ll seek out your wine. Lady Emeline?\u201d He held out his arm to her.</p><p>Which made it impossible to refuse.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Emeline smiled and rested her fingertips on the diabolical man\u2019s forearm, too aware of the heat emanating from his body. She only hoped that the heat wasn\u2019t reflected in her face.</p><p>As they walked over the downs, he paced his longer strides to hers, and they soon left the picnickers behind. Now that he had his way and they were strolling together, she\u2019d expected him to immediately start a conversation, but instead he was silent. She peered at him out of the corner of her eye. He had a slight frown on his face as he watched the path. What was he thinking? And why in the world should she care?</p><p>She huffed out a breath of air and turned her own eyes forward again. It was a beautiful day, after all. Why let a surly companion spoil\u2014</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that young man talking to Rebecca and the other girls?\u201d Samuel\u2019s voice cut into her thoughts.</p><p>And how silly to feel a twinge of disappointment that he\u2019d begun the conversation with his sister. Had he forgotten all about the kiss he\u2019d given her the week before? Perhaps he had. Well, then, so would she. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>Samuel waved a hand impatiently. \u201cThe one with the idiot laugh.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Unfortunately, that described the young man rather too well. \u201cMr. Theodore Green. He has a very nice annual income and an estate in Oxford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything else about him?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, feeling contrary. \u201cWhat else is there to know? I don\u2019t believe he gambles.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her with something like disappointment in his eyes. \u201cIs that the only way in which you judge a man? His income?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd rank, of course,\u201d she drawled.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the nephew of a baron. A very nice catch for Rebecca, if she can overlook the idiot laugh,\u201d she said as if considering. Something seemed to drive her to provoke this man. \u201cReally, I don\u2019t think we can aim any higher for her. Your colonial money will only buy her into a certain level of society and no further. I\u2019m afraid your family can be of no consequence in the matter.\u201d</p><p>His lip curled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t as shallow as you pretend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d She was glad she faced forward, for she wasn\u2019t sure she could control her expression. The wind picked up the hem of her skirts playfully, and she batted them down.</p><p>\u201cAll this talk of money and rank. As if that was all that made a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are discussing your sister and prospective husbands, are we not? How would you have me judge a gentleman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharacter, intellect, kindness to others,\u201d he listed rapidly. His tone was low and intense. They\u2019d crested a little hill, and golden fields demarcated by hedges and low stone walls lay before them. \u201cHow he fulfills his duty and looks after those who depend on him. There are any number of points I\u2019d place above income in a man I would wish Rebecca to marry.\u201d</p><p>Emeline pursed her lips. \u201cSo, then, if I found a kind, intelligent beggar in the street, you would immediately want to draw up a marriage contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be obtuse.\u201d His arm was hard as rock under her fingers. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t become you, and you know perfectly well what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d She gave a short laugh. \u201cI beg your pardon, but perhaps I am obtuse. Here in England, we like to marry our daughters and sisters to gentlemen who can properly keep them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if the man is a rakehell or a half-wit or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d He was striding so fast now that she had to skip to keep up. \u201cWe think only of money and rank because we\u2019re such greedy wretches. Why, if I could find an earl with twenty thousand a year, I\u2019d marry him even if he were riddled with disease and senile to boot!\u201d</p><p>He stopped short and grabbed her by the upper arms, which was just as well, as she would\u2019ve fallen otherwise. When she looked up into his face, she knew that she ought to be afraid. He was pale with rage, his mouth twisted in a sneer. Fear, however, was the last thing she felt.</p><p>\u201cCat,\u201d he hissed at her, and then he lifted her nearly off her feet to bring her mouth to his.</p><p>The word kiss did not adequately describe their embrace. His mouth ground down on hers, forcing her lips apart, forcing her to accept his tongue. And she gloried in it. She met his rage with her own fury. She gripped at his shoulders and dug her fingernails into the fabric of his coat. Had she access to his bare skin, she would\u2019ve scored him, marked him with her despair and been glad. She was panting, almost crying, her mouth working under his, their teeth scraping against each other inelegantly. There was no finesse, no pretty caress in their kiss. This was a display of lust and anger.</p><p>She could smell his skin. He wore no powder or pomades or perfume, it was purely him, and she was driven mad by his scent. She wanted to tear the coat from his shoulders, rip off his shirt and neckcloth and bury her nose in his naked neck. The desire was animalistic and nearly out of control and that was what finally made her stop. She pulled her head back and saw that he watched her almost analytically. His eyes were far more calm than she felt.</p><p>Damn him! How dare he not be as affected as she?</p><p>He must\u2019ve seen the anger in her eyes. His mouth curved, though not into a smile. \u201cYou do it apurpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped in real confusion.</p><p>He studied her face. \u201cYou argue with me, enrage me, until I can\u2019t stand it anymore and kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that as if I plan to make you kiss me.\u201d She pulled at his grip, but he wouldn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you do,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI think you feel you can only accept my touch when it is forced upon you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prove it,\u201d he murmured as his head lowered to hers again. \u201cSheath your claws and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his lips softly over hers, a caress that was almost reverent. She gasped, parting her lips, and he kissed her openmouthed. Lushly. Sweetly. She could drown in a kiss like this; it was much more dangerous than their near-violent sparring of before. This kiss spoke of yearning, of need. She shook at the possibility that this man could want her so much. And that she wanted him in return. She knew she shouldn\u2019t, but she pressed her mouth back at his. She kissed Samuel, all her hopeless yearning caught in the whisper of breath between them. If only she\u2014</p> <p>He suddenly raised his head, and she opened her eyes dazedly, missing his mouth.</p><p>He was looking over her shoulder. \u201cThe footmen Lady Hasselthorpe sent back are about to join us. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her hands were trembling, but she buried them in her skirts and turned, pasting a bored expression on her face. The footmen were indeed trudging up the little hill, carrying a basket of wine bottles between them. They didn\u2019t look particularly interested, so perhaps the footmen had missed their explosive embrace.</p><p>\u201cWill you take my arm?\u201d He held it out.</p><p>She took it, trying to steady her shaking senses. When had she become so impulsive? The effect Samuel Hartley had on her was not one she relished. He seemed to tear the veil of civilization from her limbs. He left her naked and exposed. She was an unsophisticated creature all emotion and nerves, crouching without a mask at his feet, unable to control her basest compulsions. She ought to refuse his arm and run as fast as she could away from him. She needed to find her old self, to soothe her raw nerves with the rituals of polite society.</p> <p>Instead, as she laid her fingers on his arm, she felt when he threw a triumphant look at her, as if she had conceded something.</p><p>LADY EMELINE\u2019S TOUCH soothed him, even if it was given reluctantly, and the scent of lemon balm drifted close to his face. Sam closed his eyes for a second, trying to regain control of himself before the footmen were upon them. He\u2019d been a soldier, had faced down screaming native warriors and not broken rank. Yet, place him with Lady Emeline and in seconds he was sweating. He whispered a curse as the footmen tramped closer. This had to stop. She was an aristocrat and not for him.</p><p>He let his face relax and hailed the footmen. \u201cWe were sent to look for you. May I help you carry that?\u201d He indicated the full basket of wine.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. Thank you, sir,\u201d the elder man replied. His breath was short, and his companion\u2019s face was red, but there was an undertone of shock to his voice. Obviously a gentleman was not supposed to offer to help a servant.</p><p>Sam sighed and turned with Lady Emeline to lead the way back to the picnic. \u201cYour people revere divisions between men.\u201d</p><p>She peered up at him, a little frown creasing her brows. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>He gestured to the footmen panting behind them. \u201cEvery little detail of rank, every little opportunity to separate one fellow from another. You English worship the tiniest difference between men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying there are no differing classes in the Colonies? Because if you are, I won\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are differences, but take my word that station is not nearly so idolized there as here. In America, a man can raise himself above the rank he was born with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs has your friend, Mr. Thornton.\u201d She tapped his arm for emphasis. \u201cAn Englishman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThornton wasn\u2019t invited to this pretty house party, was he?\u201d He watched her face flush a becoming dark pink and suppressed a smile. She hated to lose an argument. \u201cHe may\u2019ve raised his standing and wealth, but obviously he is still not considered good enough for the gentlefolk in your society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, Mr. Hartley,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou served in the army. Don\u2019t try to tell me that you weren\u2019t aware of rank there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we had ranks,\u201d he replied bitterly. \u201cAnd some of the worse fools were placed above me, made generals even, solely on the basis of their birth. You needs must find a better argument than that, if you\u2019re to convince me of the good in ranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas my brother a bad soldier?\u201d she asked stiffly.</p> <p>He damned himself for a cad. God! How could he be so thoughtless? Naturally she would think of her brother first. \u201cNo. Captain St. Aubyn was one of the best officers I ever knew.\u201d</p><p>Her head was down bent, her lips thinned. For such an argumentative woman, she could be very vulnerable sometimes. It hurt him, somewhere in his chest, to see her so. It was odd, her vitriolic tongue made him feel alive, made him want to seize her and kiss her until she moaned beneath his mouth. But when she revealed a rare weakness, she crushed him. Pray she only let show her vulnerability with him. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of another man seeing that part of her. He wanted to be the only one to protect that softness.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jasper?\u201d she asked now. \u201cWas he a good officer as well? Somehow I cannot see him leading men. Playing cards and jesting with them, yes. Ordering them about, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you do not know your fianc\u00e9 very well.\u201d</p><p>Her head came up and she scowled at him. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jasper since I was in leading strings.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think you ever know a man until you see how he faces death.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d come within sight of the picnic spot now. Lady Emeline looked over to where Jasper remained in the midst of a group of laughing gentlemen. He\u2019d doffed his coat for some reason\u2014most improperly\u2014and stood gesturing in his waistcoat and shirtsleeves, long arms flapping in the air like a great gander. As they watched, another wave of laughter went through the group.</p><p>\u201cLord Vale was the most courageous man in battle I ever knew,\u201d Sam said thoughtfully.</p><p>Lady Emeline turned to stare at him, her eyebrows raised.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him fall from a horse shot out from underneath him. Seen him get up bloodied and keep fighting, even when all around him were dying. He faced battle\u2014faced death\u2014as if he had no fear. Sometimes he smiled as he fought.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, watching Jasper caper about. \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t have any fear.\u201d</p><p>Sam slowly shook his head. \u201cOnly fools have no fear at all in battle, and Lord Vale is no fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he is an accomplished actor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur rescuers!\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe flew at them, her pale hands fluttering helplessly. \u201cOh, thank you, Mr. Hartley and Lady Emeline. You\u2019ve saved my little alfresco party from disaster.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled and bowed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d Lady Emeline asked quietly as their hostess flitted about, getting in the footmen\u2019s way.</p><p>Sam glanced at her in question.</p><p>\u201cHow do you face death?\u201d she clarified, her voice so low only he could hear.</p><p>He felt his face freeze. \u201cAs well as I might.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head gently. \u201cI think you must\u2019ve been just as much a hero as Jasper in battle.\u201d</p><p>He looked away. He could not meet her eyes. \u201cThere are no heroes on the battlefield, my lady; there are only survivors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re modest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was too intense, he knew. He was in danger of drawing attention. But he could not banter about this subject, of all things. \u201cI am not a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmie!\u201d Lord Vale hailed them. \u201cCome have some pigeon pie before it is all devoured. I have risked my very life to save you a slice or two. I fear the roast chicken is already disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded to Vale, but he leaned down and whispered in Lady Emeline\u2019s ear before he led her there, because it was important she not have any illusions about him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever think me a hero.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>So all of the things that the old wizard had promised came to pass. Iron Heart lived in a wonderful castle with Princess Solace as his bride. He had purple and crimson clothes to wear, and there were servants everywhere to wait upon him. Of course, he still could not speak, for that would break the promise he\u2019d made the wizard, but Iron Heart found that silence was not such a very bad hardship. After all, a soldier is rarely asked his opinion....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>\u201cThat scowl on your face does not become you,\u201d Melisande murmured the next morning.</p><p>Emeline tried to smooth her forehead, but she had a feeling her irritation still showed through. She was watching Samuel, after all. \u201cI wish you had come down yesterday instead of today.\u201d</p><p>Melisande raised an eyebrow fractionally. \u201cHad I known that you would pine for my company, I would\u2019ve, dear. Is that why your mood is so gray?\u201d</p><p>Emeline sighed and interlocked her arm with her friend\u2019s. \u201cNo. My mood has nothing at all to do with you except as you make me feel calmer.\u201d</p><p>They stood on the long mown lawn at the back of Hasselthorpe House. Half of the house party had assembled here for target shooting, the other half having chosen to go into the nearby town to see what sights there were. Painted canvas targets were being erected at the far end of the lawn by footmen. Behind the targets were straw bundles to catch the balls that were fired. The gentlemen who intended to participate were standing about showing off their weapons to admiring ladies who were, of course, to be the audience.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hartley\u2019s gun is awfully long,\u201d Melisande commented. \u201cNo doubt that is why you are glaring at him so ferociously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does he have to stand apart?\u201d Emeline muttered. She picked fretfully at her rose and green striped skirts. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the man goes out of his way to be different from the other gentlemen. I declare he does it just to aggravate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s probably the first thing he thinks about when he wakes in the morning. \u2018How shall I go about aggravating Lady Emeline today?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Emeline looked at her friend, who was staring back with innocent wide brown eyes. \u201cI\u2019m being a ninny, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, dear, I didn\u2019t say ninny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you didn\u2019t have to.\u201d Emeline sighed. \u201cI brought something that I want to show you.\u201d</p><p>Melisande looked at her, brows raised. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a book of fairy tales that my old nanny used to read to us. I found it recently, but I think it\u2019s written in German. Can you translate it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try,\u201d her friend said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t promise anything. My German is only fair, and there are many words I don\u2019t know. A product of learning it from my mother and not a book.\u201d</p><p>Emeline nodded. Melisande\u2019s mother had been a Prussian who had never entirely learned English, despite marrying at the age of seventeen, and Melisande had grown up speaking both German and English. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The targets in place, the last footman began to walk toward the shooting party. The gentlemen bent their heads together in a grave manner, evidently deciding in what order they should shoot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he causes all intelligent thought to flee my mind.\u201d Emeline realized she was glowering at Samuel again.</p><p>Unlike the other gentlemen, he didn\u2019t make a show of aiming his weapon and such. He held his rifle with the butt resting on the ground as he stood casually, one hip cocked. He caught her eye and nodded, unsmiling. Emeline looked quickly away, but she could still see in her mind\u2019s eye his plain brown coat, the now-familiar dull leather leggings, and the wind ruffling the hair on his bare head. Nothing about his dress recommended him. Even with the other gentlemen attired for shooting in the country, Samuel could\u2019ve been a servant, so much more plain were his clothes. And yet, she had to exert her will to refrain from looking at him again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tugged at a bit of lace at her throat. \u201cHe kissed me yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Melisande stilled. \u201cMr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She could feel his eyes on her, even though she had not looked at him again.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you kiss him back?\u201d her friend asked as if she inquired the price of ribbons from a vendor.</p> <p>\u201cGod.\u201d Emeline choked on the word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll assume that means yes,\u201d Melisande murmured. \u201cHe is a handsome man, in a rather primitive way, but I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve thought that he\u2019d attract you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>But her heart knew she lied. This was like a horrible fever. She actually grew flushed whenever he was near. She was quite unable to control her body\u2014or herself\u2014when around the awful man. Emeline had never felt this wild in her life, not even with Danny, and that thought made her bite her lip. Danny had been so young, so gay, and she had been young and gay with him. It didn\u2019t seem right to have stronger feelings now for another man\u2014a man not even her husband.</p><p>Melisande glanced at her skeptically. \u201cThen you will avoid him in the future, no doubt.\u201d</p> <p>Emeline turned her head so that Samuel wasn\u2019t in her line of sight at all. Instead, she stared at an ornamental pond behind the targets. It looked like it was filled with reeds. Lady Hasselthorpe should\u2019ve had the pond cleared before the house party. Mrs. Fitzwilliam stood by herself near the bank, poor woman. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise lady would seek out her fianc\u00e9\u2019s company, of course,\u201d Melisande murmured.</p><p>Jasper was part of the shooting party, naturally. He loved anything to do with physical exertion. Unlike Samuel, though, he was in constant movement\u2014one moment crouching on the ground for some reason, the next bounding up to the footmen to help with straightening the targets. For a moment, Emeline remembered what Samuel had said about Jasper: that he fought as if he\u2019d had no fear. That was certainly not the man she knew. But then again, maybe a woman never really knew the men in her life.</p><p>Emeline shook her head. None of that mattered. \u201cThis has nothing to do with Jasper. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have an understanding with him,\u201d her friend reminded her neutrally.</p><p>\u201cAn understanding, yes. That\u2019s exactly what it is. Jasper\u2019s heart is not involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Melisande glanced at her toes, pursing her lips. \u201cI think he has a certain fondness for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sees me as a sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be the basis for a loving union\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has other women.\u201d</p><p>Melisande didn\u2019t say anything, and Emeline wondered if she\u2019d shocked her friend. It was to be expected that an aristocratic gentleman would have affairs, both before and after a marriage, but it was considered gauche to speak of such things aloud.</p><p>\u201cYou had no quarrel with that before,\u201d Melisande said. The gentlemen were beginning to order themselves as to who would shoot first. \u201cCome, let us go watch the target shooting.\u201d</p><p>They strolled toward the shooters.</p><p>\u201cI still have no quarrel with Jasper\u2019s feelings for me,\u201d Emeline said low. \u201cIn fact, I believe a kind regard toward one\u2019s spouse is for the best in marriage. Far better than desperate passion.\u201d</p> <p>She felt Melisande\u2019s sharp glance, but her friend did not comment. They had neared the group of gentlemen shooters now. The Duke of Lister stepped forward and made a show of preparing to shoot. No doubt he\u2019d been given the first shot as a badge of his rank.</p><p>\u201cNasty man,\u201d Melisande muttered.</p><p>Emeline raised her eyebrows. \u201cThe duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. He drags his mistress about like a little dog on a chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to mind.\u201d Emeline glanced at Mrs. Fitzwilliam again. She was shielding her eyes to watch the shot, her golden hair glinting in the sunshine. She appeared perfectly relaxed.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t show any vexation, can she, if she\u2019s to keep her position?\u201d Melisande frowned at her, and Emeline suddenly felt rather dim-witted. \u201cBut all the same, it must be wretched. None of the ladies will talk to her and yet he is perfectly respectable.\u201d</p><p>The duke raised the gun to his shoulder.</p><p>Melisande covered her ears with her hands as he fired, and she winced when the sound of the shot echoed off Hasselthorpe House. \u201cWhy do guns have to be so loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that we ladies can be duly impressed, I expect,\u201d Emeline said absently.</p><p>A footman advanced ceremonially toward the target and painted a black circle around the bullet hole so that all could see where it had hit. Lister\u2019s shot was near the edge of the target. He scowled, but the watching ladies clapped enthusiastically. Mrs. Fitzwilliams started forward as if to congratulate her protector, but the man didn\u2019t notice her and turned away to talk loudly with Lord Hasselthorpe. Emeline watched as the woman halted uncertainly before smiling and strolling back to the edge of the lake. Melisande was right. Obviously it wasn\u2019t an easy job being a mistress.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t the gentlemen look manly!\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe fluttered toward them. Today their hostess was dressed in pink-dotted dimity over wide panniers. Many pink and green ribbons decorated her elaborately draped skirts, and she held a white shepherd\u2019s crook in one hand. Apparently she fancied herself a rustic shepherdess, although Emeline doubted many shepherdesses wore panniers whilst tending sheep. \u201cI do so love to watch the gentlemen show off their prowess.\u201d</p><p>She was interrupted by another loud bang!</p><p>Melisande started at the sound. \u201cLovely,\u201d she said with a strained smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Mr. Hartley is next with his odd gun.\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe squinted toward the gentlemen\u2014she was notoriously nearsighted but refused to wear spectacles. \u201cDo you think it will fire properly with such a long barrel? Perhaps it will explode. That would be most exciting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Emeline said.</p><p>Samuel stepped up to the mark and stood for a moment simply looking at the target. Emeline frowned, wondering what he was doing. Then, almost faster than her eye could follow, he lifted the rifle to his shoulder, aimed, and fired.</p><p>There was a stunned silence from his audience. The footman with the paintbrush started toward the target. Samuel had already turned aside even as everyone else waited to see where the ball had hit. Solemnly, the footman painted a black circle at the very center of the target.</p><p>\u201cMy God, he\u2019s hit a bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d one of the gentlemen finally murmured.</p><p>The ladies clapped, the gentlemen crowding around Samuel to examine his gun.</p><p>\u201cLord, I hate the sound of a gun firing,\u201d Melisande muttered as she lowered her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou should have brought lint for your ears,\u201d Emeline said absently.</p><p>Samuel hadn\u2019t blinked as he shot. Not as he\u2019d raised the gun to his shoulder, not at the sound of the shot, and not as the smoke from the flintlock had wafted over him. The other gentlemen handled a gun easily; they probably went hunting and target shooting fairly often at country parties like this one. But none of them had shown the absolute familiarity that Samuel displayed. She could imagine that he\u2019d know how to shoot that gun in the dark, while running, or while being attacked. In fact, he probably had.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Melisande muttered, \u201cthat would certainly improve my appearance if I had lint growing out of my ears like a rabbit.\u201d</p><p>Emeline laughed at the image of her friend with rabbit ears, and Samuel turned as if he could hear her amusement. She caught her breath as his eyes met hers. He stared for a moment, his dark eyes intense even across the distance that separated them, and then turned away as Lord Hasselthorpe said something to him. Emeline could feel the blood pulsing in her head.</p><p>\u201cWhatever am I to do?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDAMN GOOD SHOT, that,\u201d Vale murmured from behind Sam.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Sam watched as their host prepared to shoot. Hasselthorpe stood with his feet too close together and was in danger of falling or at least staggering when he fired.</p><p>\u201cBut then you always were a good shot,\u201d Vale continued. \u201cRemember that time you got five squirrels for our dinner?\u201d</p><p>Sam shrugged. \u201cNot that it did much good. They still hardly filled the stew pot. Too scrawny.\u201d</p><p>He was aware that Lady Emeline stood not twenty feet away, her head close to her friend\u2019s, and he wondered what the ladies were talking about. She was avoiding his gaze.</p><p>\u201cScrawny or not, they were welcome fresh meat. I say, Hasselthorpe\u2019s going to blow over, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight.\u201d</p><p>They were silent as their host squinted down the barrel, squeezed the trigger, and then inevitably couldn\u2019t keep the gun from jerking as it fired. The shot went wide, missing the target altogether. Lady Emeline\u2019s friend covered her ears and winced.</p><p>\u201cAt least he didn\u2019t fall down,\u201d Vale murmured. He sounded a little disappointed.</p><p>Sam turned to look at him. \u201cHave you asked about Corporal Craddock yet?\u201d</p><p>Vale idly rocked back on his heels. \u201cI\u2019ve got the address Thornton gave us, and I found out where Honey Lane is\u2014Craddock\u2019s house is there.\u201d</p><p>Sam eyed him a moment. \u201cGood. Then we shouldn\u2019t have problems finding it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone at all,\u201d Vale said cheerfully. \u201cI remember Craddock as a sensible sort. If anyone can help, I\u2019m sure he can.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded and faced ahead again, although he didn\u2019t notice who stepped up to shoot next. He hoped to hell that Vale was right and Craddock could help them.</p><p>They were running out of survivors to question.</p><p>EMELINE SMOOTHED THE coral silk draped over her panniers that night as she stepped into the Hasselthorpe ballroom. The cavernous room had been recently redecorated, according to Lady Hasselthorpe, and it appeared as if no expense had been spared. The walls were shell pink with baroque gilt vines outlining ceiling, pilasters, windows, doors, and anything else the decorators could think of. Medallions along the walls, also rimmed in baroque gilt leaves, were painted with pastoral scenes of nymphs and satyrs. The whole was like a sugared flower\u2014overpoweringly sweet.</p><p>Right now, though, Emeline was less concerned with the Hasselthorpes\u2019 grand ballroom than with Samuel. She hadn\u2019t seen him since the shooting party this afternoon. Would he attempt the dance, even after his problem at the Westerton ball? Or would he forgo the experience altogether? It was silly, she knew, to worry so much over a matter that was none of her business, but she couldn\u2019t help hoping that Samuel had decided to stay in his rooms tonight. It would be awful if he were overcome again here.</p><p>\u201cLady Emeline!\u201d</p><p>The high voice trilled nearby, and Emeline turned, unsurprised, to see her hostess bearing down on her. Lady Hasselthorpe wore a pink, gold, and apple-green confection, belled out so extravagantly that she had to sidle sideways to make her way through her guests. The pink of her skirts exactly matched the pink of her ballroom walls.</p><p>\u201cLady Emeline! I\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe cried as if she hadn\u2019t just seen Emeline not two hours before. \u201cWhat do you think of peacocks?\u201d</p><p>Emeline blinked. \u201cThey seem a very pretty bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but carved in sugar?\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe had reached her side and now leaned close, her lovely blue eyes genuinely concerned. \u201cI mean, sugar is all white, is it not? Whereas peacocks are just the opposite, aren\u2019t they? Not white. I think that\u2019s what makes them so lovely, all the colors in their feathers. So if one does have a sugar peacock, it isn\u2019t the same as a real one, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Emeline patted her hostess\u2019s arm. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure the sugar peacocks will be marvelous nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe didn\u2019t appear convinced, but her eyes had already wandered to a group of ladies beyond Emeline. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you seen Mr. Hartley?\u201d Emeline asked before her hostess could flit away.</p><p>\u201cYes. His sister is quite pretty and a good dancer. I always think that helps, don\u2019t you?\u201d And Lady Hasselthorpe was off, singing about turtle soup to a startled-looking matron.</p><p>Emeline blew out a frustrated breath. She could see Rebecca now, pacing gently with the other dancers, but where was Samuel? Emeline began to skirt the dancers, working her way to the far end of the ballroom. She passed Jasper, who was whispering something in a girl\u2019s ear that made the child blush, and then Emeline was blocked by a phalanx of elderly men, their backs toward her as they gossiped.</p><p>\u201cI saw the book of fairy tales you left in my room,\u201d Melisande said from behind her.</p> <p>Emeline turned. Her friend was wearing a shade of gray-brown that made her look like a dusty crow. Emeline raised her eyebrows but didn\u2019t comment. They\u2019d had this discussion before, and it hadn\u2019t changed her friend\u2019s attire a wit. \u201cCan you translate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Melisande opened her fan and waved it slowly. \u201cI only looked at a page or two, but I could decipher some of the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d</p><p>But her voice must\u2019ve been distracted. Melisande looked at her sharply. \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d</p><p>Sadly, there was no need to explain who him was. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought I saw him go out onto the terrace.\u201d</p><p>Emeline glanced to where glass doors had been opened to let in the night breeze. She touched her friend\u2019s arm. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Melisande snapped her fan shut. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall.\u201d Emeline was already turning away, moving through the crush.</p><p>A few steps farther and she was at the doors leading to the garden. She slipped through. Only to meet disappointment. There were several couples outside, strolling the stone terrace, but she didn\u2019t see Samuel\u2019s distinctive silhouette. She glanced around as she advanced, and then she felt him.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely this evening.\u201d His breath brushed her bare shoulder, raising goose bumps on her skin.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured. She tried to look in his face, but he\u2019d caught her hand and tucked it in his elbow.</p><p>\u201cShall we stroll?\u201d</p><p>The question was rhetorical, but she nodded anyway. The night air was a relief from the hot ballroom. The chatter of the guests faded as they crossed to wide steps leading into a gravel path. Tiny lanterns hung from the branches of fruit trees in the garden, and they sparkled like fireflies in the autumn dusk.</p><p>Emeline shivered.</p><p>His hand tightened on hers. \u201cIf you\u2019re cold, we can go back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d She glanced at his shadowed profile. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>He gave a soft snort. \u201cMore or less. You must think me an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>They were silent then, their steps crunching on the gravel. Emeline had thought he might try to lead her off the path into the dark, but he kept to the proper, lighted ways.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss Daniel?\u201d he asked, and for a moment she misunderstood him, thinking he meant her dead husband.</p><p>Then comprehension flooded her. \u201cYes. I keep worrying that he might be having nightmares. They sometimes trouble him, as they did his father.\u201d</p><p>She felt him glance at her. \u201cWhat was his father like?\u201d</p><p>Emeline looked down blindly at the dark path. \u201cHe was young. Very young.\u201d She glanced at him quickly. \u201cYou must think that a silly thing to say, but it\u2019s true. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time because I was young, too. He was only a boy when we married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you loved him,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDesperately.\u201d It was almost a relief to admit it, how terribly she\u2019d been in love with Danny. How prostrate with grief she\u2019d been at his death.</p><p>\u201cDid he love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She didn\u2019t even have to think about it. Danny\u2019s love had been easy and natural, a thing she\u2019d taken for granted. \u201cHe said he fell in love with me at first sight. It was at a ball, like this one, and Tante Cristelle introduced us. She knew Danny\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, not speaking.</p><p>\u201cAnd he sent me flowers and took me for drives and did everything that was expected. I think our families were almost surprised when we announced the engagement. They\u2019d forgotten that we weren\u2019t already engaged.\u201d Those days were golden but a little blurry now. Had she ever been that young?</p><p>\u201cHe was a good husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled. \u201cHe drank and gambled sometimes, but all men do. And he used to give me presents, pay me the loveliest compliments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marriage sounds ideal.\u201d His voice was even.</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Was he jealous?</p><p>He stopped and faced her, and she saw it wasn\u2019t jealousy in his eyes at all. \u201cThen why, after an ideal, loving first marriage, do you want a loveless second one?\u201d</p><p>She gasped, feeling as if he\u2019d hit her. She raised her own hand, almost without realizing it, either in defense or to strike him back, but he caught her fist and pulled it aside, leaving her unshielded.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Emeline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d Her voice shook no matter how hard she fought to control it.</p><p>\u201cI think it is, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone will come,\u201d she hissed. The path was deserted, save for themselves, but she knew it wouldn\u2019t stay that way for long. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d He ignored her plea, pushing his face with his analytical eyes toward her. \u201cYou did love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I loved him and he died and left me.\u201d Her breath caught on the traitorous words. \u201cHe left me all alone.\u201d</p><p>He still looked at her as if he could see inside her head to pick apart her very soul. \u201cEmeline\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tore away from him and ran.</p><p>Ran up the garden path and away from Samuel as if she were fleeing from demons.</p><p>THE DAY HAD turned gray by the time Sam and Lord Vale rode out early the next afternoon. Sam shivered atop his borrowed horse and hoped that there wouldn\u2019t be rain on the trip home. He hadn\u2019t been able to talk to Emeline all morning. Whenever he saw her, she\u2019d made sure to be in the company of someone else. Her refusal to let him talk out their troubles bothered him. He\u2019d touched a raw spot the night before in the garden, he knew. She had loved her first husband. In fact, Sam had the feeling that Emeline was capable of deep, unwavering love.</p><p>And maybe that was the problem. How many times could she give that kind of love and lose it without eventually feeling the effect? He imagined her a fire, banking itself, conserving its embers by burning low so that it might not go out altogether. It would take a determined man to stir those flames again.</p><p>Sam\u2019s horse shook its head, jingling the bridle, and he returned his thoughts to the present. He and Vale were riding to the nearby town of Dryer\u2019s Green where Corporal Craddock lived. Vale had been uncharacteristically silent as they\u2019d procured their horses and jogged up the long drive to the main road.</p><p>When they reached the wrought-iron gate that stood at the drive\u2019s end, Vale spoke. \u201cYour aim was impressive all day yesterday. I think you hit a bull\u2019s-eye on every shot.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked at the other man, wondering at the choice of subjects. Perhaps Vale was only making small talk. \u201cThank you. You didn\u2019t shoot yourself, I noticed.\u201d</p><p>A small muscle jerked in Vale\u2019s jaw. \u201cI had enough of guns and gunfire in the war.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. That he could understand. Aristocrat or common soldier, there had been far too many experiences in the war that didn\u2019t bear repeating.</p><p>Vale glanced at him. \u201cI expect you think me a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of you.\u201d The other man\u2019s horse shied at a leaf, and for a moment, he tended to the reins. Then he said, \u201cIt\u2019s odd; I don\u2019t mind hearing gunfire or smelling the smoke. It\u2019s just holding a gun in my hands. The weight and the feel. Somehow it brings it all back, and the war is real again. Too real.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t reply. How could one reply to such an observation? At times the war was too real for him, too. Maybe the war still lived for all the soldiers who had returned home\u2014the wounded and the ones who only seemed whole.</p><p>They\u2019d turned into the road now, following an ancient hedge along one side, the other side bordered by a drystone wall. Beyond these barriers, the brown and golden fields rolled away into the distance. A party of haymakers was working one field, the women with their skirts gathered to their knees, the men in smocks.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Hasselthorpe was in the war, too?\u201d Vale asked suddenly.</p><p>Sam glanced at him. \u201cIndeed?\u201d Hasselthorpe didn\u2019t have a particularly military bearing about him.</p><p>\u201cWas an aide-de-camp to one of the generals,\u201d Vale said. \u201cCan\u2019t remember which one now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he at Quebec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not sure he saw any action at all. I don\u2019t think he was in the army very long, anyway, before he inherited.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. Many aristocrats sought soft commissions in His Majesty\u2019s army. Whether or not they were suited to army life had very little to do with their choice of career.</p><p>Their conversation ceased until they\u2019d entered the outskirts of Dryer\u2019s Green some minutes later. It was a bustling little town, the kind that would have a thriving market every week. They passed the smithy and a cobbler\u2019s shop, and an inn came into sight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told Honey Lane is just here.\u201d Vale indicated a small road just past the inn.</p><p>Sam nodded and turned his horse down the lane. There was only one house here\u2014a mean little cottage, the thatching blackened with age. Sam looked at Vale, his brows raised. The viscount shrugged. Both men dismounted their horses and tied them to low branches near the stone wall that separated the cottage from the road. Vale unlatched the wooden gate, and they marched up the brick walk. The place might\u2019ve once been nice. There were signs of a garden, long neglected now, and the cottage, while small, was well proportioned. Evidently Craddock had fallen on hard times. Or he\u2019d lost the ability to tend to the house.</p><p>On that uneasy thought, Sam knocked at the low door.</p><p>No one came. Sam waited a moment and then knocked again, this time more forcefully.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s out,\u201d Vale said.</p><p>\u201cDid you find where he\u2019s employed?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>But the door creaked open, interrupting Vale. A woman of middling years peered at them through a hand-span crack. She wore a white mobcap but otherwise was all in black, a shawl wrapped across her bosom and tied at the waist. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon us, ma\u2019am,\u201d Sam said. \u201cBut we\u2019re looking for Mr. Craddock. We were told that he lives here.\u201d</p><p>The woman gasped softly and Sam tensed.</p><p>\u201cHe did live here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not anymore. He\u2019s dead. He hung himself a month ago.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Six years went by in wedded happiness\u2014for what man wouldn\u2019t be happy to be rich and married to a beautiful woman who loved him? In the sixth year, Iron Heart\u2019s happiness reached a new peak, for the princess found she was expecting their child. What rejoicing there was in the Shining City! The people danced in the streets, and the king showered the populace with gold coins the night the princess gave birth to a son. This small baby was the heir to the throne and one day would wear a king\u2019s crown on his head. On that night, Iron Heart smiled down on his son and his wife and knew that soon he would be able to speak aloud their names. For this was the third day before the end of his seven years of silence....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>\u201cCapers,\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emeline swallowed a bite of goose and glanced at her hostess. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is to say...\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe looked down her long, elegant supper table at her guests, all of whom had paused to look at her. \u201cWhere do they come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the cook! Ha!\u201d a young gentleman exclaimed. No one paid him any heed, save the young lady at his side who giggled appreciatively.</p><p>Lord Boodle, an elderly gentleman with a thin, pale face under a rather stringy full-bottomed wig, cleared his throat. \u201cI believe they are buds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe widened her lovely blue eyes. \u201cBut that seems most fanciful. I rather thought they might be related to peas, only more sour, if you understand my meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite, quite, my dear,\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe rumbled at his spouse from the other end of the table. One wondered sometimes how Lord Hasselthorpe, a thin, dour gentleman without an ounce of humor, had ever come to marry Lady Hasselthorpe. He cleared his throat ominously. \u201cAs I was saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery, very sour peas,\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe said. She was frowning down at the puddle of sauce that surrounded the slice of goose on her plate. A scatter of capers swam there. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I like them, really, sour little things. There they lurk in a perfectly plain sauce, and when I bite into one, it quite startles me. Doesn\u2019t it you?\u201d She appealed to the Duke of Lister, sitting on her right.</p><p>The duke was known for his oratory in Parliament, but now he blinked and seemed at a loss for words. \u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>Emeline decided to rescue the conversation. \u201cShall we have the footman remove your plate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe smiled charmingly. Her blue eyes were exactly matched by the blue in her gown tonight, and she wore a tight necklace of pearls at her throat that highlighted her long, slim neck. She really was extraordinarily beautiful. \u201cI shall just have to watch out for the capers, shan\u2019t I?\u201d And she popped a piece of goose into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBrave woman,\u201d the duke muttered.</p><p>His hostess beamed at him. \u201cI am, aren\u2019t I? Braver than Lord Vale and Mr. Hartley, I think. They didn\u2019t even come back from the village for supper. Unless\u201d\u2014she glanced inquiringly at Emeline\u2014\u201dthey are hiding in their rooms?\u201d</p><p>Actually, this was a subject that Emeline had been rather worrying about. Where could Samuel and Jasper have got to? They\u2019d left directly after luncheon and had been gone for hours now.</p><p>But Emeline feigned a careless smile for her hostess. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ve simply stopped at the village tavern or something similar. You know gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hasselthorpe widened her eyes as if uncertain whether she did know gentlemen or not.</p> <p>\u201cActually.\u201d Lister unexpectedly cleared his throat. \u201cI believe Lord Vale is in the conservatory.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hasselthorpe stared. \u201cWhatever is he doing there? Doesn\u2019t he know supper isn\u2019t served in the conservatory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he is, ah\u201d\u2014the duke\u2019s face reddened\u2014\u201cindisposed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d their hostess said roundly. \u201cThe conservatory is a silly place to be indisposed. Surely he\u2019d pick the library?\u201d</p><p>The duke\u2019s rather hairy eyebrows shot up at this statement, but Emeline only vaguely noticed. What was Jasper doing in the conservatory indisposed? He\u2019d have to have been back to the house for some time to be in that condition, yet she hadn\u2019t seen him. More importantly, where was Samuel?</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Mr. Hartley?\u201d she asked His Grace, interrupting his convoluted explanation as to why a gentleman might choose to indispose himself in the conservatory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, no, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they shall both have to miss their suppers,\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe said merrily. \u201cAnd go to bed without.\u201d</p> <p>Emeline tried to smile at this witticism, but she thought the smile didn\u2019t quite come off. The supper lasted nearly another hour, and for the life of her, she had no idea how she replied to the conversation of her neighbors. Finally, after a course of cheese and pears that she could hardly bear to look at, the meal ended. Emeline lingered only long enough to be polite; then she hurried in the direction of the conservatory. She traversed a series of halls before her heels tapped on the slate floor that heralded the entrance to the room. A pretty glass and wood door kept the moist heat within the room.</p><p>Emeline pushed open the door. \u201cJasper?\u201d</p><p>All she could hear was the tinkle of water. She grimaced in exasperation and closed the door behind her. \u201cJasper?\u201d</p><p>Something clattered up ahead, and then she heard a male curse. Definitely Jasper. The conservatory was a long, keyhole-shaped building, the sides and ceiling made of glass. Here and there a few green plants in buckets gave the room its purpose, but mostly it was an ornamental folly. Emeline gathered her skirts to walk down the slate aisle. Near the end, she rounded a stone Venus and found Jasper lounging on a bench. Behind him a fountain was centered in the round space at the end of the conservatory.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Jasper\u2019s eyes were closed. He was tilted to the side, his hair and clothes disarranged, and frankly, she didn\u2019t see why he hadn\u2019t toppled over yet.</p><p>Emeline placed a hand on his shoulder and shook him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Samuel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that. Makin\u2019 me dizzy.\u201d He batted at her arm without opening his eyes and naturally missed by a mile.</p><p>Lord! He must be completely soused. Emeline frowned. Gentlemen did like to drink too much, and Jasper in particular seemed to be rather overfond of spirits, but she\u2019d never seen him actually drunk. Merry, yes. Drunk, no. And in public, no less. Her worry intensified. \u201cJasper! What happened in the village? Where is Samuel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>A thrill of pure horror coursed through Emeline before she realized that this simply could not be. Surely they would\u2019ve heard if Samuel had met with an accident of some sort? Jasper\u2019s head had fallen forward, his chin resting on his chest. Emeline knelt at his feet to try to see his face. \u201cJasper, darling, please tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>His eyes suddenly opened, shocking turquoise blue and so sad that Emeline gasped. \u201cThat feller. Killed himself. Oh, Emmie, it\u2019ll never end, will it?\u201d</p><p>She had only a dim idea of what he babbled about, but it was obvious that something terrible had happened in the village. \u201cAnd Samuel? Where did Samuel go?\u201d</p><p>Jasper flung an arm wide and nearly went over backward into the fountain. Emeline caught him about the waist to steady him, although he didn\u2019t seem to notice either his near fall or her help. \u201cOut there somewheres. Took off the moment we got off our horses. Running. Grand runner, Sam is, jus\u2019 grand. Ever seen him run, Emmie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Wherever Samuel was, at least he was alive. Emeline sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed, dear one. You shouldn\u2019t be out like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not out.\u201d Jasper\u2019s comical bloodhound face contorted in confusion. \u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Nevertheless, I think you\u2019d be far better abed.\u201d Emeline gave an experimental tug at Jasper\u2019s waist. To her surprise, he stood easily. Once upright, he towered over her, swaying slightly. Good Lord, she hoped she could manage him by herself.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wish,\u201d Jasper slurred, and placed a wide pawlike hand on her shoulder. \u201cWish Sam was here. Then we could have a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d Emeline panted as she guided Jasper up the walk. He stumbled slightly and leaned into an orange tree, breaking off a branch. Oh, dear.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wonnerful feller, did I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did mention that.\u201d They were at the door now, and Emeline had a moment of worry, trying to puzzle out how to open it without letting go of Jasper. But he solved the problem by opening the door himself.</p><p>\u201cHe saved me,\u201d Jasper muttered as they entered the hallway beyond. \u201cBrought back the rescue party jus\u2019 when I thought those savages might cut off me baubles. Oops!\u201d He stopped and looked at her in chagrin. \u201cNot \u2019spose to say that in front of you, Emmie. D\u2019you know, I think I might be tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I never would\u2019ve guessed,\u201d Emeline murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Samuel was the one who brought back help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRan for three days,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cRan \u2019an ran \u2019an ran, even wi\u2019 a knife wound in his side. He\u2019s a grand runner, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d They\u2019d come to the stairs, and Emeline tightened her grip on him. If he fell, he\u2019d bring her down as well; there was no way that she\u2019d be able to hold his weight. And it was a miracle no one had seen them so far.</p><p>\u201cIt bloodied him, though,\u201d Jasper said.</p><p>Emeline had been concentrating on the treads. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that running. His feet were bloody stumps by the time he got to the fort.\u201d</p><p>Emeline drew in her breath sharply at the awful image.</p><p>\u201cHow do you thank a man for doing that?\u201d Jasper asked. \u201cHe ran until his feet blistered. Ran until the blisters broke and bled. An\u2019 then kept running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord,\u201d Emeline whispered. She\u2019d had no idea. They were at Jasper\u2019s rooms now, and she knew that it wasn\u2019t proper for her to go in, but she couldn\u2019t very well leave him in the hallway. And it was Jasper, for goodness\u2019 sake. He was as close a thing to a brother that she had in this world anymore.</p><p>Emeline reached for the doorknob but was saved by the door opening. Pynch, Jasper\u2019s burly valet, stood in the doorway, absolutely expressionless. \u201cMight I assist you, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you, Pynch.\u201d Emeline gratefully handed over her inebriated fianc\u00e9. \u201cCan you see to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d If Pynch had shown an expression, it might have been affront, but really it was impossible to tell.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Emeline was indecently relieved to leave Jasper to Pynch\u2019s care. She flicked a smile at the valet and then hurried back down the stairs.</p><p>It was imperative that she find Samuel.</p><p>NIGHT WAS FALLING. The sky had taken on that shade of pewter that heralded the end of the day\u2019s light.</p><p>And still Sam ran.</p><p>He\u2019d been running for hours. Long enough to have reached exhaustion. Long enough to have passed exhaustion into a second wind. Long enough to have lost that wind and simply be enduring now. His body moved in the repetitive rhythm of a machine. Except that machines did not feel despair. However long he ran, he could not outrun his thoughts.</p><p>A soldier dead by suicide. To have made it through all the battles, the marching, the rotten food, the cold of winter with inadequate clothing, the diseases that periodically swept the regiment. To make it through all that alive and whole, a near miracle, one of the few to survive the massacre intact. To come home to a neat little cottage and a loving wife. It should\u2019ve all been over. The soldier come home, the war lost to history, and stories by a winter fire. And yet Craddock had stood on a stool, looped a rope about his neck, and kicked the stool away.</p><p>Why? That was the question that Sam couldn\u2019t outrun. Why, when you\u2019d already cheated death, why go willingly into her withered arms? Why now?</p><p>His breath caught as he crested a hill, his legs trembling with fatigue, his feet slicing with pain with each step. Dark had settled now on the fields he ran through, and he didn\u2019t like it. With each footfall there came the real possibility that he might step wrong. Hit a rabbit hole or rock and fall. But he must not fall. He had to keep running because others depended on him. If he stopped, then his reason for running in the first place would be false. He\u2019d be a coward, merely fleeing a battle. He wasn\u2019t a coward. He\u2019d survived battle. He\u2019d killed men, both white and Indian. He\u2019d come through the war and become a gentleman, a man of means and respect. Others depended on him; others nodded gravely at his opinions. Hardly anyone accused him of cowardliness anymore\u2014at least not to his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam stumbled, his left foot catching. But he didn\u2019t go down. He didn\u2019t fall. Instead, he half whirled, sobbing with pain, the stars overhead blurring.</p><p>Keep running. Don\u2019t give up.</p><p>Craddock had given up. Craddock had succumbed to the blackness that seeped into his mind in odd moments, the nightmares that tore apart his sleep, the thoughts that he could not keep away. Craddock slept now. Peacefully. Without nightmares or fear for his own soul. Craddock was at rest.</p><p>Don\u2019t give up.</p> <p>EMELINE DIDN\u2019T KNOW what woke her late that night. Certainly Samuel moved without a sound, silent and secretive like a cat returning home from the hunt. But she woke nevertheless when he entered his room.</p><p>She straightened in the chair by the fireplace. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem startled to see her in his room. His face was pale and unreadable in the candlelight as he walked toward her, oddly stiff. She looked down. Dark stains on the carpet followed his footsteps. She almost took him to task for not wiping the mud from his feet, but then she understood. And in that moment came fully awake.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear Lord, what have you done?\u201d She stood and grabbed his arm, thrusting him urgently into the chair she\u2019d occupied. \u201cYou stupid, stupid man!\u201d She whirled to pile more coal on the fire, then brought a candle closer. \u201cWhat have you done? What could have possessed you?\u201d</p><p>She closed her mouth because what she saw in the candlelight nearly made her ill. He\u2019d run through his moccasins. They were merely tattered leather strips about his feet. And his feet, dear God, his feet. They were nothing more than bloody rags, the stumps that Jasper had told her about only hours ago. But now they were real and in front of her. She looked wildly about the room. There was water, but it wasn\u2019t hot, and where could she find cloth to use as bandages? She started for the door, but his hand flashed out to catch her arm.</p> <p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>His voice was guttural, raspy with exhaustion, but his eyes had focused on her. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>How many miles had he run? \u201cI need to get water and bandages.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him roughly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to die of infection!\u201d</p><p>Emeline was scowling down at him, and she knew the fear showed in her eyes. But despite her harsh tone and unlovely face, he smiled. \u201cThen come back to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d she muttered as she went to the door. \u201cOf course I will.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for an answer but took the candle and almost ran into the hallway. She paused there only long enough to verify that no one was about; then she made her way as quickly and as quietly as possible to the kitchens. House parties were notorious for clandestine assignations. Most of her fellow guests would turn a blind eye if they saw her scurrying about the place in the wee hours of the night, but why chance the gossip? Especially as she was quite innocent.</p><p>The Hasselthorpe House kitchens were vast, with a great vaulted main room that probably dated back to medieval times. Emeline was satisfied to note that the cook obviously was a competent woman: She kept the fire banked at night. Emeline hurried across the room to the great stone fireplace and nearly stumbled over a small boy sleeping there.</p><p>He uncurled from a nest of blankets like a little mouse. \u201cMum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Emeline whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>There was a huge earthenware jar in the corner, and she lifted the lid to peer inside. She nodded in satisfaction. It contained water. As she dipped some out into an iron kettle, she heard the boy rustle behind her.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, mum?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him as she set the kettle on the fire and stirred up the coals. He sat on his blankets with his dark hair standing on end. He was probably all of Daniel\u2019s age.</p> <p>\u201cDoes Cook have a salve for burns and cuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d The boy got to his feet and went to a tall cupboard and pulled out a drawer. He rummaged inside and brought back a small jar to hand to her.</p><p>Emeline lifted the lid and looked inside. A dark, greasy substance filled half the jar. She sniffed it and identified the odors of herbs and honey.</p><p>\u201cYes, this will do. Thank you.\u201d She recovered the jar and smiled at the boy. \u201cGo back to bed now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, mum.\u201d He settled on his pallet and watched her sleepily as she waited for the water to boil and then poured it into a metal pitcher.</p><p>There was a pile of neatly folded cloths in a basket on the cupboard. Emeline took several and grasped the pitcher with one. She smiled at the boy. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, mum.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were already drooping as she left the kitchen. She hurried from the kitchens and back up the stairs, the heavy pitcher in one hand, the jar of salve in the other, and the cloths over her arm. The candlestick was left behind. She knew the route now, anyway, even in the dark.</p><p>She thought Samuel might be asleep, but his head turned alertly at her entrance, although he didn\u2019t say anything as she crossed the room. She poured the hot water into a basin, added just a little of the cold water from the pitcher on the dresser, and brought the basin over to him.</p><p>Emeline knelt at his feet and frowned. \u201cHave you a knife?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he pulled a small blade from his waistcoat pocket. She took it and carefully cut away what remained of his moccasins. Some of the leather stuck to the drying blood, and careful as she was, there were bits that pulled and started the bleeding afresh. It must have hurt, yet he didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>She rolled up the embroidered edges of his leggings and placed the basin under him. \u201cPut your feet in here.\u201d</p><p>He complied and hissed softly as his feet met the hot water. She glanced up, but his face merely showed weariness as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cHow long did you run?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She half expected him to deny it, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and frowned at the basin of water. It was clouding with blood.</p><p>\u201cVale told you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJasper said something about the man you went to see being dead,\u201d she murmured absently. If he\u2019d run through the soles of his moccasins into bare feet, there would be dirt and debris in the wounds. She\u2019d have to clean them thoroughly or infection would set in. It was going to be terribly painful.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Vale?\u201d he asked, interrupting her distressed thoughts.</p><p>She looked up. \u201cIn his rooms in the care of his valet. He drank himself nearly into a stupor.\u201d</p><p>Samuel nodded but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>She pulled a cloth across her lap and tapped his left leg. \u201cLift.\u201d</p><p>He complied, holding out a dripping foot. She guided it to rest on her lap so she could examine the sole. It was raw-looking, reddened and scraped, but in better condition than she would\u2019ve thought. There were several broken blisters but only one cut. She was conscious, too, that it was a rather elegant foot for a man, which was a silly thought. His feet were large and bony, but with a high arch and long toes.</p><p>\u201cHe had hung himself,\u201d Samuel murmured.</p><p>Emeline glanced at him. His eyes were closed, his head resting against the back of his chair. The flickering firelight cast the planes of his face into stark lines and shadows that gleamed a little from old sweat. He must be completely exhausted. It was a wonder that he was still awake.</p><p>She inhaled and looked back at the foot. \u201cThe soldier you and Jasper went to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. His wife was there at the cottage. She said that he came home after the war and seemed fine for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d She had taken another cloth and ripped it until she had a rag the size of her palm. Now she dipped it into the salve and began to wash the bottom of his foot. Emeline frowned to herself. She should\u2019ve brought some type of scrub brush from the kitchen.</p><p>She heard him sigh. \u201cHe stopped living.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him. He must be in pain\u2014she was handling his foot quite roughly to get the grit out\u2014but his face was smooth and calm. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCraddock went out less and less until he never left the cottage at all. He\u2019d lost his job long before that point; he\u2019d been a clerk in the village dry grocer\u2019s store. After that, he stopped talking. His wife said he\u2019d sit by the fire and simply stare into it as if mesmerized.\u201d</p><p>Emeline set his left foot on a clean rag by her side and tapped his right foot. \u201cThis one, please.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he lifted the dripping foot onto her lap. She didn\u2019t want to listen to this. Didn\u2019t want to hear about old soldiers who couldn\u2019t come home and live normally. Would Reynaud have been like Mr. Craddock had he lived? Would she have had to watch him slowly eat himself alive? And what about Samuel?</p><p>She cleared her throat and picked up a fresh rag. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then he stopped sleeping.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and glanced quickly up at him. \u201cHow can that be? Everyone must sleep; one has no control over it.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at her with such a well of sorrow in his face that she wanted to glance away. Wanted to flee the room and never have to think about wars and the men who had fought in them.</p><p>\u201cHe suffered from nightmares,\u201d Samuel said.</p><p>The fire popped from behind her. He held her gaze. She stared into his eyes, turned black by the firelight, and felt her breasts push against her stays as she breathed in, filling her lungs with air. She didn\u2019t want to know; she truly didn\u2019t. Some things were too awful to imagine, too awful to hold in her soul for the rest of her life. She\u2019d been fine all these years since Reynaud\u2019s death. She\u2019d grieved and railed against fate, and then she\u2019d accepted because she\u2019d had no other choice. To find out now what the war had been like, what it was still like for the men who returned, alive but not whole...It was too much.</p><p>Samuel held her gaze. Emeline inhaled again for fortitude and asked, \u201cDo you have nightmares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...\u201d She had to stop and clear her throat. \u201cWhat do you dream about?\u201d</p><p>The lines about his mouth grew deeper, more grim. \u201cI dream about the stink of men\u2019s sweat. About bodies\u2014dead bodies\u2014crushing me, their wounds still open, still flowing with bright, red blood even though they are dead. I dream that I am already dead. That I died six years ago and never knew it. That I only think I\u2019m alive, and when I look down, the flesh is rotting from my hands. The bones show through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d She couldn\u2019t bear hearing of his horrible pain.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the worst,\u201d he whispered so low she almost didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the worst?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes as if bracing himself, then said, \u201cThat I\u2019ve failed my fellow soldiers. That I\u2019m running through the woods of North America, but I\u2019m not running to fetch help. I\u2019m merely running away. That I\u2019m the coward they call me.\u201d</p><p>It was horribly inappropriate, ghastly, really, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She laughed. Emeline stuffed her fist into her open mouth like a little child, trying to stifle the sound, but it broke forth, anyway, loud in the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>But one side of his mouth moved upward as if he almost smiled. He reached down and pulled her into his lap, her skirts dragging through the basin of bloody water. She didn\u2019t care. All she worried about was this man and his hellish nightmares.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured again, dropping the bloody rag. She placed her palm against his face. If she could only absorb his pain into herself, she would. \u201cOh, Samuel, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cI know. Why did you laugh?\u201d</p><p>She caught her breath at the tenderness in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s so ludicrous, the thought that you could ever be a coward.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t,\u201d he murmured as his face drew close to hers. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2014\u201d She had meant to say that she knew him better than any man alive, even Jasper, but his lips covered hers.</p><p>He kissed her tenderly, his mouth soft, and she swallowed sorrow from his kiss. Why this man? Why not some other man of her own rank, of her own country? She took his face in between her hands and pushed her mouth on his, and her mouth wasn\u2019t soft or gentle. What she wanted from him wasn\u2019t a gentle thing. She licked across his lips, tasting salt, then forced her tongue into his mouth. She turned her upper body and pressed herself against him without any artifice, a wanton woman. He broke then. His arms wrapped about her back, and he pulled her fully into his chest, holding her tightly as his tongue slid against hers. She felt the drying tears on her face, she felt the ridge of his organ, even through all the intervening clothes, and she felt an answering feminine thrill.</p><p>And then she felt him push her away.</p> <p>She grasped his shoulders to keep from falling in the basin of water. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>His face was dark, working with some emotion. Had she misunderstood his interest? But, no, looking at his lap, it was all too evident that he\u2019d been fully engaged in their kiss. Then why...?</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>He picked her up, placed her on her feet, and shoved her unceremoniously toward the door. \u201cGo.\u201d</p> <p>And Emeline found herself outside Samuel\u2019s room. She fled down the hall, her skirts dripping bloody water and her heart overflowing with pain.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>That night, when all was quiet in the castle, Iron Heart woke on the stroke of midnight. He felt a nameless fear, and leaving his marital bed and the princess asleep, he grasped his sword and went to find his baby son. When he reached the nursery, the guards were asleep outside the door. Quietly, he cracked the nursery door open, and what he saw inside froze the blood in his veins. For a giant wolf, its fangs glittering in the dark, stood over his son\u2019s crib....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>Oddly, he\u2019d slept well. That was Sam\u2019s first thought the next morning. It was as if Lady Emeline had laid a balm not only on his feet, but also on his soul. Which was a strange thought. She\u2019d laugh if she\u2019d heard it; she was such a prickly little thing.</p><p>His second thought was that his feet throbbed with pain. He groaned and sat in the huge bed the Hasselthorpes had provided for him. The entire room\u2014like the house itself\u2014was magnificent. Red velvet curtains hung from the bed, the walls were paneled with dark carved wood, and a thick carpet lay on the expansive floor. The cabin he\u2019d grown up in might almost fit in the bedroom. If this was what they\u2019d given him, probably the least important of their guests, what had they given the others?</p> <p>He grimaced. The thought left Sam disgruntled. He didn\u2019t belong here in a house of velvet and antique wood. He was from the New World, where men were judged by what they achieved in their own lifetimes, not by what their ancestors had gained. And yet he couldn\u2019t dismiss England altogether. This was Lady Emeline\u2019s home, and she fit in as only one who was born into this country and class could. That fact alone should\u2019ve been reason enough to stay away from her. Their worlds, their experiences, their lives, were too far apart.</p><p>But that hadn\u2019t been why he\u2019d pushed her off his lap the night before. No, that had been an instinctive move, one that had gone against his body\u2019s own wishes. He\u2019d been throbbingly hard, had been thinking of nothing save putting his body within hers, and then he\u2019d known it wasn\u2019t right. He\u2019d not wanted her capitulation if it was because of pity. Pity wasn\u2019t the emotion he wanted from Lady Emeline. Not at all. \u2019Course, maybe that made him a fool, because his cock certainly didn\u2019t seem to care why she\u2019d lain across his lap like butter melting on toast. It only knew that the lady had been willing, and like a hound set to a scent, it was already proudly awake and ready for the chase.</p><p>First things first. He smelled like a pigsty, the result of running the night before until the sweat streamed from his body. Sam limped to the door and called for hot water. Then he sat and examined his feet. Lady Emeline had done a good job. The bottom of both feet were covered with broken blisters, and he had a rather nasty cut on the right one, but the wounds were clean. They\u2019d heal properly; he knew by experience.</p><p>His bath was in a tin tub that barely fit Sam\u2019s body, but the warmth and steam felt good to his aching muscles. Then he dressed, grimacing as he laced his older pair of moccasins, and went down to break his fast. The hour might be late for him, but for an English aristocrat, it was still early and when he limped into the breakfast room, it was only half full.</p><p>The room was long, running across a portion of the back of the house. Diamond-paned windows lined the outer wall, letting in the morning light. Instead of one long table, smaller ones had been set here and there for the diners. Sam nodded to a gentleman whose name escaped him and tried to correct his limp as he made his way to the dishes laid out on a sideboard on the far end of the room. Rebecca was already there, peering at a plate of fried gammon.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d his sister muttered at him.</p><p>Sam glanced sideways at her. \u201cGood morning to you, too.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him, then cleared her brow when she saw Lady Hopedale staring at them. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo what?\u201d He placed a slice of gammon on his plate. He\u2019d noticed the other day that it was particularly good here.</p><p>\u201cPretend you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d his sister said in palpable exasperation.</p><p>Sam looked at her. In fact, he had no idea what she was talking about.</p><p>Rebecca blew out a breath of air, then said slowly as if talking to a very small child, \u201cYou were gone all day yesterday. No one knew where you and Lord Vale were. You were missing.\u201d</p><p>Sam opened his mouth, but she leaned into him and continued in a whisper, \u201cI was worried about you. That\u2019s what happens when you suddenly disappear and no one can find you and people start wondering if you\u2019ve fallen into a ditch and are lying dead somewhere. Your sister starts to worry about you.\u201d</p><p>Sam blinked. He wasn\u2019t used to accounting for his movements to anyone. He was a grown man and in the peak of health. Why would anyone worry about him? \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to worry. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point!\u201d Rebecca hissed loud enough to make a matron with pendulous jowls look back at them. \u201cYou could be the strongest, most well-armed man in the world, and I would still worry if you disappeared for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca slapped a salted herring onto her plate. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t make any sense is you.\u201d She turned and marched off with her fish.</p><p>Sam was still staring after her, trying to understand where he had gone wrong in the conversation, when Vale spoke beside him. \u201cYour sister\u2019s feathers seem to be ruffled.\u201d</p><p>Sam glanced at the other man and winced. Vale\u2019s face was ashy-gray, and he swayed almost imperceptibly as he peered at the plate of gammon. \u201cYou look like a pile of horseshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost kind.\u201d Vale swallowed. His gray face was taking on a greenish undertone. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll have anything to eat just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Sam heaped buttered kidneys on his own plate. \u201cMaybe some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Vale closed his eyes for a second. \u201cNo. Just some barley water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you think best.\u201d Sam called a footman over and asked for a glass of barley water.</p><p>Vale winced. \u201cI think I\u2019ll sit in the corner where it\u2019s quiet.\u201d</p><p>Sam smirked and piled two pieces of toast on his plate before following the other man to a small, round table. He ought to be sympathetic. The devils that plagued Vale were the same as his, although the symptoms they evoked were different.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Emmie this morning?\u201d Vale asked as Sam sat across from him.</p><p>Sam looked down at his plate as he set it carefully on the table. \u201cNo.\u201d God, he hated the familiarity of that nickname. He wanted to punch Vale each time he used it.</p><p>Vale smiled weakly. \u201c\u2019Fraid I was an ass to her last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you?\u201d Sam stared at the other man, feeling hostility well in his chest. \u201cShe was with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long.\u201d Vale squinted. \u201cAt least I think not. I was a bit tight.\u201d</p><p>Sam cut into the gammon in a vicious, controlled motion. Had Lady Emeline been in Vale\u2019s rooms as well? Had she undressed him and readied him for bed? Cared for him with as much tenderness as she had Sam? He pushed too hard and his knife skidded across the plate with a screech, pushing the gammon onto the table.</p><p>\u201cWhoops,\u201d Vale said with an imbecilic smile.</p><p>Lady Emeline walked into the room.</p><p>Sam watched her with narrowed eyes. She was wearing a demure white and pink dress today, and the sight provoked him. Pink made her look like a silly society lady, a woman who would never be able to make a decision for herself, when he knew that the opposite was the truth. She was a strong woman, the strongest he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Emmie,\u201d Vale exclaimed.</p><p>Had her fianc\u00e9 ever looked at the grown woman? Evidently not, or he\u2019d never call her such a girlish name as Emmie. Sam felt his hostility grow. She was like a sister to Vale, nothing more. And while love for a sister might be true and deep, it wasn\u2019t passion. Emeline was a strong woman with intense emotions. She needed more than brotherly love.</p><p>She\u2019d seen him. He knew that, although she pretended otherwise, her head turned away as she talked to their hostess. Emeline was always aware of where he was. He should\u2019ve taken that as a sign. He should\u2019ve known, just from that one fact: he couldn\u2019t hide from her, even if he wanted to.</p><p>\u201cEmmie!\u201d Vale called to her and winced at the sound of his own voice. \u201cDamn me, why doesn\u2019t she see us?\u201d</p><p>But she looked toward them then, though she was careful not to meet Sam\u2019s eyes. She made a last comment to Lady Hasselthorpe and squared her shoulders before walking toward their table.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Jasper. Mr. Hartley.\u201d</p><p>Vale reached for her hand, and Sam\u2019s fingers fisted under the table. \u201cCan you ever forgive me, Emmie? I\u2019m ashamed I was such a drunken oaf last night.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sweetly, making Sam immediately suspicious. \u201cOf course I can forgive you, Jasper. You are always so appreciative.\u201d</p><p>Sam was sure he\u2019d not imagined her emphasis on the second you. He cleared his throat, trying to draw her attention, but she was resolute in her determination not to look at him. \u201cPlease. Sit with us.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t ignore him speaking directly to her without drawing attention. Emeline smiled tightly at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes! Have a seat,\u201d Vale cried. \u201cI\u2019ll go get you a plate.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of pure exasperation crossed Emeline\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she was too late. Vale was already up and bounding over to the sideboard. Sam smiled and pulled out the chair between his and Vale\u2019s seat. \u201cHe\u2019s left you no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She flounced into the chair, pointedly tilting her chin away from him.</p><p>Strangely, this made him come achingly erect. He leaned toward her, hoping to catch her scent. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I pushed you away last night.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed a lovely shade of pink, and she finally looked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He watched her dark eyes. \u201cI refer to you sitting on my lap, my lady, and sticking your tongue in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d she asked low. \u201cYou cannot speak about that here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I didn\u2019t appreciate sucking on your sweet tongue.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d she protested, but her gaze fell to his mouth.</p><p>God, she made him feel alive! He wanted her. Damn their differences, damn Vale, damn the whole goddamn country. She\u2019d been eager last night. \u201cAnd I liked the feel of your rump on top of my cock.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared wide. \u201cStop it! It\u2019s too dangerous. You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Vale said happily. He plunked down a laden plate in front of Emeline and sat with a tall glass of what must be barley water for himself. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what would tempt you, so I got some of everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind,\u201d Emeline said weakly, picking up a fork.</p><p>\u201cQuite the gallant,\u201d Sam murmured. \u201cI shall have to take lessons from him, don\u2019t you think, Lady Emeline?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cThere\u2019s no need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there is.\u201d He\u2019d lost all control. It was the sight of her being cared for by Vale, a man who didn\u2019t even know her. He was aware that his face had tensed, that he was revealing too much, but he couldn\u2019t seem to stop himself. \u201cMy manners are too rough, my speech too blunt. I need to learn to smooth my ways so that I can have proper congress with a lady.\u201d</p><p>On the word congress, Emeline dropped her fork.</p> <p>Vale choked on the sip of barley water he\u2019d taken and started coughing.</p><p>Sam looked at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so, Lord Vale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just remembered...\u201d Emeline\u2019s face was pale with anger as she searched for an excuse. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have to go.\u201d And she got up and walked quickly from the room.</p><p>\u201cCongress, old man, is really not the word you were looking for,\u201d Vale said. \u201cConversation, maybe, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I stand corrected,\u201d Sam murmured. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for Vale\u2019s reply or look to see what the other man thought. He didn\u2019t care anymore. She\u2019d fled, and she must know by now the reaction that that would provoke in a predator.</p> <p>EMELINE GATHERED HER skirts as she quickened her pace down the hallway. Awful, awful man! How dare he\u2014after rejecting her the night before, actually pushing her away from himself\u2014act as if he were the one wronged? She rounded a corner, nearly cannoning into the Duke of Lister and barely muttering an apology before continuing. The worst part was that her attraction to the horrible man was completely undimmed. How mortifying. To have offered herself to him, have him reject her in no uncertain terms, and then be unable to kill the animal lust her body felt for him.</p><p>She\u2019d been so worried when she\u2019d first seen him in the breakfast room. How were his feet? Had she properly cleaned them? How had he been able to walk this morning? And then he\u2019d begun stalking her with his words, not caring who overheard or that he\u2019d already rejected her. It was because of Jasper, she was sure. Samuel was reacting with a kind of male territorial instinct like a hound guarding its dinner. Well, she wasn\u2019t some moldy bone to be fought over.</p><p>The stairs were in front of her, but her vision was blurred by rage and frustration. She didn\u2019t care for him; she refused to care for him. He was a colonial without manners or sophistication. She hated him. On that thought, she nearly slipped on a tread and prayed she could make her room before she broke down altogether. That would be the final straw\u2014to be found wandering the Hasselthorpe hallways out of her mind because of a man. She nearly ran the last distance to her room, wrenching open the door and falling inside before slamming it behind her.</p><p>Or at least she tried to slam the door. It met with resistance. She looked over her shoulder and found to her utter horror that Samuel stood there, one palm flat against the wooden door.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Emeline pushed against the door with all her might. \u201cGet out! Get out, you whore-mongering, son of a bitch, arsehole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d His eyebrows were drawn down sternly. He took her shoulder and effortlessly pulled her away from the door before shutting it.</p><p>Which only enraged her further. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>She was writhing, trying desperately to get out of his grasp, slapping at his hands, snaking her head to bite him.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>And he pulled her roughly against his chest. He slammed his mouth onto hers. Immediately, she bit him. Or tried to. He yanked his head back and, amazingly, grinned down at her, although the expression held no amusement. \u201cI remember that trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d She flung up a hand to hit him, but he caught that as well.</p><p>He shoved her bodily against the wall and pinned her there like some unfortunate moth. Then he bent his head and, avoiding her mouth, bit her neck, just under her ear. And her body\u2014her idiot, traitorous body\u2014responded, going all soft and warm. He nipped and tongued her neck, and her head arched back even as something close to a growl slipped from her lips. He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you laugh at me!\u201d she screeched like a harpy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he murmured against her throat. \u201cI\u2019d never laugh at you.\u201d He pulled at her bodice, ripping something. Then he was licking across the mounds of her breasts above her stays.</p><p>She sobbed and his mouth softened, whispering against her flesh.</p><p>Damnable man. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare do this out of jealousy.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head, his cheeks flushed, his mouth reddened from kissing her. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t involve anyone else. This is purely between you and me.\u201d He yanked her hand down and thrust it crudely against his breeches.</p><p>And she felt him, long and hot, waiting behind his clothes just for her. It was a kind of triumph that she could make his body hard for her. She wanted that. She wanted him. She pressed the palm of her hand against his length.</p><p>He groaned and then spun her to face the wall, reaching around her to tear at the ties in the front of her stays. She placed her hands flat against the wall, scraping her nails against the paint; her fevered cheek lay on the cool plaster. This was madness, insanity, and she didn\u2019t care. He wrenched down the sleeves of her gown, more fabric ripping, and she felt cool air on her shoulders. He trailed his hands, large and warm, down her spine. She could feel his calluses, male against her soft, feminine skin. He nipped at the back of her neck, and she closed her eyes. It had been so long. So very long. She was melting. There was no need for him to do any more; she was quite ready for him now, but he seemed in no hurry. Or maybe he was just enjoying her naked and vulnerable. He was kissing her spine now, and she felt the touch of his lips, each moist stroke of his tongue.</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>He reached her hips, where her gown, chemise, and underskirts were tangled. He must\u2019ve done something truly awful to her clothing then, because there was a prolonged tearing sound, and yards of fabric were at her feet and her bottom was bare. He placed his mouth on the small of her back and kissed her there before moving downward to kiss, actually kiss, her buttocks. This wasn\u2019t mannerly. This was animal and crass and she shouldn\u2019t like it. She shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He was urging her legs apart, and one part of her mind was thinking that his position relative to hers did not put her in the most attractive angle. Then she forgot any doubts, for he was running his thumb along her crease.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet,\u201d he said, his voice deep and dark with male satisfaction.</p><p>She lifted her head from the wall and almost pulled away at that. How dare he take her for granted?</p><p>But he tilted her hips and then...</p><p>Oh, God! And then he licked her. Her cheek fell back against the wall. It didn\u2019t matter anymore, her ungraceful position, his feral nature. She wanted him to continue this forever. His tongue worked between her folds, nudging and licking, and she thought she had never felt anything like it in her life. He pulled his mouth away and blew on the place where it had been, cooling and exciting her at once. Then he was pulling apart her folds with his thumbs and tonguing his way to the very center of her being. She was moaning now, her hips pushing back at his face, and if she thought too hard about what she was doing and what he was doing, she would be completely mortified. So she drove any thoughts from her mind and simply concentrated on the sensation, his mouth against her most intimate flesh. His tongue seeking out and finding her clitoris. She moaned as he found her. Moaned again when he licked delicately.</p><p>She felt him wrap one hand about her hip and stroke through her curls. She gasped and opened her eyes to look down. The sight was unbearably erotic. His dark fingers tracing across her white skin and into the black curls above her thighs. He slid his middle finger into her cleft, and she was forced to close her eyes as that finger replaced his tongue on her knot. She felt him lick back, and then he thrust his tongue into her, and she convulsed violently. Her body shuddered and she gasped, scraping the wall with her fingernails, moving her hips mindlessly as pleasure streamed through her. Spasms wracked her as he thrust and thrust again his tongue into her body, while his finger worked over her bud. Her climax seemed endless, a hard, shimmering river of light that went on and on and on.</p><p>Finally she subsided, weak and shivering, her knees threatening to give beneath her, her arms shaking as she held herself up.</p><p>His mouth left her and she tried to turn, but he held her still. \u201cBend over.\u201d</p><p>She was dazed, her mind in a fevered sexual haze, and she could do naught but obey him, bending at the waist and grasping at the wall with outstretched arms to keep from falling.</p><p>His fingers nudged against her wet flesh, and then his cock. She sighed. So sweet, so beautiful. That hard, hot flesh parting her folds, beginning to enter her. This was the best part, the part of discovery. When he was a man stripped to his essentials and she was a woman receiving him. Exploring him and holding him. Discovering how this was with him.</p><p>He should be at the end of his rope by now, nearly frantic with delayed lust, but he went slowly. She felt each inch of his flesh enter hers, widening her until the fabric of his breeches met her bare bottom. He inhaled and thrust once, and he was fully seated. She could stay like this forever, she thought dreamily, holding his hardness within herself, reveling in the feeling of fullness, of connection.</p><p>But he drew back, as slowly as he\u2019d entered her, and her inner muscles pulled at him, as if reluctant to let him leave. He thrust suddenly, and her arms bent with the force of the impact.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d he grunted, the words almost unintelligible.</p><p>She locked her elbows. And then he gripped her hips and began thrusting into her, hard and fast, the slide of his cock tormenting and wonderful. She angled her hips to more fully receive him.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d he growled.</p><p>His fingers were suddenly in her bush again, tunneling and seeking, finding that part of her that ached for his touch. He pressed down firmly in front even as his cock ravished her from behind. She felt a scream build in her throat. It was too much, the pummeling, the pressure of his knowing finger, the ache of her arms holding her up.</p><p>He swore suddenly, and then he caught her against himself, her bare back pressed to his waistcoat as his cock buried itself in her and began to spurt. It was an odd angle\u2014and erotic\u2014her feet on tiptoe, her legs wide apart, her breasts and belly bare and displayed, impaled on his cock. She heard him groan and reveled in his loss of control. He worked insistently at her bud, splaying his hand possessively over her cunny as he came inside her.</p><p>And then she did scream. Waves of almost painful pleasure coursed through her as she convulsed on his cock. He placed his hand over her mouth to muffle the sound, and she bit him, relishing the taste of his skin on her tongue.</p><p>Behind her, he caught his breath. \u201cLittle cat.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew his flesh from hers and grasped her about the waist, lifting her from behind and dumping her on her back on the bed. Emeline only had time to brace herself and then he was in the bed beside her, the mattress dipping with his weight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably bite me again, but it might just be worth it,\u201d he said before bringing his mouth down on hers. He kicked her legs apart and shoved himself into her again. And then he just lay there, heavy and hot, kissing her hungrily.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even undressed, she thought hazily as she opened her mouth beneath his. He was still wearing coat, waistcoat, breeches, and leggings, probably even had his moccasins on the covers of her bed. But then that thought fled, and she gave herself over to his tongue, courting and seducing hers. She felt the press of the cold metal buttons of his waistcoat on her bare breasts as he leaned into her.</p><p>Someone knocked on the door. Emeline froze. Samuel lifted his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, my lady?\u201d Harris, her maid, called.</p> <p>He arched his eyebrow at her.</p><p>Emeline cleared her throat, conscious of his flesh still in hers. \u201cPerfectly fine. You may leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d They heard receding footsteps.</p><p>Emeline exhaled and pushed at his chest. \u201cGet off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked lazily. \u201cI like it here.\u201d</p> <p>But she was feeling a suffocating sense of panic. \u201cMy maid will return.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back and searched her face. \u201cI find that hard to believe. I\u2019m sure you demand only the best-trained servants.\u201d</p><p>She pushed again, and this time he yielded, withdrawing his penis from her as abruptly as he\u2019d placed it there. He rolled to the side. She scrambled off the bed before she could regret the loss of his flesh. \u201cYou should go.\u201d</p><p>How terribly awkward to stand nude in front of the man she\u2019d just made wanton love to. He should have the common decency\u2014a gentleman\u2019s decency\u2014to leave quietly after the act. But apparently he did not. She could feel his silent gaze as she bent over her pile of discarded clothes, rummaging for something, anything, to cover her nakedness. She pulled out her chemise and held it over her front, but then discovered that it was more rag than cloth. It was too much.</p><p>Emeline threw the shredded chemise down and whirled to the man on the bed. \u201cYou must go!\u201d</p><p>He was lounging on his side, propped on one elbow, watching her as she knew he\u2019d be. His hair was still tightly braided, his clothes rumpled but otherwise the same. But his mouth had relaxed into a sensuous, wide curve, his eyes half-lidded and sleepy-looking. He hadn\u2019t even the tact to button the flap of his breeches. Her gaze was drawn helplessly to his manhood, shining and thick, and the only nude part of him. His cock should\u2019ve been limp and little by now, a thing to be pitied, but it wasn\u2019t. Quite the contrary, it lay arrogant and half-erect as if willing to do the whole thing over.</p> <p>The sight enraged her. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you left?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and sat up. \u201cI had hoped to lie with you a time, my lady, but evidently that does not meet with your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. Emeline actually felt the heat invade her cheeks and neck. She knew she was being surly and unreasonable. She knew she should display grace and perhaps an indifferent sophistication, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She simply couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cPlease go.\u201d She crossed her arms over her breasts in an inadequate defense and glanced away.</p><p>He stood and buttoned the flap of his breeches without hurry. \u201cI\u2019ll go now, but this is not over.\u201d</p><p>She looked up in horror. \u201cOf course it\u2019s over! You got what you wanted; there\u2019s no need to...to...\u201d She trailed away because she really didn\u2019t know how to voice the thought. Oh, if she\u2019d only been one of those sophisticated widows! The ones who took discreet lovers and made liaisons where both parties knew the rules of behavior. But she\u2019d had to care for Daniel and Tante Cristelle and then Reynaud had died and, well, she\u2019d never felt the urge before.</p><p>While she\u2019d been thinking about her woeful lack of experience, he\u2019d finished putting himself to rights and strolled over to where she stood like a rather aged dryad. He bent and brushed his lips against hers, softly, tenderly, the touch almost making her weep.</p> <p>And then he stepped back. His eyes were narrowed and thoughtful. \u201cYes, I got what I wanted\u2014and what you wanted as well\u2014but I\u2019m not quenched. I\u2019m coming to you again, and you can either let me in quietly, or I will knock your door down and in the process summon the whole household.\u201d The corner of his mouth quirked upward, but he didn\u2019t look amused. \u201cI may not be fully aware of all the niceties of your society, but I think that you won\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth had fallen open during this arrogant speech, but now as he turned away, she found her voice. \u201cHow dare you presume\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her by the shoulders, making her indignant sentence end on a squeak. He bent his head and spoke fiercely into her ear. \u201cI dare because you welcomed me into your body not a quarter of an hour ago. Your body rained your pleasure all over my cock, and I want that again.\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth. But this time his kiss wasn\u2019t gentle or soft. It spoke of a man\u2019s desire. He thrust his tongue into her mouth and angled his head so that his lips all but enveloped hers, and her silly body arched into him. She wanted this. She craved this. Intellect and reason fled her brain.</p><p>He stepped back so suddenly she nearly fell. His face was hard and flushed. \u201cLet me in tonight, Emeline.\u201d</p><p>He left her room before she could reply.</p><p>As she sank into her pile of ruined clothes, she had a blinding realization. She\u2019d lost whatever control she\u2019d ever had over this affair.</p><p>\u201cCRADDOCK HUNG HIMSELF a month ago,\u201d Lord Vale said later that afternoon.</p><p>Sam dragged his thoughts away from Emeline\u2014her skin, her breasts, the fact that she didn\u2019t want to see him again\u2014and focused on the problem of the 28th. \u201cYou\u2019d think that Thornton would\u2019ve known that Craddock was already dead.\u201d</p><p>Vale shrugged. \u201cThornton didn\u2019t say when he\u2019d last seen the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next on your list to question?\u201d</p><p>Sam grimaced. \u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>It was raining outside, which had sent their hostess into a flurry of despair. Apparently, Lady Hasselthorpe had planned an afternoon expedition to view the ruins of an abbey, a famous local sight. Sam was privately relieved at the rain. He would never have been able to hike over the hills today, not at least without a good deal of pain, and making an excuse would\u2019ve drawn Rebecca\u2019s attention. He was beginning to realize that his sister saw much more than he\u2019d given her credit for. Having to explain to her why his feet were in ribbons would\u2019ve been awkward indeed.</p><p>But instead the majority of the house party had retreated to a large sitting room at the back of the house. Emeline was noticeably absent, of course\u2014she was obviously avoiding him\u2014but most everyone else was in attendance. Some of their number amused themselves playing cards; others were reading or talking in small groups.</p><p>Like Vale and Sam.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anyone else to question at all?\u201d Vale looked incredulous.</p><p>Sam grit his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m happy to take suggestions.\u201d</p><p>Vale pursed his lips. \u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming you have any ideas of your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Vale found a sudden interest in the rain-drenched windows.</p><p>\u201cThought not,\u201d Sam muttered.</p><p>Both men gazed at the windows as if transfixed by the terrible weather. Vale drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair in an incredibly annoying manner.</p><p>Finally, the viscount inhaled. \u201cIf Thornton was the traitor, he\u2019d have to have a reason to betray the 28th.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t take his eyes from the window, strangely unsurprised that the other man\u2019s thoughts had run along the same lines as his. \u201cYou definitely suspect him, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sam thought of the unease he\u2019d felt since meeting Thornton again in London. He sighed. \u201cI might suspect him, but I can\u2019t think why he\u2019d betray the entire regiment. Any ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t a clue,\u201d Vale said. \u201cPerhaps he was growing weary of all the peas porridge we had to eat on that wretched march.\u201d</p><p>The viscount seemed to like him. There was something villainous in pretending friendship with a man when you\u2019d just made love to that man\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Sam would\u2019ve avoided him, but Vale had sought him out as soon as he\u2019d entered the sitting room.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always money, I suppose,\u201d Vale mused, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see how killing an entire regiment would benefit Thornton unless he was paid by the French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Thornton speak French?\u201d Sam asked idly.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t a clue.\u201d Vale drummed his fingers for a moment, apparently considering Thornton\u2019s linguistic abilities. \u201cNot that it matters\u2014the note was written in English, you said. And besides, plenty of French speak English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he in debt?\u201d Sam watched as Rebecca tilted her head to listen to another girl. She\u2019d found at least one lady to talk to.</p><p>\u201cWe should find out. Or rather I should find out. Haven\u2019t been much help to this investigation so far. Ought to lend more of a hand, what?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked over at Vale. The other man was watching him with his earnest, hangdog eyes. What kind of a man would betray a friend like this?</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sam said gravely.</p><p>Vale made one of those mercurial transformations that he was sometimes capable of. He grinned and his funny, homely face lit up, his almost iridescent blue eyes sparkling. \u201cDon\u2019t mention it, old man.\u201d</p><p>And Sam looked down, no longer able to meet the other man\u2019s eyes. He should in all honor resolve to never see Lady Emeline again. Which must make him the most dishonorable man alive.</p><p>For he fully intended to find her and make love to her again tonight.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The giant wolf leapt for the baby\u2019s cradle, its jaws gaping wide. But Iron Heart ran at the beast, his sword upraised to protect his son. Then what a battle commenced! For Iron Heart must remain silent\u2014he could not call for help\u2014and the monster wolf was a test of all his strength and skill. Back and forth across the room the combatants raged, smashing the furniture to splinters. The babe\u2019s cradle was overturned and he began to wail. Iron Heart gave a mighty blow and struck the wolf\u2019s hind leg. The beast howled with pain and lashed out, flinging the man against the wall with a crash that shook the castle. Iron Heart\u2019s head hit the stone wall and he knew no more....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>She\u2019d argued with herself all day, even as she\u2019d been careful to keep to her rooms for fear that she might see him. The reasons were well worn by now. They were of different classes, different worlds. She had a son and a family to think of. He was too intense, a man not easily led. She wouldn\u2019t be able to hold the upper hand with him. And yet...</p><p>And yet...</p><p>Maybe it was because she\u2019d spent all day debating and redebating herself. None of the arguments seemed to hold sway anymore. She shrugged them aside because they paled in comparison to her need. She needed to feel him inside her once again. Shocking, how animal she\u2019d become. She\u2019d never done this before\u2014pushed reason aside, let her physical self rule. It was a frightening thing, to give herself solely over to the sensual. Frightening, and exhilarating at the same time. She\u2019d always held herself in strict control, been the one in control. Someone had had to\u2014all the men who were supposed to hold the family together had left. First Reynaud, then Danny, then six months later, Father, leaving her alone.</p><p>So terribly alone.</p><p>She tensed as she heard a footstep outside the door. She was ready for him, nude and already in bed, and she felt excitement shoot through her. Then he was opening the door. He closed it behind him, not bothering to disguise his limp once inside the room. In that moment before he saw her, she noticed the lines that carved furrows into his cheeks, the slump of his broad shoulders. He was weary, she could tell, probably not yet recovered from his punishing one-man race of the day before. And she didn\u2019t care. She would have him tonight, would use him as he used her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She saw the moment he noticed her. He paused, his coat half off, and she sat up in the bed. His bed. The coverlet slipped to her waist, revealing her bare breasts. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d He pulled off his coat. His tone was casual, but his eyes were on her breasts.</p><p>She leaned a little back on the pillows, which had the effect of thrusting out her breasts. She didn\u2019t have to look down to know that her nipples had tightened in reaction to the night air\u2014and to him. \u201cHours, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He unbuttoned his waistcoat, his fingers working nimbly, although he never took his eyes off her. \u201cI would have hurried had I known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer you not hurry, actually.\u201d She made a moue, as if displeased at the thought.</p><p>His fingers paused. \u201cI shall keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>He flung aside the waistcoat and pulled off his shirt in a flurry of activity, then prowled toward her, bare-chested. He had a lovely chest, broad and muscled, the dark hair curling over nipples and in a line down his belly. Just the sight of him was making her wet, but she must not lose her advantage.</p><p>\u201cYes, you should.\u201d Her gaze flicked downward, toward the breeches, leggings, and moccasins he still wore. \u201cYet you seem to be approaching me prematurely.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and for a moment she thought she\u2019d gone too far. His mouth thinned and he didn\u2019t look particularly pleased. But then he grabbed a wooden chair and set it facing her, only a few feet from the bed. He placed a foot on the chair and began unlacing the moccasin. It was different from the ones he\u2019d ruined; he must have more than that one pair. She watched tiny muscles in his arms and back work as he untied the laces. He pulled the first one off, glanced at her, and began on the other.</p> <p>She swallowed. He was only taking off his shoes, yet she knew he was preparing himself, undressing himself, solely for her. The thought made her breath catch, and she was aware that her body was ready for him.</p><p>He took off the second moccasin and revealed that he\u2019d wrapped his feet in linens. What she could see of his bare feet looked to be healing well, though. He straightened and untied a lace at his side. She saw that his leggings were held up by leather laces tied to a strip of leather about his waist. He untied the lace at his other side and stripped the leggings off. Then he placed his hands on the buttons of his breeches, and she quite forgot about his leggings. He looked at her, holding her eyes as he unbuttoned himself, the flick of his fingers precise and controlled. She thought about what those long, nimble fingers would soon be doing to her and nearly moaned. But she didn\u2019t break the silence, and the rustle as he pushed down his breeches and smallclothes was loud in the room.</p><p>He stepped out of his garments and was gloriously nude, except for that band of leather riding below his navel. She held her breath and watched him unwind that as well and toss it atop his leggings. He was long and lean, his skin tanned where it had met the sun and naturally swarthy where it had not. She could\u2019ve spent years just looking at him. He had dark hair on his calves, bony knees, and thighs that were thick and strong. There was that beautiful, secret male spot where hip met belly, just next to his groin. A muscle arched into his hip there. Above that a thin white scar cut across his belly, and another scar, small and puckered, marred his upper right chest. For a moment, her eyes lingered on the thin scar on his belly, and she remembered how Jasper had said he\u2019d run for days with a knife wound in his side. How hard that must have been. How proud she was to have such a brave man want her.</p><p>Her eyes wandered down again\u2014saving the best for last\u2014to his manhood. She\u2019d forgotten how wondrous a man\u2019s genitals were. His penis pointed nearly upright, thick and hard, wrapped about with veins that bulged with his arousal. Below, his bollocks were tight and round, and the dark hair that curled at his lower belly merely served to emphasize all. She swallowed and had trouble catching her breath.</p><p>\u201cWill I do?\u201d he asked quietly, breaking the silence. He\u2019d stood still, letting her take her time to examine him fully.</p><p>Her eyes rose to his and she inhaled unsteadily. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p> <p>His eyebrows shot up, an arrogant male insulted. \u201cThink? If you are unsure, my lady, let me help you make up your mind.\u201d</p><p>He was at the bed in a second, a rushing pounce that made her jump with nervous feminine alarm. He crawled up and over her on all fours, like an animal, and when she thought he would kiss her, instead he dipped his head to her left nipple. And sucked. She arched, a sigh escaping her throat. He touched her nowhere else, just that single nipple, and he sucked strongly. Was it possible to feel so much from such a small bit of flesh? She reached up and wound her arms about him, reveling in what she\u2019d been unable to do before. Touch him. Feel the heat of his skin beneath her palms, run her hands over the ridges of his ribs, smooth the broad expanse of his lovely back. She wanted to feel every inch of him, to taste him, and to take him into herself until she knew his body as well as her own.</p><p>He lifted his head, but his gaze remained on her breasts. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of this all day\u2014your nipples, bare to me and what I would do with them. I could hardly walk for the cockstand in my breeches.\u201d His eyes flicked to hers, and she saw that his expression was almost angry. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do to me\u2014turn me into a mindless, hungering cock.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed at the words, so crude and explicit.</p><p>His nostrils flared at her movement and she froze. \u201cHold them for me. Offer your breasts to me so I can suck them until you come.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord! She mustn\u2019t let him talk to her this way. He would assume too much if she allowed him to order her about. But at the same time, she felt the moisture seep at her center from just his words. She wanted to offer herself to him. She wanted to let him suck her nipples. So she placed her palms under her breasts and lifted them, like a sacrifice to a half-animal god.</p><p>He growled low in his throat, a sound of approval, and attacked her breasts. Nipping and licking, grasping the rosy tips gently between his teeth, moving back and forth from one breast to the other, his day\u2019s growth of beard scraping against her sensitive skin. Then he took a nipple into his mouth and sucked at it, worrying the opposite nipple with his fingers. And the two points of pleasure lit within her until she arched helplessly, gasping. It was too much. He would hurt her. She couldn\u2019t stand anymore.</p><p>She shuddered, a light blinding her behind her closed eyes as warmth flooded her limbs. Her hands fell away, but he continued to lick, his tongue gently soothing on her breast, each rasp a separate spark. She felt the soft brush of his lips as he kissed her nipple.</p> <p>She opened her eyes. She met his coffee-brown gaze, for he was right there, her breast under his mouth. His look was intense and not kind.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer,\u201d he muttered, and jerked the coverlet from her legs.</p><p>He pushed her thighs apart unceremoniously and sank between them, guiding his penis with one hand. He found her entrance and pushed, parting and breaching her. He pushed again, entering her and entering her until his entire length lay inside. His eyelids fell helplessly and he groaned, still and hard and in her.</p><p>She smiled. How could she not? He took such pleasure in her flesh, seemed so powerless to stop himself from enjoying her. She touched the side of his face with her palm, and he opened his eyes, shockingly bright.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re laughing at me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She shook her head, opening her mouth to explain, but he\u2019d levered himself up so that he was braced on straight arms, his hips pressing hers down into the mattress. And then he moved. He withdrew and jolted back into her, hard and fast. She closed her eyes, forgetting what she was about to say, not caring if he was offended or even angry with her, as long as he kept moving. His hardness was thrusting in her, rubbing against her sensitive flesh, relentless in its purpose\u2014to pleasure him and her.</p><p>\u201cWill this do?\u201d he grunted.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, lost in a sea of bliss.</p><p>He slammed into her and held still. \u201cWill this do, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open and she glared at him. \u201cYes!\u201d She clutched at his buttocks, trying to get him to move again. \u201cYes! Yes! Yes! Just move, damn you!\u201d</p><p>And he complied, either chuckling or growling low in his throat; it was impossible to tell, because her eyes had fallen closed again. Besides, she just didn\u2019t care anymore. All she cared about was the movement of his body in hers. The relentless pistoning, the relentless pleasure. His hardness and drive and the fact that she never, never, never wanted him to stop.</p><p>Until she came in wave after crashing wave. She felt his hand cradle the side of her face. She opened her eyes in time to see him arch, his pelvis grinding against hers, and she watched Samuel Hartley convulse as he came deep inside of her.</p><p>HE WAS GASPING, more out of breath than when he ran. She\u2019d wrung him dry and it felt wonderful.</p><p>Sam collapsed onto Emeline, careful to keep most of his weight off of her but still wanting to feel her fully beneath him. Her breasts against his chest, her belly under his, and her legs tangled about his knees. Somewhere at the back of his brain, he knew that this was a primitive urge to dominate the woman\u2014his woman\u2014and that it was not a kind urge or one he should be proud of. But he pushed the thought away because he was too tired to reason; besides, the position was perfect.</p><p>Although maybe not to her.</p><p>\u201cGet off me,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever heard the so-proper Lady Emeline mumble before and he was delighted. \u201cAm I crushing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She was quiet for a bit, and he thought she might\u2019ve fallen asleep. But then she spoke again. \u201cBut you should get off me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He\u2019d placed his head on the pillow beside hers and was enjoying lying face-to-face and watching her expression.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose without opening her eyes. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the polite thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. But I\u2019m very comfortable where I am, so I\u2019m not that interested in politeness at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snapped open, and she scowled at him in an utterly adorable way. Not that he would ever tell her, but he found her anger arousing.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t my comfort of any importance?\u201d she demanded in a haughty, upper-crust accent.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he told her kindly. \u201cNone at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d was her not-very-eloquent retort, and he smiled at that as well. He loved having reduced her to monosyllables.</p><p>She\u2019d closed her eyes again, and now she said sleepily, \u201cYou\u2019re very sure of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because\u201d\u2014he leaned close enough to kiss her cheek and then whisper in her ear\u2014\u201dmy cock is in your cunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-satisfied,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYes, and so are you.\u201d</p><p>She grunted. \u201cGo to sleep, you vain man.\u201d</p><p>He smiled to himself since she could no longer see and pulled the coverlet over them both. And then, still interlocked with her, he followed her orders and let himself sleep.</p><p>EMELINE CAME FULLY awake all at once early the next morning. She immediately knew that she had stayed the night in Samuel\u2019s room. He still lay beside her. In fact\u2014she tried an experimental wiggle\u2014he still lay in her. Which made a discreet exit rather awkward.</p><p>She watched him. He lay prone, his face turned toward her. His hips covered hers, but most of his upper body was off her chest, except for an arm, thrown possessively over her breasts. The lines beside his mouth had smoothed, and he looked young, his brown hair tousled like a boy\u2019s. Had he looked this way before the war?</p><p>He opened his eyes and focused on her, and his gaze darkened with awareness. He was silent, his gaze traveling over her face. It was early morning, she\u2019d just woken up, and she must look terribly disheveled, but she couldn\u2019t turn away. She let him inspect her, his gaze more intimate than when he had looked at her nude body the night before. What did he see when he looked at her? She couldn\u2019t fathom, and at any other time she\u2019d be cross with her own uncertainty, her own exposure. But right now, with the morning light softly revealing the room, she didn\u2019t let her own vulnerability spoil the moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He raised his palm to cradle the back of her head and brought his face nearer slowly so he could examine her as he approached. He only closed his eyes at the last minute. And then he was kissing her. His mouth was softer in the morning, more relaxed and lazy. He opened it over hers but made no attempt to engage her tongue. Instead he kissed her lushly, his lips moving slowly, erotically, on hers. She could feel his morning stubble, scraping her face in contrast to the softness of his lips. He seemed in no hurry, even though she could feel him, large and incredibly hard, within her.</p><p>He levered himself over her on his elbows, never breaking the kiss, his palms cradling her face, and he surrounded her, male and hard, protective and possessive. She\u2019d never felt so cherished. Never felt so wanted. He\u2019d widened her legs and settled his hips more fully on hers. She could feel the tickle of his chest hairs on her nipples. It was all so intimate. She wasn\u2019t sure she could bear this, this too-close lovemaking. It exposed her, left her open to reveal things she\u2019d rather keep hidden. But she was caught in the moment, seduced by her own yearning and by the man above her.</p><p>His hand traveled from her face to her throat, caressing over her shoulder and side. He paused at her hip, seemingly distracted by their kiss; he\u2019d licked his way into her mouth and she was sucking him. Then his hand continued, reaching one knee and grasping it. He pulled that knee up and over his hip and left it draped there as he pressed his pelvis down into hers.</p><p>She gasped into his mouth. She was open and vulnerable in this position, and when he pressed, she could feel all of him against her mons. She wasn\u2019t sure she liked it, this leisurely, thorough lovemaking. He was laying bare her soul, whether that was his intention or not. She didn\u2019t even think he was aware of what he did to her. But when she would\u2019ve pushed him away, she was beguiled all over again by the sure thrust of his hips. He broke their kiss, raising his head to watch her as he ground slowly down on her exposed flesh. She gasped at the sensation and then frowned at him. How rude to stare at her in this moment! Didn\u2019t he know that this simply wasn\u2019t done? That what they did was only a fleeting pleasure of the flesh, nothing more.</p> <p>Nothing more...</p><p>When he shifted and pressed again, his body hard and insistent within hers, it didn\u2019t feel like only a physical act. It was more. Much more. She panicked, the weight of him, the emotions suddenly overwhelming. She tried to turn her head, raising her arms to push him off, but he caught her quickly, effortlessly, and trapped her wrists on the pillow on either side of her head.</p><p>She sobbed, helpless and angry, and more angry that she let her innermost feelings show. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly, pressing into her again, his hard body causing hers to flower open, vulnerable to all the sensations he was making her feel. His eyelids dropped for a second as if he, too, were overwhelmed by what he did. Then he raised them and looked into her eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head to lick the sweat at her hairline. She felt the gentle abrasion of his tongue and at the same time, the pressure of his cock inside her as he hitched his hips higher, grinding with devastating accuracy onto the one spot that could not withstand his ravishment. He withdrew a fraction of his length, but she felt the friction as his cock pulled against her oversensitive flesh. Then he was bearing down again, grinding, grinding, grinding against her exposed clitoris, and she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.</p> <p>She came apart, all the secrets, doubts, worries, and hopes that she had kept tightly bound to herself flying outward, free and unharnessed, exposed to the chill morning air and to him.</p><p>To him.</p><p>And she looked up in time to see him grit his teeth and tremble, undone as much as she, as he released his seed within her.</p><p>HER TEACUP SHOOK as Emeline raised it to her lips later that morning. She frowned at this outward manifestation of her inner turmoil and sternly made her fingers stop trembling. Around her, no one else in the breakfast room seemed to notice. Except for perhaps Melisande, sitting across from her at the little round table they shared and sending her a too-perceptive look. It really wasn\u2019t something to be valued in a friendship, sensitivity to others. It only led to awkward questions and overly sympathetic glances.</p><p>Emeline pointedly looked away from her dearest friend in the world and tried to focus her mind on something other than the overwhelming lovemaking she\u2019d experienced just that morning. And the night before. And the morning before that. She frowned at her teacup, now perfectly still. Perhaps an overabundance of sex was curdling her brain. That would certainly explain her inability to think of anything else. It couldn\u2019t be healthy to be thinking, brooding, obsessing over a man and his long legs and wide chest and hard, hard, hard penis. Emeline coughed on her tea and looked guiltily at Melisande.</p><p>Who said, \u201cI\u2019ve translated the title of the first fairy tale in that book you gave me. It\u2019s called Iron Heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d For a moment, Emeline was diverted from her troubles. She remembered the fairy tale. Iron Heart. It had been about a man who was brave and strong and true. A man like Samuel, she suddenly realized. How strange.</p><p>Across from her, Melisande cleared her throat. \u201cLord Vale was asking about you last night.\u201d</p><p>Emeline nearly spilled her tea. Hastily, she set down her teacup. Obviously she just wasn\u2019t cut out for this type of subterfuge. Her nerves were overwrought. \u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>Melisande raised her mouse-brown eyebrows. \u201cNothing. He wouldn\u2019t have noticed me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Emeline was distracted from her own worries by her friend\u2019s cynical self-assessment. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Of course he\u2019d notice you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Melisande nodded, no trace of self-pity in her steady brown eyes. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t a clue who I am.\u201d</p> <p>Emeline looked over to where her fianc\u00e9 sat among a bevy of young ladies. He was gesturing widely, evidently in the midst of some story, and his right hand nearly clipped the cap of the lady sitting nearest to him. She again wanted to snap at Melisande not to be silly, but the truth was, Jasper probably did indeed have no clue what Melisande\u2019s name was. He\u2019d always paid more attention to the most beautiful ladies in their circle. That was only to be expected, she supposed. Men were rather shallow that way, caring more for a lady\u2019s looks than her feelings or mind. Most men, anyway. Samuel sat in the opposite corner, flanked by his sister and Mrs. Ives\u2014a rather plain lady of advanced years. He had his head tilted to the lady as she said something, but his eyes caught hers just as she looked at him.</p><p>Emeline looked away, feeling heat invade her cheeks. Damn the man. It wasn\u2019t enough that he\u2019d used her body until it ached this morning in a terrible, pleasurable way; now he must invade her every waking thought.</p><p>\u201c...do hope you used a preventative,\u201d Melisande was saying across from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Emeline asked too sharply.</p><p>Her friend glanced at her as if she could tell that Emeline\u2019s mind was elsewhere. \u201cI said I hoped that you used a preventative last night.\u201d</p><p>Emeline stared. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to prevent a baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>Emeline choked.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d her bosom beau asked as if she hadn\u2019t just shot a cannon into the conversation.</p><p>Emeline waved at her as she took a drink of tea. Briefly, she contemplated denying that she\u2019d spent the night with Samuel, but the conversation seemed well past that point. Instead, she settled on the more pressing matter. \u201cQuite. How...how\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Melisande stared at her sternly. \u201cI can\u2019t think how you can embark upon an affair without taking appropriate measures. There are sponges that fit in the female body\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the world do you know of such things?\u201d Emeline asked in real wonder. Melisande was unmarried and presumably a maiden.</p><p>\u201cThere are books if one is interested.\u201d</p><p>Emeline\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cBooks about...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay attention,\u201d Melisande said sternly. \u201cHave you taken the appropriate measures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s too late for that,\u201d Emeline muttered.</p><p>Her hand crept to her laced belly before she caught herself and snatched it away. How could she not think about such a fundamental thing, even in the heat of passion? The possibility of a baby was a real concern, and one she could not afford. Jasper was very sophisticated, but no man wanted his heir to be someone else\u2019s get. If she was with child, she\u2019d have to marry Samuel. The mere thought turned her stomach. There would be nowhere to hide, living with such a man. She\u2019d be constantly exposed, her feelings, her worst traits, open to him. He saw her, really saw her as no man had ever done before, and she didn\u2019t like it. He would demand things of her, emotions she didn\u2019t want to feel, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to hide behind a fraudulent facade.</p><p>Her horror must\u2019ve shown on her face, for Melisande leaned forward and placed her hand on hers. \u201cDon\u2019t panic. It\u2019s too soon to know; there may be no cause for worry. Unless\u201d\u2014she frowned\u2014\u201cthis affair has been going on longer than I\u2019ve thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Emeline moaned. \u201cOh, no. It\u2019s just been...\u201d But she couldn\u2019t finish the thought. What must Melisande think of her? She\u2019d been cavorting with a man she\u2019d known only a little while at the same party that her fianc\u00e9 attended.</p><p>Her friend patted her hand. \u201cThen there\u2019s no point in worrying. Enjoy the rest of the party and don\u2019t go back to him without prevention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Emeline drew a steadying breath. \u201cI won\u2019t even look at him again. I\u2019m certainly not going to...\u201d She waved away the rest of the sentence and straightened her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll just avoid him. There won\u2019t be another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Melisande\u2019s murmur was noncommittal, but her look was skeptical.</p><p>And Emeline really couldn\u2019t blame her friend. She\u2019d tried, but her voice sounded uncertain even to herself. Against her will, her gaze wandered back to the corner where Samuel sat. He was watching her, his eyes narrowed. To anyone else, his expression was casual, she was sure. But to her it was not. In his eyes she saw lust, possession, and certainty of his own strength. This man wouldn\u2019t give her up without a fight.</p><p>Dear Lord, what had she gotten herself into?</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Iron Heart woke on the next dawn\u2014the day before he was to be released from his silence\u2014to the scream of a woman. The wet nurse stood in the doorway to the plundered nursery, and she screamed and screamed. For every stick of furniture was broken, the walls were splashed with crimson blood, and worse, far, far worse, the baby was gone. Soon the nursery was crowded with the people of the palace\u2014guards, servants, cooks, and maids. All stared at Iron Heart, covered in blood in the nursery where his son had once slept. But his heart did not ache until Princess Solace pushed to the front of the crowd and beheld her husband, and her eyes filled with sorrow....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>She was avoiding him. This much was obvious to Sam as he and Emeline moved through an odd, furtive dance that morning. He would enter a room and she would turn aside, giving him her shoulder. He would make his way slowly, casually toward her; she would voice an excuse and exit the room before he ever got close to her. Over and over again they played this game, and each time he grew more frustrated. He no longer cared if his attempts to catch her were observed by the other members of the party. His only focus was on cornering her. And each time she eluded him, he became more determined.</p><p>They were in the library now, the house party confined to the indoors again today since the rain continued relentlessly outside. He was biding his time, making no move toward her, simply watching for an opening. She sat in the corner with her friend, Miss Fleming. The other woman was plain beside Emeline\u2019s dark beauty, but her eyes were sharp, and she was aware of his every move. Either Emeline had confided their involvement to her friend or the woman had guessed. Not that it mattered. Miss Fleming might be a fierce watchdog, but he wouldn\u2019t let her stand between him and his prey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam grimaced at the thought and looked away. His emotions had never been this primitive, this ungentle, with a woman he wanted before. He knew he was losing control\u2014had perhaps already run past the point of self-control\u2014and yet he could not help himself. He wanted her. Her rejection was like ice held against his bare skin too long. Painful. Unacceptable. She\u2019d let him make love to her; she could not withdraw herself from him now. And underneath all that, there was a layer of hurt that he didn\u2019t want to acknowledge. She\u2019d hurt him, both his pride and something else within him that was basic to his being. It was agonizing, this hurt, and he needed it to stop.</p><p>He needed her.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you come play cards?\u201d Rebecca asked beside him. He\u2019d not even seen her approach.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said absently.</p> <p>\u201cWell, then you must at least stop looking at Lady Emeline like a dog at a sausage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said with exasperation. \u201cI expect you to start drooling at any moment. It\u2019s not nice.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and focused on her face. \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not to others, but I\u2019m your sister. I see things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d He studied her a moment. The yellow of her gown seemed to make her shine. He suddenly realized that his sister was probably among the most lovely of the ladies assembled here. \u201cAre you enjoying the party? I haven\u2019t asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...interesting.\u201d She looked down, avoiding his eyes. \u201cI was afraid at first that no one would talk to me, but that hasn\u2019t been the case. The other ladies have been nice. Mostly.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWho hasn\u2019t been nice to you?\u201d</p><p>She flicked her hand impatiently. \u201cNo one. It doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t fuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your brother; I\u2019m supposed to fuss,\u201d he said, trying to make it a jest.</p><p>His words must not have come off well, because she didn\u2019t smile. Instead she just gazed at him quizzically.</p> <p>He inhaled and tried again. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019ve been keeping company with Mr. Green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-es.\u201d Rebecca drew the word out, her voice cautious. Her head was down-bent, but she darted a glance at that gentleman now. Mr. Green was among the card players in the corner.</p><p>Sam felt like an ass. Rebecca had asked him to play cards. She must want him to give her an excuse to approach Green. He smiled down at her and extended his arm. \u201cShall we go play cards?\u201d</p><p>But she squinted up at him. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>She sighed as if he\u2019d said something incredibly simpleminded. \u201cSamuel, you don\u2019t want to play cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I thought you wanted to play cards,\u201d he said slowly. He felt as if he were searching for a hidden path. Or perhaps that he\u2019d wandered off the path altogether.</p><p>\u201cI did, but not for the reason you think. Have you heard Mr. Green\u2019s laugh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d she said as if that decided the matter. She clasped her hands together as if bracing herself. \u201cI heard Mr. Craddock was dead when you went to question him?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her warily. \u201cHe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I suppose his widow knew nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll have to wait until our return to London to continue the quest.\u201d And then he\u2019d corner Thornton. Over Rebecca\u2019s shoulder, he saw Emeline turn and stroll from the room. Dammit! \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fled again, I suppose,\u201d Rebecca said without even looking over her shoulder.</p><p>He bent and brushed a kiss across her temple, just where her dark hair was pulled back. \u201cYou are much too perceptive for a sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He paused and looked at her, startled. She was a grown woman, his sister, and he didn\u2019t always understand her, but he did love her. He grinned down into her worried eyes.</p><p>And then he was out the door, on the hunt.</p><p>THIS WAS THE problem with engaging in an affaire de coeur with a colonial: he obviously didn\u2019t know when the thing was over.</p><p>Emeline darted a glance over her shoulder as she scurried into a dim servant\u2019s passage. She couldn\u2019t see the dratted man, but she could feel him somewhere behind her. Any other gentleman would know by now that he\u2019d been given his conge. She\u2019d been careful to not look at him, to not engage him in any conversation all this morning. She\u2019d all but cut him dead, and still Samuel would not give up. And the terrible part was that something inside her thrilled at his determination. How he must want her to pursue her like this! She couldn\u2019t help but be flattered.</p><p>In a very exasperated way, of course.</p><p>Emeline rounded a corner, completely lost now, and shrieked when a large hand shot out of the darkness to grab her. Samuel pulled her behind a dusty curtain. There was a little alcove here in the passage that was used as a storage space\u2014she could make out the shapes of barrels stacked against the wall. Nevertheless, it was a very small space, and she was forced up against his chest, which made her squeak.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he murmured into her hair in the most provoking manner, \u201cyou are so loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nearly gave me apoplexy,\u201d she growled at him. Pushing at his chest was having no discernible effect at all, so she gave up and peered at him in the gloom. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to talk to you,\u201d he muttered. There was an edge to his voice, and she could feel, even through the miles of fabric between them, that he was quite hard. He sounded frustrated, and a small, not very nice feminine part of her rejoiced. \u201cIt\u2019s not been easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I haven\u2019t wanted to talk to you.\u201d She shoved at his chest, despite her vow not to, but he didn\u2019t give an inch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a prickly little thing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you anymore. I don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore.\u201d Her frustration boiled over, and she slapped him on the chest. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d She set her jaw, making her voice hard. \u201cIt was pleasant while it lasted, but it\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was nothing but a country affair. We will be going back to the city soon, and then all shall be as it was before. You must be on your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that often work?\u201d He sounded amused, not at all put out by her hurtful words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cOrdering men about.\u201d His voice was low, but in the dim alcove it sounded loud to her ears. \u201cI bet it does. They probably creep off, their tail between their legs to lick the wounds your sharp tongue cuts into them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re spoiled by getting your own way all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not.\u201d She reared back, trying to see his features. \u201cYou don\u2019t know a thing about me.\u201d</p><p>She felt him still against her, and there was a sudden silence in the alcove.</p><p>When next he spoke, his voice was grave and horribly intimate in the dark. \u201cI know that you have a cutting tongue and a quick mind that doesn\u2019t always think pleasant thoughts. And I know that you try to hide all that, as if you were like every other lady, a pretty thing made of meringue\u2014sugary sweet and nothing but air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lady should be sweet,\u201d she whispered. Awful that he knew such things about her. Worse than the intimacies revealed by sex. She maintained the facade with most, or at least she thought she did. A lady should be sweet, not sharp-tongued with mean thoughts flying through her mind all the time. She was too strong, too self-sufficient, too masculine. He must be repulsed.</p><p>\u201cAre there rules for how a lady should be, then?\u201d he asked her temple. \u201cSo many things you must do properly in this country, I don\u2019t know how you stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like a tart lady.\u201d Was that his tongue on the lobe of her ear? \u201cI like the taste of sour, a sharp surprise, like an apple picked too green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen apples give you a stomachache,\u201d she muttered against his chest. She felt a welling in her throat, as if tears threatened. How dare he do this again? Push past her defenses. Destroy her walls like so much papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9?</p><p>He chuckled, the vibration rumbling against her neck. \u201cGreen apples never give me a stomachache. And they make the best pie. Other apples are too sweet; they turn to bland mush when cooked. But a green apple\u201d\u2014his hand was on her skirts, lifting and bunching them\u2014\u201cis brought to life by the sugar and spice. Just right on my tongue.\u201d</p><p>He brought his mouth down on hers, and she was lost all over again. The taste of him was intoxicating. She might be sour to him, but to her he was coffee, rich, darkly sweet, and pure male. She gasped, widening her mouth, wanting to drink him in. This would be the last time; she must stop this insanity soon. She pushed that thought away and simply felt, drifting in a sea of sensation, his arms about her, his tongue in her mouth, the sheer bulk of him over her.</p><p>The scrape of a shoe came from the hallway. Emeline broke the kiss and would\u2019ve gasped, but Samuel covered her mouth with his hand.</p><p>\u201cHas she lost her mind?\u201d an ill-humored voice grumbled directly outside the curtain they hid behind. \u201cTo try tennis in the great hall. Jaysus!\u201d</p><p>Emeline glanced down and saw a huge pair of buckle shoes just below the hem of the curtain. She looked up at Samuel in mute horror. His lips were trembling as he watched her, his hand still over her mouth. The dreadful man was amused! She narrowed her eyes at him. If she could\u2019ve hit him without alerting the man standing not two feet away, she would\u2019ve.</p><p>\u201cNot much else they can do, is there?\u201d A second man was speaking now, his voice higher and almost slurred, as if the servant had been drinking. \u201cToffs gotta have amusements, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but tennis?\u201d The first man\u2019s tone was rich with disgust. \u201cAnd in the house? Why can\u2019t they just do their cards or maybe dice or somethin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDice? Don\u2019t be daft, man. Toffs don\u2019t dice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why not? Whatsa matter with dice, I asks you?\u201d</p><p>Emeline could feel Samuel shaking against her as he tried to contain his laughter. How he could find this amusing was beyond her understanding. She was nearly petrified with the fear of discovery. She glared at him as she lifted her foot and brought the heel of her shoe down on his moccasin. For a moment, she thought he\u2019d lose his self-possession altogether. Instead of sobering him as she\u2019d meant to do, apparently the feel of her heel digging painfully into his foot only amused him further. His eyes sparkled with silent laughter. She stood mutely glaring at him, and then he took his hand from her mouth and replaced it with his own mouth. He kissed her deeply, thoroughly, and altogether silently.</p><p>From without the curtain came a sigh. \u201cHave you some of that good \u2019bacco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTa.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, they were settling in to smoke a pipe! The thought sent horror spiking through Emeline, but at the same time, Samuel thrust his tongue into her mouth and the horror became mingled with pleasure, heightening both. He\u2019d begun working on her skirts again, drawing them stealthily up. The fabric rustled as it moved over her thighs and she froze.</p><p>Outside the curtain, one of the men coughed. She could smell the fragrant scent of tobacco smoke now. They must have both lit pipes. Then that thought fled as Samuel brushed the bared curls at the top of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cWhy tennis, d\u2019you \u2019spose?\u201d the lower voice asked.</p><p>Samuel was threading through her maiden hair, his long fingers drawing nearer to that special spot. She clutched at his shoulders, distracted, confused, and incredibly aroused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Higher Voice replied meditatively. \u201cBetter than lawn bowls, surely? At least indoors it is.\u201d</p><p>Samuel drew back his head and met her eyes. He grinned like the devil himself as his hand reached the apex of her slit. She had to consciously keep from moaning as he slid one finger over her clitoris. Gently he shook his head and at the same time circled that delicate bud.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the windows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat windows?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe windows in the great hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what about them?\u201d High Voice sounded peeved.</p><p>Samuel bit his lip as if to still a laugh, but Emeline was riding a wave of terrified bliss. If the footmen outside opened the curtain now, they\u2019d discover her nearly naked from the hips down and with Samuel\u2019s large hand working at her pussy. He inserted a thick finger into her core slowly, carefully, watching her face all the while. At the same time, his thumb pressed firmly down on that special bit of flesh. She opened her mouth in a silent gasp, glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cTennis balls would break them, won\u2019t they?\u201d Low Voice said.</p><p>Whatever was the man babbling about? Not that it mattered, as long as the servant was engaged. Samuel slowly withdrew his finger and then quickly thrust it in again, making her hips jerk in reaction. She couldn\u2019t stand this much longer; she would give them away. She did the only thing she could do. She wrapped her hands about Samuel\u2019s neck and drew his mouth down to her own. He began a rapid thrusting of his finger, and she opened her mouth and invited his tongue in. She needed him. The feelings, the emotions, were intense. She wanted to climb his body, she wanted to suck his tongue, she wanted to bring him to his knees as he\u2019d brought her to hers. Why did this man, of all the men she knew, have power over her? She turned into a puddle of yearning want around him, and only he seemed able to fill the void at her center. Her breath caught because he was indeed filling her. A second finger had joined the first, and he plunged them into her together, then spread them, widening her. She was wet, and even that thought couldn\u2019t bring her embarrassment right now. She was emotion and pleasure and never wanted this to stop.</p> <p>\u201cBest be back to work,\u201d Low Voice said. A shoe scraped against the passageway\u2019s stone floor as the man evidently put away his pipe. \u201cHaven\u2019t looked in the cellar yet, have we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be daft, man.\u201d The footsteps were receding now. \u201cThe tennis things won\u2019t be in the cellar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a clever one, tell me where they are, then.\u201d Low Voice\u2019s words floated back down the hall to them, and then there was silence.</p><p>Oh, Lord. Samuel had never stopped moving his fingers within her or kissing her open mouth all this time, and now she felt the first tremors start. She broke away and gasped, biting her lip, so that she wouldn\u2019t cry out loud.</p><p>But he withdrew his hand from her suddenly, catching her about the waist and lifting and shoving so that her rump balanced precariously on a barrel. Then he was between her legs, and she opened her eyes to watch him frantically rip at his breeches.</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d It was a groan. He freed himself and thrust into her, huge and hot, in the same movement. \u201cGod!\u201d</p> <p>She sank her nails into the cloth covering his shoulders and hung on for dear life, wrapping her legs high over his hips. He jerked rapidly in her, thrusting again and again and again. Her orgasm had not fully crested and now it began anew on a higher, sweeter, almost painful note. He had one hand braced flat against the wall by her head, one at her hip, and his cock buried deep in between her spread legs. She tore at his coat, ripping it off his upper arm, and filled her mouth with clean linen and his shoulder. Her eyes closed in bliss as she bit him. She clung to him while his cock took his pleasure of her. He rode her hard, rode her until she wanted to scream, rode her until he grabbed the back of her head and kissed her, his mouth wide and gasping as he came, his great body shaking. She could feel the heat of his seed flooding within her. And she knew, even as she crested the wave herself, she knew.</p><p>This must be the last time.</p><p>\u201cMAY I TALK to you?\u201d Emeline asked Jasper that afternoon. She\u2019d caught him in an upper hallway. The guests were beginning to linger by the dining room in anticipation of a late luncheon.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He smiled his wide, slightly lopsided smile, and she could tell that he wasn\u2019t really paying attention to her.</p><p>\u201cJasper.\u201d She touched his sleeve.</p><p>He stopped and turned to her, his bushy eyebrows knit. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>His eyes searched hers. So often they were vague or camouflaged behind the fool he liked to play. It was rare for him to look clearly, for her to see the man who lurked beneath the mask. Now, though, he was looking at her. Really looking at her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>She took a breath, and to her own astonishment, the truth escaped her lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, then raised his head to glance around the hallway. They were at the back of the house, but there were still people about, footmen and maids bringing in the luncheon, guests assembling in the next room. He took her hand and pulled her through a doorway into another passage. Several doors lined the hall here, and he seemed to pick one at random. He opened it and stuck his head in.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll do.\u201d He pulled her inside and shut the door behind them. It was a small sitting room or office, evidently unused because the fireplace was empty and sheets covered most of the furniture. He folded his arms. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how she wanted to! The urge to simply spill all her secrets was nearly overpowering. What a relief it would be if she could tell him everything and he would pat her shoulder and say, \u201cThere, there.\u201d</p><p>Except he wouldn\u2019t. Jasper might be the closest thing she had to a brother, he might be scandalously liberal about love affairs and matters of the flesh, but when you came right down to it, he was a viscount. He was expected to sire an heir to a very old and very respected family. The knowledge that his fianc\u00e9e had been meeting secretly with another man would not bring him joy. He might hide it, but in the end, Emeline very much feared that he would care.</p><p>So she pasted on a smile and lied. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it here anymore. I really can\u2019t. I know I should be more patient and bear with Lady Hasselthorpe and her awful conversation and this dreadful house party, but I can\u2019t. Do you think you could take me back to London, Jasper? Please?\u201d</p><p>His face as he watched her make this speech was disconcertingly blank. Odd that such a manic man, a man with many comical expressions should, when he chose, be utterly impossible to read. But when she came to the end and there was an awful dead silence, he suddenly sprang forward, his face animated once more as if a toymaker had turned the key on a very clever windup toy.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, dear Emmie, naturally! I shall have my bag packed in a thrice. Can our flight wait for the morning, or...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, if you don\u2019t mind. Now, please.\u201d Emeline nearly wept with relief when he simply nodded.</p><p>He leaned forward and bussed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019d best alert Pynch.\u201d And he strode off.</p><p>Emeline paused a moment to gather her sensibilities. Horrible, this constant feeling of losing control over her emotions. She\u2019d always thought of herself as a levelheaded woman. The unemotional one, the one who others leaned on. She\u2019d hardly wept when Father had died; she\u2019d been too busy packing up Tante Cristelle, overseeing the succession of the estate to the next earl, and settling their decimated family in London. Then people had been admiring, almost awed by her good sense and stoicism. Now she was like an infant\u2014shook by whatever emotion stormed over her.</p><p>She made her way back to her room, always alert like some woodland animal afraid of the hunter. And that was quite apropos, wasn\u2019t it? Samuel was a hunter\u2014a good one, too. He\u2019d hunted her down this morning, chased her into a corner, and had had his way with her. She grimaced. No, that wasn\u2019t exactly right. Samuel might\u2019ve chased her, but she\u2019d been thrilled to be caught; and while he\u2019d had his way with her, she\u2019d been having her way with him. That was the real problem. She had no defenses against the man. She\u2019d never thought of herself as being a slave to the flesh, but here she was fleeing a man because she could not withstand his advances. Evidently she\u2019d been a wanton all these years and not even known it. Either that, or it was the man involved.</p><p>But she pushed that thought away as she entered her room. Harris was supervising the packing of all her things with the help of two maids from the house.</p><p>The lady\u2019s maid looked up as Emeline entered. \u201cWe shall be ready in a half hour more, should it please your ladyship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Harris.\u201d</p><p>Emeline peeked out the door, scanning the hallway before venturing forth again. She\u2019d rather spend that half hour hiding in her room where it was relatively safe, but her presence would only impede Harris\u2019s well-organized packing campaign. Besides, she couldn\u2019t in all conscience leave so abruptly without talking to Melisande.</p><p>Her friend\u2019s door was only a few down in the same hallway, and Emeline swiftly crept to it. Melisande should be downstairs already, waiting with the other guests, but she had a habit of arriving late to a gathering. Emeline had long suspected that her friend\u2019s tardiness was a ruse to keep from having to engage in conversation. Melisande was rather shy, although she hid her affliction well beneath a carapace of aloofness and sarcasm.</p><p>Emeline scratched at the door. There was a rustle within, and then Melisande cracked the door. She cocked an eyebrow at the sight of her friend and held the door wide in silent invitation.</p><p>Emeline hurried inside. \u201cClose the door.\u201d</p><p>Her friend\u2019s eyebrows winged higher. \u201cAre we hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Emeline replied, and went to warm her hands by the fire.</p><p>She heard Melisande\u2019s skirts rustling behind her. \u201cI think it\u2019s a Germanic dialect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Emeline turned to find Melisande seated in a wingback chair.</p><p>Her friend gestured to the book spread on her knees. \u201cYour nurse\u2019s book. I think it\u2019s some type of Germanic dialect, probably spoken only in a small area, maybe only a village or two. I can try to translate it for you, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Emeline stared at the book. Somehow it didn\u2019t seem as important as it once had. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Melisande fingered a page. \u201cI\u2019ve already figured out the title: Four Soldiers Returned from War and Their Adventures.\u201d</p><p>Emeline was distracted. \u201cBut I thought it was a book of fairy tales?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, that\u2019s the funny thing. These four soldiers all have the strangest names, like the one I told you about, Iron Heart, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d Emeline said, and then felt awful when her friend\u2019s face, unusually animated, shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear, I\u2019m a beast. Do go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think what you have to tell me is more important.\u201d Melisande closed the old book and laid it aside. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d Emeline dropped into the chair opposite her friend. \u201cToday.\u201d</p><p>Melisande relaxed her rigid posture to lean back into her chair. Her eyes were hooded. \u201cHas he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel? No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the haste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...I can\u2019t...\u201d Emeline threw her hands up in frustration. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to resist him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is interesting,\u201d her friend murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re usually so controlled. He must be a very\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, he is,\u201d Emeline said. \u201cAnd what do you know of such matters? You\u2019re supposed to be a maiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cBut we\u2019re discussing you. Have you thought what you\u2019ll do if you\u2019re increasing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emeline\u2019s heart seemed to stop dead at her fear spoken aloud. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if you are?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shall have to marry him.\u201d She said the words with dread, but inside her chest, something traitorous leapt with a forbidden joy.

A man often cannot take the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think me awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course not, dear.\u201d Melisande glanced up, a flicker of surprise crossing her face. \u201cWhy would you think that I\u2019d judge you?\u201d</p><p>Emeline closed her eyes. \u201cSo many would. I think I would, if I only heard the facts and not the people involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am not such a Puritan as you,\u201d her friend said with pragmatic flatness. \u201cBut I do have one question. How will leaving here help your problem with Mr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe distance, don\u2019t you see? If I\u2019m not in the same house, or county, as he is, well, then I won\u2019t be as susceptible to his...his...\u201d Emeline waved her hands. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p> <p>Melisande looked thoughtful\u2014and not altogether convinced. \u201cAnd when he returns to London as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all over. I\u2019m sure time and distance will make a great difference.\u201d Emeline said the words sturdily, as if she completely believed them, but inside she was not so certain.</p><p>And no matter her words, Melisande must\u2019ve sensed the doubt. Her eyebrows were up almost to her hairline again. But her friend didn\u2019t comment. She simply stood and gave one of her rare signs of affection.</p><p>Melisande drew Emeline into her thin chest and hugged her tightly. \u201cGood luck, then, dear. I hope your plan works.\u201d</p><p>And Emeline laid her head against her friend\u2019s shoulder and prayed, eyes squeezed shut, that her plan would work. If it didn\u2019t, she had nowhere else to run.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Murder! cried the guards. Murder! cried the lords and ladies of the court. Murder! cried the people of the Shining City. And all Iron Heart could do was clasp his head in his bloodied hands. The princess cried and begged, first to her mute husband that he might break his silence and explain what he had done, and then to her father for mercy, but in the end, it was no use. The king had no choice but to sentence Iron Heart to death by fire, the execution to be carried out before the next dawn....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p> <p>\u201cIt was a lovely party, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Rebecca broke an hour\u2019s silence with her tentative question.</p><p>Sam tore his gaze from the gloomy scenery rolling past and tried to focus on his younger sister. She was sitting across from him in their rented carriage, looking forlorn, which was his fault, he knew. It had been three days since Emeline had quit the house party so abruptly. He hadn\u2019t even known she was gone until long after she hadn\u2019t shown for luncheon on the day they\u2019d made love in the corridor. By the time he discovered her flight, she\u2019d had a two-hour start.</p><p>Still, he would\u2019ve followed her if Rebecca hadn\u2019t talked some sense into him. She\u2019d begged him to stay, pointing out the scandal he\u2019d create if he pursued Lady Emeline so soon after she\u2019d left. Personally, he didn\u2019t care two figs about possible wagging tongues. But Rebecca was a different matter entirely. She\u2019d been spending quite a bit of time with several of the young ladies from good English families. Scandal would kill any budding friendships.</p><p>Sam had tamped down his raging need to hunt Emeline, catch her, and hold her until she came to her senses and stayed by him. He\u2019d sat on his hands and made polite conversation with giggling girls and insipid matrons. He\u2019d dressed in his best clothes, played idiot games, and ate overly rich foods. And at night he\u2019d dreamed of her snapping tongue and her soft, warm breasts. For three days, he\u2019d restrained himself, until finally members of the house party had begun to leave and Rebecca deemed it appropriate for them to depart Hasselthorpe House as well. It had been three days of hell, but that was hardly Rebecca\u2019s fault, and he was a cad to be such a boring traveling partner.</p><p>He tried to make up for the hours of silence she\u2019d endured. \u201cDid you enjoy the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled at him in relief. \u201cAt the end, many of the other young ladies were talking to me and the Hopedale sisters have invited me to come have tea with them some afternoon in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should\u2019ve been talking to you at the beginning of the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had to get to know me, didn\u2019t they? It\u2019s really not all that different from people at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it here in England?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She hesitated, then shrugged. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d She looked down thoughtfully at her hands in her lap. \u201cAnd what about you? Do you like England enough to stay here with Lady Emeline?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected such a blunt query, although he should have. Rebecca was a very perceptive girl. When they\u2019d arrived in London, he\u2019d planned on staying only long enough to do his business with Mr. Wedgwood and look into the Spinner\u2019s Falls massacre. Now his business was finished, and soon he hoped to talk to Thornton and clear up Spinner\u2019s Falls as well. What then? \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Rebecca impatiently. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t stood still long enough for me to talk to her, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca watched him for a moment, then asked hesitantly, \u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He answered without considering the matter, but he found that it was true. Somehow, without his even realizing it, he\u2019d fallen in love with his prickly Emeline. The thought was strange and at the same time perfectly natural, as if he\u2019d known all along that she was the woman he needed. It was a joyous feeling, as if he\u2019d been waiting all his life for this missing piece.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her, you know.\u201d</p><p>He looked at his sister in exasperation. \u201cThank you for tutoring me in love. I\u2019ll tell her as soon as the lady permits me to catch her.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cAnd then what will you do?\u201d</p><p>He thought of Lady Emeline and how she argued with him every chance she got. He thought of how far apart they were in rank. He thought about the fear she tried to hide, successfully with everyone, it seemed, but him. He thought about how startled she looked when she fell apart in his arms, as if she couldn\u2019t fathom not being in control of everything around her, including her body. And he thought about the sadness he sometimes saw in her eyes. He wanted to hold that sadness, cradle it and comfort it until it turned to happiness. He wanted to feel her hands on him again, like the night she\u2019d bound his broken feet, soothing him, laying her balm on his soul. She\u2019d warmed him. She\u2019d healed him.</p><p>And he knew what he would do. He grinned at his sister. \u201cI\u2019ll marry her, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHY ISN\u2019T MR. Hartley home yet?\u201d Daniel asked.</p><p>Emeline looked up in time to see her only child poke a piece of paper into the fire in her room. The paper caught and Daniel dropped it just before the flame reached his fingers. The burning sheet fluttered down, fortunately landing in the hearth rather than on her carpet.</p><p>She paused in writing out a series of last-minute instructions for the party tonight. \u201cDearest, would you mind not setting Mother\u2019s room afire? I don\u2019t think Harris would be particularly pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d rather you not burn up your fingers. They are quite useful, you know, and you might need them in later life.\u201d</p><p>Daniel grinned at this silliness and came over to climb into a chair near her desk. She winced as his shoes scraped against the satin chair cushion but decided not to comment. It was nice to have him here with her again after being separated so long.</p><p>He leaned on her desk, his chin in his crossed arms. \u201cHe must come back soon, mustn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Emeline looked back at her writing, struggling to maintain a composed expression. She didn\u2019t have to ask who Daniel was referring to; he was a tenacious child and obviously wouldn\u2019t give up the subject of their neighbor\u2014her lover\u2014easily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, dear. I\u2019m not privy to Mr. Hartley\u2019s plans.\u201d</p><p>Daniel scratched one finger across her blotter, wrinkling his nose as he made an indent in the paper with his fingernail. \u201cBut he is coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume so.\u201d Emeline inhaled. \u201cI believe Cook was making pear tarts in the kitchen today. Perhaps you should go see if they are done.\u201d</p><p>Usually the mention of freshly made tarts would be an immediate distraction for her son.</p><p>Not today. \u201cI hope he comes back. I like him.\u201d</p><p>And her heart contracted. Three simple words and she was reduced to near tears. Carefully, she laid aside her pen. \u201cI like him, too, but Mr. Hartley has his own life to lead. He can\u2019t be always around to entertain you, to entertain us.\u201d</p><p>Daniel was still watching his fingernail, his bottom lip beginning to protrude now.</p><p>She tried to make her voice cheerful. \u201cThere\u2019s always Lord Vale. You like him, too, don\u2019t you? I can see if he\u2019d escort us to Hyde Park.\u201d Her son\u2019s lip protruded farther. \u201cOr...or to a fair or perhaps even fishing.\u201d</p><p>Daniel cocked his head to look at her skeptically. \u201cFishing?\u201d</p><p>Emeline tried to picture Jasper with a fishing pole, standing beside a rushing river. Her imaginary Jasper immediately slipped, flailed wildly, and fell into the river.</p><p>She winced. \u201cMaybe not fishing.\u201d</p><p>Daniel was back to pressing half-moon shapes into her blotter. \u201cLord Vale\u2019s all right, but he doesn\u2019t have a big rifle.\u201d</p><p>Faint praise indeed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, darling,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>She looked down at the papers scattered on her desk, at the instructions she\u2019d been writing, and her vision blurred. She felt as if her heart were breaking. Damn Samuel for ever coming into their lives. For seeking her out at Mrs. Conrad\u2019s salon that first day, for talking to her son so gently, for making her feel again.</p><p>She gasped at the thought. That was the real problem. He\u2019d made her feel again, cracked the shell that had hardened around her emotions and left her defenseless and vulnerable. She was too raw now, her skin too soft. How long would this feeling last? How long before she could grow another shell? She looked at Daniel, her beautiful boy. He was growing so fast. It seemed like he\u2019d been a tender little babe only yesterday, and today she worried for her furniture with his big shoes. Did she even want to shield herself from emotion again?</p><p>Impulsively, she leaned forward, her head nearly touching his. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right. It really will. I\u2019ll make sure it is.\u201d</p><p>One side of his face scrunched up in thought. \u201cBut can it be all right with Mr. Hartley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear.\u201d She straightened and turned so that he wouldn\u2019t see the sadness in her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>They both looked up as the door opened and Tante Cristelle entered the room. The old lady looked at her with a gaze that had always been too sharp.</p><p>Emeline turned back to Daniel. \u201cI must speak with Tante now. Why don\u2019t you see if those pear tarts are done yet? Perhaps Cook will let you sample one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Daniel wasn\u2019t happy at the dismissal, but he\u2019d always been a good boy. He slid off the chair and made a half bow to his aunt before slipping from the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat one missed you most severe while you were away.\u201d The lines around Tante Cristelle\u2019s mouth became more pronounced in her disapproval. \u201cI do not think it is well that he is so close with you.\u201d</p><p>This conversation was old, and normally Emeline might argue, but today she didn\u2019t have the heart. She gathered her papers silently. Behind her she heard the thump of Tante Cristelle\u2019s cane on the Persian carpet and then felt the old woman\u2019s frail hand on her shoulder. She looked up into wise eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt is the right thing that you do tonight; never fear that.\u201d Tante Cristelle patted her once\u2014an extreme outpouring of affection\u2014and walked from the room.</p><p>Leaving Emeline with eyes once again filled with tears.</p> <p>BY THE TIME the carriage pulled up outside Sam\u2019s town house, it had been dark for hours. A late start combined with a wait for fresh horses at one of the inns had made the journey back to London an overlong one. And then, once they had turned into the street where they lived, there had been an uncommon crush of carriages. Someone must be hosting a ball. As Samuel stepped down and turned to help Rebecca from the carriage, he realized that the lights were blazing in the house next to his. Emeline\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cIs Lady Emeline having a party?\u201d Rebecca asked. She hesitated before the steps. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she would be throwing one, did you?\u201d</p><p>Sam slowly shook his head. \u201cObviously we weren\u2019t invited.\u201d</p><p>He saw her glance swiftly at him. \u201cPerhaps she planned it before she met us. Or...or she might not have expected us back from the country so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that must be it,\u201d he said grimly.</p> <p>The little witch was thumbing her nose at him, showing him that he had no part in her London life. He knew that he shouldn\u2019t rise to the bait, but his hands had already bunched into fists, his legs twitching, ready to stride into her house and confront her. He grimaced. Now was not the time.</p><p>He relaxed his fists and held out his arm to his sister. \u201cShall we see if Cook can lay out a cold supper for us?\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cYes, let\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He led her up the front steps and inside, all the while aware of the house next door and the elegantly dressed guests arriving for Emeline\u2019s party. He sat his sister in the dining room, ordered a simple supper, and was even able to make polite conversation while they ate. But his mind was elsewhere, imagining Emeline in her most elegant gown, her bosom glowing white and erotic in the light of thousands of candles.</p><p>After they ate, Rebecca excused herself, already yawning. Sam went to the library and poured himself a glass of French brandy. He paused and held the glass up to the light. The liquid shown translucent amber. When he was growing up, his father had drunk homemade spirits, bought from a family ten miles away through the woods. Sam had once taken a sip. The drink had been clear like water and hot, burning his throat as he swallowed. Had Pa ever drunk French brandy in his entire life? Maybe once while visiting Uncle Thomas in the big city of Boston. But it would have been an exotic thing, something special to be savored and thought about for days afterward.</p><p>Sam sank into a gilt armchair. He didn\u2019t belong here; he knew that. There was too wide a gulf between the life he\u2019d led as a boy and the life he led now. A man could change only so much in one lifetime. He would never fully fit into English society, and he didn\u2019t really want to. This was the life that Emeline led. The beautiful town houses, the French brandy, the balls that continued until well past midnight. The ocean that yawned wide between her world and his\u2014both metaphorically and physically\u2014was too great a distance. He knew all that, had considered it many times before.</p> <p>And it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He gulped the rest of the brandy and rose with purpose. He needed to see Emeline. Worlds apart or no, she was a woman and he was a man. Some things were basic.</p><p>Outside his town house, he saw that the lights still blazed next door. Coachmen sat huddled on their perches, a few running footmen stood together, passing a bottle between them. He leapt up Emeline\u2019s front steps and was confronted with a burly footman. The man made a move as if to block his path.</p><p>Sam stared at him hard. \u201cI\u2019m Lady Emeline\u2019s neighbor.\u201d</p><p>This was no invitation, of course, but the footman must\u2019ve seen the determination in his eyes and decided the point wasn\u2019t worth arguing. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d He held the door open.</p><p>Sam crossed the threshold and immediately realized his peril. The hall held only a few servants, but the grand, curving staircase was crowded. He began making his way up the stairs, past loudly talking groups. Emeline\u2019s ballroom was on the upper floor, and as he neared, the clamor became louder, the air heavier and hotter. He felt sweat start at his neck. He hadn\u2019t been in such a crowded space since the Westerton ball, and there he had succumbed to his demons most ignominiously. Not here, he prayed.</p><p>By the time he made the entrance to the ballroom, his breath was coming fast and short, as if he\u2019d run miles. For a moment, he considered turning back. Emeline had lit thousands of beeswax candles in her ballroom, in mirrored chandeliers overhead. The place was bright, sparkling like a fairyland. Swags of scarlet silk hung from the walls and ceiling, orange and red flowers caught in the knots. The room was beautiful, elegant, but he didn\u2019t care. His woman was somewhere in this room, and he meant to catch her and hold her.</p><p>Sam inhaled carefully through his mouth and dove into the mass of sweating, milling humanity. He could hear violins faintly playing, but they were all but drowned out by laughter and chattering voices. A gentleman in purple velvet turned and bumped into Sam\u2019s chest. Blood and screaming, eyes wide in a white face below a bleeding scalp. He closed his eyes, shoving past the man. Ahead was an opening in the crowd where the dancers paced with stately grace. He made the edge of the dance floor and paused, gasping for air. A matron in yellow silk eyed him and whispered behind her fan to her companion. Damn them all, anyway, these overfed, overornamented English aristocrats. When had they ever known fear or felt the splatter of blood from a fellow soldier? The surprise in a young soldier\u2019s face as half his head was blown away.</p> <p>The dancers halted, no more out of breath than if they\u2019d sat for the last five minutes. They looked bored and bloodless, as if they could barely take the trouble to keep themselves upright. The crowd shuffled against him, and he had to close his eyes and concentrate to keep from striking out at the nearest person. He breathed deeply and tried to think of Emeline\u2019s eyes. In his mind, they were narrowed with exasperation and that made him almost smile.</p><p>He opened his eyes, and Lord Vale strode into the middle of the dance floor, now nearly empty. \u201cFriends! Friends, may I have your ear?\u201d</p><p>Vale\u2019s shout, loud though it was, was swallowed by the mass of bodies. Nevertheless, the conversations began to die.</p><p>\u201cFriends, I have something to say!\u201d</p><p>A group of young gentlemen moved in front of Sam, obscuring his vision. They looked barely old enough to shave.</p><p>\u201cFriends!\u201d came Vale\u2019s shout again, and Sam caught a glimpse of scarlet.</p><p>His heart galloped. He put out a hand to shove against a padded shoulder, and the young buck in front of him turned to glare. Sam inhaled and caught the stink of sweat. Male sweat, sour and burning, the smell of fear. The prisoner MacDonald crouching under a wagon as the battle raged all around. MacDonald catching Sam\u2019s eye from his hiding place. MacDonald grinning and winking.</p><p>\u201cI have an announcement that pleases me greatly.\u201d</p><p>Sam started forward, ignoring the stench, ignoring his demons, ignoring the realization that he was already too late.</p><p>\u201cLady Emeline Gordon has consented to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>The crowd applauded as Sam barreled through the men, those dead and alive, who stood between him and Emeline. He came out on the dance floor and saw Emeline smiling politely beside Vale. Vale had his arms raised, triumphant in this moment. Emeline turned her head and her smile died as she saw Sam.</p><p>He started for them with no thought in his head save murder.</p><p>Vale caught sight of him. His eyes narrowed and he nodded to someone behind Sam. Sam felt his arms seized and pulled behind him. And then he was being hustled from the ballroom by two burly footmen, a third clearing the way ahead. It happened so fast he didn\u2019t even have time to call out to Emeline. At the side of the ballroom, Sam finally came to himself and twisted violently, catching one of the footmen by surprise. He pulled his arm free and swung at the man, but before his fist could connect, he was shoved from behind. The first footman still holding him let go, and Sam half fell into the hall. He straightened and whirled, and Vale\u2019s fist slammed into his jaw.</p><p>Sam stumbled back, landing on his arse. Vale stood over him, his fists still balled. \u201cThat was for Emmie, you whoreson.\u201d He turned to the footmen behind him. \u201cTake this rubbish and pitch it\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Vale didn\u2019t finish the sentence. Sam rose, low and fast, and charged him, catching him about the knees. Vale went down with a thunderous crash, Sam on top. Several women shrieked and the crowd scattered away from them. Sam began to crawl up him, but Vale twisted, and they both went tumbling, rolling toward the stairs. A matron screamed as she fled down the stairs, pushing other ladies ahead of her. Their skirts swept across suddenly cleared steps.</p><p>Sam grabbed the top banister to stop the momentum of their roll. He teetered, his shoulders over the first step, until Vale kicked at his undefended stomach and Sam had to let go to shield himself. He slid, head-down, but managed to snatch Vale\u2019s arm, bringing the other man with him. They careened without control down the stairs, tangled together in a murderous heap. Each tread raked painfully across Sam\u2019s back as they thumped down. He no longer cared if he lived through this encounter or not. He just wanted to make sure he took his enemy with him. Midway down, they slammed into a banister, halting their descent. Sam hooked an arm around a wood pole and kicked viciously at Vale, catching him good and solid, low on the side.</p><p>Vale arched under the impact. \u201cHell!\u201d He twisted and pressed his forearm down on Sam\u2019s windpipe, thrusting hard. Sam gagged from the weight. Vale brought his head close to Sam\u2019s and spoke low, his face black with rage. \u201cYou stupid, shitty colonial. How dare you put your filthy hands on\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sam let go of the railing and slammed both hands against Vale\u2019s ears. Vale rocked back, freeing Sam\u2019s throat, and Sam gasped painfully for air. But they were sliding farther down the stairs. Vale pummeled him, hitting at face and belly and thighs. Sam jolted with each impact, but strangely, he didn\u2019t feel a thing. His entire being was filled with rage and sorrow. Sam punched the other man, striking anything he could hit. He felt his knuckles split against Vale\u2019s cheekbone and felt the wet smack as the other man\u2019s nose broke. His back jarred into the landing. Vale was on top now, a clear advantage, except that Sam didn\u2019t goddamn care. He\u2019d lost everything, and right now this man was the cause of it all. Vale might have righteous anger, but Sam had the rage of despair, pure and simple. There was no match.</p><p>Sam lurched up, right through Vale\u2019s punches. He could feel their impact on his face, but he plowed through the blows. There was only the need to kill. He caught Vale and threw the bigger man down, and then Sam was hitting him, slamming his fists into Vale\u2019s face, and the feeling was glorious. He felt the crunch of bone, saw the splatter of blood, and didn\u2019t care. Didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Until he caught a movement from the corner of his eye. He swung up and froze, his clenched, bloody fist only inches from Emeline\u2019s face.</p><p>She flinched. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, this woman he\u2019d made love to, this woman he\u2019d poured his soul into.</p><p>This woman he loved.</p><p>She had tears in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She reached out one small, white hand and wrapped it around his bruised and bloodied fist. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Below him, Vale wheezed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze cut to her fianc\u00e9 and her tears overflowed. \u201cPlease, Samuel.

Sam lowered his hand and lurched upright. \u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>He staggered down the stairs and out into the cold night.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>That night, Iron Heart lay chained in the dank, cold dungeon and knew that he had lost everything. His baby son was gone, his princess wife was in despair, the kingdom stood undefended, and before the dawn, he would be put to death. One word from his lips would exonerate him. That same word would send him back to sweeping the streets and kill Princess Solace. He did not care how his life ended, but he could not be the instrument of the princess\u2019s death. For a strange and wonderful thing had happened in the six years of his marriage.</p><p>He\u2019d fallen in love with his wife....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>When Rebecca descended the stairs the next morning, she startled two maids. They had been standing, heads bent close together, whispering furiously. At the sound of her footfall, they leapt apart and stared up at her.</p><p>Rebecca lifted her chin. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss.\u201d The older one recovered first, bobbing a curtsy before hurrying away with her friend.</p><p>Rebecca sighed. The servants were naturally excited about the events of the night before. Samuel had awakened the entire household when he\u2019d stumbled in the front door with blood streaming down his face. He\u2019d been adamant that she not send for a doctor, but for once Rebecca had overridden her older brother. The blood and his apathy had frightened her half to death. She hadn\u2019t seen Lord Vale, but from bits and pieces she\u2019d gathered from the doctor and the servants, the viscount was in even worse condition.</p><p>Rebecca wished desperately that she could tiptoe next door and just talk to Lady Emeline. Sit and commiserate with her. Lady Emeline always seemed to know exactly what should be done in any given situation, and she was the type of woman who could set everything right. Always assuming that this problem could be set right. But Rebecca very much feared that she might never talk to Lady Emeline again. She doubted that there was an etiquette rule that covered this situation. How to approach a lady whose fianc\u00e9 your brother has beaten into a bloody pulp. It was very awkward.</p><p>She wandered into the dining room, her brows knit. Samuel had hardly spoken the night before, and she knew from the servants that he hadn\u2019t stirred from his bedroom this morning. She had the dining room to herself and her worries. Actually, she felt the most lonely since she\u2019d set foot in England. She rather wished that there was someone she could confide in. But Samuel wasn\u2019t talking, and everyone else in the house was a servant.</p><p>Rebecca reached for a chair only to find a masculine hand pulling it out for her. She looked up\u2014far up\u2014into the face of O\u2019Hare the footman.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, miss,\u201d he said as formally as if he\u2019d never talked to her so casually just a few weeks ago.</p><p>There was another footman in the room, of course, and the butler lurked somewhere about. Rebecca sat in her chair feeling a bit deflated. She looked down at the tablecloth in front of her and struggled to hold back sudden tears. Now, that was silly! To go weeping like a baby just because a servant didn\u2019t acknowledge one as a friend. Even if one could really use a friend right now.</p><p>She watched as O\u2019Hare\u2019s big, reddened hand poured her tea. \u201cI wonder...\u201d She trailed off, thinking hard.</p><p>\u201cYes, miss?\u201d His voice was so nice, with that bit of a burr softening it.</p><p>She looked up and met his green eyes. \u201cMy brother\u2019s very favorite sweet in all the world is crabapple jelly, and he hasn\u2019t had any in ages. Do you think it might be possible to purchase some?\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Hare\u2019s green eyes blinked. He really did have the most lovely, long eyelashes, almost like a girl\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s crabapple jelly at the grocer\u2019s, miss, but I can go look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not you.\u201d She smiled sweetly at the other footman, a bowlegged fellow who\u2019d been watching their conversation with wide, not-too-bright eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d the second footman said. He looked confused, but he was well trained. He bowed and exited, presumably in search of crabapple jelly.</p> <p>Which left Rebecca alone with O\u2019Hare.</p><p>She took a sip of her tea\u2014too hot, she usually let it sit for a minute to cool off\u2014and set the teacup down precisely on the table. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since our return from the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, miss.\u201d</p><p>She twisted the teacup a bit. \u201cI just realized. I don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s O\u2019Hare, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that one.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at her teacup. \u201cYour other name. Your Christian name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGil, miss. Gil O\u2019Hare. At yer service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gil O\u2019Hare.\u201d</p><p>She folded her hands in her lap. He stood behind her like a proper footman, ready to serve her anything she might need. Except what she needed wasn\u2019t on the table or sideboard.</p><p>\u201cDid...did you see my brother last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the basket of buns in the middle of the table. Really, she wasn\u2019t hungry at all. \u201cI suppose they\u2019re all talking about it in the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat but said nothing more, which she took as a resounding affirmative.</p><p>She sighed forlornly. \u201cIt was rather spectacular, how he staggered in and collapsed in the hall. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen so much blood in my life. I\u2019m sure his shirt is quite ruined.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, there was a rustle, and then his arm appeared, clothed in a green coat. He reached for the basket of buns. \u201cWould you like a bun? Cook made \u2019em fresh just this morn.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he picked one out for her and put it on her plate. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYer welcome, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I have no one to talk about it with,\u201d she said in a rush, staring down at the lone bun on her plate. \u201cFor my brother to brawl with Lord Vale like this...It\u2019s very confusing.\u201d</p><p>Gil walked over to the sideboard and brought back a dish of coddled eggs. \u201cYou made some fine friends at that house party you went to, didn\u2019t you, miss?\u201d</p><p>She twisted to look at him as he spooned eggs onto her plate. He didn\u2019t meet her eyes. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. There was a wash of red high on his cheeks. \u201cTalk in the kitchen. Have some o\u2019 that.\u201d He handed her a fork.</p><p>\u201cI expect they were referring to the Hopedale sisters.\u201d She absently ate a bite of eggs. \u201cThey probably won\u2019t ever want to see me again after last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Rebecca poked at the mound of yellow eggs and then took another bite. \u201cI doubt anyone in society will be receiving us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be right lucky to have you at one of them fancy parties,\u201d Gil said from behind her.</p><p>She twisted to look at him.</p><p>His brow was furrowed, but he smoothed it as she watched. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me sayin\u2019 so, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s rather sweet of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, miss.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the table and took a sip of tea. It was cooler now. \u201cIt\u2019s just that even if they would see me, I don\u2019t know if I could talk to the Misses Hopedale about this. When we converse, it\u2019s usually about the weather and types of hats, which I don\u2019t know that much about but seems to be a subject they enjoy. And once in a while we discuss which is better, lemon custard or chocolate pudding? It\u2019s rather a leap to go from puddings to my brother attempting to murder a peer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d He left her side again to walk to the sideboard. \u201cThere\u2019s a lovely herring here and some gammon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe that\u2019s what London ladies always talk about.\u201d She took her fork and prodded the bun on her plate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019m from the Colonies, and there\u2019s lots that we do different there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there, miss?\u201d Gil hesitated, then picked up the plate with the herring on it and came over to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy, in the Colonies, a man\u2019s birth isn\u2019t nearly so important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He placed a portion of the herring on her plate.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She ate a bite of fish. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that people don\u2019t judge other people. I think that happens everywhere. But it\u2019s more a matter of what the man has accomplished in his life and if he has money. And you know, anyone can earn money if he works hard enough. I say, this herring is very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Cook you said so,\u201d Gil said from behind her. \u201cBut any man, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She was rather enjoying the herring. Maybe all she\u2019d needed was a proper breakfast.</p><p>\u201cCan any man become successful in America?\u201d</p><p>She paused and glanced over her shoulder. Gil\u2019s expression was tense, as if her answer mattered greatly to him. \u201cYes, I think so. After all, my brother grew up in a one-room cabin. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. And now he\u2019s very respected in Boston. The ladies all want him at their parties, and many gentlemen consult him on business. Of course\u201d\u2014she turned back around to fork up a bite of fish\u2014\u201che started out with Uncle Thomas\u2019s importing business, but it was a very small company when Samuel inherited it. Now it\u2019s quite the biggest in Boston, I believe, all due to Samuel\u2019s hard work and quick wits. And I know many other gentlemen in Boston who had humble beginnings and have become very successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really used to people like the aristocrats here. People who are so bound by the past and expectations. For instance, I don\u2019t understand why Lady Emeline has decided to marry Lord Vale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re lords and ladies, miss. Stands to reason that they\u2019d marry one of their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what if they fall in love with someone who isn\u2019t a lord or lady?\u201d Rebecca scowled at her herring. \u201cI mean, love isn\u2019t something one can control, is it? That\u2019s the wonder of it. That a person might fall in love with someone completely unexpected. Romeo and Juliet, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid I haven\u2019t heard of them people.\u201d</p><p>She twisted about to peer up at him. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a pity; it\u2019s a very good play up until the ending. You see, Romeo falls in love with Juliet, who is the daughter of his enemy, or rather, his family\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound very sharp of him,\u201d Gil commented practically.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the point, isn\u2019t it? He didn\u2019t have any choice in who he fell in love with, whether or not it was sharp of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d said the footman. He didn\u2019t look particularly convinced about the overpowering nature of love. \u201cSo, then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s several duels and a secret marriage and then they die.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cThey die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you the end wasn\u2019t particularly good,\u201d Rebecca said defensively. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s all very romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink living might be better than bein\u2019 dead and romantic,\u201d Gil said.</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps you\u2019re right. Love doesn\u2019t seem to have made my brother very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why he attacked Lord Vale, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. He loves Lady Emeline.\u201d She glanced at him guiltily. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t, miss.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, and he smiled back, his lovely green eyes crinkling at the corners, and she thought about how comfortable he made her feel. With so many people, she spent all her time watching every word she said and constantly worrying over what they thought of her. But with Gil she could just talk.</p><p>She turned back to the table to finish her meal, secure in the knowledge that Gil was standing behind her.</p><p>EMELINE WAS IN the small sitting room of her town house, drinking tea, listening to Tante Cristelle, and wishing she could be just about anywhere else.</p> <p>\u201cYou are lucky,\u201d her aunt proclaimed. \u201cVery lucky. I do not know how that man could hide his murderous habit so well.\u201d</p><p>That man was Samuel. Tante Cristelle had decided by a logic understood only by herself that the terrible fight on the stairs the night before was the result of Samuel\u2019s true violent nature breaking free from his control.</p><p>\u201cMadmen are very cunning, I believe. And he did have very odd shoes,\u201d Tante Cristelle said, and took a thoughtful sip of tea.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think his shoes had anything to do with it, Tante,\u201d Emeline muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut, yes, they must!\u201d Her aunt stared in outrage. \u201cA person\u2019s shoes tell so much about them. The drunkard wears the shoes so dirty and worn. The lady of ill-repute has shoes too ornamented. And the so-murderous man, he wears the oddity\u2014the moccasins of an Indian savage.\u201d</p> <p>Emeline tucked her feet beneath her skirts. The slippers she wore today were rather unfortunately embroidered in gold.</p><p>Hastily she sought to change the subject. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we will survive the gossip. Half of society was crowded into the upper hall last night, the better to see Mr. Hartley throw Jasper down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that is very odd.\u201d</p><p>Emeline raised her eyebrows. \u201cThat everyone was staring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d The older woman waved an impatient hand. \u201cThat Lord Vale allowed himself to be tossed so cavalierly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Hartley is not so big as milord Vale, and yet he was able to overpower him. It makes one wonder how he came by this strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it was the strength of a madman,\u201d Emeline muttered with dark humor. She didn\u2019t want to think about the fight, the sight of two men she loved trying to kill each other, the look in Samuel\u2019s eyes at the last...But it was hard to distract Tante Cristelle off the subject. \u201cThe wedding will be ruined, I know. We will be lucky to have more than two guests attend.\u201d</p><p>Tante Cristelle immediately took the contrary opinion. \u201cIt is not so very bad, this gossip and excitement. One would think that gossip is always bad, but this is not so. The talk will cause many to come to your wedding. I think you will have quite the turnout.\u201d</p><p>Emeline shuddered and looked down at the teacup in her lap. The thought of all those people coming to her wedding just to gawk, hoping perhaps that Samuel would make another appearance and disrupt the wedding, was terribly distasteful. And worse, she knew Samuel had washed his hands of her. The look of disillusionment, of disgust, in his eyes last night had felt like a physical blow. He would never want to see her again, she knew. Which was just as well, of course. Far better to make a clean break.</p><p>If only she could pick up her spirits a bit so that she could face her future. This path had been laid out for her before she was ever born. She was an aristocrat, the daughter and sister to earls, a woman of family and standing. All that was expected of her was that she make a good match, have children, and conform to society\u2019s rules. It was not such a hard task, and until now she had never questioned it. She\u2019d been a good wife and mother. Hadn\u2019t she held the remains of her family together against all odds? Hadn\u2019t she found a second husband as worthy as the first? And if there would be no fidelity in the marriage, if the love was a fraternal, rather than passionate one, that was only to be expected. Only a fool would balk at her path at this late date.</p><p>Only a fool.</p><p>Emeline bit her lip and gazed into her cooling tea as Tante Cristelle droned on across from her. Despite all the lectures she gave herself, she couldn\u2019t stop mourning for a man not of her world. Samuel had looked at her and really seen her. He was the first and probably the last in her life to ever do so. And what was more miraculous, he\u2019d not recoiled. He\u2019d seen her awful temper, her unwomanly strength of mind, and he\u2019d said they were good. No wonder she still mourned him. Such complete acceptance was intoxicating.</p><p>Still, she was a fool.</p> <p>PEOPLE LOOKED AT Sam as he made his way through the London streets that afternoon. They would peer at him out of the corner of their eyes, then look quickly away again, especially if they met his gaze. He\u2019d seen himself in the mirror this morning and knew what they gawked at: a blackening eye, a cut and swollen lip, and the bruises turning purple on his cheek and jaw. He knew why they looked, but he hated it nevertheless. He\u2019d never been anonymous in a crowd\u2014he wore moccasins, after all\u2014but today they looked at him as if he were a lunatic.</p><p>That was the first difficulty. The second was that he wished Vale was making this trip with him. Stupid, he knew, but there it was. He\u2019d become used to Vale\u2019s banter and his sardonic view of the world, and even though he loathed the man, he missed him as well. Too, it would\u2019ve been useful to have another at his back in this.</p><p>Sam glanced over his shoulder for followers and ducked into a narrow passageway. He had to pause a moment and lean against a filthy wall, holding his side. Something stabbed there. One or more of his ribs were probably cracked. Rebecca would have a fit if she knew that he was out of bed. His little sister had been surprisingly stubborn last night in her insistence that he see a doctor. In the end, he\u2019d given in to her pleas. What did it matter when the world had fallen in on him?</p><p>He peered around the corner of the wall he leaned against and started out again, ignoring the continual pain from his ribs. There was only one thing he had to resolve, and then they could quit this damn island and go home.</p><p>This part of London was quiet and mostly clean, the odors assaulting his nostrils kept to a dull roar that hardly disturbed. Sam turned down Starling Lane. The buildings that lined the street were made of newer brick, probably built after the great fire. Small shops were at the street level, tiny, dark windows displaying wares. Above the shops were apartments, presumably for the shopkeepers.</p><p>Sam pushed open the door of a small tailor. The shop was dim inside with a low ceiling and a dusty scent. He didn\u2019t see anyone else in there. Sam turned and locked the front door behind him.</p><p>\u201cA moment\u2019s wait, if it please you, sir!\u201d a male voice called from somewhere in back.</p><p>The shop was actually quite shallow\u2014presumably the bulk was taken up by the back where the work would be done. Bolts of cloth were stacked on shelves with a single waistcoat displayed on a tree. The waistcoat was well stitched and sturdy enough, but the material wasn\u2019t of the finest. This led Sam to think that this tailor probably catered to merchants, doctors, and lawyers, instead of more wealthy gentlemen. There was a tall counter and beyond that an open doorway. Sam slipped behind the counter and peered into the doorway. As he\u2019d suspected, the room behind the shop was much larger. A long table took up much of the space, with odd pieces of cloth, marking pencils, spools of thread, and paper patterns scattered along its length. Two young men sat cross-legged on the table, sewing, while an older, balding man bent over a swath of fabric, swiftly snipping with a pair of shears.</p><p>The older man glanced up but didn\u2019t stop cutting. \u201cOnly a moment, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can talk as you work,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>The man looked puzzled. \u201cSir?\u201d His hand flew over the fabric as if it had a life of its own.</p><p>\u201cI have some questions for you. About a former neighbor of yours.\u201d</p><p>The tailor hesitated for a second, eyeing him.</p><p>The bruises weren\u2019t helping his case, Sam knew. \u201cThere used to be a cobbler\u2019s shop next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The tailor pivoted the fabric and went back to cutting.</p><p>\u201cDid you know the owner, Dick Thornton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight.\u201d The tailor bent over his task as if to hide his eyes from Sam.</p><p>\u201cThornton\u2019s father had the place before him, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. That was old George Thornton.\u201d The tailor threw down his shears, whipped the fabric off the table, and smoothed a new piece of cloth in its place. \u201cA fine man. He\u2019d only opened the shop a year or so before he passed. Even so, he was much missed on this street.\u201d</p><p>Sam stilled. \u201cThe elder Thornton had just opened the shop? He wasn\u2019t here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, he weren\u2019t. Moved from someplace else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDogleg Lane.\u201d One of the men sewing piped in suddenly.</p><p>The master tailor gave him a gimlet eye under his brows, and the man ducked his head back to his work.</p><p>Sam hitched his hip onto the table and folded his arms. \u201cWas Dick home from the war in the Colonies when his father died?\u201d</p><p>The tailor shook his head once. \u201cNo, sir. It were another year or so before Dick came home. His wife, what was George\u2019s daughter-in-law, ran the shop until Dick returned. She was a good lass but not the canniest of women, if you follow my meaning, sir. Wasn\u2019t doing too well by the time Dick made it home, but he soon turned it around. Dick were here only a couple of years before he got a bigger shop somewheres else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know Dick before he came home from the war? Had you met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d The tailor frowned as he deftly snipped a perfect oval in the cloth. \u201c\u2019Twasn\u2019t a loss, not knowing Dick Thornton, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like the man,\u201d Sam murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot many here did,\u201d the sitting tailor muttered.</p><p>The master tailor shrugged. \u201cHe puts on a nice face, always smiling, but I didn\u2019t trust him. And his wife was afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she?\u201d Sam looked at his moccasins as he spoke. If what he suspected were true, Mrs. Thornton should\u2019ve shown much more than fear. \u201cDid she act odd in any other way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it wasn\u2019t as if we saw her long after Dick returned.\u201d</p><p>Sam glanced up sharply. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDied, didn\u2019t she?\u201d The tailor met his eyes, his own shrewd, before he looked back at his work again. \u201cFell down the stairs and broke her neck. That was what her husband said, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Both of the sitting tailors shook their heads to show what they thought about that.</p><p>A savage thrill of triumph went through Sam. This was it, he knew. Dick Thornton wasn\u2019t who he said he was. The prisoner MacDonald crouching under a wagon as the battle raged all around. MacDonald catching Sam\u2019s eye from his hiding place. MacDonald grinning and winking. That was what Sam had remembered the night before as he\u2019d pushed through the crowd at Emeline\u2019s party. The way MacDonald used to grin and wink\u2014the same way that Thornton grinned and winked now. Somehow MacDonald the prisoner had taken Thornton\u2019s place.</p><p>Taken his place and now lived his life.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Sam unlocked the door to the little tailor shop and let himself out. It was all but over now. He only had to confront Dick Thornton\u2014or the man who was calling himself Dick Thornton\u2014and then go home. A year of searching for answers would be over. The dead of Spinner\u2019s Falls would finally rest in peace.</p><p>Except, as he made his way back to his town house, he knew he would never be at peace again. His body might return to Boston, but his heart would forever remain behind in England.</p><p>He was in the mews behind the town house now. He hesitated, then walked past his own gate to the gate that led into Emeline\u2019s garden. It was locked, of course, but he scaled the wall, moving a bit slower than he\u2019d have liked because of his ribs. The garden beyond was deserted. Michaelmas daisies bloomed on either side of the path, and the ornamental trees were just beginning to turn color. He could see the back of the house and the windows that lined the upper floors. One of those windows belonged to Emeline. She might at this very moment be looking out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam was conscious of how foolish his actions were\u2014to sneak into the garden of the woman who\u2019d rejected him. He was embarrassed and angry because he was embarrassed. Soon he would need to return home and ready himself for supper with Rebecca, but he lingered a little longer, gazing at her house, his heart aching as it pounded a silent beat: if only...if only...if only...</p><p>He closed his eyes, coming to a decision. He couldn\u2019t leave it like this. He had to speak to her. But now was not the time. For what he wanted, he\u2019d have to wait for nightfall. So he glanced again at that window and then turned and left the garden. He would bide his time. He would wait patiently.</p><p>For the fall of night.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p> <p>Just past midnight, Iron Heart was dragged from his dungeon cell. Guards marched him up the stairs of the castle, out into the street, and into the square in the middle of the shining city. Crowds lined the streets, clutching torches to light the way, their faces eerily lit by the flames. The people of the Shining City were silent, but one among them was not. For the wizard danced the entire way to the square, crowing his delight at Iron Heart\u2019s death sentence and only a little hampered by a limp. And on the wicked wizard\u2019s wrist, bobbing as he capered, was a white dove, tethered there with a golden chain....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>It was late and she was tired, but she still felt him before she saw him. Emeline\u2019s heart gave a wild, joyous leap, entirely outside of her control. He was here. Samuel was here. She turned from her vanity table where she\u2019d been brushing her hair in preparation for bed.</p><p>He stood by the door that connected her room to a small dressing room. His face was battered, his left eye swollen and black, and he held one hand against his side as if something pained him there. She stared at him, not daring to believe, trying not to breathe in case he evaporated from her sight.</p><p>\u201cYour hair is beautiful,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>It was the last thing she expected him to say. It made her self-conscious and oddly shy. He\u2019d never seen her with her hair down. Never seen her in such a normal, homey setting.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She set her brush down on the vanity table and nearly knocked it to the floor, her hands were shaking so badly.</p><p>He glanced at the brush. \u201cI\u2019ve come to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving so soon?\u201d</p><p>For some reason, she hadn\u2019t expected this, either. She\u2019d thought she would be the one to leave first, after her marriage to Jasper. But that was silly, of course. Samuel had to return to the Colonies some time. She\u2019d always known that.</p><p>He nodded slowly at her question. \u201cAs soon as I finish my business, Rebecca and I will sail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d There were thousands of things she wanted to ask him, thousands of things to say to him, but somehow she couldn\u2019t give voice to her real thoughts. She was stuck in this awkwardly formal conversation instead. She cleared her throat. \u201cIs it shipping business? Or the business of finding who betrayed your regiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d He ambled into her room, pausing to pick up a china dish from a side table and turning it over to look at the bottom.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cBut surely it will take weeks, maybe months to find out who\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he was already shaking his head. \u201cThornton\u2019s the traitor.\u201d He replaced the dish.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, not looking particularly interested in the subject. \u201cHe isn\u2019t really Thornton. I think he\u2019s probably another soldier, MacDonald, who was under arrest when we were attacked. MacDonald somehow took Thornton\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, plucking at her wrap anxiously. She wore only a shift and the silk wrap; her feet were bare. She felt vulnerable with him prowling about her private rooms. Vulnerable, but not afraid. There was something inevitable about this scene, as if she knew all along that Samuel would someday enter her rooms. She only wished she could hold him a little longer. She looked down at her trembling hands in her lap and asked another question, delaying what would come.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t Thornton\u2019s friends or family have turned MacDonald in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost of Thornton\u2019s friends were killed at Spinner\u2019s Falls. Maybe all of them. As to family\u201d\u2014Samuel fingered the heavy brocade curtains hanging on her bed\u2014\u201cthey were dead, too, all except his wife, and she died soon after Thornton, or MacDonald, returned home. I imagine he killed her.\u201d</p><p>Emeline caught her breath at the casual comment. \u201cWhy are you doing this, Samuel?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her tone. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you bent on following this trail?\u201d She leaned forward, wanting to cut through his defenses as he had cut through hers. They had so little time left. \u201cWhy spend all this effort and money pursuing the man? Why, after all these years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can and the others can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He dropped the curtain and turned fully to her. There was no artifice, no shield in place to keep her from seeing the desolation in his face. \u201cThey\u2019re dead. They\u2019re all dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cEven the ones who survived are dead, don\u2019t you see? Vale may joke and drink and play a fool, but you\u2019ll be wedding yourself to a corpse, never doubt that.\u201d</p><p>She stood to meet his awful despair head-on. \u201cI do doubt that. Jasper may have his demons, but he\u2019s alive. You saved him, Samuel.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ran to bring help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran away,\u201d he rasped, and she shut her mouth, for she\u2019d never heard him say it aloud. \u201cAt the height of the battle, when I knew we were going to lose, when I knew the Indians would overrun us and take scalps from still-living men, I figured there was no longer any point in fighting, so I hid. And when they took Vale, Munroe, your brother, and the other men captive, I ran.\u201d</p><p>She ventured close to him and grasped his coat in both fists, feeling the wool on her fingertips. She stood on tiptoe and brought her face as near to his as she could. \u201cYou hid because you knew that it was pointless to die. You ran to save the lives of the men captured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDid I? That\u2019s what I told myself at the time, that I was running for the others, but perhaps I lied. Perhaps I ran merely for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head desperately. \u201cI know you, Samuel. I know you. You ran to save them, pure and simple, and I admire you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d His eyes seemed to focus on her face finally. \u201cYet your brother died before I could return with the ransom. I failed him. I failed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she choked. \u201cNever think that.\u201d And she pulled his head down to her own.</p><p>She kissed him, trying to instill all her conflicting thoughts and hopes into that simple gesture. Mouth to mouth, lips moving together. A kiss was such a basic thing, a thing easily given, but she wanted this kiss to be more. She wanted Samuel to know that she\u2019d never thought him a coward.</p><p>She wanted him to know that she loved him.</p><p>Yes, love. No matter who she married, no matter if she never again saw him, she would always love this man. Loving him was beyond her control. Even though Samuel was the wrong man to marry, the wrong man to spend the rest of her life with, she couldn\u2019t help loving him.</p><p>So she kissed him softly, her lips as gentle as she could make them. She moved over his mouth, murmuring incoherent endearments, finally licking so that she could taste him. She would need to remember this moment later, his taste, his lips, what kissing Samuel felt like. She would have to hold the memory in her heart forever. This memory would be the only thing she had of him.</p><p>He moved suddenly, grasping her upper arms, and she didn\u2019t know whether he sought to push her away or draw her closer. She panicked then. He couldn\u2019t leave her before she\u2019d shown him that she loved him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she murmured against his lips.</p><p>His fingers tightened on her arms.</p><p>She pulled back and looked into his eyes. \u201cPlease. Let me.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together over his beautiful coffee-brown eyes as if he were puzzled. She pressed her palms against his chest. She\u2019d never be able to move him against his will, but he let her. He stepped back, and when she pressed again, he backed again, until his legs hit the side of her bed.</p><p>He glanced at the bed behind him and then at her. \u201cEmeline\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d She placed her fingers against his lips. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He searched her eyes a moment and then must have understood her incoherent plea. He nodded.</p><p>She smiled tremblingly at him. For this night, she would put away all thoughts of the future and what would come. Her anxieties, her fears, all the burdens she carried, all the people who depended on her. She would forget them for a few precious hours. Gently she drew his coat from his shoulders, taking care not to jostle his injuries. She folded the garment carefully and placed it on a table; then she began unbuttoning his plain brown waistcoat. She was conscious of her breathing, shallow and quick with nervousness, and his as well, deep and even. He watched her undress him, making no move to either help or hinder, his hands idle by his side.</p><p>She glanced up and met his eyes and felt a wash of heat in her cheeks. What an intimate act this was, to undress a man.</p><p>He smiled faintly as he shrugged off his waistcoat. She took a deep breath and started on his shirt. His hands came up to rest on her hips, lightly, but she felt the heat of his fingers even through the layers of cloth. Her hands shook, fumbling with a button. He leaned over her and kissed the top of her head. His body surrounded her, and she inhaled his scent: wool and linen, leather and parsley. She pulled apart the edges of his shirt, looking at his bare chest. His skin was so beautiful; she ran her fingertips over his collarbone and pressed her palm onto his chest. She could feel the wiry hair beneath, and under that the slow beat of his heart. He was here with her, so real. How would she be able to bear it when he wasn\u2019t? When he was across a wide, wide ocean?</p><p>She pushed that thought away as she urged him onto the bed. He sat and watched her under hooded eyes, waiting for her next move.</p><p>She dropped to her knees and began to unlace his moccasins. He made to lift her up.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His hands dropped.</p><p>The laces were made of some type of leather, and she bent over them, concentrating on discovering how they worked. She was aware, though, of his legs before her and her supplicant position. The pose was humble and at the same time erotic.</p><p>The first moccasin came off, and she started on the next. He stroked her hair as she worked, silent, never commenting, and she wondered what he thought of this. Yesterday he\u2019d been so angry. She looked up and saw only need in his eyes.</p><p>He bent and kissed her, thrusting his tongue into her mouth, holding her head now with both hands, and she was lost, forgetting her purpose, forgetting what she wanted. She swayed and placed her hands on his thighs to steady herself as he arched her head back, feeding on her mouth. Oh, Lord, she wanted this man. He brought her forward, and she was enclosed, still kneeling between his thighs, hard and strong, on either side of her. And in front...She smoothed her palms up the leather covering his thighs until they inevitably met where the leather stopped and there was only fabric at the juncture of his legs. She gasped, her inhale lost in his kiss, for he was hard and straining already against his breeches. She cradled his length, tracing him through the cloth.</p><p>He caught her hands.</p><p>She broke the kiss and glanced up at him. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>His face was dark, flushed from passion, and he looked in no mood to concede her anything.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He opened his hands, spreading them palms up on his thighs in a gesture of acquiescence. She squeezed him gently through the fabric and then let go to work on opening the flap of his breeches. She peeled back the cloth and fumbled with his smallclothes until she found him, ruddy and proud underneath. The hair surrounding his cock was almost black, a shockingly private sight. This should only be for her, she knew on a primitive level. This man, this sight, this penis was hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared for a moment and then looked up at him. \u201cTake them off.\u201d</p><p>Her tone was probably too commanding, for he half smiled at her, but she didn\u2019t care at the moment. She wanted him entirely nude; she wanted to imprint the sight of him on her mind. He shucked his leggings and the rest of his clothes, and she stood to push him back onto the bed, slipping out of her wrap before climbing in next to him, wearing only her chemise. He lay on his back and immediately felt for her, but she slid down his length, out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cEmeline\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d</p> <p>She was at the level of his manhood, and the creature fascinated her. One fingertip traced his length, bumping over his veins. She knew that there were women who found a man\u2019s genitals ugly and rude, but she had never been one of them. Had Danny lived longer, had she been a more experienced wife, eventually she would\u2019ve explored him, but they\u2019d never had that time. Now she was determined not to lose this opportunity with Samuel.</p><p>She studied him, beguiled by the way his foreskin pulled back to accommodate his erection, enthralled by the slight curve upward. She flicked her eyes to him and saw that he was watching her intently as she examined him, and a thought occurred to her that, at any other time, she never would\u2019ve voiced. They didn\u2019t have years to overcome shyness and the strictures of polite society. They had only tonight and she would not waste this little time.</p><p>So she asked, \u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re alone?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows, and for a moment she was disappointed. He would pretend not to understand her vulgar question. But, still holding her gaze, he moved his right hand down and wrapped it about his length. Her eyes dropped from his then so that she could watch. He held his penis much more firmly than she would\u2019ve dared and moved his hand up and down. On the up stroke, the head of his cock nearly disappeared into his fist.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that hurt?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>She heard him chuckle raspily but couldn\u2019t take her eyes from the sight of what he did to look at his face. \u201cFar from it.\u201d</p><p>And then she did something truly beyond the pale. She leaned forward and licked around the head of his penis.</p><p>He paused in his movement, and she heard his inhale before he breathed, \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p>She braced herself on her hands and hovered over him, licking and kissing the head of his cock while he continued to move his fist up and down. It wasn\u2019t a sophisticated act; her tongue sometimes hit his hand as well as his penis, her breasts swung free inelegantly under her shift, but she didn\u2019t care. She loved the taste of him, salt and spice; she adored the faint gasping sounds he made, and she was aware that she was becoming increasingly wet just from ministering to him. Why such an act should be so erotic, she had no idea, but there it was. His hand moved faster, and she attempted to engulf the entire tip of his cock in her mouth. His hips arched involuntarily off the bed.</p><p>\u201cEmeline,\u201d he gasped, and the extremity in his voice sent a thrill of sexual triumph through her. \u201cEmeline...\u201d</p><p>She looked up just as she sucked strongly on him, flattening her tongue against the underside of his penis. His eyes narrowed, his head arced back, his teeth gritted, and she tasted sweet salt in her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cEmeline.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, feeling tears behind her lids and sucked again, and again tasted a gush of salt. Finally, his hips fell, pulling his manhood from her mouth. She wiped her lips on the bed linens. Stupid, stupid tears were running from her eyes, and one splashed on his leg. Helping him do this made her want to sob, and she wasn\u2019t even sure why.</p><p>She felt more than saw him lift his head. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d she said again, choking this time.</p><p>There was no way to explain her emotions. How could she tell him that she already mourned his loss? That she wished she were a different, more adaptable person? She couldn\u2019t, so she didn\u2019t. She crawled up his body instead, until she settled herself, straddling his groin.</p><p>His hands grasped her hips, comforting and steadying her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she whispered, although the tears she could not control gave lie to her reply.</p><p>She closed her eyes so she couldn\u2019t see the worry and love in his gaze and lifted her shift over her head. She was nude now, just as he was. She didn\u2019t wear so much as a hairpin. They were as God had made them, man and woman, without the clothes and trappings that designated rank, relative wealth, and means. They could\u2019ve been Adam and his wife, Eve\u2014the first humans, unaware of the many gradations that would come to divide their children.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and leaned forward to place her palm on the center of his chest. \u201cYou are mine right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you are mine,\u201d he replied.</p><p>It was almost like a vow.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t demand more. A little part of her died then, even as she reveled in the moment. Samuel had given up on having her in his future, she knew. It\u2019d always been inevitable that they couldn\u2019t be together, but for him to have accepted that fact...</p><p>She pushed away the thought and bowed over him, smiling as she kissed the spot where her hand had lain. It was wet because her tears had dropped there as well. She kissed across his chest, small wet kisses, until she reached a nipple. Here, she opened her mouth and licked around the tiny point, tasting man, tasting Samuel.</p><p>He sighed beneath her and reached up to stroke her hair. She could feel his manhood, still half-erect, under her stomach. She shifted a little, rolling against him, and moved to the other nipple, licking at it with a pointed tongue. Tears were pricking at her eyes again, but she no longer paid attention to them. They were a physical manifestation of her internal turmoil\u2014something completely beyond her control. Tears fell to his chest, and their salt mingled with the salt of his skin, so she couldn\u2019t tell them apart as she licked.</p><p>She straightened and looked down. His cock was thick, not entirely erect, and lying on his stomach. She wanted to feel that part of him against herself, wanted this last connection. She slid forward until the tip of him lay under the tip of her. She was wet, open and sensitized, and the feeling was so right, so perfect, that she groaned softly. Just a little pressure, just a little shift of her hips. Warmth blossomed at her core. She bit her lip and ground down some more.</p><p>Her eyes were closed, so she started a little when large hands palmed her breasts, both at once. She gasped and slid against him. He brought his thumbs together with his fingers and squeezed her nipples. Oh, Lord! He was growing under her, burrowing into her folds. She leaned into his hands, pressing down harder, caught up in the sensation, trying to ignore the tears that still coursed down her cheeks. His cock slid to the side. She whimpered in frustration and grasped him, holding him against her body as she rubbed her clitoris over his cock. So close, so close...</p><p>\u201cPut me in you,\u201d she heard him say.</p><p>She shook her head, wanting to feel him here always. To stay in this moment for eternity as if in a dream. To never wake up. She moved faster over him, frantically, twisting her hips, sobbing, her cheeks wet.</p><p>Almost there, almost there...</p><p>He squeezed her nipples and still it wasn\u2019t quite right. She couldn\u2019t complete. She was gasping now, weeping openly, and suddenly she knew that she needed him inside her to reach that point. Quickly, she lifted her hips and placed him at her entrance and bore down. And then...</p><p>He was inside her, full and heavy, the feeling exquisite as he stretched her. She paused, savoring the sensation, wanting it to last forever, him filling her. She leaned over him, and in that moment felt his mouth close over one breast, pulling strongly. Her muscles contracted around him, and she came in long, lovely, warm waves. She sobbed aloud in gratitude, in wonderful release. She rubbed herself over and over against his hard body, her head hanging down in surrender, her hair draping over his chest.</p><p>He muttered something and released her nipple, catching her hips. He pumped into her in quick, powerful thrusts, grunting with each plunge, his cock hard and hot and long within her. His movements, his obvious desperation, prolonged her pleasure, and when she felt his warmth flood her, she was still in bliss. She fell against his heaving chest, his hand tangling in her hair, his breath rasping against her damp temple. She heard his whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>THE FIRE IN Emeline\u2019s hearth had died down long ago, probably some time in the middle of the night when he\u2019d still held her. Sam considered relighting it; her bedroom was chilly in the not-quite-dawn darkness. But she lay under piles of thick blankets in the bed, and he wouldn\u2019t be staying long. Besides, he wasn\u2019t sure a fire could warm him anymore.</p><p>He sat in a chair by the dead fire, fully dressed. There really wasn\u2019t anything keeping him from leaving. The servants would be up soon, and he knew that she would be embarrassed and cross if he was discovered in her room. Yet, he still lingered.</p><p>He could watch her from the chair. Try to memorize the way two fingers clutched the blanket under her chin. She lay on her side facing him, her mouth relaxed in sleep, her lips half parted. With her sharp eyes closed, she looked much younger, almost sweet.</p><p>He nearly smiled at the thought. She wouldn\u2019t thank him for the observation. They\u2019d never had time to discuss it, but he thought she might be a little sensitive at her years. He\u2019d like to argue the point, make her confess that a lady of thirty was as beautiful\u2014more beautiful, in his opinion\u2014than a lady of twenty. Then when she continued to argue\u2014for she would, she was so stubborn\u2014he would kiss her into submission and maybe another round of lovemaking. But they were past that now. They would have no more arguments, no more kisses or lovemaking. No time to settle any little problems.</p><p>Their time was over.</p><p>She sighed and snuggled the blanket over her mouth. He watched the small movement greedily, drinking it in, committing it to memory. Soon. Soon now he would get up and walk to the door, leaving this room and making his way through the silent house. Let himself out into the dawn. Go back to the town house that wasn\u2019t truly his. In two days, he would board a ship and spend over a month watching the waves as he sailed back home. And once there? Why, he\u2019d continue his life as if he\u2019d never met a woman named Emeline.</p><p>Except, while his life might look the same from the outside, it would be entirely different on the inside. He wouldn\u2019t forget her, his warm lady, even if he lived for six decades more. He knew that now, sitting by her cold fire. She would be with him all the days of his life. As he walked the streets of Boston, as he conducted his business or chatted with acquaintances, she would be the ghost beside him. She would sit with him as he ate, she would lie beside him as he slept. And he knew that when his time on this earth was at an end, his last thought as he entered the void would be of her.</p><p>The scent of lemon balm would haunt him forever.</p><p>So he sat a little longer, watching her sleep. All the days of the rest of his life stretched before him, and he needed to store up these few seconds with her.</p><p>They would have to last him a lifetime.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The guards tied Iron Heart to a great stake and then piled thorny branches about his feet and legs. He looked around and saw his sweet wife standing by her father the king, weeping. Iron Heart closed his own eyes at the sight, and then the thorns were set alight. They quickly caught fire, and the flames leapt into the dark sky. Sparks fled upward as if seeking to join the stars, and the wicked wizard screamed with glee. But an odd thing happened. Although Iron Heart\u2019s clothes burned, and indeed were soon reduced to ashes, his body did not. Instead, as he writhed in the flames, his iron heart could be seen beating on his strong, bare chest. An iron heart white-hot from the heat...</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>Samuel was gone when she woke the next morning. A maid was clattering by the hearth, trying to light the fire. It must\u2019ve been banked badly and gone out during the night.</p><p>Emeline closed her eyes for a moment, not wanting to face the day. Perhaps not wanting to face her life without him. And as she did so, she felt liquid seep from inside herself. She thought it was his seed, but when she looked, it proved to be a more familiar stain. Her monthly visitor had come. And this was the truly horrible part: Instead of feeling relief that nothing now stood between her and her marriage to Jasper, she was flooded with wild disappointment. How foolish! How utterly stupid, to want to be filled with Samuel\u2019s child. To have no choice but to marry him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emeline caught her breath then. Her mind\u2014her sanity\u2014might know that a marriage to Samuel would be disastrous, but her heart was unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something, my lady?\u201d The maid was staring at Emeline, her hand raised over the still-cold fire.</p><p>She must\u2019ve made a sound, done something to reveal her distress, for a servant girl to have noticed. Emeline sat up. \u201cNo, nothing. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded and turned back to the hearth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m taking so long today, ma\u2019am. I can\u2019t think why the fire should be so hard to light.\u201d</p> <p>Emeline looked over the side of the bed and found her wrap. She struggled into it while the maid\u2019s back was still turned. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the chill in the air. Here, let me try.\u201d</p><p>But however many times Emeline stuck a flaming straw into the coals, they refused to light.</p><p>\u201cWell, never mind,\u201d she finally exclaimed crossly. \u201cHave a hot bath brought into my sitting room. The fire\u2019s lit there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady,\u201d the maid said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just dress in my sitting room.\u201d</p> <p>An hour later, Emeline\u2019s bath had grown cold. Dismally, she stirred the water near her knee. Like it or not, it was past time for her to get out of the bath and face the rest of her life and the choices she\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cTowel,\u201d she said, and stood as a maid held out an enormous drying cloth.</p><p>Probably they didn\u2019t make drying cloths so large in the Colonies. It was lucky she had rejected Samuel and wouldn\u2019t have to put up with inferior bath accessories. Emeline stood morosely as her maids dressed her, not even interested when the new wine-red silk was presented. She\u2019d ordered the gown several weeks ago when she\u2019d helped prepare Rebecca\u2019s wardrobe. Now she might have been wearing burlap and ashes.</p><p>She finally grew restive as Harris fiddled with her coiffure. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t be receiving visitors today, anyway. I think I\u2019ll just go walk in the garden.\u201d</p><p>Harris glanced doubtfully at the window. \u201cLooks like rain, my lady, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, does it?\u201d Emeline asked in despair.</p> <p>This seemed the final straw, that the elements should conspire against her as well. She went to the window to peer out. Her sitting room overlooked the street, and as she watched, Samuel descended the steps next door and strode to a waiting horse. She caught her breath involuntarily. The unexpected sight of him sent a jab of pain into her middle, as if she\u2019d been stabbed. Her hand trembled against the cold glass pane. He ought to have looked up then. He ought to have seen her watching him from her window above him. But rather mundanely, he did not. He mounted the horse and rode away.</p><p>Emeline let her hand drop from the window.</p><p>Behind her, Harris was still talking as if nothing had happened. \u201cI\u2019ll just put the new dresses away, then, my lady, unless you need me for anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all.\u201d Emeline tore her gaze from the window. \u201cNo, wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFetch my cloak please. I wish to visit Miss Hartley next door.\u201d This might be the only time she\u2019d have to say good-bye to Rebecca. It didn\u2019t seem right to let her sail to the American colonies without bidding the girl farewell.</p><p>Emeline swung the cloak on and hurried down the stairs, fastening the neck. She didn\u2019t know how long Samuel would be gone, but it seemed imperative that she not meet him again. Outside, the sky was heavy and dark with impending rain. If Rebecca was in, she must remember not to stay too long or risk being trapped by a thunderstorm. Inhaling, she rapped on Samuel\u2019s door.</p><p>The butler\u2019s face was ever so faintly shocked when he opened the door. It was too early to be calling, but she was the daughter of an earl, after all. He bowed as she swept past him into the entry hall and then showed her to the small sitting room to wait while he fetched Rebecca. Emeline only had time to nervously glance out the windows before Rebecca came in.</p> <p>\u201cMy lady!\u201d The younger woman seemed startled at her visit.</p><p>Emeline held out her hands. \u201cI could not let you go without saying good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca burst into tears.</p><p>Oh, dear. She\u2019d never quite known what to do with the tears of others. Secretly, Emeline had often thought that ladies who wept in public were desirous of attention. She hardly ever wept, and never in front of others\u2014that is, she realized, until last night with Samuel.</p><p>Propelled by that uncomfortable thought, Emeline started forward. \u201cThere, there,\u201d she muttered as she patted Rebecca\u2019s shoulder awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady,\u201d Rebecca gasped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Emeline said gruffly, and handed her a handkerchief. What else could she say? She was almost certain that she herself was the cause of Rebecca\u2019s grief. \u201cShall I ring for tea?\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded, and Emeline led her to a chair while she gave orders to the maid.</p><p>\u201cI just wish things could be different,\u201d Rebecca said when the maid left again. She sat twisting the handkerchief in her hands.</p><p>\u201cAs do I.\u201d Emeline sat on a settee and arranged her skirts with far too much care. Perhaps if she didn\u2019t look at the girl, she could get through this. \u201cHave you set a date when you will leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Emeline looked up. \u201cThat soon?\u201d</p><p>The younger woman shrugged. \u201cSamuel found a berth on a ship just yesterday. He says we will sail tomorrow and leave the bulk of our belongings to be packed and sent on a later vessel.\u201d</p><p>Emeline winced. Samuel must want to be quit of England\u2014of her\u2014very badly.</p><p>\u201cIs it because you don\u2019t love him?\u201d Rebecca burst out.</p><p>The question was so sudden, so startling, that Emeline answered without thinking. \u201cNo.\u201d She caught her breath at the near-admission and shook her head. \u201cThere are so many things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Emeline stood and paced to the fireplace. \u201cThere\u2019s rank and position, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s more than that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Emeline couldn\u2019t bear to look at the younger woman, so she stared into the glowing fire instead. \u201cYou come from a different country, one so far away. I don\u2019t think that Samuel would want to make his home here in England.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca was silent, but her very stillness demanded explanation.</p><p>\u201cI have my family to think about.\u201d Emeline inhaled. \u201cThere\u2019s only Daniel and Tante Cristelle now, but they depend on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe that Daniel and your aunt would refuse to sail to America?\u201d</p><p>Put like that, her objection was an obvious fabrication. Yes, Tante Cristelle would grumble at a sea voyage, but the old lady need not even leave England if she did not wish to do so. And Daniel would probably be ecstatic at the mere thought of seeing America.</p><p>Emeline twisted her fingers into the gathers at her waist. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d She looked up and met Rebecca\u2019s eyes. \u201cThey all left me, you see. Reynaud and my husband and Father. I don\u2019t think I can do that again\u2014trust in another to keep me safe.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Samuel would never allow anyone to harm you.\u201d</p><p>Emeline laughed, although the sound was rusty. \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I grew up thinking. Even though the matter was never articulated aloud, it was understood that the gentlemen of my family would cherish me and keep me safe. That I would never have to fear for my situation. They would manage the affairs, and I would be a lovely companion and care for their home. But it didn\u2019t work out that way, did it? First Reynaud was lost to the war in the Colonies; then Danny died when we were both very young, and then Father\u201d\u2014she caught her breath because she had never said this last to anyone\u2014\u201cthen Father died and I was abandoned, don\u2019t you see? With Reynaud gone, the title, the estates, everything went to a cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey left you without money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Emeline\u2019s hand jerked, and she heard stitches tearing on her gown. \u201cObviously I have enough money. The Gordon income is quite sufficient. I only chaperone for pin money. But I no longer had anyone to lean on, don\u2019t you see? They all left me. Now I make the decisions in my life and the lives of Tante Cristelle and my son. I worry over the investments and whether Daniel should go to Eton soon. I must watch the land stewards to make sure they do not embezzle my monies. There is no one else I trust, no one else I depend upon save myself.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, knowing what she was trying to say was intangible. \u201cI can\u2019t relax, you see. I can\u2019t just...be.\u201d</p><p>How odd that she would confess this to Rebecca now when she\u2019d been entirely unable to talk to Samuel about this.</p><p>The younger woman knit her brows. \u201cI think I understand. You can never lay down your burdens. There\u2019s no one you trust to carry them for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, that\u2019s it,\u201d Emeline exclaimed in relief.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Rebecca gazed up at her, puzzled. \u201cYou plan to marry Lord Vale soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter. I love Jasper as a brother, but marriage to him won\u2019t change a whit the way I live and conduct my life. If he leaves me or dies as the others have, I will be just the same.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca stared at her silently. Outside the sitting room, voices murmured in the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid Samuel will die,\u201d Rebecca murmured. \u201cYou love him and you\u2019re too afraid to commit yourself to him.\u201d</p><p>Emeline blinked. Fear seemed such a childish, cowardly reason to reject Samuel. That couldn\u2019t be right. She tried to explain. \u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door to the sitting room opened. Emeline turned, frowning, at the interruption. A maid entered, bearing a tray of tea. Immediately behind her was Mr. Thornton.</p><p>Dear Lord, what was the man doing here?</p><p>The little man advanced into the room, his face wreathed in a smile. He had smiled each time she\u2019d seen him previously, but now the expression seemed twisted, not quite right. It was as if he sought to conceal the terrible thoughts in his brain by hiding behind a cheerful facade. Why had she never noticed it before? Was his self-control slipping, or had her new knowledge colored her perceptions of the man?</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my entering unannounced,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. \u201cI\u2019ve come to call upon Mr. Hartley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid my brother isn\u2019t here,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cIn fact, I believe that he\u2019s gone to see your shop, Mr. Thornton, on Starling Lane. No, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The girl shook her head in irritation. \u201cThat\u2019s where he went yesterday. Today he\u2019s looking for you on Dover Street.\u201d</p><p>Emeline glanced at the girl sharply. Her face was relaxed and open, the only mar a trace of irritation at being interrupted. Either she was a very good actress or Samuel hadn\u2019t confided his suspicions about Mr. Thornton to his sister.</p><p>But Mr. Thornton had stilled. \u201cStarling Lane, you say? How interesting. I wonder why Mr. Hartley went there yesterday? I haven\u2019t had a shop there since I returned from the war six years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Rebecca frowned. \u201cPerhaps Samuel thought you had two shops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be. In any case, I\u2019m sorry to have missed him.\u201d Mr. Thornton looked longingly at the tea being set up by the maid.</p><p>\u201cAs are we,\u201d Emeline said tightly. \u201cPerhaps if you hurry, you will find him at your establishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then again, we might pass each other as we travel,\u201d Mr. Thornton said smoothly. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t that be a shame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here and join us for tea while you wait for my brother\u2019s return,\u201d Rebecca said.</p><p>\u201cLovely, just lovely.\u201d Mr. Thornton bowed and sat. \u201cYou are graciousness itself, Miss Hartley.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Rebecca said as she poured. \u201cIt\u2019s only tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but many wouldn\u2019t be so gracious\u201d\u2014he shot a sly look at Emeline\u2014\u201cto a working man and all. Why, I\u2019m a simple cobbler at heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you own your establishment,\u201d Rebecca objected.</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed, indeed. I have a grand workshop. But it\u2019s all built up by the sweat of my own brow. My father\u2019s business was quite small.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Rebecca asked politely. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thornton shook his head ruefully as if at the memory of his father\u2019s small business. \u201cI took it over right after I came back from the war in the Colonies. Six years ago, that was. Six long years of hard labor and worry to bring my business to what it is today. Why, I do declare, that I\u2019d kill any man who sought to take my business from me.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca was looking curiously at Mr. Thornton now. His words, after all, had been far too emphatic for the conversation. Emeline held her breath, watching the man, and as she stared, he did a very strange thing. He cocked his head at her, grinned widely, and winked one eye.</p><p>And Emeline felt a thrill of horror shoot through her completely out of proportion to the gesture he\u2019d made.</p><p>SAM RODE HOME through the streets of London in a state of angry frustration. Thornton was neither at his home nor his place of business. Some of the information he\u2019d learned today caused him to be anxious that Thornton might try to flee. This together with a kind of animal instinct made urgent the need to find Thornton immediately. Long years of hunting told him that his prey was about to bolt beyond his grasp. If he couldn\u2019t find Thornton today, he\u2019d have to give up the berths he\u2019d bought for Rebecca and himself on The Hopper, sailing early on the morrow.</p> <p>Then, too, staying longer in London would mean more days in proximity to Emeline. He wasn\u2019t certain he could bear being close to her without going stark, raving mad.</p><p>A street urchin ran almost directly under his horse\u2019s nose. The horse sidestepped nervously, and Sam had to pay attention to the reins for a moment. The child was long gone, of course. The boy had probably had thousands of such near-misses in his young life, for the streets of London seemed more like a surging river than a thoroughfare. Hawkers screamed their wares at corners and indeed in the middle of the street. Carriages trundled like elephants, inevitably blocking the way with their bulk. Chairmen bearing sedan chairs wove nimbly among the crowd. And people\u2014men, women, children; infants in arms to old men with canes; high, low, and the multitude in between\u2014all crowded round, each on their own business, each in a hurry to get there. It was a wonder that the very air wasn\u2019t used up, inhaled by thousands of lungs.</p><p>Sam felt his own lungs seize at the thought, the illusion of all the air being sucked from the atmosphere infecting his brain. But that was nonsense. He concentrated on his horse and the path immediately in front of them, trying to block out the rest of the humanity surrounding them. He could breathe. There was plenty of air, though it reeked of sewage, rot, and smoke. There wasn\u2019t anything at all wrong with his lungs.</p><p>He repeated these thoughts until the town house came into view. Rebecca would still be packing, but perhaps he could entice her to stop long enough for an early luncheon. He swung down from his horse just as one of the lumbering carriages drew up to the house next door\u2014Emeline\u2019s house. The crest on the polished black door bore Vale\u2019s coat of arms. Sam quickened his step into his own house. There was no point in meeting Vale again; all that could be said had already been said there.</p><p>Inside, he gave his hat and cloak to the butler and inquired where his sister was.</p><p>\u201cMiss Hartley has just left, sir,\u201d the butler replied.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Sam frowned. Had she gone to do some last-minute shopping? \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy herself? Did she walk or take the carriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left in a carriage, sir, with Lady Emeline and Mr. Thornton.\u201d</p><p>The butler turned away to hang up the cloak and hat, completely unaware of the effect of his words. Sam stared, his gut freezing into ice at the thought that his sister and his heart had somehow climbed voluntarily into a carriage with a rapist and murderer. But of course it couldn\u2019t be voluntary. He hadn\u2019t told Rebecca of his suspicions regarding Thornton, but Emeline knew of them. Why would she leave with Thornton knowing\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done with her?\u201d</p><p>Sam whirled at the voice in time to be shoved roughly against the wall. A picture crashed to the floor, and Vale thrust his horribly bruised face at him. \u201cEmmie came here over an hour ago. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>Sam quelled the urge to simply punch the other man in the face. He\u2019d already done that, and it hadn\u2019t made matters any better. Besides, Vale cared for Emeline as well. \u201cEmeline and Rebecca have left with Thornton.\u201d</p> <p>Vale sneered. \u201cWhat rubbish. Why would Emmie go anywhere with that popinjay? You\u2019ve got her hidden somewhere.\u201d He propelled himself away from Sam and stood, legs spread wide in the hall. \u201cEmmie! I say, Emmie! Come out at once!\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. His only ally was a fool. Sam turned away, starting for the front door. He hadn\u2019t time to convince Vale of what was really going on.</p><p>But another voice stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s true, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He swung around to see Vale staring bemusedly at O\u2019Hare the footman. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Hare gave a bow, sketchy enough to almost be insolent. \u201cBoth Miss Hartley and Lady Emeline got into Mr. Thornton\u2019s carriage.\u201d He looked past Vale to catch Sam\u2019s eye. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he stood so close to Miss Hartley, sir. I think something was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t bother asking why O\u2019Hare hadn\u2019t stopped Thornton. In this country, a servant could be turned off without reference\u2014or worse\u2014for such an act. \u201cDo you have any idea where they were headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir. Princess Wharf in Wapping. I heard Mr. Thornton give the direction to the coachman.\u201d</p><p>Vale looked bewildered. \u201cWapping? Why would Thornton take them to a wharf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWharves mean ships.\u201d</p><p>Vale\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cYou think he means to kidnap them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod only knows,\u201d Sam replied. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t time to stand about debating the point. Come on, we\u2019ll take your carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, there.\u201d Vale grabbed his arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? How do I know that you\u2019re not hiding Emmie here? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sam twisted his arm downward, breaking away from the other man. \u201cBecause Thornton is the traitor, and he must somehow know that I\u2019ve found him out.\u201d</p><p>Vale\u2019s shaggy eyebrows snapped together. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, we haven\u2019t the time,\u201d Sam growled. \u201cO\u2019Hare, do you want to help with this?\u201d</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t even hesitate. \u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Sam was out the door and running down the steps without stopping for Vale\u2019s consent. He\u2019d take the waiting carriage even if the other man insisted on staying behind and debating all the possibilities.</p><p>But as he made the carriage, he found Vale beside him. \u201cPrincess Wharf, Wapping,\u201d the viscount called to his coachman. \u201cFast as you can.\u201d</p><p>All three men piled into the carriage.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Vale said as he settled across from Sam and O\u2019Hare. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Sam had his eyes on the window. Thornton\u2019s carriage had left long ago, but foolishly he still strained to catch sight of it. \u201cMacDonald took Thornton\u2019s place during or shortly after Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have proof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat a soldier we knew six years ago across the ocean is impersonating a different, dead soldier? No, I don\u2019t. He\u2019s probably killed any proof there was.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Hare shifted beside Sam. The young man hadn\u2019t spoken since they entered the carriage, but his face was worried. The carriage slowed to a roll. Shouts came from the street ahead.</p><p>Sam barely kept himself from pounding on the carriage\u2019s roof. He turned to O\u2019Hare. \u201cThere were two redheaded soldiers, you see. One was Thornton; one was MacDonald. No one paid attention to them until MacDonald was put in chains and brought back for trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat had he done, then?\u201d the footman asked.</p><p>Sam looked at Vale.</p><p>Who pursed his lips and nodded once. \u201cRaped and murdered a woman.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Hare\u2019s face whitened.</p><p>\u201cI can understand how MacDonald could\u2019ve switched identities with Thornton in the chaos after Spinner\u2019s Falls, but what of when he came home to England? Surely Thornton had family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wife.\u201d Sam shook his head. \u201cAnd she died soon after he came home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Vale nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cBut what does he want with the ladies now?\u201d O\u2019Hare burst out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sam muttered. Was Thornton insane? If his guesses were right, the man had murdered two women that they knew of. What would such a man do with the women of a man he considered his enemy?</p><p>\u201cExtortion,\u201d Vale said. \u201cPerhaps he hopes to keep you from speaking, Hartley, by holding Rebecca and Emeline hostage.\u201d</p><p>Sam closed his eyes at the thought, trying to keep down the voices inside that urged him to move rather than think. \u201cThornton is smarter than that.\u201d</p><p>Vale shrugged. \u201cEven the smartest man can panic.\u201d</p><p>A man like Thornton would kill if he panicked.</p><p>\u201cHow far is it?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>Jasper was staring out the window, too, now. \u201cWapping? Past the Tower of London.\u201d</p><p>Sam sucked in a breath. They were still on the fashionable west side of London. The Tower was a mile or more away, and the carriage wasn\u2019t moving fast.</p><p>\u201cI just remembered something,\u201d Jasper muttered.</p><p>Sam looked at him.</p><p>The other man\u2019s face had drained of color. \u201cWhen we saw Thornton in your garden, after we went into your house for tea, he boasted to me about a large shipment he was preparing for the British army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was it bound?\u201d</p><p>Jasper swallowed, then replied, \u201cIndia.\u201d</p><p>Sam felt his heart stop in his chest. If Thornton got Emeline and Rebecca on a ship bound for India...</p><p>The carriage slowed and then came to a complete stop. Sam looked out the window. A brewer\u2019s cart was stopped in the middle of the road, one of its great wheels broken from the axle. He didn\u2019t even wait for the inevitable shouting to begin. He opened the carriage door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Vale cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m faster on foot,\u201d Sam replied. \u201cYou continue in the carriage. Perhaps you\u2019ll beat me there.\u201d</p><p>And he swung down and began running.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>At the sight of Iron Heart\u2019s white-hot heart, Princess Solace gave a cry of despair. His agony was too terrible for her to bear. She ran forward and with her own hands threw a bucket of water upon him, intending to ease his pain. But, alas, although the flames were doused, it is well known what happens when metal suddenly cools.</p><p>Iron Heart\u2019s heart cracked with a loud SNAP....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>The gun was pressed firmly into Rebecca\u2019s rib cage and didn\u2019t move a whit even when the carriage bumped and swung around corners. Emeline bit her lip. To either side of her, two great brutes, Mr. Thornton\u2019s creatures, sat, effectively boxing her in. She and Rebecca had never even seen the men until they were inside the carriage. Not that it would\u2019ve mattered. Mr. Thornton had shoved his nasty gun into Rebecca and ordered them both outside and into his carriage, and Emeline hadn\u2019t liked to call his bluff at the time. The peril of having Rebecca die before her eyes had seemed all too imminent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, after riding with Mr. Thornton and his foul-smelling henchmen, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d made the right decision. He still might kill them both once they reached the wharf. She\u2019d been contemplating making an attempt at leaping from the carriage for the last several minutes. Unfortunately, she\u2019d have to make it past the brutes first, and that was without considering the gun pressed against Rebecca\u2019s side. Emeline had not a smidgen of doubt that Mr. Thornton would pull the trigger out of spite if nothing else. The man was quite, quite mad. How he had hidden his affliction up until this point was a mystery, because he was a bundle of ticcing nerves now. Mr. Thornton grinned and winked every few minutes, the expression becoming more like a grimace each time.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there, ladies,\u201d he said now, again winking in that horrible way. \u201cEver been to the East? No? Well, most haven\u2019t, I suppose. What a grand adventure we\u2019ll have!\u201d</p><p>The man to Emeline\u2019s right grunted and shifted, the movement releasing a terrible odor from his scarlet coat. The carriage was rattling into the east end of London, the way lined with warehouses. Overhead, the sky outside was becoming progressively darker.</p><p>Emeline clutched her hands together in her lap and tried to make her voice even. \u201cYou may let us out here, Mr. Thornton. There really is no need to take us any farther.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, but I enjoy your company so much,\u201d the nasty little man cackled.</p><p>Emeline inhaled slowly, then spoke quietly. \u201cOur presence only serves as a reason for Jasper and Samuel to continue pursuing you. Let us go and you may escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you to consider my welfare, my lady,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I think that your fianc\u00e9 and Samuel Hartley will pursue me whether or not I let you go. Mr. Hartley in particular seems quite obsessed. I\u2019ve had my eye on him\u201d\u2014he nodded to the scarlet-coated thug beside her\u2014\u201cfrom the moment I heard that he was questioning all of the survivors from our regiment. So, all things being equal, I think I\u2019ll keep your sweet company.\u201d</p><p>Emeline met Rebecca\u2019s gaze. The girl hadn\u2019t said a word since they\u2019d been forced into the carriage, but in her eyes, Emeline saw the same despair that threatened to overset her own sensibilities. It made no sense at all for Mr. Thornton to have kidnapped them, and the very senselessness squeezed her chest, making her breath come short.</p><p>Outside, the rain started, as sudden as a curtain falling at the end of a play. She needed to think, and the time they had might be short.</p> <p>She very much feared that Mr. Thornton meant to kill them.</p><p>THE SKY OPENED up and rain poured down in a drenching torrent. Sam flinched as the first wave hit him like a slap in the face, but he kept running. The rain actually made things a little easier. Those who could immediately sought shelter, fleeing from the streets as fast as they were able. Unfortunately, that still left quite a few vehicles. The brewer\u2019s cart, for instance, probably still blocked Vale\u2019s carriage. Sam leapt a row of broken cobblestones, turned by the rain into a miniature urban brook, and focused his mind on running. He couldn\u2019t do anything about what lay in back of him or what lay ahead. For now, running was his entire being.</p><p>The carriage had been somewhere on Fleet Street when it had stopped, but Sam had cut off the busy thoroughfare. He ran parallel to the Thames now, the river out of sight somewhere to his right.</p><p>He felt the stretch in the muscles of his legs as he fought for even more speed. He hadn\u2019t run like this\u2014full out, in desperation and hope\u2014since Spinner\u2019s Falls. Then, no matter how he\u2019d strained, he\u2019d still arrived too late. Reynaud had died.</p><p>He swerved to avoid a young girl carrying a baby and crashed into a bulky man in a leather apron. The man swore and tried to strike him, but Sam was already past him. His feet hurt, sharp shards of pain working their way up his shins. He wondered if he\u2019d reopened the wounds on his soles.</p><p>And then the smell hit him.</p> <p>Whether it was from the leather-aproned man or someone he passed now, or maybe it was just a product of his fevered imagination, he didn\u2019t know, but he smelled sweat. Male sweat. Oh, God, not now. He kept his eyes open and his legs pumping, though he wanted to cover his face and slump to the ground. The dead of Spinner\u2019s Falls seemed to follow him. Invisible bodies that reeked of sweat and blood. Ghostly hands that caught at his sleeves and implored him to wait. He\u2019d felt these wraiths in the forest after Spinner\u2019s Falls. They\u2019d followed him all the way to Fort Edward. Sometimes he\u2019d even seen them, a boy\u2019s eyes hollowed by fear, the old soldier with his scalp cut away. He\u2019d never known if he\u2019d been dreaming\u2014running while only half awake\u2014or if the dead of Spinner\u2019s Falls had leaked into his living body. Perhaps he carried them everywhere and only knew it when he was in distress. Perhaps he\u2019d always carry them, the way some men carried shrapnel beneath their skin, a silent ache, an invisible reminder of what he\u2019d survived.</p><p>He ran through a wash of water, the splashes hitting him in the thighs. Not that it mattered; his clothes had long since soaked through. He was running closer to the wharves now, and he could smell the decay of the river. Tall warehouses rose up on either side of the lane he ran down. His breath came in gasps, and there was a scorching pain in his side. He\u2019d lost track of time, couldn\u2019t tell how long or how far he\u2019d been running. What if they were already at the ship? What if Thornton had already killed them?</p><p>His mind suddenly flashed a horrific image: Emeline sprawled, naked and bloody, her face white and still. No! He squeezed his eyes shut against the sight and stumbled, slamming to his hands and knees on the cobblestones.</p><p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d a gruff male voice shouted.</p><p>Sam opened his eyes to see horse hooves inches from his face. He scrambled clumsily away, still on his knees, as the cart driver cursed his ancestry. His knees ached, especially his right one, which must\u2019ve taken the brunt of the fall, but Sam stood.</p><p>Ignoring the driver, ignoring the breath rasping in his lungs, ignoring his pain, he started running again.</p><p>Emeline.</p><p>THE CARRIAGE MADE a wide turn, and Emeline could see the docks outside the window. The rain was still sheeting down, veiling tall ships out in the middle of the Thames. Smaller vessels crowded between the ships, ferrying goods and sometimes people between ship and shore. Normally, the docks would be full of laborers, prostitutes, and the gangs of thieves that made their livings off filching from the ships\u2019 cargos. But because of the rain, the wharf was sparsely populated.</p> <p>The carriage shuddered to a stop.</p><p>Mr. Thornton dug his pistol into Rebecca\u2019s side. \u201cTime to get out, Miss Hartley.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca didn\u2019t move. She turned a heartbreakingly brave face to their kidnapper. \u201cWhat are you going to do with us?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thornton cocked his head and gave his gruesome grin and wink. \u201cNothing terrible, I assure you. Why, I have a mind to show you the world. Come and see.\u201d</p><p>Oddly, his mundane pleasantry confirmed all of Emeline\u2019s worst fears. She looked out the carriage door at the rain-grayed waters of the Thames. If they got onto a ship with Thornton, they weren\u2019t likely to survive the journey. But at the moment they had no choice. Thornton nodded to the men on either side of her.</p><p>\u201cMove on,\u201d the scarlet-coated henchman to Emeline\u2019s right grunted. He wrapped sausagelike fingers about her upper arm, no doubt leaving grease marks. He was slightly the shorter of the two and sported a frayed tricorne. Mr. Thornton must not pay him well, because his boots were nearly all holes and a grimy big toe poked through the leather on one.</p><p>Emeline smiled tightly at Rebecca, trying to give her a bit of courage, before gathering her skirts. She stepped out of the carriage and into the rain, the thug\u2019s hand still on her. The second thug followed. He was a tall, stringy man with enormously long arms and thinning gray hair. He hunched his shoulders and stood mute as Mr. Thornton descended with Rebecca.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Thornton said, smiling. He smiled at everything. \u201cLet\u2019s hurry. There should be a boat waiting to take us to The Sea Tiger. I\u2019m sure you ladies will want to get out of the rain. If we\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t finish the sentence. Rebecca pulled abruptly from his grasp, ducking to the side and behind the tall, balding henchman. For a fraction of a second, Mr. Thornton didn\u2019t know where to point the gun, and it wavered. Then he grinned that horrible grin and brought the barrel around, pointing it at Emeline\u2019s belly.</p><p>She froze. There was a long moment in time as she watched him wink and steady his aim, knowing that she was about to be killed.</p><p>And then she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Samuel ran out of nowhere and threw himself against Thornton\u2019s gun arm, deflecting his aim. The gun exploded, sending chips of cobblestone into the air. The tall, balding henchman leaped at Samuel, grabbing him from behind, and all three men went down in a writhing heap of desperate arms and legs. Rebecca screamed and pulled at the balding henchman\u2019s coat. The scarlet-coated thug let go of Emeline\u2019s arm, but before he could move, she brought her heel down on the toe that poked through his boot. The man howled and lashed out. Emeline saw a burst of white stars as his hand connected with the side of her head, and then she found herself on the ground, lying in a cold puddle of water.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rebecca gasped beside her.</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d Emeline whispered. He was under all three men now, almost hidden by the legs kicking him, the arms hitting him. They would beat him to death before her very eyes if she didn\u2019t do something.</p><p>There were no pieces of wood, no stones to pry up. All she had was herself, so Emeline used that. She scrambled to her feet and ran at the awful little man and his henchmen. She clutched a head of hair and yanked. The man she was holding\u2014one of the henchmen\u2014shouldered her aside. Emeline staggered, almost falling, but got up again. She threw herself, kicking, shrieking, clawing, at the bodies attacking Samuel. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Rebecca pummeling the back of one of the men, her fists small and puny. The rain mixed with hot salty tears on Emeline\u2019s face, and she was half-blinded, but she wasn\u2019t going to give up. If they killed Samuel, they would have to kill her, too.</p><p>Her slipper connected with Mr. Thornton\u2019s rump, and he twisted to look at her with a comically astonished expression. Samuel took advantage of the other man\u2019s distraction and punched him in the face. Mr. Thornton\u2019s head snapped back, and he rolled to the cobblestones, a hand outstretched to break his fall. He made to get up, and Emeline stomped on his outstretched hand, feeling quite pleased when something snapped beneath her heel.</p><p>Thornton screamed.</p><p>Behind Emeline, a gunshot exploded.</p><p>\u201cGood God, Emmie, I had no idea you were so bloodthirsty,\u201d a male voice said.</p><p>Emeline looked up and saw Jasper descending a carriage with a footman behind him. The footman had a gun in each hand, the right one smoking.</p><p>Fear and exasperation overflowed all of her good manners. \u201cJasper, don\u2019t be an idiot. Come help Samuel at once!\u201d</p><p>Jasper, not surprisingly, looked startled. \u201cRight you are, Emmie. You two, get off Mr. Hartley. Slowly, now.\u201d</p><p>The thugs glanced at each other glumly and got to their feet, backing away from Samuel. He lay so still, the rain beating on his pale face.</p><p>Emeline rushed to him, terribly afraid. \u201cSamuel.\u201d She\u2019d seen him punch Mr. Thornton, but now he didn\u2019t move. \u201cSamuel!\u201d She knelt on the filthy, wet cobblestones and tenderly touched her fingertips to his cheek.</p><p>He opened his eyes. \u201cEmeline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was insane, but she couldn\u2019t keep from smiling at him in the rain, with hot tears trickling down her cheeks. \u201cYes.\u201d God only knew what she was saying, but Samuel seemed to understand.</p><p>He turned his head and kissed her palm with bruised lips, and her heart rejoiced.</p><p>Then his gaze sharpened and he looked behind her. \u201cHave they got Thornton?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He started to sit up, and she put her shoulder under his to help him. \u201cYes, Jasper has it all under control.\u201d</p><p>In fact, the footman was tying the two henchmen\u2019s hands to Mr. Thornton\u2019s carriage while Rebecca held the guns. Jasper had hold of Mr. Thornton.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do with him now?\u201d Jasper asked. He looked like he was holding a piece of offal.</p><p>\u201cToss him in the river,\u201d the footman growled over his shoulder, and Rebecca smiled at him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Samuel said softly, and Emeline had never heard his voice so cold.</p><p>Mr. Thornton laughed. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>Jasper shook him like a dog does a rat. \u201cFor trying to hurt Miss Hartley and Lady Emeline, you bounder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t, did I?\u201d Thornton said. \u201cThey\u2019re not hurt at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou held a gun on them\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPish posh! Do you think any magistrate will care?\u201d Mr. Thornton smiled happily, almost normally. He didn\u2019t seem to have any idea the trouble he was in.</p><p>Emeline shivered in Samuel\u2019s embrace. Thornton\u2019s manic confidence that he could win out against Jasper\u2014a viscount\u2014was the final evidence that the man had lost his senses.</p><p>\u201cYou killed a woman in America,\u201d Samuel said quietly. \u201cThey\u2019ll hang you for that.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thornton cocked his head, completely unperturbed. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you mean.\u201d</p><p>Jasper expelled an impatient breath. \u201cCut line. We know you\u2019re MacDonald, know you killed that woman, know you betrayed us to the French and their Indian allies at Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how will you prove all that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have to,\u201d Samuel said low. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll just drown you in the Thames and be done. I doubt anyone will miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d Rebecca whispered.</p><p>Samuel looked at her, and although his expression didn\u2019t change, his voice softened slightly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have real trouble convicting you in court. There\u2019re a few survivors who must remember both MacDonald and Thornton, and if nothing else, we can ask your father-in-law.\u201d</p><p>Emeline sucked in her breath.</p><p>Samuel nodded. \u201cYes, that\u2019s one of the things I found out today. Thornton has an elderly father-in-law whom he hasn\u2019t seen since he married the man\u2019s daughter. The father-in-law lives in Cornwall, you see. The man is in poor health, but he\u2019s been suspicious ever since his daughter supposedly fell down the stairs. He\u2019s been pestering various solicitors to investigate the death, and I met one who finally took on the old man\u2019s case on my search today. I have no doubt that if we provide a carriage, he will come to London and testify that this is not the man who originally married his daughter.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thornton went into a veritable spasm of winking and grinning. \u201cTry it! The old man\u2019s on his last legs. He\u2019ll never survive a trip to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us worry about that,\u201d Jasper said, shaking Thornton again. \u201cYou, I think, should be more worried about the gallows.\u201d Jasper turned to Samuel. \u201cDo you mind if I borrow your man to escort these three to Newgate?\u201d</p><p>Samuel nodded. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll take the ladies home in your carriage.\u201d He turned with Emeline to walk to Jasper\u2019s carriage, but a shout from Thornton stopped him.</p> <p>\u201cHartley!\u201d the nasty little man cried. \u201cYou might get me for the woman in America, but you won\u2019t for Spinner\u2019s Falls. I didn\u2019t betray the regiment at Spinner\u2019s Falls. I\u2019m not the traitor.\u201d</p><p>Samuel glanced at the man, his face disinterested.</p><p>His lack of reaction seemed to inflame Thornton. \u201cYou\u2019re a coward, Hartley. You ran at Spinner\u2019s Falls; everyone knows it. You\u2019re a coward.\u201d</p><p>Vale flushed scarlet and Emeline heard Rebecca\u2019s horrified gasp.</p><p>But amazingly, Samuel smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Princess Solace cradled her dying husband in her arms, her salty tears bathing his face. And as she wept over him, the dawn broke, the golden rays of the sun flooding the earth. Iron Heart opened his eyes and, looking into the face of his wife, uttered the first words he\u2019d spoken in seven long years....</p><p>\u2014from Iron Heart</p><p>\u201cHe needs a doctor,\u201d Rebecca said as she helped Emeline push Samuel into the carriage.</p><p>Emeline didn\u2019t voice the thought out loud, but she had to concur with Rebecca. Samuel looked white under his naturally swarthy skin, and a cut over his eye was bleeding, painting the side of his face with blood.</p><p>\u201cNo doctor,\u201d Samuel mumbled, which didn\u2019t exactly help his case.</p><p>Emeline met his sister\u2019s eyes over his head and saw she was in agreement. Definitely, a doctor.</p><p>The slow pace of the carriage made the drive back through the streets of London nightmarish. By the time they arrived home, Samuel had been silent for half an hour, his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cHas he fainted?\u201d Emeline whispered anxiously to Rebecca.</p><p>\u201cI think only fallen asleep,\u201d the girl replied.</p><p>It required two sturdy footmen to get Samuel up the steps of the town house and into his own bed. Then Emeline sent for the doctor.</p><p>An hour later, Rebecca entered the library to give the doctor\u2019s report.</p><p>\u201cHe says it\u2019s merely exhaustion,\u201d Rebecca said on finding Emeline sitting by the fire half-asleep.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness.\u201d Emeline let her head slump against the back of her chair.</p><p>\u201cYou look exhausted yourself,\u201d Rebecca said critically.</p><p>Emeline started to shake her head. She didn\u2019t want to leave Samuel. But then she found herself dizzy, so she stilled the movement.</p><p>Rebecca must\u2019ve seen. \u201cGo home and rest. Samuel\u2019s asleep, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Emeline humphed. \u201cYou\u2019re a dear child, but a trifle bossy.\u201d</p><p>The younger woman smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve learned from the best.\u201d Rebecca held out a hand to help her up, but then a commotion started in the hall.</p><p>Emeline looked to the library door in time to see Jasper blow in.</p><p>\u201cEmmie! Are you all right?\u201d he asked. \u201cI went to your house, but you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Emeline frowned. She was constantly amazed at how little Jasper knew her. \u201cShhh! I\u2019m fine, but you\u2019ll wake up Samuel with that bellowing.\u201d</p><p>Jasper glanced at the ceiling as if he could see through plaster and wood. \u201cI suppose he\u2019s had a bit of a day, too, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper\u2014\u201d Emeline began, about to give him a set down, but Rebecca interrupted.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I leave you? I need to...to\u201d\u2014she knitted her brow, obviously trying to think of an excuse\u2014\u201cmake sure O\u2019Hare is all right.\u201d</p><p>Emeline stared. \u201cWho is O\u2019Hare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy footman,\u201d Rebecca said, and sailed from the room.</p><p>Emeline was still frowning after the girl when Jasper interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cEmmie.\u201d</p><p>She turned because his voice sounded grave, and really looked at him. She\u2019d never seen the expression that was now on his face\u2014a kind of weary acceptance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be married, are we?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, dear. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He slumped into a chair. \u201cJust as well, I suppose. You never would\u2019ve been able to put up with my foibles. Probably isn\u2019t a woman alive who would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a comically old-fashioned look.</p><p>\u201cIt might not be easy,\u201d she amended, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a very nice lady out there for you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth curved. \u201cI\u2019m three and thirty, Emmie. If there was a woman who would love me, and more importantly, could stand me, don\u2019t you think I\u2019d\u2019ve found her by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might help if you stopped looking for her in brothels and gaming hells and tried a more respectable place.\u201d Her words were tart, but her delivery was somewhat marred by the huge yawn that split her face.</p><p>Jasper jumped up. \u201cLet me see you home so that you can get some proper rest and continue raking me over the coals tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Sadly, Emeline wasn\u2019t even up to making a token protest. She let Jasper pull her from the chair and escort her outside the few steps to her own door. There he bussed her on the cheek in the same manner he\u2019d used since she was four and turned away.</p><p>\u201cJasper,\u201d she called softly.</p><p>He stopped and glanced at her over his shoulder with his beautiful turquoise eyes. His body was tall and lanky in the moonlight, his long, comical face full of tragedy.</p><p>Her heartstrings pulled. He\u2019d been Reynaud\u2019s best friend. She\u2019d known him all her life. \u201cI do love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Emmie, I know. That\u2019s the terrible part.\u201d His face was wry.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what to say to that.</p><p>He gave a one-fingered wave and then the night swallowed him up.</p><p>Emeline climbed the stairs to her own house, wishing she knew what to do about Jasper. She\u2019d barely made it inside when she was descended upon by Tante Cristelle and Melisande.</p><p>\u201cWhatever are you doing here?\u201d Emeline asked in tired astonishment at the sight of her friend.</p><p>\u201cI came to return your book of fairy tales,\u201d Melisande said prosaically. \u201cBut when I got here, Mr. Hartley\u2019s butler was informing your aunt that something was amiss. I decided to stay and keep her company until we had word. But we were never told exactly what had happened.\u201d</p><p>So Emeline had to recount the adventure over tea and buns while Tante Cristelle made many interruptions. At the end, she was even more exhausted than she\u2019d been before.</p><p>Which Melisande, with her knowing eyes, must\u2019ve seen. \u201cI think you need your bed as soon as you\u2019ve finished that tea.\u201d</p><p>Emeline looked into her cooling teacup and only nodded.</p><p>She sensed more than saw Melisande and Tante Cristelle exchange worried glances over her head.</p><p>\u201cIn a moment,\u201d Emeline said, just to stay in control.</p><p>Melisande sighed and gestured to the table at Emeline\u2019s elbow. \u201cI put your book of fairy tales there.\u201d</p><p>Emeline looked and saw the dusty little book. It still held fond memories of Reynaud, but it no longer seemed so important. \u201cWhatever did you bring it back for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want me to translate it?\u201d her friend asked.</p><p>Emeline set aside her tea. \u201cI think the fairy-tale book was a link to Reynaud for me. Something to make me sure I wouldn\u2019t forget him. But now it\u2019s not quite so important to have a tangible reminder of him.\u201d She met her oldest friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019ll ever forget him, is it?\u201d</p><p>Melisande was silent, looking at her with sad eyes.</p><p>Emeline reached for the book. She smoothed the tattered cover and then looked up. \u201cKeep it for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Emeline smiled and held the book out to her best friend. \u201cTranslate it. Maybe you\u2019ll find in it the thing I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Melisande knitted her brows, but she took the book, holding it on her lap between both hands. \u201cIf you think it best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Emeline yawned hugely and not at all politely. \u201cGoodness. And now it\u2019s to bed for me.\u201d</p><p>Melisande accompanied her into the hallway, murmuring a good night before turning to the door.</p><p>Emeline started up the stairs and then had a sudden thought, perhaps brought on by the delirium of exhaustion. \u201cMelisande.\u201d</p><p>Her friend glanced up from donning her shawl by the door. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can watch after Jasper for me?\u201d</p><p>Melisande, that sturdy, unflappable lady, actually gaped in astonishment. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a strange request, and I\u2019m half out of my mind with weariness right now, but I worry about Jasper.\u201d Emeline smiled at her best friend. \u201cWill you look after him?\u201d</p><p>By this time, Melisande had recovered. \u201cOf course, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Emeline nodded and started back up the stairs, a weight off her mind.</p><p>Behind her, she heard Melisande call a farewell, and she must\u2019ve murmured something in response, but she could only think of one thing.</p> <p>She needed to sleep.</p><p>\u201cDO YOU THINK Mr. Thornton really was the traitor?\u201d Rebecca asked later that night.</p><p>She was sleepy, almost dozing in front of the fire. Samuel had risen from his bed to have a belated cold supper with her, and then they\u2019d retired here. She should be asleep; she was so exhausted after the adventures of the day, but somehow something seemed to be missing.</p><p>Across from her, Samuel held up a goblet of brandy and looked through the glass into the fire. \u201cI think so.\u201d His face was battered, new bruises atop old ones that had barely begun to heal, but it was dear to her nonetheless.</p><p>She blinked fuzzily. \u201cBut you\u2019re not absolutely sure.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head decisively and drained the glass. \u201cThornton is a born liar. It\u2019s impossible to tell whether he really had nothing to do with the massacre or not. He may not know himself\u2014liars have a way of coming to believe their own lies. I doubt we\u2019ll ever be absolutely certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014Rebecca stifled a yawn\u2014\u201cyou came halfway around the world to find the truth, to put the massacre to rest. Doesn\u2019t it bother you that Thornton might not be the traitor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>A smile flickered across his face. \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I can never erase Spinner\u2019s Falls entirely from my mind. It\u2019s not possible for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s awful! How\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He held up a hand to halt her worried protest. \u201cBut what I\u2019ve learned is that I can live with the memory. That the memory is part of me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him worriedly. \u201cThat sounds terrible, Samuel. To live with that all your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019ve already lived six years fighting with my memories. I think if anything, it\u2019ll be better now that I know the memories are part of who I am.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand, but if you\u2019re at peace, I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>They sat in companionable silence for a few minutes. Rebecca began to half doze. A log popped in the fire, and she remembered that there was something else to discuss with her brother before she fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cShe loves you, you know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, so Rebecca opened her eyes to see if he\u2019d fallen asleep. He was gazing into the fire, his hands clasped loosely in his lap.</p> <p>\u201cI said, she loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d She sighed gustily and a little grumpily. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to do something about it? Our ship sails tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He got up finally and stretched, wincing as something pulled in his side. \u201cYou\u2019re about to fall asleep in that chair, and then I\u2019ll have to carry you to bed like a little girl.\u201d He held out his hand.</p><p>She placed her hand in his. \u201cI\u2019m not a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he said softly. He drew her up to stand before him. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister grown into a lovely and interesting lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at him.</p><p>He hesitated, then took her other hand and rubbed the backs of her fingers with his thumbs. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you back to England again soon, if you like, so that you can see Mr. Green or any other gentleman you might be interested in. I have no intention of crushing your hopes there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have hopes.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about our lack of pedigree, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d She looked down to watch his large hands holding hers. His hands were tanned even though they\u2019d been in England for weeks now.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Mr. Green,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cand if you want me to continue seeing him...\u201d</p><p>He tugged at her hands until she looked up. \u201cWhy should it matter to me if you see Mr. Green or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought...\u201d Oh, this was embarrassing! \u201cI thought that you wanted me to encourage him or a man like him. I thought you might like the fact that he\u2019s an English-society gentleman, even though he has a silly laugh. It\u2019s just so hard to tell what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is for you to be happy,\u201d he said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cI might object if you take a liking to a rat-catcher or an eighty-year-old grandfather, but other than that, I don\u2019t much care who you marry.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca bit her lip. Men were so obtuse! \u201cBut I want your approval.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close to her. \u201cYou already have my approval. Now you need to start thinking about what you approve of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes it very much harder,\u201d she sighed, but she smiled as she said it.</p><p>He tucked her hand into the crook of his arm. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Then you won\u2019t be making any hasty decisions.\u201d They started up the dim stairs.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Rebecca muffled a yawn. \u201cI do have a favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you offer O\u2019Hare a job?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her quizzically.</p><p>\u201cI mean in America.\u201d She held her breath.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I can,\u201d he said musingly. \u201cBut there\u2019s no guarantee that he\u2019ll accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he will,\u201d she said with certainty. \u201cThank you, Samuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he replied. They were at her bedroom door now. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d She watched as he turned toward his own rooms. \u201cYou will speak to Lady Emeline, won\u2019t you?\u201d she called anxiously after him.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t seem to hear.</p><p>THE SUN WAS shining through her window when Emeline woke the next morning. She stared at it dreamily for a moment before its full import hit her.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear Lord!\u201d She jumped from the bed and rang frantically for a maid. Then, afraid the summons would take too long, opened her door and bellowed down the hallway like a common fishwife.</p><p>She turned back to her room, found a soft bag to pack, and began flinging things into it willy-nilly.</p><p>\u201cEmeline!\u201d Tante Cristelle stood in the doorway, hair still in braids, looking horrified. \u201cWhat has possessed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d Emeline stared at the open bag, clothing spilling out, and realized there wasn\u2019t any time for packing. \u201cHis ship leaves this morning. It may have already left. I have to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to tell him that I love him.\u201d She abandoned the bag and instead ran to the wardrobe to draw out her plainest frock. By this time, Harris had arrived in the room. \u201cQuickly! Help me dress!\u201d</p><p>Tante Cristelle sank onto the bed. \u201cWhy there is such a hurry, I do not know. If that man doesn\u2019t know already that you have a tendre for him, he is an imbecile most severe.\u201d</p><p>Emeline struggled up from folds of dimity. \u201cYes, but I told him I didn\u2019t want to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to marry him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiens! Then it was very silly of you to become engaged to Lord Vale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d Good Lord, she was wasting time arguing in circles with Tante Cristelle when Samuel\u2019s ship might be sailing down the Thames right now. \u201cOh, where are my shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here, my lady,\u201d Harris said unperturbedly. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t any stockings on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d</p><p>Tante Cristelle threw her hands up in the air, imploring God in French to come to the aid of her so-deranged niece. Emeline thrust her bare feet into her shoes and hurried to the door, nearly running down Daniel.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, M\u2019man?\u201d her only offspring asked innocently. His eyes dropped to her bare ankles. \u201cI say, do you know you haven\u2019t any stockings on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear.\u201d Emeline pressed an absentminded kiss to Daniel\u2019s forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re going to America, and they don\u2019t wear any stockings there.\u201d</p><p>Emeline left Daniel yelling huzzahs while Tante Cristelle and Harris tried to quiet him. She ran down the stairs, calling for Crabs as she went.</p><p>That imperturbable gentleman ran into the hallway looking startled. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring the carriage \u2019round. Hurry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my cloak. I\u2019ll need a cloak.\u201d She looked frantically about the hall for a clock. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust past nine o\u2019clock, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Emeline covered her face. The ship would\u2019ve left by now. Samuel would be out at sea. What was she to do? There was no way to catch him, no way to\u2014</p><p>\u201cEmeline.\u201d The voice was deep and sure and oh so familiar.</p><p>For a moment, she didn\u2019t dare hope. Then she dropped her hands.</p><p>He stood in the entrance to her sitting room, his coffee-brown eyes smiling just for her.</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d</p><p>She rushed at him, and he folded his arms about her. Still she made sure to get a good grip on his coat.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d left. I thought I was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he said, and kissed her, soft brushes of his lips over her mouth and cheeks and eyelids. \u201cHush. I\u2019m here.\u201d He drew her into the sitting room.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He kissed her with determination, as if to prove his existence real. His lips gently parted hers, and he tilted her head back. She grasped his shoulders, reveling in this freedom to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His lips wandered over her brow. \u201cI was going to stay here in your sitting room until you admitted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you?\u201d she asked distractedly.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very intelligent of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so intelligent.\u201d He pulled back his head, and she saw that his eyes had grown dark and serious. \u201cIt was a matter of survival. I\u2019m cold without you, Emeline. You\u2019re the light that keeps me warm on the inside. If I left you, I think I\u2019d freeze into a solid block of ice.\u201d</p><p>She pulled his head back to hers. \u201cThen you\u2019d better not leave me.\u201d</p><p>But he resisted her urging. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat, and she had to swallow before she replied huskily, \u201cOh, yes, please.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were still grave. \u201cWill you come with me to America? I can live here in England, but it would be easier for my business if we lived in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Daniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like him to come, too.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and closed her eyes because it was almost too much. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I never cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that. \u201cIt\u2019s not the usual thing, to keep a boy by his mother\u2019s side, but I\u2019d very much like to have him with me.\u201d</p><p>He touched the corner of her mouth with his thumb. \u201cGood. Then Daniel comes with us. Your aunt is welcome to come as well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will remain here,\u201d Tante Cristelle said from behind them.</p><p>Emeline swung around.</p><p>The older woman was standing just inside the doorway. \u201cYou will need someone to handle the estates, the money, these things, yes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, yes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it is decided. And, of course, you will make the journey across the ocean every few years so that I might see my great-nephew.\u201d Tante Cristelle nodded with satisfaction at having ordered everything and left the room, closing the door softly behind her.</p><p>Emeline turned back to Samuel to find him watching her.</p><p>\u201cWill it be all right?\u201d he asked. \u201cLeaving all this behind? Meeting new people? Living in a new country, one not quite as sophisticated as this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter where we live as long as I\u2019m with you.\u201d Emeline smiled slowly. \u201cAlthough, I plan to set a new standard for sophistication and wit in Boston. After all, no one there has been to one of my balls.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her then, a wide happy smile that with all his bruises made him look like a pirate. \u201cThey won\u2019t know what hit them, will they?\u201d</p><p>Emeline mock frowned, but then she drew Samuel\u2019s head back down to hers so that she could kiss him. Sweetly, happily. And as she did, she murmured one more time against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>As Iron Heart\u2019s words left his lips, there came a scream from the wicked wizard.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! No! It cannot be!\u201d The terrible little man\u2019s face reddened until steam began to shoot from his nose. \u201cI\u2019ve waited seven long years to steal your iron heart and make its strength mine! Had you ever spoken in those seven years, I would\u2019ve won it, and you and your wife would be damned to hell. It isn\u2019t fair!\u201d</p><p>And the wicked wizard spun in a circle, enraged that his spell was forfeited. He spun, faster and faster, until sparks flew from his whirling body, until black smoke billowed from his ears, until the very ground quaked beneath him, and then, BANG! he was suddenly swallowed by the earth! But the white dove upon his wrist flew up as he vanished, the golden chain broken, and when the bird alit, it turned instantly into a squalling baby\u2014Iron Heart\u2019s son.</p><p>And then what rejoicing there was in the Shining City! The people cheered and danced in the streets with happiness at the restoration of their prince.</p><p>But what of Iron Heart and his cracked heart? Princess Solace looked down at her husband, held still in her arms, afraid that he was already dead, only to find him whole and smiling back at her. So she did the only thing a princess can do in such a case: she kissed him.</p> <p>And though many in the Shining City are of the opinion to this day that Iron Heart\u2019s heart healed when the wicked wizard\u2019s spell was broken, I myself am not so sure. It seems to me that it must have been Princess Solace\u2019s love that revived him.</p><p>For what else can mend a broken heart but true love? </p> </body></html>"]
