Day turned to night.</p><p>There was no escape.</p><p>Mere feet in front of her, an unearthly red-orange light burst from that wide, gaping hole. Still, the Earth screamed. Tied to a stake at the edge of that abyss, she could do nothing but watch. And tremble.</p> <p>She was not alone and, oh, if only she were. Because one of the other four tied around that gaping maw with her was her brother, Xavier. All her life, she\u2019d watched over him. Now she could do nothing to help either of them. And they were surely going to die.</p><p>Around them, half a dozen large, muscular males\u2014half of them clothed, half naked, ran, shouting, drawing blades, as a second group of men descended on the circle and drew them into battle.</p><p>As steel clanged, one of the naked men disappeared suddenly in a spray of sparkling lights to be replaced by a large, maned African lion. Another lunged at one of his attackers and, in a similar spray of lights, turned into a huge wolf.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Thunder rolled across the sky.</p> <p>A horrible stench met her nose. Fire tore down her cheek as if one of the warriors had turned his blade on her, but there was no one close.</p><p>And then suddenly there was.</p><p>She cried out in pain and shock, staring at the monster that stood . . . that hovered . . . in front of her\u2014more hideous than anything she\u2019d ever imagined. He was the size of a man, black hair floating around his head as if each lock were alive, gleaming in the unholy red-orange light. A black cloak hung around his indistinct body. And his face . . . his face . . . Features hung at odd angles, his flesh like melted wax, wicked fangs protruding unevenly from a slash of a mouth.</p><p>She froze with terror, her heart pounding out of her chest, as his hand . . . his claw . . . lifted, red with her blood.</p><p>Natalie Cash woke with a start, her heart pounding, her body damp with sweat. An early-dawn glow lit the window shades of her bedroom, and she blinked, trying to catch her breath from the nightmare that even now scampered back into the shadows of her mind, leaving behind only wisps of horror and fantasy\u2014a man shifting into a wolf, a terror too awful to remember.</p><p>With unsteady hands, she raked her hair back from her face.</p> <p>A hell of a way to start the day.</p><p>Xavier had been in the dream, she was almost certain, though in what capacity she had no recollection, now. Every night was the same\u2014the nightmares that slipped away upon waking. They\u2019d been plaguing her ever since the incident, the week of her life that had vanished a month and a half ago, leaving three of her friends dead and her brother missing.</p><p>The cops didn\u2019t have a single lead.</p><p>Easing from the bed quietly, so as not to wake Rick, she padded to the bathroom down the hall, then to the kitchen for a cup of hazelnut coffee. Mug in hand, she let herself out through the sliding glass door onto her deck. A pleasant breeze brushed her cheek as she settled onto her favorite cushioned chair and soaked in the beauty of the woods behind her house, drenched in the light of dawn.</p><p>As the sky lightened, as the birds woke and began to sing, she sipped the fragrant brew and slowly found the equilibrium that was usually such a natural part of her. Before six weeks ago, she\u2019d felt settled and satisfied, her life on track, everything falling into place. Her optometry practice, a year old now, was thriving\u2014she had a full patient load, and she loved it, especially working with the kids. Her mom was thrilled that she was out of college and back in town. And she was engaged to marry Rick, her longtime boyfriend and best friend.</p><p>Everything had changed in a single day\u2014the day two of her friends from high school suggested a day-trip to Harpers Ferry. Rick had made plans to help his dad, and since one of her friends had invited her own younger brother and his girlfriend, Christy, Natalie had brought Xavier.</p><p>Her stomach clenched with the grinding, constant yearning to go back in time and change that decision. If only she hadn\u2019t invited him. If only they\u2019d chosen the outlet mall in Leesburg instead.</p><p>The morning had been pleasant as they\u2019d traipsed about the quaint, historic town. And then her memories just blanked out. A week later, she and Christy awakened in a field nearby with no memory of the time between. The bodies of three of their companions had been recovered that first afternoon. Only Xavier remained missing.</p> <p>And her life had careened off the rails.</p><p>Taking a small sip of the hot brew, breathing in the hazelnut and warm coffee scents, she tipped her head back and watched the pink clouds amble slowly across the dawn sky.</p><p>Somewhere, somehow, Xavier still lived, she was sure of it. She\u2019d awakened in that field to find a quarter-sized circle on her palm, drawn in pen. A circle with a small curve in the middle\u2014a smiley-face without the eyes\u2014one of her blind brother\u2019s favorites. She felt certain Xavier had put it there, a message that he was okay. But where was he? Where had she been? And why hadn\u2019t he come home, too?</p><p>As the weeks passed, her fear grew that she might never see him again.</p><p>She had no choice but to carry on. But that missing week haunted her. Grief at the losses she\u2019d suffered had settled like a fist beneath her breastbone, an ache that throbbed constantly, refusing to abate.</p><p>Natalie took another sip of coffee, envying the clouds that floated free of the cares of the world.</p><p>A low sound caught her ear, and she straightened. A movement in the trees caught her eye, and her heart lifted on a thrill of pleasure as the huge wolf who\u2019d visited her a few weeks ago, bounded into view. He was a magnificent animal, easily the size of a bear, with a thick coat\u2014variegated black and gray\u2014on his back and head, sable on his legs and belly. He wasn\u2019t really a wolf, of course, though he might have some wolf blood. He was too friendly. At least, he had been the last time.</p><p>She watched him carefully, her more primitive instincts urging her to retreat to the house, just to play it safe. But as he crossed her yard, as she peered into that beautiful, intelligent face, she once again felt no fear. Exhilaration, yes. And awe. But not fear, not when those golden eyes of his radiated a warm, joyous welcome.</p><p>She smiled, his arrival lifting her heart and easing the burden from her shoulders, holding it aloft for a few precious moments. Setting her mug on the table beside her, she turned to him as he leaped up the few steps to the deck with a grace that belied his size.</p><p>At the top of the deck stairs, he stopped, gazing at her like a human might rather than rushing forward like a dog. Still, unbridled pleasure filled his eyes, a pleasure that burst in her chest with utter delight. Grinning, Natalie held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d she said quietly, not wanting to wake Rick or the neighbors.</p><p>The dog\u2019s hesitation lasted all of two seconds more before he strode forward, sliding his massive head between her waiting hands. How was it possible she\u2019d missed him so profoundly when she\u2019d only met him once before? Yet that\u2019s exactly how she felt.</p><p>Stroking the thick, soft fur on the sides of his neck, emotion welled up inside of her, a strange mix of grief and sorrow, and peace. As if the sheer power of his soul tore away the protective defenses she\u2019d been struggling to build around her misery, then lifted the grief itself, helping her to carry it.</p><p>A fanciful notion. And yet stroking his fur, gazing into those intelligent eyes, she felt as if she\u2019d somehow grabbed hold of the anchor she\u2019d been struggling so unsuccessfully to find. She\u2019d always heard that pets had an amazing ability to ground and calm humans, but she\u2019d never expected to feel such a visceral reaction to an animal she barely knew.</p><p>\u201cI needed your visit, today,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI already feel better. Lighter. Stronger.\u201d</p><p>If possible, the look in those golden eyes deepened.</p><p>\u201cWho are you? You don\u2019t wear a collar or dog tag, yet you can\u2019t be wild, can you? You\u2019re far too comfortable with humans.\u201d As he sat, she ran her fingers between his forelegs, scratching his chest. \u201cWhatever your situation, you\u2019re certainly thriving. Look at you. You\u2019re well fed. Truly gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>While she stroked his head with one hand, Natalie sipped her coffee with the other, marveling that what she\u2019d told him was true. She felt one hundred percent more capable of handling the day than she had when she\u2019d first awakened. She felt almost calm again.</p><p>Or she did until the big animal stiffened, suddenly, and leaped to his feet. Hackles rising, he turned toward her back door, a low, deadly growl rumbling from his throat.</p><p>Wulfe smelled the male before he saw him through the screen door. The fianc\u00e9.</p><p>Instinct, or maybe jealousy, had him growling.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sakes, Natalie,\u201d the man exclaimed. \u201cHe\u2019s a wolf!\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s soft hand slid through the fur on Wulfe\u2019s neck. If he were a cat, he\u2019d be purring. Deep inside, the wolf animal spirit that had marked him howled with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dog and a friend. He won\u2019t hurt me, Rick.\u201d</p><p>Hell no, he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. He\u2019d kill anyone who tried to hurt her. He\u2019d just come to check on her, to make sure she was okay after all she\u2019d gone through in Harpers Ferry. Xavier worried about her. They both did.</p><p>His gaze shifted back to the man behind the screen door. The prick just stood there, making no move whatsoever to protect his female. And, okay, that wasn\u2019t entirely fair since Wulfe had made it more than clear he wouldn\u2019t hurt the female. And more than clear he didn\u2019t like the male. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t like him. He just didn\u2019t like it that, standing there in nothing but boxers, the male had almost certainly come from Natalie\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cNatalie, please. Come inside? You said you didn\u2019t want to talk about it last night, but we need to. I feel like I\u2019m losing you.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe felt Natalie\u2019s tension through her hands, and it was all he could do not to growl at the fianc\u00e9 again because he really, really wanted the man to go away and let him enjoy these few minutes with Natalie. He loved having her hands on him, even if it was just in his furred state. Only in his dreams was he free to touch her back. Not only was she engaged to the prick, but Wulfe would scare her half to death if he revealed his human face. So he\u2019d take what he could.</p><p>It was so good to see her again, to smell her sweet scent and to drown, even for a few moments, in those calm gray eyes. She was so lovely, the morning sun turning her hair a bright gold, bathing her entire body in rich color. Even with his wolf\u2019s far-less-color-sensitive eyesight, he could see the sun\u2019s light creating the illusion of an aura\u2014gold, blue, and green.</p><p>\u201cNat, I understand you\u2019ve been through hell. I know you\u2019re grieving for your brother and your friends. I\u2019m trying to be here for you, but you\u2019re shutting me out.\u201d</p><p>Still, she didn\u2019t answer, but Wulfe had a front row view of her expression, and he saw the sorrow in her eyes. The sadness. And his heart gave a painful squeeze.</p><p>Finally, with a sigh, Natalie rose. \u201cGo home, boy.\u201d</p><p>Instead, he sat, staking a claim, though on what . . . or who . . . he wasn\u2019t sure. Natalie was not his.</p><p>With a wry smile, Natalie stroked his head, then brushed past him and walked inside, closing the screen door. As Wulfe watched, she pressed her palms to the other man\u2019s face, filling Wulfe with a sharp, piercing jealousy.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Rick. I just need time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different, Nat.\u201d</p><p>Mentally, Wulfe blinked. She was different. And not in the way her fianc\u00e9 meant. That sunrise glow\u2014the gold, green, and blue aura\u2014had followed her inside. Even out of the sunshine, it clung to her flesh, bright against the dark shadows of her living room.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Natalie dropped her gaze to the other man\u2019s bare chest. \u201cRick . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019d be different, too, if you\u2019d lost days, and friends. If your brother was missing.\u201d She looked up, meeting the man\u2019s gaze. \u201cI have dreams . . . the most terrifying dreams. Sometimes I think I\u2019m beginning to remember some of it, but the things I remember . . . aren\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe gave a loud mental groan. The last thing they needed was for Natalie Cash to remember seeing shape-shifters and wraith Daemons and the inside of Feral House. Not that she\u2019d be able to find it. Probably. And not that anyone else would believe her. Still . . .</p><p>\u201cNat, if you remember something, you have to tell the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just dreams, Rick.\u201d</p><p>The man ran a frustrated hand through his hair, mussing it even more, then held out that hand to her. \u201cCome back to bed, Natalie.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Wulfe thought she\u2019d say no. Instead, she turned back to the screen door, to him, that odd aura clinging to her. \u201cGo home, boy.\u201d</p><p>Was he really seeing something, or were the changes that had been coming over him of late affecting his vision, now, too? Maybe it was just his wolf\u2019s eyesight that was affected, but he couldn\u2019t very well shift to human form to check. Not when his clothes were in his truck on the other side of the woods.</p><p>With a growl of frustration, he leaped off the deck and headed back into the trees. Natalie\u2019s odd glow was probably just a factor of his own vision\u2014either a side effect of the Ferals\u2019 endangered immortality, or the Daemon blood within his own heritage that had begun to stir to life.</p><p>But his gut gnawed at him, the possibility raising its head that she really was glowing. That perhaps she\u2019d been changed in some way by the Daemon who\u2019d attacked her six weeks ago. He needed to get someone out here to take a look at her without alarming anyone. Because if Natalie Cash had been changed, and the humans started to see it, she could endanger the anonymity of the immortal races. Which could endanger her life.</p><p>Hell. She didn\u2019t deserve this.</p><p>Leaping over a rotting log, he ran through the woods, his wolf\u2019s paws quick and sure. The forest scents played in his senses, the smell of moss and leaves, of rabbit and spring dawn, pleasing the animal. But his mind remained firmly on Natalie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d first met her on that field of battle where the evil Mage had captured her and her friends to use as Daemon bait. He\u2019d noticed her because she was pretty, but also because her stoicism in the face of such horror had drawn his respect. In the end, only three of the six humans had survived, and the Ferals had taken them back to Feral House and locked them up until they could steal their memories of all they\u2019d seen. They\u2019d only succeeded with the two women, and had subsequently sent them home. But Xavier was blind, and memories were stolen through the eyes. He could never go home again. And Natalie could never know that her brother remained alive. No one could.</p><p>Her grief made Wulfe ache.</p><p>Clearing the woods on the other side, he loped down the hillside to the deserted warehouse outside Frederick, Maryland, where he\u2019d parked his truck. Sending his wolf\u2019s senses outward, he reassured himself no humans lurked about, then shifted, calling on the power of the animal spirit that lived within him to change back into a man in a rush of joy and sparkling colored lights. The June morning was warm, the birds twittering in the trees above as the sun slowly rose in the east.</p> <p>As he rounded the cab to fetch his clothes out of the open bed, he caught a glimpse of himself in the window\u2014the crooked nose set among nearly two dozen scars, one of which slashed across his mouth, tugging his lip downward, giving him the appearance of a perpetual scowl. His was a face that made women scream, a face that sent children running into the night.</p><p>With a sigh, he tugged on his jeans. He hadn\u2019t always been this way, of course. Centuries ago, in his youth, women had sighed over his beauty, claiming him the most handsome of males. At seven feet tall, he\u2019d towered over his competition in every way. Despite that, he\u2019d never thought himself vain or arrogant, which in hindsight had probably been the height of conceit. The fates had punished him for his hubris. In a single day he\u2019d lost it all\u2014his looks, the admiration of his peers, his self-respect. The goddess had, in her terrible wisdom, declared his soul flawed, then marked him so that everyone would know it. Marks he\u2019d carried for centuries now, and would for the rest of his immortal life.</p><p>He shrugged into his T-shirt, then pulled on his boots. At least the wolf animal spirit hadn\u2019t found him lacking. Three years after the scarring, the sole wolf shifter had died, and he\u2019d been marked to be the next. It was said that the animal spirit always chose the individual it considered to be the strongest and most honorable among those of the Therian race that still possessed wolf-shifter DNA. So Wulfe had learned to give thanks for the goddess\u2019s painful lesson. He\u2019d been taught a terrible humility, then been rewarded for embracing it.</p><p>The lesson had been a steep price to pay, but he\u2019d pay it again a hundred times over if it meant remaining a Feral Warrior, one of only a handful of shape-shifters left in the world. At the moment, the Ferals were all that stood between the races of the Earth, both immortal and human, and destruction by the Daemons, if the soulless Mage succeeded in freeing the fiends, as they were determined to do.</p><p>Wulfe dug his keys out of the pocket of his jeans and let himself into the cab.</p> <p>If only he could keep Natalie safely out of this war. But the way she was glowing . . .</p><p>He shook his head, his heart heavy as he started the truck and headed home to Feral House.</p><p>Natalie Cash wasn\u2019t safe at all.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Wulfe pulled his truck into the wide circular drive of Feral House in Great Falls, Virginia. The three-story brick mansion was set among the trees in this upscale neighborhood near the Potomac River a dozen miles outside of Washington, D.C. Vehicles lined the drive, the house itself overflowing with people now. Lyon had recruited a large contingent of nonshifting immortals, Therian Guards, to back up the Ferals in their rapidly escalating battle to keep the Mage from freeing the Daemons.</p><p>Most of the Therian Guards hailed from the British Isles, and the strongest twenty had been moved into Feral House to help protect the Radiant. They\u2019d quickly filled the extra bedrooms, the rest bunking on sofas and pallets in the living room, media room, and basement. Another 137 took up every spare bed in the local Therian enclaves and in the safe houses dotting the area.</p> <p>While it rankled that the Ferals needed backup, not a one had argued against the move. Not when the enemy had Ferals of his own, now\u2014fully functioning, if evil, immortal shape-shifters\u2014while the original Ferals\u2019 immortality had been badly compromised.</p><p>As Wulfe parked behind Kougar\u2019s Lamborghini, the early-morning sun reflected off the dew still coating the roof shingles, making them sparkle. If only he\u2019d find the mood inside as bright. If only they\u2019d made a breakthrough in finding a way to reclaim their immortality while he was gone. But as he walked through the front door and saw the haggard faces of Tighe and Paenther as the pair descended one of the twin curved stairs that bracketed the huge foyer, that hope was dashed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d Paenther asked, his tone only mildly curious.</p><p>Several men and two women nodded as they passed. He recognized them only because Lyon had made them memorize the faces of the Guards. The house was full of the low murmur of voices, but the Guards were well disciplined and eminently respectful of the Ferals, and the place had not become the madhouse they\u2019d feared. So far, the only real problem had been keeping them all fed.</p><p>\u201cYou went to Frederick, am I right?\u201d Tighe\u2019s short blond hair gleamed brightly beneath the light of the chandeliers as he reached the bottom step and reached out an arm, clasping Wulfe\u2019s at the elbow as their forearms slapped in the greeting of the Ferals.</p><p>Wulfe didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>Paenther greeted Wulfe in the same fashion, his jet-black hair framing a face that looked one hundred percent American Indian, though the warrior was only three-quarters. Slashed across one eye were three long scars, what appeared to be claw marks and were in fact feral marks. Each of the warriors had them somewhere on their bodies, the mark of the animal spirits that lived inside them. Wulfe\u2019s own feral marks were on his forehead above his left eye. But he doubted even his brothers knew that. What were three scars among so many?</p><p>\u201cDid you see Natalie?\u201d Tighe asked. All Wulfe\u2019s brothers knew why he went to Frederick.</p> <p>He opened his mouth to confide what he\u2019d seen, then closed it again. The Shaman would know better than anyone else if there was something wrong with Natalie. Or with him, for that matter. Until that ancient male had a chance to look at her, he\u2019d keep it to himself. The last thing Natalie needed was to be dragged back into his world and this mess, even if the thought of her in his life again sent a thrill of excitement winging through his mind. Xavier seemed content enough helping Pink in the kitchens and remaining a virtual prisoner of Feral House, but Xavier was a rare case. Most humans would never accept imprisonment for a lifetime. And Wulfe didn\u2019t want that for Natalie. If for some reason they couldn\u2019t take her memories and let her go again, she might wind up with the same choice Xavier had been given\u2014life as a servant of the Ferals, or death.</p><p>She had a life, a home, a fianc\u00e9, and he wouldn\u2019t steal those things from her, not if he had any other choice. He prayed that glow had just been his own vision messing with him.</p><p>\u201cI saw her,\u201d Wulfe admitted. \u201cShe\u2019s developed a soft spot for the wolf.\u201d The memory of her sweet smile as she\u2019d greeted him, her soft hands in his fur, tugged the corners of his mouth upward. Until he remembered . . . His mouth turned hard. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of them seemed very happy. He accused her of changing.\u201d</p><p>Paenther snorted. \u201cThe woman went through hell. Of course it changed her.\u201d</p><p>Tighe peered at Wulfe. \u201cIs she starting to remember anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so though she may be reliving some of it in her dreams. But even if she doesn\u2019t remember, she knows her friends are dead. She knows her brother\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she knows something terrible happened during the days she lost.\u201d Paenther\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cSometimes the not knowing is the hardest.\u201d He clasped Wulfe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice of you to keep an eye on her.\u201d Tighe clasped his other shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the Shaman?\u201d Wulfe asked, as Paenther started toward the dining room.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s eyes narrowed. Stripes always saw too much.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still asleep, I imagine,\u201d Kougar said, entering the foyer from a different hallway behind them. \u201cHe and Ariana were up until dawn.\u201d</p><p>Kougar\u2019s mate, Ariana, and the Shaman had been working tirelessly to figure out a way to counter the effects of the dark charm the evil Mage, Inir, had somehow snuck into Feral House, a curse that was rendering them mortal. They\u2019d found the charm\u2014a chunk of crystal of some sort\u2014and destroyed it. But the damage had already been done.</p><p>\u201cAny luck?\u201d Tighe asked.</p><p>Kougar shook his head, not bothering to elaborate as he strode past them, following Paenther down the hallway to the dining room. No elaboration was necessary. How many ways were there to say, We\u2019re fucked?</p><p>As Wulfe moved to follow Kougar, Tighe stopped him with a hand to his arm, his gaze sharp. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, buddy? What\u2019s really going on with Natalie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you quit being so damned perceptive?\u201d Wulfe growled.</p><p>Sympathy tightened Tighe\u2019s expression, but he didn\u2019t give way.</p><p>Wulfe sighed. \u201cShe has an aura, a bright blue, green, and gold one. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, on her or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen auras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Maybe it\u2019s just another of my newly awakened, strange-ass Daemon talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re worried something\u2019s wrong with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Hell, it was twisting his gut in knots.</p><p>Tighe nodded with quiet understanding and clasped his shoulder again. \u201cMaybe we can convince the Shaman to drive out there with us later and take a look at her.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe stiffened. \u201cI\u2019d scare her half to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. She wasn\u2019t scared of you the last time she saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d just been attacked by a Daemon. And she doesn\u2019t remember any of that, now. Or me.\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s expression turned thoughtful. \u201cIt might be safest if the Shaman knocked on her door alone. He can pretend to be a kid selling popcorn or cookies or something. Kids are always coming by here selling popcorn or cookies.\u201d The Shaman might be thousands of years old, but thanks to a Mage attack in his youth, he still looked fifteen.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks, Stripes.\u201d</p><p>Together they headed to the dining room, stepping through the archway into the large, formal room. Around the mammoth dining table sat most of the other Ferals and their wives. Only Lyon was missing. And his mate, their Radiant, Kara.</p><p>Zeeland alone among the Guards sat at the dining table with the Ferals. One of the highest-ranking, he was a close personal friend of a couple of the Ferals. To Wulfe\u2019s knowledge, no one had ever told the other Therian Guards that they weren\u2019t welcome at the main table, but they seemed happy enough out on the patio where the morning sun filtered through the summer trees, or at one of several card tables that had been set up in the open space between the main table and the hallway.</p><p>As Wulfe and Tighe started across the dining room, Tighe\u2019s mate, Delaney, strolled out of the swinging door to the kitchen, a tray of sweet rolls in her hand that she placed on one of the card tables. Seeing Tighe, she smiled and joined them.</p><p>Tighe hooked his arm around her shoulders. \u201cHow\u2019s it going in there?\u201d</p><p>Delaney\u2019s smile turned rueful. \u201cAs well as can be expected with five women and one blind male in the kitchen. Pink\u2019s not happy, but with so many mouths to feed, she needs the extra hands, and she knows it. Some of the Guards have offered to help with the cooking, but that was a complete nonstarter. Pink won\u2019t even let them in the kitchen.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re handling it.\u201d</p><p>Tighe gave her a quick kiss. \u201cDon\u2019t overdo it.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cI may be pregnant, but I\u2019m immortal, now, remember?\u201d</p><p>Tighe grinned back at his wife. \u201cAnd I thank the goddess every day for that.\u201d</p><p>With a low laugh, Delaney headed back to the kitchen. As Wulfe and Tighe neared the main table, the other Ferals rose, greeting them as if it had been weeks and not hours since they\u2019d seen one another. Humans rarely understood the need that the animals\u2014most of the animals\u2014had for touch. Hawke and Falkyn could take it or leave it, as could Vhyper. But the cats and canines were another matter.</p><p>Despite the warmth of the greeting and the sunshine pouring in through the back windows, the mood in the room felt heavy and thick with frustration. No one at the main table spoke as Wulfe grabbed a plate from the stack in the middle and began stabbing thick slabs of smoked ham off of one of the platters. Out of the corner of his eye, he spied Xavier coming toward the table from the kitchen, a pitcher of juice in one hand, a blind man\u2019s cane in the other. Wulfe\u2019s gut tightened at the sight of Natalie\u2019s brother.</p><p>\u201cThree more steps head-on, X-man,\u201d Jag said.</p><p>Xavier, the only bright spot in the room, grinned and took three more steps. Jag lifted the pitcher out of his hand. \u201cThanks, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cX . . .\u201d Wulfe said, pushing himself from his seat and joining Xavier as the young man made his way back to the kitchen. \u201cI stopped by to check on Natalie this morning.\u201d</p><p>Xavier\u2019s face fell, his expression hiding nothing. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looked good. Her fianc\u00e9 was with her.\u201d Not lies, not really. Natalie had looked lovely. And her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 would probably be fine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad she has someone to help her through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Just thought you\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>The kid grinned. \u201cThanks, dude.\u201d Dude, always dude.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dude.\u201d And now he had them saying it.</p><p>He saw no need to share his worries with Xavier since the kid could never leave Feral House to see his sister again; nor could she ever know he still lived. They occupied two different worlds, now. Xavier and Wulfe one, Natalie the another. It was a fact Wulfe would do well to remember himself.</p><p>Returning to the table, he took his seat across from Fox and his new mate, Melisande, and dug into his meal.</p><p>\u201cEveryone still able to shift?\u201d Paenther asked, his tone nonchalant even as a thread of tension ran through his words.</p><p>It was no idle question. The Ferals had been at war with the Mage pretty much from the dawn of time except for a small period five millennia ago when the two immortal races had pooled their combined power and magic to defeat the High Daemon, Satanan, imprisoning him and his entire Daemon horde in a magical prison, the Daemon Blade. But some years ago, the powerful Mage, Inir, had become infected with a wisp of Satanan\u2019s consciousness left behind all those millennia ago, a consciousness that had grown within Inir until they suspected that Satanan himself now directed the Mage in the battle to free himself and his horde from that blade.</p> <p>The primary thing needed in order to accomplish that was the unanimous consent of all the Feral Warriors, a thing the real Ferals would never give. But Inir had found a way around that. He\u2019d created a small band of evil Ferals, and now slowly destroyed the good ones through the curse that was turning them mortal and would soon, they feared, steal their ability to shift into their animals, if not steal their lives. They suspected that the charm had been made with Daemon magic, the most powerful force on Earth. Unfortunately, none of the usual methods of clearing the magic had worked. All they could do now was search for a cure. And pray they found it in time.</p><p>Wulfe was shoveling his last bite into his mouth when Lyon strolled into the dining room, Kara in his arms, tucked neatly against his chest. Though of average height, the woman looked tiny within the arms of her powerful mate. And very ill thanks to another of Inir\u2019s diabolical attacks. But her arm was hooked around Lyon\u2019s neck, her tired eyes bright with pleasure as she spotted the rest of the Ferals. As one, they rose and went to greet her.</p><p>Wulfe kissed her on the forehead, squeezing her hand, as Kougar patted her knee. One after another, they silently told their beloved Radiant how much they cared until her eyes were shining with unshed tears.</p><p>The Radiant was the one woman in all the world who could pull the energies from the earth that allowed the Ferals to access the power of their animals, to shift. Without that radiance, even without a dark charm fucking up the works, they\u2019d eventually weaken and die, though it would take time\u2014a couple of years.</p><p>But Kara had come to mean far more to them than simply their provider of radiance. Though she\u2019d only been with them a short time, and had come to them believing herself human, she\u2019d proved herself brave and loyal beyond compare, stealing all of their hearts, not just the heart of their chief, to whom she was now mated. If anything happened to her, they would all suffer. Lyon would be destroyed.</p><p>Lyon pressed a kiss to the top of his mate\u2019s head, then joined them at the table, seating Kara to his right.</p> <p>Kara smiled wearily. \u201cI needed a change of scenery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes, no more.\u201d Lyon grabbed a plate. \u201cEggs? You have to eat.\u201d</p><p>Her smile turned soft as her gaze met her mate\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re a tough nurse. But, yes, eggs would be nice.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s eyes filled with such love as Kara\u2019s hand covered his much larger one, that Wulfe almost felt compelled to look away.</p><p>Around the table, the Ferals turned to their wives with a kiss or a touch, all moved by the deep love between their chief and his mate, all sharing the fear that the Ferals\u2019 days were numbered. Only Wulfe and Vhyper remained single, which was a startling change from a year ago, when Wulfe had been the sole mated male. Nine months ago, his mate Beatrice, their previous Radiant, had been killed in a Mage attack. He\u2019d mourned her, of course. Mating bonds between immortals were physical things that, when broken, damaged the one left behind. And he had been damaged in ways he was only beginning to figure out.</p><p>The thing was, as he watched his brothers with their mates, he knew that what he\u2019d had with Beatrice had been pale and thin in comparison. Theirs had been a mating decreed by the goddess, as the Radiant\u2019s mating always was. He\u2019d hoped it would be a good one, like Lyon and Kara\u2019s, but Beatrice had never been able to see past his scars. She\u2019d allowed him to make love to her, but only on occasion, and only in full dark. He\u2019d often suspected she\u2019d fancied herself the Ferals\u2019 queen and he the one designated to serve her sexual needs. But she\u2019d never really wanted him. And he was certain she\u2019d never loved him.</p><p>No, their relationship had not been satisfying to either of them, and while the severing of their mating bond had damaged him, her loss hadn\u2019t crushed him as it should have.</p><p>As his gaze roamed the table, skipping from Hawke\u2019s stroke of Falkyn\u2019s cheek to Paenther\u2019s eyes as he gazed at Skye, to Melisande\u2019s head tipped against Fox\u2019s shoulder and the soft kiss he placed on her crown, he felt an ache deep in his chest. An emptiness. A loneliness that he\u2019d rarely felt so sharply. Because there was a woman that his heart had begun to long for. A human engaged to another. A woman who could not be his.</p> <p>Natalie.</p><p>Jag dropped his fork suddenly, with a startling clatter, his face a mask of alarm.</p><p>Olivia grabbed his hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy animal . . .\u201d He shoved to his feet so fast his chair fell back, slamming against the floor. With quick, hard strides, he moved away from the table, his back to them, ramrod straight, his fists clenched at his sides. Suddenly, he whirled to face them, his face a mask of shock, quickly turning to fury.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fucking shift!\u201d</p><p>The room went silent, even the Guards quieting. As one, the Ferals exchanged glances, the ramification of Jag\u2019s statement rushing over them simultaneously.</p><p>Deep inside, Wulfe\u2019s animal growled as if he understood. And he probably did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s begun,\u201d Kougar murmured.</p><p>They were losing their immortality. Now, their animals.</p><p>Olivia rose and went to her mate, sliding her arms around Jag\u2019s waist as he hauled her close in return.</p><p>Did this mean Jag would be the first to die? Goddess help them all. The moment they were gone, there would be nothing to stop Inir and his evil band of Ferals from freeing the Daemons.</p><p>Paenther asked the question they were all thinking. \u201cMaybe we need to attack Inir\u2019s stronghold while most of us can still shift, Roar.\u201d</p><p>Lyon eyed his second-in-command with a hard sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t considered it. If I really thought we\u2019d never recover, we\u2019d move now, but I refuse to believe that. Attacking fully functioning Ferals as mortals is akin to suicide. And I\u2019m not leading you in there to die. Not if we have any other choice.\u201d</p><p>Kougar leaned back in his chair. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance Ariana has the answers in her head. She just has to find them.\u201d Within the Queen of the Ilinas\u2019 mind was amassed all of the knowledge of the queens who\u2019d come before her. \u201cAs she\u2019s fond of telling me, her personal encyclopedia of knowledge is neither indexed nor easily browsed. But if the answers are in there, Ariana will find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf,\u201d Tighe muttered. \u201cAnd even if she does, will it be in time?\u201d</p><p>Fox rose and strode to Jag, gripping his shoulder, concern etched into the hard planes of his face.</p><p>There were no words of comfort, and they all knew it. Jag might be the first, but the others would follow. If they didn\u2019t find a way to reverse the dark charm\u2019s curse soon, they were all going to die. And Satanan and his terrifying horde would rise.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>After breakfast, Wulfe shifted into his animal and curled up outside the Shaman\u2019s bedroom door so he wouldn\u2019t miss his waking. At half past noon, Wulfe finally heard the Shaman stir, and leaped up. As he trotted back to his own room, he called to Tighe telepathically, a form of communication only possible when one or the other of them was in his animal, and only when they were in relatively close proximity.</p><p>The Shaman\u2019s awake. If he\u2019s willing, do you still want to go with us to Frederick?</p><p>I\u2019ll meet you in the foyer in five, Tighe replied.</p><p>Reaching his bedroom, Wulfe shifted and dressed, and was just striding back down the upstairs hall when the door he\u2019d been lying in front of opened, and the male he\u2019d been waiting for stepped out.</p><p>The Shaman was unique in many ways\u2014more ancient than the pyramids and gifted with an ability to sense magic that most Therians lacked. He looked like a young teenager from a couple of centuries past, his hair long and tied at his nape, his long-sleeved white shirt ruffled. But while his face remained youthful, lacking even the ability to grow a beard, his eyes held an unmistakable wisdom and compassion.</p><p>\u201cShaman, may I have a word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Wulfe. Yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe told him briefly about the odd glow. At the Shaman\u2019s frown, a fist formed in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI need to see her,\u201d the ancient said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bring her here. Can you spare a little time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I would enjoy the drive. The road often clears my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Great. Do you want to eat first?\u201d He was in a hurry to get going . . . it had been hours, but the male deserved to get some lunch if he wanted to.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll stop by Starbucks on the way out, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They found Tighe waiting for them in the foyer, an unopened package of Oreo cookies in his hand. \u201cI told Delaney where we\u2019re going and why,\u201d he said, as the three headed out to Wulfe\u2019s truck. \u201cThey can send Ilinas for us if they need us in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>Ilina travel was a bitch. It might be fast as lightning, since the Ilinas\u2019 natural state was mist, but it was a head-spinning, stomach-turning ride that they\u2019d all rather avoid.</p><p>Wulfe and Tighe piled into the front seats of the truck. As the Shaman climbed in the back, Tighe handed him the Oreos. \u201cWhen we get there, knock on Natalie\u2019s door and tell her you\u2019re selling cookies. Human kids do it all the time.\u201d Tighe glanced at Wulfe ruefully. \u201cDelaney rolled her eyes when I told her the plan. She said brownies sell cookies. What the hell does that mean? When I asked if we had any brownies, D just laughed and waved me out of the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got to be a human thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d Tighe glanced at him carefully. \u201cAny chance what you saw at Natalie\u2019s has something to do with your Daemon blood?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s entire body went tense, the question hanging in the air like a rancid thought. \u201cMaybe. Hell if I know.\u201d The evidence kept growing that he really did have Daemon blood, but he sure as fuck wasn\u2019t accepting that gracefully. Daemons, the most evil, vile creatures to roam the Earth, and he was one of them? Okay, maybe not entirely. Any Daemon ancestor of his had to have lived more than five thousand years ago. Even for an immortal, that had to be generations and generations ago. Still . . . how was he supposed to accept that he was part Daemon?</p><p>He\u2019d thought it just a rumor that his wolf clan was descended from those monsters. He\u2019d never believed it, not for an instant, not until a week ago, when he alone had been able to see the labyrinthine warding Inir had used to protect his stronghold in the mountains of West Virginia\u2014warding riddled with Daemon magic. He alone had been able to get his Feral brothers through the worst of it. And even more damning, he alone had begun to hear Inir and Satanan conversing . . . in Inir\u2019s head. Satanan hadn\u2019t even risen yet. He still only existed within Inir\u2019s body, little more than a wisp of consciousness. Yet, Wulfe continued to hear the two of them chatting from time to time.</p><p>Finally, he\u2019d stopped denying the obvious and accepted that he had Daemon blood. After all, good or bad, it gave him advantages the Ferals needed in this war against Inir, and increasingly, against Satanan himself. Still, what it meant for him in the grander scheme of things, he had no idea. And it was freaking the hell out of him.</p><p>Wulfe turned on the radio to his favorite country-music station, and the three lapsed into silence, each lost to his own thoughts. Twice the Shaman called Ariana, suggesting she research specific events that Wulfe had never heard of\u2014the incarceration of the King of Marck in the Buldane pit, and the plague of Opplomere. As promised, the ride appeared to be helping the Shaman think.</p><p>All it did was make Wulfe more impatient to get back to Natalie.</p><p>They were only a couple of miles outside Frederick when Wulfe began to hear the voices again. The hair rose on his arms.</p><p>If you\u2019d killed the Radiant when you had her, you wouldn\u2019t be having this trouble. You could have simply stolen the new one.</p><p>That\u2019s assuming I could identify the new Radiant and catch her before she reached the Ferals, my lord. An unlikelihood. Besides, I needed the current Radiant to bring my new Ferals into their animals. This will work. We have Radiant\u2019s blood. Just not unascended Radiant\u2019s blood. My sorcerers will find a way to make it what it must be. I\u2019ve already felt the first of the Ferals\u2019 lights go out. One is no longer registering as a shifter. Once the others follow, and we\u2019ve perfected the blood, you and your horde will be freed.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s hands clenched around the steering wheel at the disclosure of Inir\u2019s grand plan. The ritual to free the Daemons required the blood of an unascended Radiant\u2014a newbie, which Kara hadn\u2019t been in months. As long as they kept Kara safe, they\u2019d assumed Inir couldn\u2019t perform the ritual. Apparently, they\u2019d assumed wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWulfe?\u201d</p><p>At the sharp note in Tighe\u2019s voice, Wulfe glanced at his friend.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to snap the steering wheel. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI heard Inir and Satanan again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe told Tighe and the Shaman what he\u2019d heard.</p><p>Tighe growled, pulled out his phone, and called Lyon, relaying the information.</p><p>Wulfe glanced at Tighe when he\u2019d disconnected the call. \u201cWhat did Lyon say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot much. He\u2019s still not giving up on finding the ritual to make us mortal again.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe just hoped they found it in time.</p><p>Minutes later, as they drove slowly past Natalie\u2019s house, Wulfe felt something sigh inside of him. His wolf gave a whine of excitement at the prospect of seeing her again, but both man and animal spirit were going to be disappointed this time. Only the Shaman would be going up to the door.</p><p>Wulfe parked his pickup across the street and turned off the ignition, forcing himself to stay put while the Shaman climbed out of the truck and crossed the street, cookies in hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s home?\u201d Tighe asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve wasted two hours if she isn\u2019t. It\u2019s Sunday. Xavier says she\u2019s an optometrist with a practice in town. Sunday and Monday are her days off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be running errands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be doing any of a hundred things.\u201d</p><p>They were both watching the Shaman ring the doorbell, neither paying any attention to the conversation, which had devolved quickly.</p><p>Be home, Natalie. He needed the Shaman to tell him that she was fine. Please let her be fine. She deserved that, deserved a life without the threat of Daemons though if the Ferals didn\u2019t find a way to stop Inir, all humans would soon know that terror.</p><p>The door opened. Wulfe\u2019s heart began to thud in his chest. Natalie. She stood in the doorway in a pair of white shorts that accentuated her long, long legs, and a soft blue T-shirt that highlighted the blues and greens in her shockingly bright aura. At least he knew it hadn\u2019t been a trick of his wolf\u2019s eyesight. Dammit.</p><p>Tighe whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s some glow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear as day.\u201d</p><p>Crud. Strike two. He\u2019d really hoped it was him.</p><p>As he watched, the Shaman reached out his hand as if to shake hers. Natalie looked bemused, but she shook the proffered hand with a friendly smile. Probably, human children didn\u2019t shake hands with their cookie customers. A moment later, she turned away but didn\u2019t close the door, and the Shaman continued to stand there. When she returned, she handed the Shaman what appeared to be a few dollars and he, in turn, handed her the Oreos, shook her hand again, and turned away.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Wulfe demanded as the ancient male climbed into the truck a minute later.</p><p>\u201cI sense Daemon energy though what that means, I do not know. It may be a lingering effect of the energy all of you were exposed to on the battlefield in Harpers Ferry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen all three of the humans who survived that battle might have been affected. Xavier hasn\u2019t shown any signs of it, yet,\u201d Wulfe said.</p><p>Tighe grunted. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to send someone to check on the screamer.\u201d The teen, Christy, had done little but scream the entire time she\u2019d been in their prison. \u201cCan we leave Natalie in the human world looking like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so,\u201d the Shaman said. \u201cFew humans can see auras. But someone should keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe eyed him sharply.</p><p>The Shaman held up his hand. \u201cJust keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>Tighe glanced over, met Wulfe\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt might be safer to bring her back to Feral House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word left his throat like a shot. Lyon would only command her locked up in their prisons again. While the Ferals never took human life without reason, Daemon energy might be deemed reason enough. He wouldn\u2019t risk it. \u201cShe stays here.\u201d</p><p>Tighe nodded, sympathy in his eyes as if he\u2019d heard the thoughts rolling through Wulfe\u2019s head.</p><p>Wulfe turned to the Shaman. \u201cHow do we cure her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d The Shaman sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Wulfe. My expertise is Mage magic, not Daemon.\u201d</p><p>Tighe reached over and clasped Wulfe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve had worse assignments than keeping an eye on a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>In truth, there was nothing he\u2019d enjoy more than watching over this woman even if he\u2019d have to remain in his animal to do it. \u201cI wonder if she\u2019ll let a wolf in the house,\u201d he mused. It might be worth a try. Tonight, he\u2019d find out.</p><p>When they got back to Feral House, Tighe took him aside. \u201cBe careful, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe lifted a brow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, you\u2019re strung tight about this. I knew you had a soft spot for her, but I think it\u2019s more than that. A lot more.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. She belongs to another male, and even if she didn\u2019t, my severed mating bond has screwed me up good.\u201d Not to mention, he didn\u2019t know what in the hell was going on with his Daemon blood. He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d never pursue her.\u201d</p><p>Deep inside, his wolf whined unhappily.</p><p>Tighe nodded. \u201cIt would be best if you kept your distance. Then maybe, when this is over, you can forget about her.\u201d</p><p>That was just it, though. He couldn\u2019t forget about her. Not for one damned minute.</p><p>Tighe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, humans don\u2019t live long, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe snorted. \u201cThe way things are going, neither do we.\u201d</p><p>But he understood Tighe\u2019s concern, and he shared it. The last thing he wanted or needed was to have his heart ripped out of his chest in fifty or sixty years\u2014a blink of an eye if he managed to get his immortality back. Because fifty or sixty years was all Natalie had. Maybe far, far less.</p><p>The rain started just as Wulfe pulled to a stop behind the deserted warehouse. It was early evening, approaching sunset, though the sun was hidden behind thick rain clouds. He turned off the ignition and climbed out, tossing his keys beneath the vehicle so the rain didn\u2019t ruin the electronics. Stripping, he shoved his boots and clothes into the backseat, then locked the doors and shifted into his wolf.</p><p>A thrill of pleasure snaked its way through him as he reflected on the fact that Lyon had officially given him the job of keeping an eye on Natalie Cash. Unfortunately, there was really nothing else for him to do. Not unless word came of another newly marked Feral for them to hunt down and throw in the prison beneath Feral House. Or they got a lead on the two escaped new Ferals, Grizz and Lepard.</p><p>Wulfe trotted through the woods, the rain soaking his fur and his mood, because there was zero chance Natalie would come out to see him this time, and slim to no chance she\u2019d let a soaking-wet wolf into her house. Otherwise, he didn\u2019t mind the rain. The day had been warm, and the cool rain felt good against his hide.</p><p>They\u2019d tracked down the screamer, Christy, without much trouble and confirmed that she had no odd glow. Nor did Xavier. Which meant that whatever was going on with Natalie was hers alone.</p><p>Inside, his wolf gave a howl of misery. Neither man nor animal spirit liked it, not one bit.</p><p>As he reached the edge of the woods, he eyed the house with the yellow siding that he knew to be hers. The kitchen light was on, but he couldn\u2019t see any sign of Natalie. Wait. There she was. She crossed the kitchen, the overhead light turning her hair to gold. His stomach did a little flip, but as he sat on the wet ground, the rain splattering against his snout, his heart felt heavy in his chest.</p><p>Natalie had already been through so much, even if she didn\u2019t remember most of it. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be in danger anymore, yet in his gut he felt it circling around her. The need to protect her clawed at his insides.</p><p>Somehow, he had to get her to let him in.</p><p>As the rain pattered against her kitchen windows, Natalie dropped the last teaspoonful of apple-spice cookie dough onto the baking sheet in front of her, slipped the cookie sheet into the oven, and set the timer. Baking had always been her comfort activity, that and work, and both were getting her through now. In the month since the incident, she\u2019d made a dozen cakes, two dozen pans of brownies, and at least sixteen different cookie recipes. Her neighbors were starting to complain that she was trying to fatten them up, but she had to do something with the fruits of her crisis since she ate few sweets herself.</p><p>And there was no doubt she was in crisis. Especially after this morning.</p><p>Leaning back against the kitchen counter, she wrapped her arms around herself and closed her eyes, fighting back the thoughts that constantly flayed her\u2014the days she had no memory of, the police investigation that continued to go nowhere. And the pounding, grinding grief. The police believed Xavier was dead, and she refused to accept that, but where was he?</p><p>She blinked back the tears that burned her eyes and turned to the sink to wash her mixing bowls. Her gaze caught on the package of Oreos, drawing a bemused smile and a disbelieving shake of her head. What had made the teen come to her door selling store-bought cookies? He\u2019d almost certainly been up to something though she hadn\u2019t sensed anything malicious. She\u2019d detected a faint accent in his voice, so perhaps he\u2019d been an immigrant or exchange student looking for a little extra cash and going about it in an odd way. Or he might have been a drama student having a little lighthearted fun with her. She probably wouldn\u2019t have actually bought the cookies, but she\u2019d always been very, very good at reading eyes, and in his she\u2019d seen a wealth of kindness.</p><p>She loved looking at people\u2019s eyes. Perhaps because she was an optometrist. Or maybe that was part of the reason she\u2019d become an optometrist in the first place. She\u2019d never been entirely sure. But from the day her youngest brother had been born blind, she\u2019d been fascinated with eyes.</p><p>Oh, Xavier, how I miss you.</p><p>The ache beneath her breastbone pulsed so harshly it nearly doubled her over, the grief overwhelming her in that instant. Breathe. Just breathe.</p><p>Slowly, she pushed past it and began to clean up the kitchen. By the time she was done, the smell of freshly baking cookies filled the air but did little to tempt her. After what had happened this morning, her appetite was well and truly gone. She\u2019d done the right thing, she knew that. But never in her life had she felt so alone.</p><p>If only her mom were in town. Picking up the phone, she made the call she\u2019d been putting off all day.</p><p>\u201cNatalie,\u201d her mother said, her voice breathless with both hope and dread as it always was these days. \u201cAny news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot about Xavier.\u201d If only she had some good news to share. \u201cRick and I called off our engagement this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . honey.\u201d</p><p>Natalie could hear the scrape of a kitchen chair against tile and imagined her parent sinking onto it, gripping the table unsteadily against this latest blow. The unmistakable sound of sobs filled her ear, and she closed her eyes, wishing she\u2019d been able to deliver this blow in person instead of over the phone. But her mom was in Birmingham, visiting her sister, and planned to stay there another week. Someone was bound to break the news to her long before that if Natalie didn\u2019t tell her first.</p><p>\u201cNat?\u201d Aunt Deb\u2019s voice rang in her ear suddenly. \u201cDid they find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I broke up with Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God. The way your mom collapsed I was certain they\u2019d found Xavier\u2019s remains.\u201d</p><p>Natalie cringed at Deb\u2019s frank talk. And then her mom was back on the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhy, honey? Why now? You need him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d How could she explain that the relationship had become strained? That as patient and understanding as Rick tried to be, she found little comfort in his presence. He reminded her too much of her life before. And perhaps the real clincher was that she sensed he was working too hard to be patient. He was a good guy, there was no doubt about it. But he missed the old Natalie. He wanted her back. And that woman was gone for good.</p><p>He\u2019d stayed over last night, and they hadn\u2019t even made love. She hadn\u2019t been in the mood. She was never in the mood anymore. Rick hadn\u2019t complained, not about that. He rarely complained about anything, but she\u2019d seen the frustration in his eyes. Finally, as he\u2019d dressed to leave, she\u2019d suggested they call off the wedding. Rick had nodded, sadly, as if he\u2019d been thinking the same.</p><p>\u201cI need time, Rick,\u201d she\u2019d said as she handed him back her engagement ring. \u201cI just need some time alone.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d looked at the ring sadly. \u201cIf I were the right man for you, Nat, it would be me you needed.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been able to argue.</p><p>She gave her mom the shortened version, which set off another round of sobs. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, Mom,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThe oven timer\u2019s about to go off. Give Aunt Deb my love.\u201d</p><p>In a way, she envied her mother for getting away. A change of scenery would do her good, too. But she had her practice and a full schedule of patients to see this coming week, and for now that would have to be enough. One foot in front of the other. Just keep moving. There was little else she could do except pray that someday the ache would ease enough that she\u2019d be able to breathe again.</p><p>As she pulled the cookie sheet out of the oven, she heard the low bark of a big dog at her back door. Her mind flashed immediately to her canine buddy and she found a smile pulling at the corners of her mouth at the thought that he\u2019d come to see her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laying the cookie sheet on the stove, she pulled off her oven mitt and hurried to the sliding door to look out. Sure enough, he was sitting in the rain, looking up at her with a hopefulness she could practically feel through the glass. Poor guy. He was soaking wet.</p><p>She hesitated to let him in\u2014surely he belonged to someone in the neighborhood. But why would anyone who loved him let him out to roam in weather like this? He shouldn\u2019t be off a leash at all, especially not looking like a monster-sized wolf.</p><p>\u201cHold on, boy,\u201d she called through the door, then ran back to her laundry room, where she kept a stack of old towels. Grabbing two fraying bath towels, she laid one on the carpet, then opened the door just enough to let the massive animal in, braced for the invariable dash and shake.</p> <p>To her surprise, he didn\u2019t bound inside, nor did he shake at all. Instead, he walked forward calmly onto the towel, and stopped, watching her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d She closed the door behind him, then opened the second towel and rubbed him down. \u201cSomeone\u2019s trained you well.\u201d</p><p>The dog looked up, meeting her gaze with a look in his eyes that she could swear was amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re way too smart for your own good, aren\u2019t you, boy?\u201d She knelt in front of him, rubbing down his head and neck, watching the pleasure fill those beautiful eyes. Oddly, he didn\u2019t even try to lick her face, which most dogs did given the opportunity. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the gentleman.\u201d She dried his legs and his belly, then finished with a quick rub of his tail.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have any dog food, but I have leftovers from dinner. How about chicken and green beans? That shouldn\u2019t be too terrible for you. I\u2019ve also got cookies. Do you have a sweet tooth, boy?\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he shook his head . . . or appeared to. She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re really something.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled a wide, shallow plastic food storage container out of the cupboard, then cut up the leftover chicken and green beans and heated them in the microwave just enough to take off the chill. After pouring the mixture into the plastic container, she set it on the floor in the corner.</p><p>The big animal looked up at her with an unmistakable gleam of thanks in his eyes, then turned to the food and wolfed it down while she filled another container with water.</p><p>She picked up the cake recipe she\u2019d thought to make tonight, but no longer felt driven to continue her baking and set it down again. The animal\u2019s presence had calmed her, pulling her back from that edge of desperation that always drove her to bake.</p><p>Maybe, instead, she\u2019d try to get some work done. While the dog ate, Natalie grabbed her laptop off the counter and settled on the floral-patterned sofa in her small family room. As she pulled up the file of the first patient she saw on Friday, and the results of the vision tests she\u2019d run on the girl, the tension began to ease out of her shoulders. For the first time all day, she felt like she could breathe freely again. This was what she\u2019d been born to do. It was no wonder, considering she had two younger brothers whose lives had been handicapped by their eyes\u2019 inability to function optimally, if at all. Her youngest brother, Xavier, had been born blind, but it was James, only two years her junior, who\u2019d actually had the hardest time thanks to a pair of undiagnosed vision problems that had made it next to impossible for him to learn to read.</p><p>By the time James was seen by a developmental optometrist, a specialist who could actually help him, he\u2019d been a freshman in high school, and it had been too late. When she thought back on it, she wanted to shake their family eye doctor who\u2019d seen him every couple of years throughout his childhood, who\u2019d assured her mom that there was nothing wrong with James\u2019s eyes, that James could read if he wanted to. And while, technically, he was right\u2014there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with his eyes\u2014his brain could never make sense of what he saw because he wasn\u2019t able to track smoothly across the page or keep from seeing everything slightly double.</p><p>Finally, one of his teachers talked her mom into taking him to a vision specialist, but by then James was convinced he was a dull-witted loser and refused the recommended therapy that could have corrected both problems. Though they didn\u2019t know it at the time, he\u2019d already found drugs and alcohol. A year later, he dropped out of school and took off. The last time they\u2019d heard from him, he was living in Florida and had been in and out of rehab repeatedly.</p> <p>While she\u2019d love to find a way to open, quite literally, the eyes of the eye-care establishment as a whole to the benefits of vision therapy, she\u2019d settle for helping the kids she could. No child should be made to feel stupid because of an undiagnosed vision problem.</p><p>James had been lost to them for years and now Xavier was gone, too. The ache in her heart was sometimes so sharp, she thought it might rupture that critical organ. She couldn\u2019t imagine how much harder this all was on her mom.</p><p>The dog trotted through the kitchen, his nails clicking on the linoleum, then padded silently across the carpeted family room to join her.</p><p>Natalie smiled. \u201cAll through?\u201d</p><p>He sat at her feet, then leaned forward to rest his chin on the cushion, pressing against her thigh, as if thanking her. Her heart swelled with adoration. As he looked up at her with soft, liquid eyes, she knew she was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your family, boy?\u201d She ran her hand over his head, stroke after stroke, as those liquid eyes watched her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have one, you can live here.\u201d</p><p>The words were out before she really thought them through, though it wasn\u2019t like he could possibly have understood her. She didn\u2019t have time for a dog. Still, the thought of his waiting for her at night made something stir inside of her, an excitement and longing for companionship that she hadn\u2019t felt in weeks.</p><p>\u201cSince you can\u2019t tell me your name, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to give you a new one. What do you think of King?\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a disgusted snort and she laughed. \u201cOkay, not King. How about Bruiser?\u201d</p><p>He looked away as if he couldn\u2019t bear it, making her grin.</p><p>\u201cNot Bruiser, then. I\u2019m half tempted to call you Wolf, but the neighbors might think you really are one, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>But at the sound of the name, he lifted his head expectantly and barked once, low.</p><p>\u201cYou like Wolf?\u201d</p><p>He barked again, his eyes all but laughing at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Wolf it is. Did someone already give you that name? It certainly fits.\u201d She stroked his big head again. Would he be happy here while she was at work all day? Did she really want responsibility for an animal? This animal?</p><p>Staring into those kind, intelligent eyes, she knew there was nothing she wanted more.</p><p>Her hand sunk into the fur beneath his ear as she stroked his neck. \u201cI\u2019d be honored if you chose to live with me, Wolf, but I understand that you may already have a family. Regardless, you\u2019re welcome to visit me anytime.\u201d</p><p>As Natalie returned to her work, Wolf curled up on the carpet at her feet, a warm, welcome presence. She\u2019d worked for nearly an hour when Wolf suddenly leaped to his feet, baring his teeth, a low growl rumbling deep in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, boy? What do you hear?\u201d</p><p>The animal met her gaze as if he understood every word she uttered. In those dark eyes, she could swear she read indecision, as if he felt torn between investigating and protecting her. What a wonderful dog.</p><p>She placed her laptop on the sofa beside her and rose. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll investigate together.\u201d</p><p>But he stepped in front of her, blocking her path.</p><p>\u201cWolf, move.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at her, his eyes stubborn and determined, and damn if he didn\u2019t shake his head again. Which was impossible. He was a dog.</p><p>But when she tried to push him out of her way, he refused to budge.</p><p>\u201cWolf . . .\u201d</p><p>She heard a bang at the front door, as if someone had thrown something against it. Or kicked it. A moment later, her front door splintered and crashed back against the wall. Shock reverberated through her body, her heart leaping with terror because she knew . . . she knew . . . that whatever malevolent force had killed her friends and stolen her brother, had come for her again.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Wulfe growled low in his wolf\u2019s throat as the first of the Mage sentinels came charging into Natalie\u2019s family room, sword drawn, triumph on his face, and violence in his eyes.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s mind roared with fury that they violated Natalie\u2019s house, that they threatened her safety, even as he thanked the instincts that had driven him to check on her this morning. What if he\u2019d waited until tomorrow morning, then arrived to find her missing? Or dead.</p><p>The thought barreled through him, lending furious power to his hind legs as he leaped at the first of the bastards, crushing the Mage\u2019s skull between his powerful jaws. The last thing he wanted was for Natalie to witness any more violence, but . . . no . . . the last thing he wanted was for her to become a victim of it herself. If that meant forcing her to watch him take out her attackers, so be it. He could always clear her memory of the sight later. He hoped.</p><p>A second Mage intruder rushed into the room, and a third, and a fourth, all dressed in the tunics of Inir\u2019s sentinels. Why were they here? Was it because of her glow?</p><p>Wulfe leaped for another of the Mage, killing him, too, as a blade tore through his shoulder from behind. Not good, not when he wasn\u2019t healing much better than a mortal these days. Fire licked through his muscles, the pain radiating down his limb. Son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t hurt him!\u201d</p><p>As Wulfe turned to tear off the hand of the Mage who\u2019d stabbed him, he saw Natalie grab the wooden lamp off the end table, rip off the shade, and swing it upside down as if she planned to use it as a weapon. Admiration and terror rushed through him in equal measure because she was going to get herself killed.</p><p>Not if he took care of these bastards first.</p><p>He lunged for the next of the Mage, going for his throat. As the pair crashed to the floor, half a dozen more ran into the room, swords drawn, eyes blank. Soulless.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill them,\u201d one commanded. \u201cInir wants them alive.\u201d</p><p>Them? There was no doubt that Inir . . . or Satanan . . . had felt Wulfe\u2019s presence, and his Daemon essence, before. On the mountain, he\u2019d heard Satanan say, I sense one of mine. Blood calls to blood.</p><p>Hell, the Mage might have followed him here. He might have inadvertently led them right to Natalie.</p><p>He leaped for another Mage, taking him down, then scrambled out of the reach of grasping hands to attack another and another, taking three more blades to the shoulders and side.</p><p>In his peripheral vision, he saw Natalie swing her lamp at one of the two Mage who\u2019d cornered her, cracking it against his shoulder. But before she could pull her makeshift weapon back for another swing, the second of her stalkers seized it, wrenched it from her grasp, and grabbed her.</p><p>Instantly, she stilled, and Wulfe knew she\u2019d been enthralled. She wouldn\u2019t remember anything more of this fight. But they weren\u2019t taking her. Over his dead body would they take her.</p><p>In a spray of sparkling lights, he shifted to human form, swiped one of the dead Mage\u2019s swords off the bloody carpet, then ripped the blade out of another of his attacker\u2019s hands. Swinging two blades at once, he took on the remaining Mage. The Ferals avoided killing Mage whenever possible since Mother Nature took their deaths so personally, but he didn\u2019t have a choice this time. It was either kill them or escape, but with Natalie enthralled, he\u2019d have to remain human in order to sling her over his shoulder and run. Unfortunately, the draden would almost certainly find him before he could reach his truck and safety, and he\u2019d be forced to shift back to wolf or die, simply delaying the inevitable fight to the death with the Mage. Better to do it here, now. Mother Nature was just going to have to be pissed.</p><p>One by one, his attackers died beneath his blades. Outside, the wind began to howl like a freight train bearing down on the house. By the time only two Mage remained, his opponents circling him, his vision was beginning to waver, his arms starting to feel like anvils thanks to the stab wounds that still bled freely. If he didn\u2019t kill these last two quickly, it would be too late. For both him and Natalie.</p><p>As they leaped at him, carving slices into his side and thigh, Wulfe called on the last of his considerable reserves and took them on with desperate efficiency, hacking, stabbing, until only one remained.</p><p>Wulfe faced the last of the sentinels sent to attack them, the leader of the band. Fury tore through him, fury that these soulless monsters had followed him here. Here. That they\u2019d desecrated the home of one of the brightest spirits Wulfe had ever encountered and threatened her life. Inside, his animal gave a furious growl.</p><p>Fangs sprouted from his mouth, claws erupted from his fingertips, and he went feral, that place halfway between man and beast. As the sentinel lunged at him with his sword, Wulfe cut off the bastard\u2019s remaining hand. The last thing Wulfe needed was to become enthralled, too.</p><p>Digging his claws into the sentinel\u2019s neck, he slammed him against the nearest wall. \u201cWhat does Inir want with us?\u201d</p><p>Real fear shone in those soulless eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Our orders were to capture you both and bring you in.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe believed him. With one clawed hand, he ripped out the Mage\u2019s heart, then dropped it to the floor, along with his body. A harsh wave of dizziness rolled across his vision, and he sank back against the wall, sweat rolling down his temples, blood down his chest.</p><p>A gust of wind blew through the house, whipping the curtains and scattering papers every which way. Hail pounded against the siding and windows. He needed to get Natalie out of here before Inir sent more men, which he\u2019d undoubtedly do when this batch failed to return. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His head felt helium-light, his shoulder as heavy as burning iron as he pushed away from the wall to search for a phone. If he could get ahold of Feral House, his brothers would send Ilinas to pick them up. He\u2019d be home, with Natalie, within seconds.</p><p>He spied a cell phone on the kitchen counter, but when he turned it on, he found it password protected. Hell. And he saw no sign of a kitchen phone.</p><p>The lights flickered and died, casting him into a darkness broken only by the lightning that slashed across the sky every few seconds. He turned back to find Natalie standing as if frozen, right where the Mage had left her. Enthralled. His heart cramped at all she\u2019d seen, at all she\u2019d endured . . . again. She\u2019d snap out of the enthrallment in an hour or two, maybe less. Until then, they were trapped here. And he desperately needed to lie down and give his body a chance to start the healing process.</p> <p>He was afraid he might pass out, and the last thing he wanted was Natalie waking to this scene of carnage. As a warrior, he\u2019d become far too used to such sights, but although Natalie had seen worse\u2014she\u2019d watched her own friends die\u2014she didn\u2019t remember. The least he could do was get rid of the bodies, or at least move them out of her sight until they disintegrated in a few days. The basement would have to do.</p><p>After three tries, Wulfe found the right door, then bent to scoop up the closest body and nearly sank to his knees as pain screamed through his shoulder and side, and weakness tore at his muscles. His vision swam.</p><p>Straightening slowly, he slammed his palm against the wall, willing his vision to clear. When it did, he made his way to Natalie, lifting her carefully. The bodies would have to wait. Clenching his jaw, he made his way slowly up the stairs, Natalie tucked against his chest.</p><p>He was nearly to the second floor when a razor-sharp bite tore into his injured shoulder wrenching a bloodcurdling yell from his throat. Draden. He\u2019d known the little fiends, no bigger than an average man\u2019s fist, would find him sooner or later, drawn to his Therian life force. If he didn\u2019t shift soon, they\u2019d steal it all, killing him. But he couldn\u2019t carry Natalie in his wolf.</p><p>Pushing himself past the point of endurance, he climbed the last couple of steps, sweat rolling down his temples. Another draden found him, then another, and another, all tearing at his flesh until his sight blurred, until it was all he could do to put one foot in front of the other.</p> <p>As he stumbled into the nearest room, a flash of lightning lit the bed and he pushed himself toward it, managing to lower Natalie onto the soft mattress and not . . . quite . . . follow her down. The moment she was out of his arms, he shifted back into his wolf, listening with satisfaction as the draden squawked their anger at the loss of their meal and flew away.</p><p>His vision tilted. If he were still immortal, the weakness would be a temporary thing. But he wasn\u2019t, and there was no telling what would happen.</p><p>Goddess, he had to survive this. He had to. Natalie needed him.</p><p>Lurching toward the bedroom door, he managed to butt it closed with his wolf\u2019s flank, then sink down in front of it, blocking her escape. Hopefully, he\u2019d awaken if she tried to move him.</p><p>Hopefully, he\u2019d awaken again period.</p><p>A loud crack of thunder startled Natalie awake. Lightning flashed across the room and she caught sight of the pictures on the wall.</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I doing in the guest room?\u201d she muttered groggily. Confusion clouded her mind as she sat up and swung her legs over the side of the bed. She reached for the lamp, but though her fingers turned the knob, nothing happened. The electricity was out. And the closest flashlight was in the master bedroom.</p><p>Utterly confused, she pushed to her feet just as another flash illuminated the room and the large dog lying in front of the closed door, his fur caked with . . . blood.</p><p>It all came back in a rush\u2014the men breaking into her house. The dog, Wolf, attacking them . . . killing them . . . as he protected her. She swayed, her forehead heating at the memory of the violence, her stomach lurching. Had he killed them all? Heaven help her, she hoped he had, because they\u2019d stabbed him, over and over, in return.</p><p>Stumbling forward, she sank to her knees on the carpet beside the beautiful animal and reached for him. Please don\u2019t let him be dead. Her palm pressed against the warm fur of his shoulder and felt the steady rise and fall she\u2019d hoped for. Thank God.</p><p>Downstairs, something crashed, stopping her heart. The intruders are still here. Her pulse began to thud hard enough to shake her entire body as she waited for the sound of boots on the stairs, a sound she might not hear over the howling wind and the rain slashing against the windows.</p><p>Lightning again illuminated the dog\u2019s blood-soaked fur. Thunder cracked, startling her out of her momentary paralysis. She had to do something to stop the bleeding, or Wolf was going to die right here, right now. If the intruders broke through the door, so be it. They must know she was up here. Which made no sense.</p><p>Pushing to her feet, she moved quietly to the dresser where she kept the stack of old T-shirts she wore to exercise in. They\u2019d have to do. Grabbing a handful, she sank down beside the animal and whispered softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, boy. This might hurt, but I\u2019ve got to staunch your wounds.\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers pressed gingerly, burrowing through Wolf\u2019s fur, as she sought the site of the stab she\u2019d seen him take to the shoulder. Warm blood coated her fingers and she knew she\u2019d found it. As gently as possible, she pressed one of the shirts against the wound, then started searching for any others.</p><p>\u201cPoor guy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou chose the wrong night to come see me, but you probably saved my life.\u201d She needed to get him to a vet. The beautiful animal made no sound, gave no indication of consciousness. He might be alive, but for how much longer?</p><p>Something skittered across the floor downstairs, stopping her heart for another moment. Why hadn\u2019t they followed her upstairs? For that matter, how in the heck had she fallen asleep on the guest bed in the middle of an attack on her house? None of it made a bit of sense. The last thing she remembered was hitting one of the nasties with the lamp and the other one grabbing her. Had he hit her, then? She didn\u2019t hurt anywhere. Somehow, she must have stumbled up here and passed out.</p><p>As she probed the dog\u2019s side, she felt more warm blood and knew she\u2019d discovered another wound. If only she could see them. If only she had a flashlight. Or . . . a camp lantern. Yes. Her camping supplies were stored in the closet in this room. Rising, she dug the lantern out of the bottom of the closet and turned it on only a little, bathing the injured animal in a soft glow.</p><p>He had blood everywhere. Her gut cramped. How was she supposed to know how much of the blood was his and how much belonged to the men? They\u2019d been dressed so strangely, like some kind of foreign army, in matching blue tunics. And swords.</p><p>She pressed T-shirts against the two wounds she\u2019d found so far, knowing she had to find the others, yet wondering what she was going to do with them if she did. She only had two hands. And no telephone or suturing supplies.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Wolf. Just hang on for me. Sooner or later, they\u2019ll leave, and I\u2019ll be able to get you to a vet. What are they doing down there?\u201d She heard something roll across the hardwood foyer. Roll. Suddenly she remembered the way they\u2019d broken down her front door and relief left her on a hard exhale.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not them, it\u2019s the wind. Of course, of course.\u201d Leaping to her feet, she stroked Wolf\u2019s head. \u201cThis is going to hurt, boy, but I have to move you if I\u2019m going to get you help.\u201d</p><p>She scooted around to his back end and, as gently as she could, lifted his hips and lowered them again a few inches out from the door. Moving to his head, she did the same, back and forth, a few inches at a time until she nearly had him far enough from the door to open it. Once more should be enough.</p><p>Sweat beading on her brow, she took a deep breath, squatted at his tail, and lifted his hips one more time.</p><p>Suddenly, her hands were empty, the dog just . . . gone . . . exploding in a spray of colored lights.</p><p>Natalie fell back, landing on her backside, then stared, jaw dropping, as a man appeared out of thin air . . . a huge, naked man lying on the floor right where the dog had been.</p><p>She crab-walked back, the bed catching her in the shoulder blades. This isn\u2019t happening.</p><p>The man groaned and began to stir. Natalie tensed, her heart pounding violently in her chest as she pushed herself to her feet, then sank onto the bed when her legs refused to hold her.</p><p>Slowly, the man sat up and leaned back against the door, his muscular body marred by half a dozen stab wounds, one on the shoulder . . . right where the dog\u2019s had been.</p><p>This isn\u2019t happening. Dogs don\u2019t turn into men. They don\u2019t!</p><p>But even as the argument roared in her head, her gaze took in the sight in front of her. The man was built, his waist narrow, his abs ripped, his biceps as thick as tree trunks, one adorned with a thick golden armband with what appeared to be the head of a wolf. His shoulders were easily half the width of her sofa. Her gaze continued up, reaching his face, and her heart clenched. Scars crisscrossed the flesh every which way, tugging down one of his lips, cutting across one eye. His body might be prime, but his face was made for nightmares. Within that ruined face, eyelids lifted revealing dark eyes that turned to her, contracting on a sheen of pain, radiating a dismay so raw it almost made her ache.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, Natalie.\u201d His voice was low and urgent as he struggled to his feet, grimacing. Towering over her\u2014he had to be a full seven feet tall\u2014he watched her with eyes filled with the same intelligence, the same gentleness she\u2019d seen in Wolf\u2019s. \u201cI would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking, her pulse racing, her stomach cramping from shock. But not from fear. Because as she stared into those dark eyes, she saw only truth and honor and kindness. And, odd as it was, she recognized the essence of the dog in the man.</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt you,\u201d he said again, his voice throbbing with sincerity and desperation that she believe him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she told him.</p><p>And she did.</p><p>I know.</p><p>Wulfe stared at Natalie, trying to catch his breath through the pain of the wounds that refused to heal, as realization hit him like a sledgehammer. Somehow, he\u2019d shifted back into human form and stood in front of Natalie in all of his scarred, naked glory.</p><p>Goddess, when had he shifted? It couldn\u2019t have been long because the draden had yet to find him again. And they would.</p><p>She stared at him, white as a sheet, clearly in shock.</p><p>I know. He\u2019d promised he wouldn\u2019t hurt her, and she\u2019d replied, I know.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you remember?\u201d He must have failed to take her memories of before or, at the very least, her memories of the small friendship that had bloomed between them in the Feral prison.</p><p>Sitting there, her hands clasped in her lap, she met his gaze with the calm strength he\u2019d come to associate with her despite the fact she was visibly shaking. \u201cI don\u2019t remember much\u2014the men breaking into my house, Wolf attacking them, getting stabbed.\u201d She blanched. \u201cYou.\u201d The word was uttered on an exhale, the last of her color draining away as she doubled over until her head rested on her knees. \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, wanting to go to her, yet afraid he\u2019d scare her more if he tried.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d If only he could see her face. Reaching for his wounded shoulder, he encountered stickiness . . . and pain. The one in his side was the worst, but the Mage swords didn\u2019t appear to have punctured anything vital, or he\u2019d be fighting for his life by now. How did humans stand this . . . this . . . not healing?</p><p>\u201cI feel a little faint.\u201d Natalie slowly lifted her head, then straightened. Her color was back, if only a little, her usual calm cracked, but not shattered. Even in the dark, she shone with a glow that had nothing to do with the unnatural aura. So lovely.</p><p>Her brows drew together. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shape-shifter. Man to wolf.\u201d He reached for the door, feeling exposed, feeling like a monster. \u201cWe need to get out of here, Natalie. Those men were Mage, evil, and their leader is going to send more of them as soon as he realizes the first group failed. They may already be on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll heal.\u201d He hoped.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have clothes to fit you.\u201d She rose unsteadily. \u201cIt\u2019s pouring out there. I could give you a blanket.\u201d</p><p>Something warm and thick moved through his chest. She was worried about his getting wet. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to return to my wolf form in a minute. I can\u2019t remain in human form long at night, not . . .\u201d Not unless he was in his truck or at Feral House or somewhere else that had been warded against the draden. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Natalie. I know this is a lot to take in all at once.\u201d He was a lot to take in, the way he looked, the way he\u2019d killed, right in front of her. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have seen any of this.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, nodding, shadows of the violence she\u2019d witnessed darkening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. But we need to go.\u201d</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not going with you. I can\u2019t. There are . . . dead bodies . . .\u201d Her voice cracked, slicing open his heart. \u201cI\u2019m going to the police.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened at all the reasons that wasn\u2019t going to happen. The last thing they needed was for her to tell the human cops a crazy tale of a shape-shifting wolf, then bring them back to her house to round up all the dead bodies\u2014bodies that would disintegrate suddenly, in a couple of days. Bodies that were not human.</p><p>His hands clenched and unclenched at his sides as he debated how to secure her cooperation. \u201cCome home with me, Natalie. I can give you something the police can\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her expression turned wary, fear alive in those no longer calm, gray eyes. \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze, his mouth twisting in a semblance of a smile. \u201cXavier.\u201d</p><p>Natalie swayed, her heart suddenly in her throat.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he? What have you done to him?\u201d She\u2019d started to trust this man, this . . . werewolf. Was he nothing but a kidnapper? A murderer? \u201cThe week I lost, was I your prisoner, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t hurt you. We let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not Xavier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t take his memories of all he\u2019d seen. We can only take memories through the eyes.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, the sudden feeling washing over her that they\u2019d had this discussion before. \u201cAnd his don\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, Natalie. He\u2019s safe. And he\u2019ll be glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>Safe. How could he possibly be safe? Her pulse raced, her muscles tensing with the need to run. With him injured, she might be able to get away. But what if he was telling the truth? What if he really could take her to Xavier?</p><p>She pressed a trembling palm to her pounding head and met the werewolf\u2019s gaze. The warm light of kindness emanating from his dark eyes slowly burned through her own haze of fear, reminding her why she\u2019d been drawn to the animal in the first place. Despite every logical thing to the contrary, her instincts told her she could trust him. He wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>And she would risk being wrong, risk anything, to reach Xavier.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He watched her for a moment more, then nodded and turned. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave through the front door and circle to the back. I don\u2019t want you having to see . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the lantern. \u201cWhy the backyard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy truck is on the other side of the woods.\u201d</p><p>The wolf always came to her through the woods. He drove a truck? Of course he did.</p><p>The man opened the door. \u201cPack a bag. Quickly. Essentials only, and just for a few days.\u201d</p><p>A bag. With a shake of her head, she focused on that, just that, and slipped past him to run to her bedroom. \u201cDoes Xavier need anything?\u201d she called as she grabbed the small, hard-sided, yellow suitcase out of her closet.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d She turned to find him standing in her doorway, watching her. \u201cWe\u2019d have gotten him anything he asked for. Pink makes the shopping lists, and he\u2019s become her best friend. Fuck.\u201d</p> <p>The man exploded into sparkling lights, and suddenly the wolf was back.</p><p>Pardon my language.</p><p>At the sound of his voice in her head, she met his wolf\u2019s gaze and saw the man\u2019s intelligence and personality in the wolf\u2019s eyes. Chills ran down her arms, making the hair rise. He was speaking to her. Telepathically.</p><p>The draden are back, and I have to stay in my wolf. I\u2019ll explain that later. Pack, Natalie. And change your shirt.</p><p>With a shake to clear her head, she glanced down to find her clothes and arms streaked with blood. For a moment, she just stared. Then, taking a shaky breath, she pulled herself together again. They needed to get out of here quickly, before more of those soldiers came. The thought spurred her to move. Grabbing a clean tee, she ran into the bathroom to change and grab a few toiletries, then packed quickly.</p><p>Feral House is full of women, these days, the wolf said as she added the last items. Most of my brothers are married. If you forget anything, you can borrow it.</p><p>Married werewolves. Her head was going to explode. \u201cHow many of you are there?\u201d</p><p>One wolf shifter. More than a dozen other Ferals . . . shifters . . . each of whom shifts into a different animal. I\u2019ll explain more later.</p><p>So not werewolves. Not exactly.</p><p>She zipped the suitcase, then grabbed the flashlight off the bottom shelf of her nightstand, deciding the lower light would attract less attention. Turning to the wolf, the shape-shifter, she said, \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He rose and trotted to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need my purse. It\u2019s on the desk in the kitchen.\u201d She really wanted her laptop, too, but she was afraid the rain would destroy it.</p><p>I\u2019ll get the purse and your phone. Grab a raincoat. It\u2019s pouring.</p><p>The wolf ran down the stairs ahead of her as the wind and rain blew in through the open front door. By the time Natalie snatched her raincoat out of the coat closet and pulled it on, her pants were already damp. As she turned her back to the buffeting wind to zip up the raincoat, she made the mistake of glancing toward the family room just as another bolt of lightning illuminated the house. Bodies . . . body parts . . . lay everywhere, blood streaking the walls and soaking the carpeting. The sight burned her eyes and made the bile rise in her throat. Swallowing it back down, she spun away.</p><p>Her house was ruined. Her life was in shambles. But Xavier might still be alive. The thought raced through her like a live wire, filling her with hope and excitement, strengthening her against all she\u2019d lost. Because if she could really see him again, if she truly found him safe and well, none of this mattered. None of it.</p><p>Straightening, she pulled up her hood and waited. A moment later, the wolf returned with her purse dangling from his mouth. She took it from him, slung it over her shoulder, and braced herself against the wind as she stepped through the wreckage of the front door and into the driving rain. Without a backward glance, the wolf at her side, Natalie left everything she knew behind.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>As Natalie followed the massive gray wolf around the corner of her house, through her backyard, and into the woods, the wind buffeted her, dragging at the hood of her raincoat. She clung to her suitcase with one hand, her flashlight with the other.</p><p>Her hand shook as she struggled to assimilate all that had happened. How was any of this real?</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d she asked the huge animal, desperate for any pretence of normalcy.</p><p>You already guessed it. I\u2019m Wulfe, spelled W-U-L-F-E. All the Ferals, the shape-shifters, have taken the names of our animals. It\u2019s tradition.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only wolf.\u201d Twigs snapped under her soles, the leaves torn free of the trees flying and swirling around her. The woods smelled of rain and damp fur this night.</p><p>Yes. The others include a tiger, hawk, lion, jaguar, cougar, panther, fox, snake, and falcon. There aren\u2019t many of us anymore. Maybe as many as twenty-six, but that\u2019s it. We\u2019re Therians, a race that used to be all shape-shifters. Five thousand years ago, we were forced to mortgage most of our power to defeat and imprison Satanan and his Daemon horde. When the dust settled, one member each of only a fraction of the animal lines reclaimed the power of their animal and the ability to shift. They banded together and became known as the Feral Warriors, the defenders of the race and the protectors of the Daemon Blade, in which Satanan and his horde are imprisoned.</p><p>He described something from a movie or urban fantasy novel. If she hadn\u2019t seen him shift with her own eyes, she\u2019d never believe any of this. Now, she had no reason to doubt him. Still, despite his fantastical tale, she had more pressing worries.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when the police find the mess in my house, Wulfe? They\u2019re going to think some of that blood was mine.\u201d Her stomach cramped. \u201cMy mother\u2019s going to think she\u2019s lost me, now, too.\u201d</p><p>Once we get a little deeper into the woods, I\u2019ll use your phone to call for cleanup. We can ward the house against intrusion so that no one will see the damage until we have a chance to fix it. The bodies and blood will disintegrate on their own in a few days.</p><p>How could that be? How could any of this be?</p><p>The wind began to die down, the rain changing to a mere drizzle. Ahead, the wolf trotted, favoring one leg.</p><p>\u201cYou need to see a doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cOr a vet.\u201d</p><p>In her head, she heard him chuckle. We have a healer staying with us, now. She\u2019ll be able to help me.</p><p>\u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>A little.</p><p>\u201cDid those soldiers know you were a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>I think so, yes.</p><p>She thought about that, felt relief at his words. \u201cSo they were after you.\u201d</p><p>Yes. They may have been after both of us. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Natalie frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s complicated.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t everything? Did you . . . did shape-shifters . . . kill my friends?\u201d There. She\u2019d asked it.</p><p>His head whipped back, the flash of horror that lit his wolf\u2019s eyes revealing the truth before the No exploded in her head.</p><p>They were killed by Daemons and Mage. He made a sound of frustration. I guess there\u2019s no reason not to tell you the rest. The six of you were captured to be sacrifices. You, Xavier, and Christy were the only ones we were able to save.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said the Daemons were imprisoned.\u201d</p><p>They were. They still are, though the Mage managed to free three of them. We killed those three, but during that battle\u2014a battle you witnessed\u2014you were exposed to an energy that, for about a week, kept us from stealing your memories of the event. The Mage leader, Inir, is evil. Worse, Satanan is now controlling him. We\u2019re trying our damnedest to stop Inir from freeing Satanan and his entire Daemon horde, but we\u2019re struggling.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand where I come into all this. What do they want with me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>\u201cWulfe . . .\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the truth, Natalie. All I know is that yesterday morning, when I came to check on you, you\u2019d developed an odd glow.</p><p>He\u2019d come to check on her . . . Wulfe. Not the wolflike dog, but Wulfe, the shape-shifter. Good grief. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018odd glow\u2019?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve acquired a bright aura, an unnatural one.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think the attack last night had something to do with that?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what else it could be.</p><p>\u201cXavier?\u201d</p><p>Neither Christy nor Xavier is experiencing it, so far.</p><p>As Natalie made her way through the dark woods, the rain slowly eased to a drizzle. Exhaustion rolled over her as she tried to take in all that he\u2019d told her, all that had happened. A little of the tension she\u2019d been living with eased out of her shoulders as those lost days began to emerge, ever so slightly, from the fog. She\u2019d been with Wulfe. And Xavier. Presumably safe. But there were still so many things she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Emotion welled up as the adrenaline of the past hours slowly drained away, burning her eyes. Please let Xavier be at the end of this journey. Please, please, please let me see my little brother again.</p><p>A rain-soaked branch snapped dully beneath her shoe, and the scent of the night woods filled her senses as they walked in silence.</p><p>Wulfe stopped suddenly, his ears going rigidly alert, his hackles rising. Natalie, turn off your flashlight and give me your cell phone. Fast. With startled eyes, she watched as he exploded in a million sparkling lights, turning back into a man.</p><p>Dropping her suitcase, she flicked off her flashlight and shoved it into her pocket, then fished her cell phone out of her purse, swiped the screen, and punched in her security code. Wulfe\u2019s dark form rose large before her as he reached for the phone and snatched it from her hand.</p><p>He tapped a number, lifted the phone to his ear, and grabbed her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her suitcase and together they hurried through the dark woods. Without a flashlight, she could see virtually nothing, but Wulfe\u2019s tight grip kept her upright each time she stumbled.</p><p>\u201cNatalie and I are in the woods behind her house,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Mage sentinels on our tail. I\u2019m guessing more than two dozen.\u201d Disconnecting the call, he released her hand long enough for her to slide the phone back into her purse, then took it again.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat Falls. Virginia side. Give me your suitcase.\u201d</p><p>She handed it to him and his hand tightened on hers as they half walked, half ran.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an hour from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the way we travel. But our transport has to find us, and that could take time.\u201d</p><p>Which made little sense. \u201cCan you see where you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough. My human night vision isn\u2019t nearly as good as my wolf\u2019s, but it\u2019s better than yours.\u201d</p><p>A dull thud reached her ears, vibrating up through the ground. Footfalls. A lot of them. Terror crawled slowly up her spine.</p><p>Suddenly, Wulfe made a low sound of pain. \u201cFuck. Sorry. Natalie, I\u2019m going to have to shift. The draden . . . I can\u2019t explain but I have to shift. Take your suitcase.\u201d</p><p>He shoved her small case into her hand, then stepped away from her and in another spray of colored lights, again became the wolf.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, I can\u2019t see,\u201d she whispered. He was little more than a dark smudge against the nearby trees.</p><p>I\u2019ll guide you.</p><p>The smudge moved to her side, his warm body pressing against hers. Natalie slid her hand into his fur, then followed as he started forward. But the ground was wet and uneven, small branches strewn about everywhere from the storm, and she could only move so fast.</p><p>Behind them, the footfalls grew louder.</p><p>Natalie, we need to run. Hold on to me and do the best you can.</p><p>Her pulse began to race because she knew they were in trouble. Dropping her suitcase and her purse, she bent over to grip Wulfe lightly around the neck, not wanting to add weight to his already wounded body.</p><p>\u201cBe my eyes, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>She nearly lost her grip on him as he took off, but she managed to hold on and run alongside him, at a slow and awkward gait. Behind them, the pounding grew louder until Natalie\u2019s spine crawled, and she kept imagining she felt the steel of a blade piercing the back of her neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow much farther?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Too far. But all we need to do is stay ahead of them until the Ilinas find us.</p><p>But in the next instant, her foot snagged on a fallen limb, and she went down, hard.</p> <p>Natalie.</p><p>She saw the sparkling lights, though even those were barely visible in the dark, and a moment later, strong arms scooped her up, then almost as quickly, released her legs, setting her back on her feet. She understood why as the clouds broke apart and moonlight illuminated the Mage running to surround them on every side. As before, they wore blue tunics and carried swords. As before, they meant trouble.</p><p>\u201cWulfe!\u201d a woman\u2019s voice called in the distance.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Wulfe shouted in return. And before Natalie could wonder, two dark forms, two women, appeared beside them. Out of thin air.</p><p>\u201cStop them!\u201d one of the enemy shouted.</p> <p>Wulfe whirled and grabbed Natalie by the shoulders. Though she couldn\u2019t see his eyes, she felt the force of his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, Natalie. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>Then he released her and stepped back. And her world went into free fall.</p><p>Natalie swayed, stunned.</p><p>The sudden lights blinded her. Voices erupted all around her. One moment she\u2019d been in the pitch-black, rain-soaked woods. The next, here, behind this house, this . . . mansion . . . lit up like a birthday cake. People everywhere.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Her vision swam, her pulse thudded as her body turned cold and clammy.</p> <p>Strong feminine hands grabbed hold of her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t faint on me, human,\u201d the owner of those hands said, not unkindly.</p><p>\u201cI need to get my head down.\u201d Close by, she heard the sound of vomiting, but she struggled too hard to keep from passing out to worry about anyone else. Sinking to her knees, she folded over until her forehead nearly touched the dry grass. A soothing, slender hand stroked her back, filling her with warmth, easing back the dizziness, the shock.</p><p>As the vertigo passed, Natalie took a deep breath and sat up, glancing at the woman\u2014a petite blonde with sharp, bright blue eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cMy gift comes in handy every now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Natalie asked, pushing herself slowly to her feet.</p><p>The woman grabbed her arm, helping her up. \u201cI brought you to Feral House. You\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought me?\u201d Behind her companion, she saw Wulfe rising from his hands and knees, the light from dozens of windows playing over the muscles and contours of his perfect form.</p><p>\u201cI was your Ilina transport. Wulfe\u2019s fine, by the way. Humans handle Ilina travel much better than the immortal races, for some reason. I\u2019m Melisande, the wife of one of the Ferals.\u201d</p> <p>Wulfe turned and saw her, his face a mask of concern as he started toward her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, grabbing her shaking hand, his large fingers wrapping tight around hers. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to fully warn you.\u201d</p><p>Natalie nodded, swallowed. But her mind kept blanking from overload, screaming, This isn\u2019t happening!</p><p>She clung to Wulfe\u2019s hand, squeezing hard as his warm fingers settled more firmly around hers.</p><p>Slowly, her gaze eased around him, to take in her surroundings. On one side, at least a dozen people, both men and women, sat at tables scattered across the patio, watching her curiously. All appeared dressed similarly, in casual training pants and tanks. They looked like some kind of military fighting unit. Looking the other way, she saw several more of the fighters standing in the grass, watching her, swords at their sides.</p><p>The sound of a door had her turning back just as three muscular men strode from the house. The one in front, a male with a distinct air of authority, looked from Wulfe to her, and back again, scowling. The other two were a contrast\u2014one with long black hair and the features of a Native American, a trio of scars slashing across one eye. The other as fair as his companion was dark, his blond hair cut short.</p><p>Wulfe turned to face them, his hand still tight around hers.</p><p>One by one, the three greeted Wulfe, clasping his arm at the elbow, slapping forearms.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the leader demanded, his amber eyes once more flicking unhappily toward her.</p><p>Wulfe glanced pointedly at the throng on the patio. \u201cCan we talk inside?\u201d</p><p>The leader nodded. \u201cMy office.\u201d As he and the Native American turned back toward the house, the remaining man tossed Wulfe a pair of workout shorts then turned to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tighe,\u201d he told her, dimples appearing briefly in his cheeks. His eyes, warm and kind, ratcheted down her racing pulse a couple of notches.</p><p>As Wulfe released her hand to pull on the shorts, she nodded. \u201cHi, Tighe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you got caught up in all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe nodded toward the house and started forward, waiting for her to fall into step beside him, but he didn\u2019t reach for her hand again.</p><p>Tighe brought up the rear. \u201cYou look like hell, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bleeding\u2019s stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the goddess for small favors,\u201d Tighe murmured, as they crossed the patio. \u201cNatalie appears unharmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the Mage enthralled her. I\u2019ll tell you the rest when we get inside.\u201d</p><p>Natalie glanced toward Wulfe. \u201cEnthralled?\u201d</p><p>His expression turned grim. \u201cThe Mage can . . . and did . . . capture your mind with a touch. Once I\u2019d dispatched them, I carried you upstairs and laid you on the first bed I could find before I passed out.\u201d</p><p>Dispatched them. A vision of blood and body parts flashed through her head, and she drew in a trembling breath and shoved the memory aside, focusing on the rest of his revelation. He was the one who\u2019d put her in the guest room. Waking up there finally made sense. As much sense as anything tonight.</p><p>Wulfe led her into the house, into a huge room with the biggest, most ornate dining table she\u2019d ever seen. A pair of crystal chandeliers hung above the table, casting light on walls covered in blue-and-gold wallpaper.</p><p>Somewhere nearby, a peel of high-pitched laughter was answered by a laugh she recognized instantly.</p><p>\u201cXavier.\u201d Her body tensed, her heart jolting, as her gaze flew to Wulfe. \u201cIs he here?\u201d</p><p>A funny look crossed the big man\u2019s face, a hint of a smile. \u201cX!\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Xavier called back.</p><p>Natalie swayed, and Wulfe pulled her against his side, his arm around her shoulders. Her heart began to pound, tears burning her eyes. As the far door swung open, and her youngest brother pushed through, a cane in his hand, a smile on his beloved face, joy burst inside of her, powering her feet.</p><p>\u201cXavier,\u201d she breathed, pulling away from Wulfe to rush toward him.</p><p>\u201cNat?\u201d Xavier\u2019s smile erupted into a full-out grin and he stopped, opening his arms for her.</p><p>Tears running down her cheeks, Natalie closed the distance between them and hugged her brother, who stood only a couple of inches taller than she, euphoric at the feel of his arms around her, at the sound of his heart beating against her own. Alive.</p><p>The events of the past hours ripped away the last shred of her control, and she began to sob as she held him, as she shook and rejoiced and thanked the heavens over and over and over again for giving him back to her.</p><p>Xavier patted her back. \u201cNat, are you okay? You smell like blood. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just so . . . glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she pulled herself together and let go of him, stepping back enough to examine his face. Someone pressed a couple of tissues into her hand, and she used them to mop up her tears and blow her nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Sis? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She felt a large hand settle on her shoulder and knew, without looking, that it belonged to Wulfe. The feel of him beside her helped settle her.</p><p>\u201cThe Mage found her again, X, but I was there. I took care of them, and they didn\u2019t hurt her. She got a little bloody trying to staunch my wounds. She\u2019s going to stay here for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You\u2019re okay, Wulfe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot cool that the Mage found you, Nat,\u201d Xavier said. \u201cBut cool that you\u2019re back. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Natalie laughed, the sound watery. \u201cOh, Xavier, how I\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mom?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced, unsure how to answer that. The last thing she wanted to do was hurt her brother. But sometimes, only the truth would do.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s grieving.\u201d</p><p>His face fell. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>Natalie met Wulfe\u2019s gaze, holding on to the soft understanding she saw there. \u201cMom clings to the hope that you\u2019re alive, but the cops . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid no one else thinks you survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s better that way. No one\u2019s looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s looking for you. They\u2019ve scoured the Harpers Ferry area over and over again. But they\u2019re past the point of believing they\u2019ll find you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has to be killing Mom.\u201d</p><p>Natalie gripped his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard on her. You know how much she loves you. But she\u2019s tough, Xavier. She\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow cast a sheen in his eyes, and he squeezed her hand in return. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t disappear, too.\u201d</p><p>The truth of his words cut deep. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Her gaze found Wulfe\u2019s again. \u201cI have to believe I\u2019ll get home again.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d</p><p>And she believed he would if the power lay in his hands.</p><p>Wulfe clasped Xavier\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLyon\u2019s waiting for us in his office, X. You two can talk more later.\u201d</p><p>Natalie hugged her brother again, drinking in the feel of his wiry body, and the sheer miracle of his survival before forcing herself to pull away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Nat, for however long you stay. You have to meet Pink. She\u2019s half-flamingo, but she can\u2019t shift like the others can, she\u2019s stuck that way. But she\u2019s awesome.\u201d Xavier frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ll like it here, Nat. But do whatever they say. They\u2019re the good guys, just do whatever they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d But the gravity of his words sent a chill down her spine. They\u2019re the good guys, but . . . She wasn\u2019t safe here. Not entirely.</p><p>She squeezed Xavier\u2019s hand, then turned back to Wulfe, surprised by the softness in his eyes as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curled lightly around her upper arm as he led her through the dining room and into the hall. His touch, his presence, steadied her. Strengthened her. Despite Xavier\u2019s warning, she felt safe with Wulfe as she had from the moment she\u2019d met him in his animal form, though she probably shouldn\u2019t. In so many ways, he was a total stranger. And yet . . . he wasn\u2019t. In his eyes, she recognized the same spirit, the same sweet yet fierce soul who\u2019d pressed his wolf\u2019s head against her thigh, then taken knife wound after knife wound to defend her. The man\u2019s face was still new to her\u2014the scars disturbing, mostly because they spoke of great suffering. But beneath those scars was a strong face, a handsome one. And his body, which she\u2019d seen more of than she had any right to, was nothing short of breathtaking. His scent invaded her air, a warm, masculine aroma that wove a spell over her, easing the tension from her muscles even as it quickened her pulse.</p><p>Everything about him called to her on the most primitive level, leaving her feeling secure but not calm. No, not calm. His half-naked closeness excited every molecule in her body.</p><p>As he ushered her down the hallway, his thumb began to rub her upper arm gently. \u201cYou\u2019re still shaking,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She laughed, a single burst of air. \u201cI\u2019m still reeling from all that\u2019s happened, but I\u2019m fine, Wulfe. More than fine.\u201d She turned and met his gaze, the joy barreling up and out of her in a grin that split her face. \u201cMy brother\u2019s alive.\u201d Tears pooled in her eyes all over again, but she blinked them back, watching as an answering smile lit Wulfe\u2019s eyes, igniting a sparkle within those dark depths that set up a warm, lively dance in her chest. His scarred mouth twitched, then widened, his crooked smile nothing short of stunning. Her pulse took off in a crazy flight.</p><p>\u201cThat went down just as I had hoped it would,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>If possible, his eyes softened even further. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sad. Seeing X made you happy.\u201d</p><p>As gratitude and affection surged up inside of her, Natalie rose up and placed a quick kiss on his cheek. \u201cVery. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>To her dismay, Wulfe jerked back, the light dying from his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d But his tone turned flat, and he released her arm and turned away, continuing down the hall.</p><p>Natalie hurried to keep pace with him, wondering, unhappily, if she\u2019d breached some kind of werewolf . . . shifter . . . etiquette. The last thing she wanted to do was displease the man who\u2019d been nothing but wonderful to her. Taking a deep breath, she steeled herself for the meeting ahead and whatever followed, because it was obvious she didn\u2019t understand this world. Or, for that matter, the people in it.</p><p>She was in over her head, that was all too clear.</p><p>And she might have just alienated the only one standing by her side.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>She\u2019d kissed him.</p><p>Wulfe led Natalie through Feral House to Lyon\u2019s office, feeling knocked on his ass.</p><p>She\u2019d kissed him.</p><p>Just his cheek, of course. But she\u2019d touched his scars. With her lips. A thing Beatrice would have never done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Goddess, this woman was turning him inside out. Watching her with her brother had ripped his heart out. Hearing her sobs, even if they\u2019d been of joy and not sorrow, had utterly slain him.</p><p>Then she\u2019d kissed him.</p><p>His hand itched to reach for hers again. His arm tensed with the need to curl around her shoulders and pull her close, but he wouldn\u2019t do that. Not when she was steady on her feet again and no longer needed him. She might have kissed him, but he knew a peck of gratitude when he felt it. If he tried to draw her close for no reason other than that he couldn\u2019t think of anything more wonderful than holding her close, she\u2019d probably stiffen, then pull away. Nicely, of course. He didn\u2019t think Natalie knew how to do anything except nicely. But they\u2019d both be left feeling intensely uncomfortable, and he didn\u2019t want that.</p> <p>As they strode through the foyer, side by side, Natalie\u2019s soft scent wafted to his sensitive nose and he drank it in, feeling it slide through him, warming him, settling into his blood, his chest, calming him. Her scent reminded him of wild roses beneath a summer sun\u2014at once lovely, warm, and tenacious. Being near her was like walking into an errant shaft of sunlight on a cold, overcast day. Or like stepping into cool shade in the middle of a summer scorcher. It made him sigh, deep inside. It made him feel good all the way to his soul. His wolf agreed, giving a low bark of satisfaction.</p><p>As they neared Lyon\u2019s office, Natalie gasped, her hand flying to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Wulfe asked.</p><p>She shook her head, then slowly relaxed again. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>He peered at her doubtfully, but she seemed to be okay, so he turned forward and opened the door to Lyon\u2019s office. He motioned for her to take a seat in one of the chairs in front of Lyon\u2019s desk, and she did, moving with that innate grace of hers to settle onto the chair, her back straight, her hands in her lap, her expression calm and alert, as always, despite the fact that he knew she was still shaking.</p> <p>His instincts told him to stand behind her, to protect her back, even though he knew Lyon would never make a move against her without discussing it with Wulfe first. Lyon didn\u2019t work that way. The Chief of the Ferals was ruthless only when he had no choice, and, in all things, utterly fair. But before Wulfe could take his place behind Natalie, the healer, Esmeria, headed him off, gliding forward to meet him with a sound of sympathetic dismay. Wulfe stood still, just inside the door, as the Therian healer pressed her hand to the wound on his shoulder, closed her eyes, and slowly stole the pain.</p><p>As he submitted to Esmeria\u2019s ministrations, Wulfe\u2019s gaze moved to Lyon where he sat behind the large desk that dominated the room. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves covered the walls except for the space occupied by the hearth, where Paenther stood. Tighe propped one hip on the corner of Lyon\u2019s desk and waited.</p><p>Lyon rose and held out his hand to Natalie. \u201cI\u2019m Lyon, Natalie. Chief of the Ferals. We met weeks ago though you don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Natalie shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you . . . again.\u201d</p><p>Paenther stepped forward, his black hair swinging forward to partly obscure the feral marks across his eye. \u201cI\u2019m Paenther, the black panther shifter and Lyon\u2019s second-in-command.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, shook his hand, and settled back onto her chair, her posture slightly less tense than before. Humans generally responded well to shows of respect and friendliness, and Wulfe appreciated Lyon and Paenther taking the time to show her both.</p> <p>Lyon\u2019s gaze turned to Wulfe. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Esmeria moved behind him, and Wulfe stepped forward, allowing her access to the wounds on his back. \u201cTen Mage sentinels kicked in Natalie\u2019s front door. Inir had ordered them to bring us . . . both of us . . . to him alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Paenther asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cHow did Inir know you were there?\u201d Lyon asked at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. On Inir\u2019s mountain last week, Satanan sensed me. I\u2019m wondering if he always knows where I am, now.\u201d</p><p>Lyon frowned. \u201cSo they waited until you were far from Feral House before trying to take you. Why Natalie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kill them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ten who breached the house. Unfortunately, the front door was kicked in and there was no fixing it before we left. We need to send a cleanup crew before the humans find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where the house is,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Lyon nodded. As Tighe rose to leave, Lyon turned to Wulfe. \u201cMore sentinels came after you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey followed us into the woods, more than two dozen of them. Either the first group jumped the gun and attacked us without waiting for their backup, or the Mage are stationed close enough to Frederick that Inir was able to send reinforcements quickly. Within about an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey knew you\u2019d go back there.\u201d Lyon sighed. \u201cUntil we know why they want you both, Natalie stays here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>Lyon turned to Natalie. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re going to have to lock you up.\u201d</p><p>Natalie jerked.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s muscles bunched, a hard no burning in his throat. Deep inside, his wolf leaped up, snarling. \u201cYou can\u2019t put her in the prisons, Roar. Not again. Not when we\u2019ve got men down there that we\u2019re not sure about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWulfe . . .\u201d</p><p>He slammed his fist on Lyon\u2019s desk. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t deserve the prison again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was never down there because she deserved it.\u201d Lyon sank back onto his chair wearily. \u201cIf she gets away from you and shares what she\u2019s seen with other humans, the result could be catastrophic, especially with the human cops already stumped by the deaths and disappearances of her companions last month. You know that. I can\u2019t risk it.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. He knew Lyon was right. Still . . . what if . . . ? \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to be locked up in the prisons.\u201d Enthusiasm quickened Wulfe\u2019s speech. \u201cNatalie can stay in the bedroom between yours and mine. I\u2019ll put locks on the windows and on the outside of the door. She\u2019ll be comfortable. And if she needs anything, I\u2019ll hear her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we had Guards staying in that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can sleep on pallets in the living room with the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>For several moments, Lyon met his gaze, silently considering Wulfe\u2019s words. After six hundred years of working together, Wulfe knew his chief well.</p><p>With a sigh, Lyon ran his hand across the back of his neck. \u201cShe\u2019s your responsibility. I want you, another Feral, or one of the stronger women with her any time she\u2019s out of that room, no exceptions. And I don\u2019t want her anywhere near electronic devices\u2014computers, phones, etc.\u201d</p><p>The coiled tension in Wulfe\u2019s body eased. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Lyon turned a hard, uncompromising gaze on Natalie. \u201cYou must understand, we don\u2019t kill humans without cause, but we will destroy anyone who threatens the anonymity of the immortal races. When we first realized that Xavier was blind, and his memories of us couldn\u2019t be stolen, I wanted him put to death.\u201d</p><p>Natalie stiffened, and it was all Wulfe could do not to put his hand on her shoulder and promise her he\u2019d protect them both, now.</p><p>Lyon folded his hands on the desk in front of him. \u201cYou know what would happen if the press, human law enforcement, or the military found out about us. At best, we\u2019d be run out. More likely, we\u2019d be attacked with weapons that can destroy even immortals. And if we die, the Daemons rise. It\u2019s as simple as that. And then it\u2019s game over for both of our races. Until we can figure out what was done to you, reverse it, then steal your memories of all you\u2019ve seen, we can\u2019t send you home, and we can\u2019t let you escape. The risk is too great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t figure it out?\u201d Natalie asked, her voice even and professional, despite everything. \u201cOr you can\u2019t reverse it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it one step at a time. But you must understand that if you betray us in any way . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I betray you, you\u2019ll kill me. I understand.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s muscles bunched, a low growl rumbling in his throat.</p><p>Lyon glanced his way but didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cWe\u2019ll have no choice. What\u2019s more,\u201d he said, turning back to Natalie. \u201cIf we\u2019re forced to take your life, we\u2019ll instantly lose your brother\u2019s loyalty, and we\u2019ll no longer be able to trust him either. So both of your lives are in your hands.\u201d</p><p>Natalie was silent for a moment before finally nodding. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Esmeria circled Wulfe one more time, eyeing him critically. \u201cDid I get them all?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe nodded. \u201cThank you, Esmeria.\u201d He opened the door for her, then closed it again after she left.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Lyon said, glancing from Wulfe to Natalie and back again. \u201cGet the locks installed on that bedroom and get some sleep. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Natalie rose from her chair and faced the Chief of the Feral Warriors. \u201cThank you for sparing Xavier\u2019s life, Lyon. Thank you for sparing both of ours. I won\u2019t betray you.\u201d She held out her hand to seal their bargain.</p><p>Lyon eyed her thoughtfully as he shook her hand. \u201cYour brother is a good person, Natalie. The better I get to know him, the more certain of that I become. It would seem the trait runs in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>As Wulfe ushered Natalie out of Lyon\u2019s office, he glanced back and met his chief\u2019s gaze, reading the unspoken warning clear in Lyon\u2019s eyes. Don\u2019t fuck this up. If he did, if Natalie found a way to escape with her brother in tow\u2014because he knew she\u2019d never leave without him\u2014all their lives might be over. He wasn\u2019t going to let that happen.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Wulfe opened the door and stepped back, allowing Natalie to precede him into the hallway. Despite Lyon\u2019s warnings, or perhaps because of them, the feel of Wulfe at her back sent a frisson of warmth stealing through her veins. There was safety in that warmth, and goodness. And something more.</p><p>\u201cWulfe,\u201d Lyon called after him. \u201cSend in one of the Guards. They can be emptying the room while you install the locks.\u201d</p><p>A pair of Guards overheard the command and one of them nodded to Wulfe and went to join Lyon.</p><p>As they crossed the mammoth foyer, Natalie considered Lyon\u2019s words. If he\u2019d meant to scare her, he\u2019d succeeded. His was no idle threat, she knew that in her gut . . . a gut that felt like it had been filled with cement. Xavier\u2019s warning made sense, now. There was honor in these males, and goodness. She was fairly sure of that. But they were warriors, first. Soldiers battling an enemy who could not be allowed to win. If she and Xavier got in the way, they\u2019d be removed. As simple as that. Collateral damage.</p><p>She understood the ways of war, understood that sometimes a few had to be sacrificed to protect the many. The Ferals wouldn\u2019t hurt them if they had a choice. And she\u2019d do nothing to betray them, just as she\u2019d promised. But with her glowing like a nuclear reactor, they might not have that choice, no matter what she did.</p><p>Agitation simmered low in her blood even as she fought it back. She might not be able to control her glow. But she could accept her fate, cooperate, and pray it was enough to keep Xavier and her alive.</p><p>As they started down another hallway, Wulfe stopped and opened a door, revealing a stairwell that looked as if it disappeared deep beneath the Earth.</p><p>Natalie eyed the long flight of stairs warily. \u201cIs this where you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy room\u2019s on the third floor. This is the way to the workroom, with the tools and spare locks.\u201d He motioned her forward. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she started down, her head beginning to feel unattached. Never could she remember feeling so physically and emotionally drained. No, that wasn\u2019t true. She\u2019d felt worse in the days after her release, when she\u2019d feared Xavier might really be dead. But there was no denying she\u2019d experienced shock after shock tonight. And her mind and body wanted nothing more than to simply shut down.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, how long until we know if Tighe got to my house before the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder to find him pulling a phone out of his back pocket. A moment later, Tighe\u2019s voice filled the stairwell.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on speaker, Tighe. I\u2019m with Natalie. Are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. You left a bit of a mess. Nice work.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile flitted across Wulfe\u2019s face as his gaze met hers. \u201cThe situation\u2019s contained?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest I can tell. There were no humans around when we got here, and while I\u2019m not the best tracker, I circled the house in cat form and didn\u2019t catch fresh scent of any humans in the yard other than Natalie. We\u2019ve got the place warded, now, so no one will see any blood if they do pay the place a visit. Melisande and her mist warriors have already disposed of the bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Thanks, Stripes.\u201d Wulfe shoved the phone back in his pocket and glanced at her. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Very.\u201d She turned and continued down the stairs. No one would find the blood or the bodies in her house. But when she failed to show up for work, people were bound to fear the worst. \u201cWulfe, I know Lyon said to keep me away from phones, but it would help both of us if I could make a couple of calls to cover my tracks. One to my mom, the other to my office manager. Think of the firestorm my disappearing again will create in the media.\u201d Her mom didn\u2019t deserve that. Nor did she want her patients making the trip to her office only to be turned away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about your fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe broke off our engagement this morning.\u201d Right after Wulfe left, she realized.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to beat the shit out of him?\u201d</p> <p>At the anger in his low words, Natalie looked over her shoulder to find him watching her with righteous fury. Affection welled up inside her, hot and fast.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was the one who broke it off, but he wasn\u2019t surprised.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, the anger drained from his face. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She started to answer, then hesitated, thinking it through. \u201cI suppose we\u2019d both begun to realize he wasn\u2019t the man for me.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe turned still as stone. \u201cIs there another?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated. \u201cNo.\u201d But as she stared into those dark eyes, something soft fluttered inside of her. A wish. A longing. There could be. But she didn\u2019t say the words out loud. He was a godlike immortal, and she was merely a human caught up in something she should never have known existed. If all went as hoped, soon she wouldn\u2019t even remember him. Or that Xavier lived.</p><p>Her heart plummeted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Lyon about those phone calls,\u201d Wulfe assured her. As she started back down, he asked, \u201cWhat will you tell them?\u201d</p><p>She thought about that for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll say that I need to get away for a little while. I don\u2019t think anyone will judge me considering all that\u2019s happened. And if they do, so what? It\u2019s better for them to judge me than to search for me.\u201d</p><p>When they finally reached the bottom of the stairs, Wulfe moved past her, leading the way down a wide hallway lit by mock-gas lanterns, giving the space an old-time, atmospheric feel. A feel that quickly dissipated as he opened one of the doors along the hallway and, flipping a switch, illuminated a huge workshop filled with every kind of power tool known to man.</p><p>Wulfe pulled open a drawer in a wall unit filled with them, digging out a handful of small items.</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, and dropped several pieces of dead-bolt hardware into her palm before grabbing a screwdriver and drill.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked, and headed back for the door.</p><p>As Natalie followed him out, she heard people on the stairs and watched three enter the hallway a moment later, two males and a female. The males were dressed just like Wulfe, naked except for a pair of workout shorts. The woman wore only a sports bra with her shorts. All three eyed her with friendly curiosity.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d one of the men asked Wulfe. He was a nice-looking male with a long face and steepled brows. His hand curved across the shoulders of the woman, and she leaned into him as if the pair were two parts of a whole. The woman was cute, with dark, blue-tipped hair and a winning smile.</p><p>\u201cBoyo,\u201d the third in the group said, striding forward and greeting Wulfe in the same manner Lyon and Jag had. This male was startlingly handsome in a cover-model kind of way, his hair falling to his shoulders in golden waves, his features utterly perfect in his strong-boned face.</p><p>\u201cFox,\u201d Wulfe said to the golden warrior, a smile lifting his mouth. He turned to the first male and greeted him in the same manner. \u201cI\u2019m good, Hawke. We\u2019re going to put some locks on the door and windows of the bedchamber beside mine. Lyon\u2019s orders, if Natalie\u2019s to avoid the prisons this time.\u201d</p><p>Hawke turned to her, his expression surprised, but kind. \u201cHello, Natalie.\u201d He held out his hand, and she shook it. Glancing at Wulfe, he lifted one of those steepled brows. \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen Mage sentinels broke into her house tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Fox whistled. \u201cTen against one and yet here you are, boyo. Wish I\u2019d been there to see that.\u201d His voice held an unmistakable Irish brogue.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d been there to help,\u201d Wulfe replied. \u201cInir wanted her.\u201d</p><p>A dark look passed between the men and the woman.</p><p>\u201cHi, Wulfe.\u201d The woman thrust out her hand to Wulfe and he greeted her as he had the men, though without the same ease. She turned to Natalie, smiled, and extended her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Faith.\u201d She gave her head a little shake. \u201cFalkyn. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally? So we haven\u2019t met before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but your brother talks about you constantly. He\u2019s very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Natalie smiled. \u201cAs I am of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good chap,\u201d Fox said, smiling. \u201cWelcome, Natalie.\u201d And he shook her hand, too.</p><p>Lyon might not trust her, entirely, but the other shape-shifters were openly warm and friendly.</p><p>\u201cDoing a little training?\u201d Wulfe asked.</p><p>Hawke nodded, sending Falkyn a look of such deep adoration it made Natalie\u2019s heart ache a little. Had Rick ever looked at her like that? If she were perfectly honest, no. Nor had she ever felt that deeply about him. They\u2019d gotten along famously, enjoying many of the same pastimes. But he\u2019d never been necessary to her, she knew that now.</p><p>\u201cFalkyn\u2019s skills are improving by leaps and bounds, but I want her to be the best fighter among us.\u201d</p><p>Falkyn rolled her eyes with a grin and met Natalie\u2019s curious gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the first female Feral Warrior in centuries, and I shift into a falcon. Not exactly Godzilla. He\u2019s determined to make me invincible anyway.\u201d</p><p>Hawke smiled. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Falkyn gave Natalie a little wave and headed past them, deeper into the underground, the two males following.</p><p>\u201cHow many of you did I meet on my first visit here?\u201d Natalie asked as she started up the stairs, Wulfe close behind. \u201cI got the feeling Hawke, Fox, and Falkyn were all meeting me for the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were. None of them were here last time. The only ones you met were Lyon and his mate, Kara, and Paenther, Jag, and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you kept us in the prisons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You were unconscious most of that time. We figured the less you saw and learned, the easier it would be to take your memories later.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened at the implications of that. \u201cHow difficult will it be to take my memories this time?\u201d He clearly wasn\u2019t minimizing what she was seeing . . . or learning.</p><p>\u201cNatalie,\u201d he said quietly behind her.</p><p>She stopped and turned to him, only a single step between them.</p><p>He met her gaze, his eyes at once soft and fierce. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d both heard Lyon. Wulfe knew as well as she did that her life hung in the balance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he repeated quietly, his gaze like steel, ordering her to believe him.</p><p>Warmth fluttered in her chest on wings of a rising affection for this honorable, enigmatic man. An unruly lock of hair hung across his forehead and her hand itched to reach for it, to brush it back, to touch him again as his words and actions touched her over and over. But he hadn\u2019t welcomed her kiss to his cheek, and she feared he wouldn\u2019t welcome her touch.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said quietly, revealing her growing affection with a smile instead.</p><p>An answering warmth flared in his eyes, his own endearing smile making a small, quick appearance, filling her with a sharp and unexpected joy. With the soft lamplight half illuminating, half shadowing his face, his scars faded to nothing, and the raw male beauty of the man all but took her breath away. His was a strong face, strong-boned, in perfect counterpoint to the body upon which it was attached. His warm, masculine scent wafted over her, pleasing her, drawing her, turning her body soft and warm with wanting. The heat that licked inside her startled her, setting her pulse to flight. And he saw it. She could see the awareness in his eyes. And the disappointment.</p><p>Cheeks heating, Natalie turned and resumed the climb, dismayed and embarrassed, because it was clear Wulfe didn\u2019t feel the same. It wasn\u2019t right that she felt anything for this man when she\u2019d been engaged to another just this morning. But Wulfe called to places inside her that Rick never had, places in her heart, in her mind, that were beginning to awaken and unfurl. Places so deep, so new and untouched, that their awakening scared her on a primitive level. If she wasn\u2019t careful, Wulfe, despite his promises to never hurt her, would. Without ever meaning to.</p><p>They reached the main floor, crossed the foyer, then, at Wulfe\u2019s lead, started up one of the curved stairs, side by side. Neither said a word.</p><p>As they walked down the third-floor hallway, the high yip of an excited puppy echoed suddenly from the other end. Natalie watched, amused, as Wulfe squatted, holding out his big hands as a small black ball of fur came hurtling toward him, tongue out, tail wagging a hundred miles an hour.</p><p>As the little black schnauzer pup reached him, Wulfe scooped the tiny creature up and held her in front of his face, chuckling as the pint-sized canine licked his chin and wiggled with happiness. His laugh was a wonderful sound.</p><p>\u201cAre you being good, Lady?\u201d Wulfe asked, his voice soft as fleece.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a doll, aren\u2019t you, Lady?\u201d A woman strolled gracefully down the hall toward them with a kitten held in one arm, a white cockatiel on her shoulder. Beneath a short cap of dark hair, she smiled at Natalie. \u201cLady thinks Wulfe\u2019s her pack mate. You should see her when Wulfe\u2019s in his animal. They\u2019re adorable together.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe grunted and set the puppy on the ground. \u201cBack to your mom, you scamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Skye,\u201d the woman said, reaching out to shake Natalie\u2019s hand with the one she had free. Her eyes were fascinating, the irises ringed in a shiny band of copper. \u201cI\u2019m Paenther\u2019s mate. You must be Natalie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord travels fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just saw Xavier.\u201d</p><p>Natalie grinned. \u201cXavier\u2019s mouth travels faster.\u201d</p><p>Skye laughed. \u201cWe love Xavier.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe started down the hall, the puppy fast on his heels. Natalie and Skye followed, side by side. Natalie reached over and stroked the kitten, smiling at the other woman. \u201cYou have quite a menagerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWulfe gave me Lady as a wedding present a couple of months ago. Jag gave me Tramp, the tabby, and Hawke gifted me with Princess, my cockatiel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must have known you like animals.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s smile was soft. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to animals, and they to me, in a way far beyond human understanding. I don\u2019t really understand it myself, I just know that it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it seems like you\u2019re in the right house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith shape-shifters, you mean?\u201d Her expression turned wry. \u201cYou would think so, and yet, if you knew a little more about our world, you would think not. I\u2019m Mage.\u201d</p><p>Natalie jerked with surprise.</p><p>Skye\u2019s mouth twisted ruefully. \u201cI see you know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen of them broke into my house tonight.\u201d</p><p>Skye blanched. \u201cBut you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWulfe was there. He . . . took care of them.\u201d</p><p>Skye nodded. \u201cToo many of my people have had their souls stolen. We\u2019re not all like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that. And I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Natalie cocked her head. \u201cCan you see my glow, too?\u201d</p><p>Skye nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s faint\u2014I don\u2019t usually see auras\u2014but it\u2019s there. The colors are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks . . . I think. From what I gather, it\u2019s Daemon-related, which is probably not good.\u201d</p><p>Skye frowned, looked at Wulfe. \u201cIs the Shaman going to take a look at her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already did,\u201d Wulfe told her. \u201cAll he can say is that it appears to be Daemon energy. But he doesn\u2019t know what that means.\u201d Wulfe strode into one of the rooms, a large room with a massive poster bed sitting in the middle. Against one wall sat a dresser with a mirror. But other than a single nightstand, that was it. The walls were white, there was no rug on the hardwood floor, and only a single sheet covered the bed. Against one wall sat a pair of plain army green duffel bags.</p><p>A woman . . . presumably one of the Therian Guards, poked her head out the bathroom door. \u201cI\u2019m gathering up our toiletries. I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Natalie going to stay here?\u201d Skye asked, surprised.</p><p>Natalie responded without rancor, \u201cWulfe\u2019s been ordered to put locks on the windows and door as a precaution. It\u2019s odd to be considered dangerous among immortals who could end my life in an instant, but I get it.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s eyes darkened with sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not angry about it.\u201d</p><p>The woman strode from the bathroom, her hair short, her body toned and strong beneath her tank and fighting pants.</p><p>\u201cSorry for running you out,\u201d Skye said.</p><p>The woman grabbed the duffels and turned to her with a smile. \u201cThank you, but a bed is a luxury we don\u2019t need.\u201d She nodded to Natalie and Wulfe as she left.</p><p>Skye set the kitten down to scamper over to the puppy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need fresh linens,\u201d she said and began stripping the bed. As Natalie stepped forward to help, another woman strode into the room, her arms laden with sheets and towels, a small canvas bag slung over one arm, a gun strapped to her waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got them,\u201d the newcomer said.</p><p>Melisande walked in behind her. \u201cTighe wants to know if you want him to bring anything back for you, Natalie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love him to, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to find them. I had to drop my purse and a yellow suitcase in the woods behind my house when the Mage started chasing us.\u201d She glanced at Wulfe. \u201cI\u2019d love to have my laptop, too, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Melisande asked.</p><p>\u201cOn the sofa in the family room, where the battle took place. The power cord is on the desk in the kitchen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring them.

I used to be human, too.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cUsed to be?\u201d</p><p>Delaney smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story that still gives me nightmares, but the result was worth it. I\u2019ve got the hottest, sweetest male on the face of the planet for all of eternity.\u201d</p> <p>Skye laughed as she grabbed one end of the sheet. \u201cI could argue that. Mine happens to be the sweetest. And the hottest.\u201d</p><p>Delaney grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it a draw.\u201d</p><p>Natalie helped the pair make the bed, her gaze drawn to Wulfe as he moved to the window and began screwing bolts into the frame.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, you should give Natalie one of those cell phones that Tighe gave me when I first got here.\u201d Delaney looked at Natalie. \u201cThe only calls I could make from it were to Tighe or Lyon. They didn\u2019t want me calling the FBI, which I\u2019d been trying to do.\u201d She glanced back at Wulfe. \u201cLoad Skye\u2019s number, and mine, in case you\u2019re not around and she wants company. Being locked up is no fun, even with a comfy bed.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe just nodded but continued to concentrate on his task.</p><p>Lady began to bark and ran toward the door.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s her gotta pee bark,\u201d Skye said, hurrying after her.</p><p>Delaney met Natalie\u2019s gaze. \u201cIf you need anyone to talk to, have Wulfe call me. I\u2019m on lockdown, too, if in a different way.\u201d Her smile turned beatific. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant with Tighe\u2019s child and he barely allows me to leave the house, let alone join in the fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Wulfe said.</p><p>\u201cI know. But it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going stir-crazy. I\u2019m barely even showing yet.\u201d Her gaze turned serious. \u201cThey\u2019re good guys, the best, but if you betray them, there\u2019s nowhere you can hide,\u201d she said, echoing Xavier\u2019s warning. Despite the harshness of her words, Delaney\u2019s eyes were sympathetic as she grasped Natalie\u2019s hand and led her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cDelaney . . .\u201d Wulfe called, a note of warning in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWe need a moment of girl talk. She won\u2019t be out of your sight.\u201d Delaney led her into the hallway just outside the room. When Wulfe turned back to his task with a nod, Delaney met Natalie\u2019s gaze, her own piercing. \u201cWhen you were here before, Wulfe became your protector. He watched over you like a mother hen, and he hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d</p><p>Natalie nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s visited me as the wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cares about you, Natalie. But there are other factors. A lot of them. You\u2019ve never appeared put off by his scars, and that\u2019s huge. But tread carefully, please. In many ways, he\u2019s the strongest, fiercest of the shifters. But in others, he\u2019s vulnerable. I wouldn\u2019t want either of you to get hurt because either of those scenarios will wind up hurting him. Just tread carefully.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie watched her. \u201cYou do realize you\u2019ve given me only enough to make me intensely curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The rest isn\u2019t mine to tell. If you need someone to talk to at any time, I\u2019m here.\u201d She squeezed Natalie\u2019s hand, motioned Natalie back into the room, and left.</p><p>Wulfe glanced at her as she approached, then turned back to the window without asking any questions.</p><p>\u201cHere you go!\u201d a feminine voice called from the doorway.</p><p>Natalie turned to find Melisande holding her purse and suitcase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave them right here.\u201d The Ilina set them by the door, then disappeared again before Natalie could thank her.</p><p>With a mind-clearing shake of the head, Natalie turned back to Wulfe, intrigued by the play of muscles across his broad, broad shoulders and back. He really had the most incredible build. Watching him did funny things to her insides, hot, quivery things. And she was just tired enough to not care if he knew it.</p><p>She moved closer, leaning against the wall beside him. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you with a shirt on. Not that I remember.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her with dismay. \u201cDo you want me to get one before I finish?\u201d</p><p>A smile fought to escape. \u201cI rather like you without clothes on.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled, his eyes changed, slowly darkening, watching her with an intensity that snagged at her breath, that made her body heat and soften.</p><p>Longing filled his eyes. \u201cNatalie.\u201d</p><p>For one charged moment, she thought he might drop his tools and reach for her. And she wanted that. Badly.</p><p>Instead, his eyes filled with frustration and he returned to his task. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you unpack while I finish here?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she just watched him, her brows drawn with confusion. He\u2019d reared back when she kissed his cheek, as if her touch was anathema. But just now, she\u2019d seen longing in his eyes, she knew that. She read eyes too well to doubt herself. And yet . . .</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She got such mixed signals from him. Or maybe she just didn\u2019t know how to read a werewolf. And, honestly, she was probably too tired to get anything straight right now.</p><p>Unpacking quickly, she laid her clothes in the dresser drawers and set her toiletry bag on the sink in the small private bathroom, then hung up the towels Delaney had brought with the sheets. Last, she opened the little canvas bag Delaney had left behind and found hand soap, body soap, a toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, and half a dozen other female necessities including a fat Toblerone candy bar and an index card with a handwritten note across it. If I forgot anything, just yell. D.</p><p>Natalie smiled at the offering. They were treating her far more like a welcome guest than the unexpected problem that she was. Probably because she was Xavier\u2019s sister and they were clearly fond of him.</p><p>Her heart tightened, tears burning her eyes, as the joy of finding him well and happy rushed through her all over again. A single tear escaped, and she swiped it away.</p><p>\u201cNatalie?\u201d</p><p>She turned to find Wulfe watching her with concern in those dark, gentle eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThe best I\u2019ve been in weeks. I have my brother back, even if only for a little while. You have no idea what a gift you\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>He watched her intently. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I want more than for you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>Sincerity throbbed in his words. And she wondered what he\u2019d say if she told him that his taking her into his arms would make her very happy indeed. She wouldn\u2019t put him on the spot like that. Nor did she want to find out it was the last thing he wanted.</p><p>But the thought of being that close to him tantalized.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s voice, low and sexy, stroked Wulfe\u2019s senses. I rather like you without clothes on. Goddess, had he ever received a clearer or more welcome invitation? Her eyes had beckoned without coyness. Natalie wanted him. She wanted him.</p><p>And he had nothing to give. The severing of his mating bond had ruined him in that way. In a lot of ways. His senses had dimmed\u2014his eyes losing their ability to see color as brightly, food losing its taste. Only his sense of smell had yet to fail him, but his libido had disappeared altogether. He could still get an erection if he needed to, but it required hard physical effort on his part. His body hadn\u2019t risen on its own in six months, not for any woman. And he feared it never would again. Even Natalie, as pretty as she was, failed to stir him in that way.</p><p>With not quite steady hands, Wulfe picked up his tools and strode past her. The windows were done. All he had left was the door.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever installed a dead bolt?\u201d His arms ached to grab her and haul her close, his wolf howling, urging him to do just that. But he refused to go down that path with her. No good could come of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never installed one from scratch,\u201d Natalie said, falling into step beside him. \u201cBut I replaced one once.\u201d</p><p>The faint scent of her arousal nearly drove him to his knees.</p><p>\u201cThen you know what we\u2019re doing. I could use a hand.\u201d Goddess. The thought of where he wanted her hand . . . Yeah and how much fun would that be when she found him flaccid and soft?</p><p>If he were smart, he\u2019d send her to the other side of the room where her nearness wouldn\u2019t tie him into knots of longing and of wanting something he couldn\u2019t have. But he wanted her near him so badly, it was worth any amount of torture to watch the play of light on her creamy skin, to smell the tangy scent of shampoo in her hair, and to watch her full, lovely mouth draw up in those soft, Natalie smiles.</p><p>She followed him to the door, and he handed her the lock pieces, screws, and screwdriver, his fingers brushing hers as he laid them in her palms, the simple touch sending electricity buzzing beneath his skin and down into his body. But not far enough. Not nearly far enough.</p><p>Eyeing the door, he mentally marked where he wanted to drill, then picked up the tool and made the holes with a noisy whine. Then he grabbed the chisel and hollowed out a space for the faceplate to fit, all the while intensely aware of Natalie\u2019s nearness, of her gaze. And of the attraction thickening the air between them. Goddess how he wanted to haul her against him and bury his face between her breasts. How he longed to feel her fingers in his hair as he had in his fur.</p><p>He imagined holding her close, stroking her soft cheek as she reached up . . .</p><p>The thought of her touching his scarred excuse for a face burst the sensual bubble, snapping him back to reality. His life was too fucked up to even think about getting involved with a woman right now. And never a woman like Natalie, one who deserved laughter and beauty, safety and happiness. He\u2019d thought she\u2019d found those things with her human fianc\u00e9. The fact that she hadn\u2019t made the jealous male inside of him keenly satisfied. But not the part of him that just wanted her happy. Because he, with his damaged mating bond, his worrisome Daemon blood, and his waning immortality, had absolutely nothing to offer her.</p><p>As Natalie watched the muscles ripple across Wulfe\u2019s beautiful back, her hand itched to reach for him, to stroke his flesh, to know if he felt as hard and strong as he looked. His hair gleamed in the lamplight, a rich blend of browns of every shade, and she yearned to touch it, to feel its softness between her fingers.</p><p>Standing so close to him made her breath unsteady and turned her pulse erratic. She\u2019d never felt like this with Rick, ever. She hadn\u2019t even known she could feel this way\u2014this jittery, rubbery warmth that had her imagining the feel of his flesh against hers.</p><p>As he plucked one of the screws out of her palm, he glanced at her face and stilled. His nostrils flared, his eyes dilating as his gaze at once softened and sharpened, as hunger leaped into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWulfe . . .\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and turned back to his work, leaving her completely confused. Tilting her head back, she looked up at the ceiling and willed her thoughts elsewhere. Anywhere but on the too-appealing male in front of her, a male who, for whatever reason, didn\u2019t want what she offered. But she couldn\u2019t ignore him, not even for a moment.</p><p>As she watched him screw in the faceplate, her left cheek began to tingle oddly as it had as they\u2019d approached Lyon\u2019s office earlier. As before, it slowly began to sting. But where before, the sensation had died as quickly as it had begun, this time it worsened. She touched it, brushing at it in case there was something there, but she felt nothing.</p><p>All of a sudden, her cheek began to burn, and she gasped, dropping the lock pieces onto the floor.</p><p>Wulfe straightened as if he\u2019d been struck, rising to his feet, grabbing hold of her arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy face.\u201d She lifted her hand, afraid to touch it. \u201cWhat\u2019s on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He grabbed her jaw with careful fingers, turning it as the fire ripped through nerve endings, sending tears cascading down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d When she showed him, he covered the spot with one hand, pressing his palm against the fire as he cupped the back of her head with his other. Almost at once, the pain began to fade. To her surprise, she felt his lips against her forehead, a quick, soft kiss that melted her heart. Moments later, the pain was gone.</p><p>Natalie sagged with relief. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he released her and stepped back. As her gaze cleared, she saw, clearly, the dismay in his eyes, the worry.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Lifting her own palm to her cheek, she felt nothing but smooth skin, as if it had all been her imagination. \u201cEarlier, just before we went in to see Lyon, I felt the same sharp pain. It wasn\u2019t nearly this bad, and disappeared almost as soon as it started, but it was in the exact same spot.\u201d</p><p>He looked away before she could read the answers in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing.\u201d</p><p>But the quickness with which he\u2019d turned away made her suspect otherwise. It wasn\u2019t nothing. And though she couldn\u2019t be certain, she suspected he knew that very, very well.</p><p>Wulfe returned to his work, the drill\u2019s whine tearing at his eardrums as he dug out the place beneath the strike plate where the dead bolt would burrow. But while his hands worked, his mind spun. Why had Natalie suffered pain in the exact spot the Daemon had clawed her? She didn\u2019t remember the wound, not consciously. Was it some kind of subconscious recollection? He\u2019d never heard of such a thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another thought stopped him cold. What if this was the fault of his Daemon blood?</p><p>He turned off the drill and stared at the hole, unseeing. Goddess, what if he\u2019d done this to her? What if, thanks to his Daemon blood, he\u2019d accidentally hurt her by taking that wound?</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d hurt a woman he\u2019d only meant to help. The thought made him ill.</p> <p>A buzzing erupted suddenly in Wulfe\u2019s ears. As he frowned, red smoke began to curl around the edges of his vision. Rage barreled through him from out of nowhere. His confusion disappeared, drowned beneath the rush of red smoke that ignited a full-blown fury in his mind. The drill that had been in his hand suddenly shattered against the floor beside him and he felt his fangs dropping, his claws erupting. He leaped to his feet with a roar, searching for something . . . anything . . . to bear the brunt of this sudden, ferocious anger.</p><p>His gaze caught on the female who was backing away from him, terror in her eyes.</p><p>Natalie.</p><p>As quickly as it rose, the smoky haze dissipated from his vision, his mind clearing, leaving him stunned. Shocked.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s eyes took up her entire face, her skin pale as new snow as she stared at him, at the monster he must appear.</p> <p>His wolf howled with misery.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d The words came out deep and nearly unintelligible.</p><p>But, goddess. What just happened? He\u2019d lost himself. Even furious, that shouldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>His fangs and claws retracted as he stared at her. The need to reassure her swelled in his mind and chest, yet he was clueless how to do that because he didn\u2019t know what the fuck just happened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never hurt you, Natalie,\u201d he said, his voice still gruff. \u201cI need you to believe that.\u201d But was he certain? He could have killed her with a single swipe of his claws, and he wasn\u2019t at all sure he\u2019d have known what he was doing until it was too late. The thought turned his blood cold.</p><p>If he were smart, he\u2019d hand her over to someone else, right here, right now. Except the first thing anyone else would do was lock her up in the prisons, and he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her down there again.</p> <p>Slowly, the color returned to her face, the terror easing away. \u201cDid I do something to make you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Goddess, no.\u201d He turned away from her, pressing both hands against the wall. His gaze fell to the floor, to the disintegrated drill, and his knees went weak. What if he hadn\u2019t come back to himself in time?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what set me off. It wasn\u2019t you. The situation maybe\u2014that you\u2019re in danger. But not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . changed.\u201d Her voice wasn\u2019t steady, and it broke him.</p><p>Slowly, he straightened and turned back, forcing himself to meet her gaze. \u201cI went feral. All the Ferals do from time to time. In that in-between place, halfway between man and animal, we can fight as equals, no matter which animal we shift into. We enjoy fighting that way\u2014it\u2019s like a Feral form of wrestling, and we usually beat the shit out of one another. But we don\u2019t lose control like I did. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><p>Natalie watched him, her mouth tight. \u201cI\u2019m very good at reading people, Wulfe. And animals. I knew the first time I met you in your wolf form that you were a friend, and that you\u2019d never intentionally hurt me. I still believe that to be true.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. But he\u2019d caught the word intentionally, and that was what worried him, too. Because there was clearly something wrong. And the thought made him ill.</p><p>He swiftly finished installing the dead bolt, then turned to where Natalie now sat on the bed, exhaustion written all over her face.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to see Xavier tonight or wait until morning?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snapped open, her spine straightening. \u201cTonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him up.\u201d</p><p>Natalie nodded, and Wulfe left, locking the door behind him. His body felt leaden as he descended the stairs, as he saw again, in his mind\u2019s eye, the terror on Natalie\u2019s face. She\u2019d stared at him as if he were a monster.</p><p>He had to tell Lyon. Maybe his loss of control was due to the dark charm, but so far no one else had suffered such a breach of control. No, he feared the cause lay at the feet of his recently triggered Daemon blood. And if he was right?</p><p>He might soon turn into a monster for real.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Natalie could barely keep her eyes open, but she fought the pull of the soft bed as she waited for Wulfe to bring Xavier up to her room. The evening\u2019s events had begun to take on a dreamlike, perhaps nightmarelike, quality. And yet here she sat, for all practical purposes the captive of shape-shifters.</p><p>Good grief. Wulfe\u2019s face, as he\u2019d changed, had turned terrifying with those fangs and eyes that were not human, yet not quite wolflike. Especially when he\u2019d first turned toward her, furious, staring at her without recognition. She\u2019d honestly thought he was about to attack her.</p><p>Then he\u2019d recognized her. She\u2019d seen the moment it happened. He\u2019d looked so confused, so horrified, chagrin and shame filling those dark eyes. And she\u2019d ceased to be afraid despite the fangs. Wulfe had returned, regardless of the face he wore.</p><p>She heard the click of the dead bolt and rose from the bed as the door opened and Xavier entered, cane first.</p><p>\u201cNat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Xave.\u201d She strolled to him, speaking as she moved. \u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t already asleep.\u201d As her hand slid around her brother\u2019s arm, her gaze met Wulfe\u2019s. Her heart clenched at the misery that still swam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait outside,\u201d he said, then closed the door, leaving her alone with her brother.</p><p>Natalie led Xavier to the bed, then sat cross-legged while he stretched out on his back, his hands behind his head.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up, Nat?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a single burst of air. \u201cI can\u2019t decide if I feel more like Dorothy in Oz or Alice in Wonderland.\u201d</p><p>Xavier grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Natalie reached for him, her hand on his shoulder. \u201cAre you okay here, Xave? You\u2019re safe, right?\u201d She knew her brother would tell her the truth. If he didn\u2019t, she\u2019d know it anyway. He\u2019d never been able to hide his expressions, certainly not from her.</p><p>\u201cI love it here.\u201d He took her hand and held it, the Xavier equivalent of meeting her gaze. \u201cThe moment the Mage found us in Harpers Ferry, our death warrants were signed, Nat. Your friends and Mary Rose\u2019s brother died for real, killed by the Mage and the Daemons. It was a miracle that you and me and Christy survived. But all of our lives ended that day, at least the lives we had before. In a way, all our lives belong to the Ferals now. If not for them, we\u2019d have died. You don\u2019t remember what happened on that battlefield, which is good, but I do. The things I heard and smelled and felt that day still give me nightmares, Nat. If the Ferals lose this war, we\u2019ll all be living in constant terror. People will be dying by the thousands. And every doomsday prediction about civilization\u2019s collapse will come true.\u201d</p><p>Xavier sat up and turned to her, his face older and wiser than she\u2019d ever seen it. \u201cThis might not be what I\u2019d have chosen for my life. Cook\u2019s helper to a houseful of shape-shifters wasn\u2019t exactly in the career-options manual I read in high school. But I have a purpose here, a purpose I never had at home. Pink needs me. Even if she thinks she can do it on her own, she needs me. She\u2019s so cool, Nat, and the guys are great. Sure, they\u2019re kind of scary sometimes, like when they go feral and draw claws and start ripping into one another. But they\u2019re good guys. And their wives are really nice. If I could have chosen this life, Nat, I would have.\u201d</p><p>His face fell. \u201cI just wish I didn\u2019t have to give up everyone at home to live here. I miss you and Mom. I love that you\u2019re here now, but I don\u2019t want you to get stuck here, not when you have such a great life outside. Rick has to be worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Natalie sighed, hating to have to break the news. \u201cRick and I broke up this morning, Xave.\u201d</p><p>Xavier frowned. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was in love with him, but I wasn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t the man I wanted to spend my life with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nat,\u201d Xavier said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m just glad I figured it out before we got married.\u201d Even if nothing ever came of her attraction to Wulfe, the very fact that she\u2019d discovered it\u2014that she\u2019d awakened to the possibilities within her\u2014made it imperative that she find someone with whom she could feel that kind of excitement. Someone who, like Wulfe, would stir both her body and her emotions. And as much as she\u2019d enjoyed Rick\u2019s company, she knew now that he\u2019d done neither.</p><p>Natalie and Xavier talked for a while longer until a huge yawn caught her midsentence.</p><p>Xavier smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a crazy night, Nat. Get some sleep. We\u2019ll talk again tomorrow, and I\u2019ll introduce you to Pink.\u201d</p><p>Together, they climbed off the bed, and Natalie gave her brother another big hug, emotion welling all over again as she marveled at the miracle of his survival. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Xavier hugged her in return. \u201cBetter than okay. You\u2019re going to be fine, too.\u201d But as he pulled back, a frown pulled at the flesh between his eyebrows, and she knew he wasn\u2019t certain of that last statement. She was in a precarious position, a pawn in an immortal war. A dangerous place to be.</p><p>And they both knew it.</p><p>As he paced the hallway outside Natalie\u2019s room, Wulfe heard the soft rap of knuckles, the signal that Xavier was ready to return to the kitchen apartments. He unlocked the door and Natalie pulled it open, meeting his gaze with a soft, tired smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting us visit, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, struck speechless as he was every time he saw her, every time he fell into the calm gray of her lovely, lovely eyes.</p><p>Xavier kissed his sister\u2019s cheek. \u201cSleep tight, Sis.\u201d Then he smiled in Wulfe\u2019s direction, a worry in his eyes that dug at Wulfe\u2019s gut. Because it was a worry he shared in spades.</p><p>He was still shaken by what had happened, by the way he\u2019d lost control . . . lost time . . . when he\u2019d gone feral. And by the fact that Natalie was feeling pain from a wound he\u2019d taken from her completely. None of it made an ounce of sense.</p><p>As he accompanied Xavier downstairs, his skin crawled with the sick suspicion that it was somehow all his fault.</p><p>Entering the dining room, he found Kougar and Paenther sitting at the table, sharing a bottle of whiskey with Kougar\u2019s mate, Ariana, the Queen of the Ilinas. The two males rose when they saw him. As Xavier headed back to his room behind the kitchen, Wulfe greeted his friends warmly and was greeted in return. He nodded at Ariana, who flashed him a smile and pushed a plate of ham sandwiches toward him.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cPink brought them out a little while ago, and we\u2019ve already had our fill.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe sat beside Paenther. \u201cHow\u2019s Kara? Any change?\u201d</p><p>Paenther shook his head and poured him a finger of whiskey. \u201cShe\u2019s no worse, thank the goddess, but she\u2019s no better, either. The Shaman\u2019s convinced she won\u2019t recover until she brings a good Feral into his animal.\u201d</p><p>A month ago, Inir managed to free seventeen animal spirits that had been trapped for centuries, unable to mark new Feral Warriors. Seventeen animal spirits he\u2019d infected with a dark magic meant to force them to mark the worst, most evil of the line, not the best. An infection passed to the ones marked, trapping them beneath Inir\u2019s spell.</p><p>Some of the animal spirits had succeeded in thwarting the dark magic to mark good men. And Falkyn. Others hadn\u2019t. Wulfe and his Feral brothers had been ecstatic as their ranks began to swell after centuries of being only nine\u2014until the first batch of new shifters rose up against them and tried to kill them. Almost too late, they\u2019d realized Inir\u2019s plan\u2014to destroy the good Ferals and order the evil to free the Daemons in their place.</p><p>With the help of Ariana and the Shaman, they\u2019d managed to cure a few of the new Ferals from the poison passed to them through their infected animals, but they had no way of knowing for certain which of the males were the ones meant to be marked\u2014good men\u2014and which were, deep down, evil. The only one they were one hundred percent certain of was Falkyn, the lone female among them, and Hawke\u2019s new mate.</p><p>They\u2019d thought Grizz and Lepard to be honorable until the pair escaped. Six of the new Ferals belonged to Inir still, firmly under his spell. The rest were locked up in the Ferals\u2019 prison or hadn\u2019t shown up yet. No additional new Ferals would be brought into their animals until, and unless, the Ferals found a way to tell, conclusively, which were good men and which were evil, because bringing the evil ones into their animals was slowly killing Kara. One more, and they\u2019d lose her for good.</p><p>Wulfe grabbed a sandwich and turned to Ariana. \u201cHave you found anything?\u201d</p><p>In a T-shirt and jeans, her dark hair pulled back into a ponytail, Ariana looked far too human to be Ilina, a race whose Crystal Realm castle sat, literally, in the clouds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found a couple of ancient Mage rituals for dispelling Daemon magic that might possibly help reverse the dark charm that\u2019s turning all of you mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t work. There\u2019s another one you need to be looking for.\u201d Wulfe blinked, as startled by the words that had come from his mouth as his companions appeared to be.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Paenther asked evenly.</p><p>\u201cI have no fucking idea.\u201d But as he turned his thoughts inward, he knew he was right. He knew that no ancient Mage rituals would help them. No Mage had ever used this particular magic before. It was Daemon magic last used against the Nyads millennia ago. He turned back to Ariana. \u201cThe ritual you need to find is one the third Ilina queen witnessed near the end of the second Nyad War.\u201d His heart was beginning to race because not only was he starting to lose control, now alien knowledge was somehow invading his mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ariana watched him carefully. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll try to access that memory.\u201d</p><p>As his friends watched him in contemplative silence, Wulfe returned to his food, devouring his first sandwich, then reaching for a second. By the time Kougar finally broke that silence, Wulfe was about to crawl out of his skin.</p><p>\u201cI hear Xavier\u2019s sister is back with us.\u201d</p> <p>Wulfe nodded. Just what he wanted, the discussion turning from his own increasing weirdness to Natalie\u2019s. \u201cSomething\u2019s up with her,\u201d he told them. \u201cShe\u2019s acquired an odd aura. And a little while ago, the wound I healed on her face started hurting like the Daemon had just clawed her again.\u201d</p><p>All three of his companions frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat would cause that?\u201d Paenther asked, sipping his whiskey.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>Ariana reached halfway across the table, laying her palm flat on the gleaming surface. \u201cI\u2019ll add that to my search, Wulfe. If I come up with anything, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Wulfe finished his second sandwich, then said good night and left them before he started spouting more Daemon history. Goddess, he hated this.</p><p>No light shone beneath Natalie\u2019s door when he reached it, so he knocked lightly. When she didn\u2019t answer, he unlocked the dead bolt and opened the door wide enough for the hall light to illuminate her sleeping face above the sheet that covered her to the neck.</p><p>A rush of emotion swamped him\u2014tenderness, protectiveness. Possessiveness. Mine. She\u2019d been through so much, yet remained as solid and strong as hammered steel. She\u2019d make a fine mate for a warrior.</p><p>For the right warrior.</p><p>He stepped inside and closed the door behind him. Stripping out of his clothes, he shifted into his wolf and curled up on the rug beside Natalie\u2019s bed, as close as he could get to her without actually joining her. He didn\u2019t want to risk waking her.</p><p>Please, goddess, don\u2019t let Natalie suffer more pain when I\u2019m too far to hear her distress.</p> <p>He shouldn\u2019t have taken her wound a month ago. He hadn\u2019t planned to. Despite days in their prison, she\u2019d remained brave and stoic and so damned beautiful. And that wound on her cheek had made him ache every time he\u2019d looked at it. Finally, he hadn\u2019t been able to bear it any longer.</p><p>He remembered the moment so clearly. She\u2019d awakened and greeted him with a smile that had turned him on his tail. They\u2019d talked as she ate the meal Kara brought down to her, but then it had been time to try again to steal her memories of all she\u2019d seen. He\u2019d hesitated, knowing that once he took her memories, he\u2019d have to send her home. And he\u2019d just gotten the chance to talk to her again.</p><p>His gaze fell to that jagged cut on her cheek, his thumb lifting to trace it lightly.</p><p>Natalie flinched.</p><p>Wulfe jerked his thumb back. \u201cIt still hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too much.\u201d</p><p>Which was a blatant lie.</p><p>Her brows drew down. \u201cHow bad does it look?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot as bad as mine.\u201d</p><p>A genuine laugh escaped her throat, utterly delighting him. She caught herself with a groan, though wry humor continued to light her eyes and tug at her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that wasn\u2019t quite the reassurance I was looking for.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her, amazed at how easy she was to be with.</p><p>To his surprise, she lifted her hand, almost touching his face, before lowering it again. As she did, her smile died, her expression sobering. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for all you must have suffered.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d Without thinking too much about what he was doing, he made a decision. \u201cHold still. This may be uncomfortable for a moment, but I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d When her eyes gave him the go-ahead, he said, \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated only a moment before doing as he asked. He opened his hand, covering her wound and half her face with his palm.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>Beneath his palm, her heart beat, throbbing beneath the surface of her skin. Once more, her scent wrapped around him like a warm summer breeze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m something of a healer.\u201d Sometimes. His own cheek began to burn and throb with surprising misery. How did humans stand the pain that took so long to go away? \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pain\u2019s gone.\u201d Her voice held a note of wonder.</p><p>Lifting his hand, he peered at her cheekbone with keen satisfaction. The wound was gone completely now, her cheek unblemished.</p><p>She opened her eyes, blinking. \u201cHow did you . . . ?\u201d Her gaze locked onto his cheek, onto the throbbing, aching wound he knew to be there, now. Her hand flew to her own cheek, then rubbed, as if seeking . . . anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe shrugged. \u201cWhat\u2019s one more?\u201d</p><p>But he saw no gratitude in her eyes, only a keen dismay. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Her brows knitting, she grabbed his face between her hands without fear, staring at him, at the cut that would mark him as all the others had. To his amazement, her fingers slid gently over his scarred cheeks. \u201cYou took it.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was breathless, stunned. She stared up at him, pain in her eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, confused by her reaction. The last thing he\u2019d meant to do was upset her. But the truth was, he didn\u2019t have an answer. He wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d done it. Maybe he just didn\u2019t like seeing her suffer when he could help. Or maybe he hadn\u2019t liked the sight of that ugly scar on her pretty face.</p><p>What difference did it make? Women were so damn hard to please.</p><p>He turned away, breaking her soft hold on him and ending the discussion. \u201cLie down.\u201d The words came out harsher than he\u2019d meant them to.</p><p>But when he turned back to her, she was still standing where he\u2019d left her, still staring at him. Although her brows remained drawn, her eyes no longer flashed with pain but something infinitely softer.</p><p>\u201cWill you heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll scar you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, what\u2019s one more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty.\u201d The softness in her eyes deepened, a fine film of moisture making them shine like diamonds. \u201cThat may have been the most unselfish thing anyone\u2019s ever done for me. And I don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>Understanding lit her gaze, the memory of watching him shift, he was certain. \u201cI suppose that makes sense. Thank you, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his jaw tight. Then he slid his hand to her neck and pressed beneath her ear, feeling a need to close those eyes that saw too much. As she fell unconscious, he caught her, then laid her down carefully on one of the pallets someone had brought down for the prisoners.</p><p>Straightening, he stared down at her, clenching his jaw at her now-unblemished beauty.</p><p>With a burst of self-disgust, he\u2019d turned away, because nothing good had ever come from his healing gift.</p><p>Now, a month later, he was more worried than ever that in taking her pain, he\u2019d inadvertently hurt her more.</p><p>He sank his chin on his paws and gave a low, miserable whine.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Natalie woke to the sound of Wulfe\u2019s calling her name. Blinking against the brilliant sunlight pouring into the room, she turned her head to find him filling the doorway, watching her with those liquid eyes.</p><p>A small flutter of pleasure filled her chest, making her smile. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged at his mouth, and that flutter of pleasure intensified. She was coming to love those smiles of his. And, oh, he was a sight to wake up to. He wore a T-shirt today, tucked into his jeans, the first time she\u2019d seen him fully dressed, but the soft fabric did nothing to hide the fine, fine shape of his broad chest, narrow hips, and thick, muscular arms. His golden armband curled around his biceps just below one sleeve.</p><p>If only he\u2019d join her in the bed. If only he wanted to.</p><p>In one hand, he held a small silver laptop. She sat up, letting the sheet fall to her waist. \u201cIs that mine?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHawke modified it, disabling the GPS along with your ability to get online.\u201d He gave her a rueful smile. \u201cSorry. Lyon\u2019s rules.\u201d His gaze dropped briefly to her chest, to her sleeveless cotton nightgown, then rose again all too quickly. If the sight in any way intrigued him, she couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cLyon says you can make the calls to your mom and your assistant, but not alone, and not here. We don\u2019t want the signal tracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I assume you have my phone?\u201d It was no longer in her purse.</p><p>\u201cWe have it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t blame them for being so cautious. No good could come of humans\u2019 getting involved in the Ferals\u2019 war. She was certain of that.</p><p>Wulfe crossed his arms over that powerful chest. \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing a power raising soon. I thought you might enjoy watching it. We\u2019ll be shifting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of you?\u201d At the thought of watching them change into all those marvelous animals her eyes went wide, and she found herself grinning. \u201cI\u2019d love to watch.\u201d Flinging back the sheet, she swung her legs over the side of the bed and stood up. \u201cHow much time do I have?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s gaze made a slow, gratifying trail down her body to her legs, bared beneath the hem of her short nightie. Pleasure shimmered through her that he was at least looking.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to wait here while I dress?\u201d she asked, striding to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word snapped out, his expression turning almost pained. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for you in thirty.\u201d He disappeared out the door, half slamming it behind him.</p><p>Natalie glanced at the closed door, bemused. Perhaps the man wasn\u2019t as uninterested as he appeared. She could only hope.</p><p>Wulfe leaned back against the wall outside Natalie\u2019s bedchamber, searching for his breath. The sight of her in that nightgown, the soft cotton skimming her curves, hiding, teasing, enticing. Goddess. His mind was on fire even if his body was too damaged to respond. With her cheeks pink from sleep, her golden hair a tousled halo about her head, she\u2019d looked like an angel\u2014a sexy-as-hell angel. At one time, he\u2019d have been burning to pull her beneath him. His cock would have been thick and throbbing, his pulse racing. Now it was only his mind that imagined, and longed, and wanted. And, goddess, how he wanted. He shoved himself away from the wall and started down the hallway, that vision of long, long legs and slender curves caressed by soft cotton burned into his mind.</p><p>With effort, he turned his thoughts back to the situation at hand. So far, Ariana had been unable to find any reference to the second Nyad War in the storage facility that was her Ilina queen\u2019s brain. Of course, perhaps there had never been a second Nyad War, and he\u2019d dreamed up the whole thing. How was he supposed to verify the veracity of information he shouldn\u2019t even know? The whole thing made his gut cramp.</p><p>As he approached the dining room, Fox strode out through the doorway, a pair of large cloth bags hanging from each of his fists.</p><p>\u201cGive me a hand, boyo?\u201d Fox asked with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve drawn short straw for the prison run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Wulfe backtracked and opened the door to the basement, then took one of Fox\u2019s bags. He knew from experience they were filled with food and drink for their prisoners.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Jag this morning?\u201d Wulfe asked as he followed Fox down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAye. He seems to be fine. No change.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe nodded, more relieved than he wanted to admit. None of them knew how long they had to live once they lost their animals.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear about the female watching the place?\u201d Together, they crossed the gym toward the hidden door at the back.</p><p>\u201cMage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Either human or Therian. She parked her car along the road and was just starting up the drive when Vhyper spotted her. Before he could call for backup, in case it was some kind of trap, she lifted her hand, and yelled, \u2018Wrong house,\u2019 then backtracked to her car and drove away.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe looked at him as he followed Fox through the door and into the long stone passage that led to the prisons. \u201cWhat about that set off Vhyper\u2019s alarm bells?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in particular. Not until he asked one of the Ilinas to follow and see where she went, and she drove straight out of the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe frowned. \u201cIf she\u2019d really approached the wrong house, she should have searched for the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, boyo. Precisely what Vhyper thought. We\u2019re wondering if she\u2019s a newly marked Feral who lost her nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the Ilina stay with her long enough to know where she went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Apparently tailing a vehicle while in mist form is extremely taxing. Lyon\u2019s ordered the Ilinas to notify him immediately if either the vehicle or the woman are spotted again.\u201d</p><p>Together, they entered the prison block where three newly marked Ferals languished in separate cells. None had been brought into his animal. They didn\u2019t know any of the three well enough to be able to guess whether or not they were the ones their animal spirits had meant to mark. They could be either good or evil, and choosing wrong would sign Kara\u2019s death warrant.</p><p>Wulfe set down his bag in front of Castin\u2019s cell and pulled out three individually wrapped foot-long subs. Straightening, he handed them to the male through the bars.</p><p>\u201cAny news?\u201d Castin asked. Of all of the prisoners, Castin seemed the most accepting of his fate. From what they could tell, he was by far the oldest among them, possibly as ancient as the Shaman. He\u2019d helped in the rescue of Kara from Inir\u2019s stronghold, then returned to Feral House willingly, expressing his displeasure at being locked up with a tight jaw and little more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they\u2019d first dragged this latest group of new Ferals down here, they\u2019d discussed whether they should keep them in the dark about what was going on. The trouble was, they empathized with these men. And if the day came when they could free this group, bring them into their animals, and call them \u201cbrother,\u201d they wanted to know they\u2019d treated them as fairly as possible under these very trying circumstances.</p><p>\u201cInir is attempting to turn the blood he stole from Kara into unascended Radiant\u2019s blood,\u201d Wulfe told Castin. If their situations had been reversed, he\u2019d be hungry for information, too. \u201cIt\u2019s the prime ingredient he needs to open the Daemon Blade once the Ferals cease to register, but you probably know that as well as anyone.\u201d</p><p>Just as a Feral had to be brought into his animal through ritual, so too did a new Radiant have to be ascended to her power. Months ago, Inir had arranged for their previous Radiant, Beatrice, to be killed so that the new one could be blooded before she was ascended, and that blood used to open the Daemon Blade. Not until the last minute had the Ferals figured out what was happening and thwarted that scheme.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing to stop Inir?\u201d Rikkert demanded from the next cell. The male had been bad-tempered from the moment he\u2019d arrived.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working to get our immortality back, boyo,\u201d Fox answered. \u201cJag lost the shift, or didn\u2019t you hear? He can no longer access his animal. Inir has us over a barrel until we can reverse the effects of his dark charm.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe passed three sandwiches to Rikkert, then moved to the last cell. The third male had arrived at Feral House a little over a week ago, hailing from Kenya. He\u2019d said little when they\u2019d explained the situation and forced him into the prison. He\u2019d said nothing since. Wulfe didn\u2019t even know his name.</p><p>The male rose and took the sandwiches with a nod, his dark eyes piercing, his expression enigmatic.</p><p>\u201cOne other thing,\u201d Fox said as he handed out water bottles to the three prisoners. \u201cWe got a call from Lepard. Apparently he and Grizz are out West somewhere hunting for a woman who\u2019s said to be able to see into a man\u2019s soul. If they find her, they\u2019ll bring her to us. Hopefully, she\u2019ll be able to tell us which of our new Ferals were meant to be marked.\u201d</p> <p>Wulfe looked at him with surprise. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re helping in their own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Castin said something in a language Wulfe didn\u2019t recognize, a fervent string of words that sounded like a prayer of thanksgiving. Rikkert just grunted. The newest Feral said nothing, as usual.</p><p>Wulfe led the way back upstairs, feeling more hopeful for the males in the prison than he had on the way down. Being marked to be a Feral Warrior, to finally, after a lifetime, be able to shift as you were born to do, should be the greatest of honors. Wulfe himself had found absolution and salvation in his own marking.</p><p>\u201cDaemon?\u201d The word brushed across Wulfe\u2019s mind, startling him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, boyo?\u201d Fox asked behind him.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Fuck. He waited for it to happen again, but he heard nothing more. What in the hell was happening?</p><p>The only thing he knew absolutely, positively for certain . . . it was far from nothing.</p><p>Natalie stood at the window, gazing at the vehicles that lined the Ferals\u2019 circular drive\u2014a bright yellow Hummer, a white Land Rover, and a low-slung sports car that she thought might be a Lamborghini, among them\u2014as she waited for Wulfe to collect her for the spirit raising. Beyond the drive, the woods rose on all sides, and not far beyond them, she knew, lay the Potomac River and the horizontal falls for which Great Falls had been named.</p><p>She wondered if she\u2019d ever be allowed to leave the house, to see them again. Xavier\u2019s days of freedom were over, and the knowledge made her ache. No matter how happy he seemed to be, he was trapped here, unable to leave for fear of being recognized. He might never leave this house again.</p><p>But he was alive. Dear God, her brother was alive. Despite her concerns, her heart soared. She\u2019d awakened to a bright, sunny day, to the sight of a gorgeous male with the sweetest smile, and in the house where Xavier now lived. It was a glorious day, and she would rejoice in every single moment.</p><p>The rap she\u2019d been waiting for finally sounded on her door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she called, turning away from the window. She was halfway across the room when the door swung open.</p> <p>Wulfe\u2019s gaze skimmed her body, taking in her jeans, her green T-shirt with the pretty detailing, and her sandals, setting off little flares of warmth along the way. Slowly, he looked up, meeting her gaze, a smile in his eyes that burrowed deep down inside her. Other men had looked at her over the years, but never before had she felt as if they really saw her. And Wulfe did.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked, a smile pulling at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d Natalie returned his smile as she joined him. The warmth of his body wrapped around her, his masculine scent filling her nostrils. As they started down the hall, side by side, electricity arced through the air between them, making Natalie catch her breath. Glancing at Wulfe, she found him watching her with eyes that leaped with an answering awareness.</p><p>Natalie swallowed.</p><p>Wulfe frowned and took her arm, gently pulling her around to face him. Slowly, he lifted his hand, his knuckles caressing her cheek, making her pulse race and her body melt with longing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you what you want,\u201d he said, his voice low, rough, aching. With fingers shaking ever so slightly, he stroked her neck. \u201cI can\u2019t make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u201cOr don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d He leaned in, his nose brushing the curve of her neck, his soft, fragrant hair caressing her cheek, sending her pulse into overdrive. He made a sound deep in his throat, half-human, half-wolf, a low rumble of pleasure. It took every bit of control she possessed not to weave her fingers into his hair and lift his face for her kiss.</p><p>He pulled away suddenly with a look of chagrin. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for us,\u201d he said gruffly, and started back down the hall.</p><p>Natalie caught up to him, more confused than before, yet elated. Wulfe wanted her. Something was holding him back, but he wanted her. And that was all she needed to know.</p><p>Her step was light as they reached the stairs and started down. \u201cAfter this ritual, do you think we can scare up a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll grab it on the way out.\u201d</p><p>As they reached the foyer, they had to merge with the steady stream of people passing by.</p><p>\u201cQuite a crowd today,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>One of the women heard her and smiled. \u201cThe Guards have been invited to watch the Ferals shift. We wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe and Natalie joined the stream, following the others down the hall and into the dining room. Through the back windows, Natalie caught a glimpse of a brick patio and heavily treed yard quickly filling with people.</p><p>\u201cDo I have time to say hello to Xavier?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. They won\u2019t start without me. And Lyon hasn\u2019t brought Kara down, yet.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe led her to the swinging door she\u2019d watched Xavier come through last night, and into a first-class kitchen with granite countertops and gleaming appliances. Xavier was busy kneading dough. The joy that pulsed inside of her as her gaze took in his beloved, contented face was so great it was a moment before she noticed the extraordinary creature standing behind him, stirring a pot on the stove. The woman appeared to be part human, part bird, with . . . my God . . . pink feathers instead of skin.</p><p>The bird-woman turned and stared at Natalie. In unblinking bird-shaped eyes, Natalie saw a terrible self-consciousness, an almost palpable fear of rejection. Empathy curled around her heart. This was clearly Pink.</p><p>\u201cX, your sister\u2019s here,\u201d Wulfe said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nat!\u201d Her brother turned toward the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Xave.\u201d But her gaze remained riveted on those tense, unblinking eyes. Natalie smiled. \u201cYou must be Pink. You have quite a fan in my brother. I\u2019m happy to finally make your acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>Xavier reached for the bird-woman without hesitation, his hand clasping a feathered arm. \u201cPink, this is my sister, Natalie. And, yeah, I\u2019m a fan. Pink does all the cooking and cleaning around here, or she used to when there weren\u2019t so many people. I\u2019m her helper, now.\u201d</p><p>Natalie met Pink\u2019s gaze with a rueful look. \u201cThis place is mobbed. I don\u2019t know how you do it all, even with help.\u201d</p><p>Pink\u2019s stiffness eased a little. \u201cMost of our guests are temporary, and we\u2019re managing. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet Xavier\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure is all mine. I\u2019m delighted that Xavier has you as a friend, Pink.\u201d The truth of that statement hit her hard, because it was more than clear that a good deal of the reason Xavier radiated such contentment with his captivity was due to Pink. She met the woman\u2019s gaze, letting her see her thoughts and emotion. \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she said quietly, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to watch the Ferals shift this morning, Nat?\u201d Her brother launched into one of his dear and familiar rambles. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool when they shift, though a little scary when they fight like that, but then they\u2019re best friends again, usually, except for the evil Ferals, but they\u2019re all with Inir, now, or maybe in the prisons below Feral House. We\u2019re not sure about those guys. It was scary as shit when the evil Ferals attacked. We weren\u2019t sure what they were going to do. Pink and I hid, then the bad guys ran to Inir, and the good guys finally healed and came back.\u201d</p><p>Natalie shook her head with a smile. \u201cYou must be a good listener, Pink, because my brother can talk the ears off an elephant. Mom likes to tease that he came out of the womb talking, that she had to buy him a pacifier just to get a little quiet.\u201d</p><p>Xavier laughed at the old joke. \u201cWhat can I say? Active mind, active mouth.\u201d</p><p>As the two women\u2019s gazes met, Natalie watched a small smile form on that remarkable face. \u201cI enjoy Xavier\u2019s thoughts. He\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>Gratitude welled up inside Natalie, and she started around the island that separated her from the pair, talking as she went so that Xavier could follow her movement. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re happy here, Xave.\u201d Natalie gave her brother a hard hug, meeting Pink\u2019s gaze over his shoulder. Thank you, she mouthed, earning a sweet smile.</p><p>As she released her brother, Pink held out her hand to her. \u201cI am very pleased to meet you, Natalie.\u201d</p><p>Natalie took that soft, feathered hand between both of hers. \u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to go,\u201d Wulfe said from the doorway. \u201cLater, X and Pink.\u201d</p><p>Natalie followed him back to the dining room. As the kitchen door swung closed behind them, she glanced at Wulfe. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>He watched her with eyes like velvet. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice called softly from a short distance away.</p><p>Wulfe turned. \u201cKara.\u201d</p><p>Lyon slowed his walk through the dining room, the woman in his arms holding out her hand toward Natalie. She appeared wan, with dark circles under her eyes, her blond hair pulled back in a lifeless ponytail. But as she gazed at Natalie, she smiled warmly.</p><p>Natalie took the proffered hand. \u201cYou must be Kara. Wulfe says we met the last time I was here, but I\u2019m afraid I have no memory of that visit.\u201d</p><p>Kara\u2019s smile turned rueful. \u201cThat\u2019s what they were hoping. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been pulled back into all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d And she realized that was true. \u201cI know I probably won\u2019t be able to keep these memories, either, but it\u2019s worth everything to see my brother again and see him so happy.\u201d She glanced at Wulfe, a welling of pleasure filling her chest. \u201cThis is turning out to be quite an adventure.\u201d</p><p>Kara laughed. \u201cEverything the Ferals touch turns into an adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d a Feral she hadn\u2019t met said, joining them from the hallway. \u201cI\u2019d say everything we touch turns into a goat fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJag, watch your language,\u201d Lyon snapped.</p><p>The shaggy-haired warrior grinned unrepentantly. \u201cSorry, ladies. I just call \u2019em like I see \u2019em. Are we ready to start this war dance? The sooner Kara stops looking like death warmed over, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jag.\u201d Kara met Natalie\u2019s gaze with a wry smile.</p><p>Jag leaned over and kissed Kara\u2019s cheek, his gaze turning stone-cold serious. \u201cI mean it, little lightbulb. I want you getting better. That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Jag.\u201d Kara looped her free arm around his neck and pressed her cheek to his. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>When Jag had stepped back, Wulfe reached for Kara\u2019s hand and brought it to his lips, earning himself a sweet smile. Then Lyon started forward again, heading for the back doors. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe grabbed Natalie\u2019s hand and led her to the sideboard laden with coffee mugs and industrial-sized coffeepots. \u201cFirst things first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, thank you.\u201d She threw him a grin as she grabbed one of the cups and was rewarded with a pleased smile.</p><p>\u201cHow many will actually take part in this?\u201d she asked, pouring herself a cup of the steaming brew.</p><p>\u201cTen Ferals and Kara since the purpose of the power raising is to strengthen her.\u201d</p><p>When Natalie had filled her mug, Wulfe ushered her out the back door and onto a wide brick patio ringed by azalea and forsythia bushes growing in abandon. The morning was warm, the humidity reasonably comfortable, and the sky bright blue above the trees. In the middle of the open yard, a male with a close-cut mustache and goatee lifted his hands to the sky and murmured words too low to hear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKougar is calling a feral circle,\u201d Wulfe told her. \u201cThe entire back of the house will be warded once he does, so even if one of the neighboring humans walks through, they\u2019ll neither see nor hear anything. Wait here.\u201d He stepped forward, joining the other men, all of whom were incredibly well built, though not a one held a candle to Wulfe.</p><p>\u201cHi, Natalie.\u201d Delaney came to join her, along with another woman, an attractive brunette with eyes almost as bright a blue as Melisande\u2019s. \u201cNatalie, Julianne,\u201d Delaney said, by way of introduction.</p><p>\u201cHi, Julianne.\u201d Natalie shook hands with the woman, but her gaze immediately returned to the Feral who\u2019d caught her eye\u2014a male currently stripping out of his clothes, right there in front of everyone. Lyon was doing the same.</p> <p>\u201cThe nudity takes a little getting used to,\u201d Delaney murmured, amusement in her voice. \u201cJust one of the many perks of life with a bunch of shape-shifters.\u201d</p><p>Natalie snorted, her gaze following Wulfe\u2019s movements, admiring the perfection of his now-bare back and shoulders and watching with fascination as he pulled his jeans down and off. Her breath caught. His butt and legs were like sculpted marble, truly glorious to behold. How could a flesh-and-blood male be so beautiful, so perfectly formed?</p><p>\u201cAdmiring the view?\u201d Delaney asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Every time I see it.\u201d</p><p>Delaney made a sound of surprise. \u201cSomething already going on between you two?\u201d</p> <p>Lyon had settled Kara on a lawn chair, and now all the males, either shirtless or naked, made a wide circle around her. Each of them had a golden armband snaked around one thick biceps, Natalie realized.</p><p>\u201cWhen the Mage attacked, he shifted a couple of times,\u201d she told Delaney.</p><p>Julianne groaned. \u201cAnd you\u2019re human. That must have been a shock.\u201d</p><p>Natalie smiled. \u201cYou could say that. I\u2019d met the wolf before and had already fallen in love with him. Finding out he was really a man, a shifter, was definitely a shock. But at least I\u2019d already come to trust him. He saved my life, attacking the Mage sentinels who\u2019d been sent to capture me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m officially a fan, Natalie,\u201d Delaney said quietly, seriously. \u201cIf you can handle all that and not fall apart, you\u2019re rock solid.\u201d</p><p>Natalie looked at her thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve been having some strange dreams since . . . the incident\u2014the Daemons. I\u2019m beginning to think I\u2019ve been dreaming about that day even if I don\u2019t remember much of it. What happened last night was shocking of course, but I didn\u2019t have much trouble accepting it. I suppose, subconsciously, I already knew about shape-shifters and the Mage.\u201d</p> <p>Delaney nodded. \u201cThat makes a lot of sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere they go,\u201d Julianne said breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Feral shift.\u201d</p><p>All three women turned their attention back to the shifters. Natalie watched as Kougar pulled out a wicked-looking knife.</p><p>\u201cSmall cuts only,\u201d Lyon commanded. \u201cAnd to your palms, not your chests.\u201d</p><p>Several of the shifters made sounds of disgust.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not healing,\u201d Delaney said, her voice low and tight.</p><p>One by one, the shifters cut their palms, then thrust those fisted hands into the air. As Wulfe cut his own, his gaze found Natalie\u2019s and held, a look in his eyes that, for once, she couldn\u2019t read. A touch of pride, perhaps, that he belonged in that elite, mythic circle. Or perhaps a pinch of concern that she might be put off by the strangeness of it all. Maybe a little of both.</p><p>\u201cHe likes you,\u201d Delaney murmured beside her.</p> <p>\u201cI like him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d It wasn\u2019t a casual question.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. He absolutely is. But he\u2019s been dealt a rough hand.\u201d</p><p>Natalie met the other woman\u2019s gaze. \u201cAre you ready to tell me more, now?\u201d</p><p>Delaney watched her assessingly. \u201cWhen a new Radiant is marked, one of the Ferals is chosen as her mate. It happens during a ritual, all very mystical. Wulfe was the one chosen for the previous Radiant, Beatrice. From what I\u2019ve heard, Beatrice was selfish and shallow and threw a tantrum that the goddess chose the scarred Feral for her.\u201d</p><p>Natalie winced. \u201cOh, Wulfe. That\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe says Wulfe loved her, at least at first. The goddess gave him no choice but to love her. But he suffered for almost a century and a half with a mate who . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t complete the sentence, but Natalie heard the rest. \u201cNine months ago, Beatrice died, leaving Wulfe in even worse shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe misses her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I honestly don\u2019t think he does. But the mating bond between immortals is a real, physical bond that, when broken, often damages, if not destroys, the one left behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems . . . okay.\u201d</p><p>Delaney nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not sure in what way it hurt him. Only that Tighe says it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there no healing from such an injury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Natalie watched Wulfe as he thrust his hand into the air alongside his companions, aching for all he\u2019d been through. \u201cHow could Beatrice not see past his scars? I barely see them anymore, and I\u2019ve known him less than a day. He is so beautiful,\u201d she breathed. \u201cInside and out.\u201d</p><p>Delaney\u2019s hand landed on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Natalie. Very, very glad.\u201d</p><p>Natalie met the other woman\u2019s gaze with a smile. \u201cMe, too.\u201d Though her being there might be a very short-lived thing.</p><p>As the last of the Feral Warriors thrust his fist in the air, the bearded Feral began to chant. \u201cSpirits rise and join. Empower the beasts beneath this sky.\u201d</p><p>The other Ferals joined in the chant, their voices low at first, then louder and louder. Goose bumps raced along Natalie\u2019s arms. Lightning flashed. The ground beneath her feet began to tremble.</p><p>Eyes widening, Natalie glanced at Delaney and Julianne.</p><p>\u201cWatch, Natalie,\u201d Delaney whispered.</p><p>She did, turning back to the Ferals as excitement and energy pressed all around her.</p><p>\u201cEmpower the spirit of . . .\u201d they called in unison.</p><p>\u201cThe wolf!\u201d Wulfe yelled.</p><p>His brothers . . . and sister . . . all named their own animals. \u201cThe hawk! The falcon! The tiger! The cougar!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, most of them disappeared in that familiar explosion of sparkling lights to be replaced, seconds later, by incredible, magnificent animals\u2014a glorious African lion, a magnificent Bengal tiger, a sleek black panther, and a huge red fox. Two birds of prey sat among the larger animals as their animal kin would never dare. And the wolf she was coming to adore stood with them.</p><p>But the bald Feral\u2014a male she hadn\u2019t met\u2014shouted with a mix of fury and agony and remained human. Kougar, too, threw back his head, his body going rigid as he failed to shift. And Jag stood, fully clothed, eyeing the other two with frustration and misery.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Delaney said beside her, her voice laced with real fear. \u201cKougar and Vhyper now, too.\u201d</p><p>Remain in your animals. Lyon\u2019s voice rang in Natalie\u2019s head as Wulfe\u2019s did when he was in his animal. Concentrate on your Radiant. Share your energy with her.</p><p>The animals milled about the circle, several nudging Kara or laying their heads in her lap. Finally, Lyon shifted back to human and the others followed, one by one. Natalie watched Wulfe shift back, then walk over to clasp the bald Feral\u2019s shoulder. A pall had fallen, dark and heavy, on the gathering. Lyon lifted Kara into his arms, then approached the two warriors who\u2019d failed to shift, his eyes filled with a throbbing regret.</p><p>\u201cI never thought the ritual would do harm.\u201d</p><p>Kougar\u2019s face was pale. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have if our connections to our animals weren\u2019t already close to shattering. This wasn\u2019t your fault, Roar.\u201d</p><p>Lyon nodded, but his mouth remained tight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than just losing their animals, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Natalie asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cFerals who can\u2019t shift, ultimately die.\u201d Though Delaney\u2019s words were matter-of-fact, Natalie heard the underlying thread of fear.</p><p>Natalie reached for Delaney\u2019s hand and gave it a squeeze, her gaze finding Wulfe where he stood with his friends. How could so much power and beauty, so much goodness and gentleness, be snuffed out just like that? It was wrong on so many levels. The Feral Warriors, these powerful immortals, might soon be no more. And while she understood that the ramifications of that were far greater than the loss of a handful of fine, strong males, that was the only part of it that she could truly wrap her mind around.</p><p>As she watched Wulfe pull on his jeans, then grab his T-shirt and turn to her with eyes as deep as the ocean, she knew her loss would be far, far more personal.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Wulfe pulled his T-shirt on over his head, the summer sun caressing the back of his neck through the trees even as his heart pounded with misery. And dread. Kougar and Vhyper, like Jag, were now cut off from their animals. Three Ferals unable to shift.</p><p>Deep inside, Wulfe\u2019s own animal howled with anger and fear that he\u2019d soon be next, and Wulfe had no words of comfort to offer. Because, for all he knew, the animal was right.</p><p>All around him, his brothers\u2019 mates flocked to their sides. As Ariana took form at Kougar\u2019s, the stoic, often silent male pulled her hard against him, burying his face in her hair. Olivia slid into Jag\u2019s arms. Of the three now-nonshifting Ferals, only Vhyper stood alone without a mate to offer comfort. Without a mate to leave behind in pain and misery, if the worst happened. If they all died.</p><p>Beside him, Fox wrapped Melisande in his arms.</p><p>Two more Feral lights have gone out, my lord. Soon all will be doused, and the Daemons will rise.</p><p>Wulfe froze at the now-familiar sound of Inir\u2019s voice in his head.</p><p>Hail the Daemons, my lord.</p><p>Hail the Daemons.</p><p>A chill rippled over Wulfe\u2019s flesh, his gaze seeking Natalie, where she now stood beside Julianne and Zeeland. Behind them, the Therian Guards returned to the house, heads down, their mood respectfully somber.</p><p>Natalie watched him with worried gray eyes\u2014eyes filled with compassion and strength. The sun sparkled on her hair, turning it to spun gold, the brightness making her aura pale by comparison. She was so pretty, it made him ache. Especially when she flashed him a soft gray-eyes smile that arrowed straight to his heart.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s into you, boyo,\u201d Fox said quietly beside him, Melisande in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI saved her from the Mage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a thing or two about female smiles, Wulfe, and that one is as warm and welcoming as any I\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p><p>At Fox\u2019s grunt, Wulfe turned to find Melisande looking up at her mate with an eyebrow raised, yet softness in her eyes. \u201cAs any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for your smiles, my love.\u201d Fox lifted his hand and stroked his Ilina wife\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Wulfe turned away, the raw tenderness between them too private. Instead, he gave in to the need to be close to Natalie. As he neared, she reached for him, and he took her hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, squeezing her fingers around his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still shifting.\u201d</p><p>Frown lines formed between her pretty brows. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this is happening, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVhyper, wait,\u201d Lyon called. Wulfe glanced up to find the warrior turning back a few feet from the door. \u201cThe Shaman would like to examine you, Jag, and Kougar.\u201d</p><p>With a curt nod, Vhyper returned to the yard and the others, coming to a halt before the Shaman. But, while Vhyper towered over the much smaller male, the Shaman had never been intimidated by any of the Ferals, and he waved his hands, reaching up to touch Vhyper\u2019s bald head. With a frown, the Shaman turned to Kougar and did the same, then to Jag.</p><p>By the time the ancient male turned to face Lyon, all eyes were upon him.</p><p>\u201cTheir animals are not gone,\u201d the Shaman explained. The hope his words created were dashed with his next utterance. \u201cAs yet. A wall has been erected between each man and his animal spirit, a wall that is disintegrating the connection and will ultimately sever it permanently.\u201d</p><p>And once those connections were broken, the men would die.</p><p>\u201cHow long do they have?\u201d Lyon asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Jag\u2019s connection feels no less strong than the other two, so I would venture to say there\u2019s been no significant deterioration during the past hours. It might be months. Or only days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when we\u2019re gone,\u201d Hawke said, his expression bleak, \u201cInir will free the Daemons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe before then.\u201d Still holding Natalie\u2019s hand, Wulfe moved toward them, pulling her with him. \u201cInir and Satanan are feeling our lights go out, as they put it. They know that three of us have ceased to register as Ferals. They\u2019re waiting for the rest of us to do the same.\u201d</p><p>Low murmurs of surprise and dismay peppered the group.</p><p>\u201cSo they don\u2019t even need our deaths to free the Daemons,\u201d Vhyper growled. \u201cThey just need us to lose our animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this rate, that could happen before nightfall,\u201d Tighe muttered.</p><p>Kougar stroked his beard. \u201cThey still need unascended Radiant\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich they\u2019re working to create,\u201d Paenther countered. He looked at Wulfe. \u201cThey haven\u2019t succeeded?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe shook his head. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>Lyon turned to Ariana, who stood tight against Kougar\u2019s side. \u201cWe need that ritual.\u201d</p><p>The queen of the Ilinas nodded. \u201cI\u2019m working on it, Lyon.\u201d Her expression turned resolute. \u201cI will find it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lyon nodded, but Wulfe saw the fear in his eyes, the fear that Ariana would be too late. A fear they all shared.</p><p>The mood was somber as Wulfe and Natalie entered the dining room again. Wulfe led her back to the kitchen, where Pink and Xavier worked.</p><p>Pink looked up as they entered, her expression tight. \u201cWhat happened, Wulfe? I heard Vhyper\u2019s unhappiness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe and Kougar have both lost their animals, now, too.\u201d</p><p>Odd bird eyes filled with misery. Natalie wouldn\u2019t have thought such eyes would be so expressive, but she had no more trouble reading them than she did anyone else\u2019s.</p><p>Xavier frowned. \u201cDude, that\u2019s not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Natalie needs some breakfast, X.\u201d</p><p>Xavier\u2019s expression changed lightning-fast as it so often did. \u201cI made Mom\u2019s banana-nut pancakes for Pink this morning, and I have some leftover batter, Nat. They used to be your favorites.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey still are. So you\u2019re cooking for the chef, now?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cHey, someone has to. She\u2019s so busy cooking for everyone else, she forgets to eat.\u201d Xavier poured the batter onto the griddle. How he knew where things were when he couldn\u2019t see them, she\u2019d never understood. \u201cSo, what did you think of watching the Ferals shift into their animals? You should have been here when Maxim shifted into a saber-toothed cat. That was awesome. The noises he made weren\u2019t anything like you\u2019d expect from a cat. He\u2019s dead now\u2014he was a seriously evil dude\u2014but there will be another saber-tooth. Eventually, there will be twenty-six Ferals in all.\u201d</p><p>She watched Wulfe as Xavier talked, saw the way his mouth tightened at twenty-six and suspected she knew what he was thinking. Twenty-six new Ferals. All of them new, because the current ones might soon cease to exist.</p><p>\u201cGive me something to do, Pink,\u201d Wulfe growled.</p><p>Pink looked like she wanted to argue . . . until she glanced at Wulfe\u2019s face and saw the barely controlled despair. Instead, she handed him a carving knife. \u201cThe ham in the refrigerator needs to be sliced, Wulfe. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>As Xavier regaled Natalie with what he\u2019d learned of the different Feral animals, Wulfe pulled the ham from the fridge, placed it on a cutting board, and began to cut the slices with quick precision. The man knew how to use a knife. But the tension in his shoulders told her he was imagining carving up something else. Or someone. Like the Mage behind all their troubles.</p> <p>Xavier flipped the pancakes. \u201cYou should see Grizz. He\u2019s a giant even in human form, but he shifts into a bad-ass grizzly bear.\u201d A moment later, he scooped the pancakes onto a plate, added a fork and knife, and handed it to her. \u201cThe butter and syrup are right here,\u201d he said, motioning to the counter in front of her.</p><p>As Natalie sliced herself a pat of butter, Xavier leaned closer, his expression softening. \u201cWhat do you think of Pink?\u201d he whispered. \u201cShe is so amazing, Nat. You have to get to know her.\u201d Her brother\u2019s face was alight with infatuation. Maybe something deeper. Without a doubt, he was falling for that girl.</p><p>\u201cShe seems very sweet. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d His voice rose to normal volume, and he began to regale her with stories of Feral House as she ate her pancakes and watched Wulfe butcher the ham.</p><p>The way the thick muscles of Wulfe\u2019s arm contracted with each slice of his knife, making his wolf\u2019s-head armband bob and gleam in the overhead light, was truly a sight to behold. As he worked, he glanced up, and their gazes met. His knife stilled and in his eyes, she saw such a mix of worry, anger, and misery that it made her chest ache. With his gaze, he clung to her, need and warmth beckoning her forward like a night ocean she could too easily drown in.</p><p>The breath trembled in her chest, and she forced herself to break the eye contact. Taking the last bite of pancake, she turned away, looking for the dishwasher and realizing that there were three of them lined up beneath the rich granite countertop.</p><p>\u201cDo you guys have a system for which dishwasher to put the dishes in?\u201d she asked her brother.</p><p>Xavier smiled. \u201cHave you ever seen anything like it? Every kitchen needs multiple dishwashers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was Jag\u2019s idea.\u201d Pink\u2019s soft, high-pitched voice was filled with affection. \u201cWhen the Ferals undertook my kitchen renovation a few years ago, Jag demanded they fill the room with dishwashers so that I would never again have to wash anything by hand. I told them it wasn\u2019t necessary, but Jag was adamant. In the end, they managed to fit three.\u201d</p><p>Natalie smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>Xavier nodded. \u201cRight? We\u2019re loading the middle one now.\u201d</p><p>Natalie placed her plate and utensils into the appropriate dishwasher and turned back to her brother. \u201cThe pancakes were delicious.\u201d She kissed him on the cheek. \u201cBetter than Mom\u2019s, though if you tell her I said that . . .\u201d She winced. \u201cXave . . .\u201d</p><p>Her brother looped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close. For once, he didn\u2019t say anything, but his sorrow was clear and open on his face. \u201cI miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The words just came out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s right to talk about Mom when we\u2019re together. I just wish . . .\u201d</p><p>Natalie turned toward him, hugging him. \u201cI love you, Xavier Cash. Everything\u2019s going to work out the way it needs to.\u201d She met Wulfe\u2019s gaze as she said the last. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to believe that.\u201d</p><p>Xavier hugged her back. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here, Nat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Nothing was right about her current situation, and yet, as she held her brother in her arms and met Wulfe\u2019s gaze over his shoulder, there was no place, at this moment, that she\u2019d rather be.</p><p>Wulfe hung the hand towel he\u2019d used to dry his hands on a decorative hook, watching her. \u201cReady to make those phone calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d Natalie gave her brother a peck on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll come see you later.\u201d As she passed Pink, she reached out and gripped a soft, feathered forearm, giving a light squeeze and a smile of thanks, then followed Wulfe through the swinging door.</p><p>\u201cIs Pink a Feral?\u201d Natalie asked quietly as she and Wulfe crossed the dining room. Several people were sitting at the huge table, though none Natalie thought were Ferals. She didn\u2019t recognize them, and Wulfe didn\u2019t greet them. Instead, he led her into the hallway, answering her question as they walked.</p><p>\u201cPink was supposed to have been a Feral, yes. A few of the passive ancient animal lines survived through the centuries, though all eventually died out. The flamingo was the last, one of the oddest, I\u2019ll admit. But that particular Feral was never a warrior. The animal spirit always marked women and gave them the ability to connect with the Earth\u2019s energies as mystics, healers, seers, etc. The flamingo Feral was a big asset. But the animal spirit can only mark a Therian with the DNA of that animal\u2014someone whose ancestry includes shifters of that line. And we believe the flamingo line had all but died out when Pink was marked. She was newly conceived, just an embryo. The problem was, the embryo split into twins and the animal spirit was destroyed. Both girls were born half-animal, half-human. Pink\u2019s sister was killed in hopes of reuniting the animal spirit, but it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. For her and for the Ferals since with the animal spirit dead, so too was the gift. Pink possesses none of the mystical strength she should have.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s mouth compressed in sympathy. \u201cShe has to remain hidden from human eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She stays with us. Even though the animal spirit within her is dead, she needs radiance just like we do. Besides, we\u2019re the only ones she\u2019s safe with. She works her tail off, trust me. She earns her keep many times over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she been with you long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCenturies.\u201d</p><p>Centuries. She looked at him. \u201cAre you all centuries old?\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze, a glimmer of wry humor in his eyes, and nodded.</p><p>Together, they passed through the foyer, then followed the hall to Lyon\u2019s office. They found him seated at his desk, Paenther and Tighe seated on the chairs facing him. Curled up in the chair by the window was Kara.</p><p>\u201cHi, Natalie,\u201d Kara said with a weary smile that didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes.</p><p>The mood in the room was heavy and grim. And Natalie felt suddenly selfish for bothering them with something so trivial.</p><p>\u201cNatalie\u2019s ready to make those phone calls,\u201d Wulfe told them.</p><p>She shook her head as she looked at him. \u201cThey can wait. You have much bigger problems.\u201d</p><p>Lyon glanced at Tighe. \u201cNatalie wants to make a couple of calls to let people know she\u2019ll be out of town for a few days,\u201d he told the tiger shifter. \u201cIf she\u2019s careful, I suspect it\u2019s a good idea, but I want her away from here when she makes them. Leesburg area, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her, Roar,\u201d Wulfe said.</p><p>Lyon shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take a chance on the Mage tracking you two again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoar . . .\u201d Wulfe argued.</p><p>But Lyon\u2019s expression brooked no argument.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you, Natalie,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cThis place has become like a morgue. I could use a drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Paenther said, looking to Lyon for agreement. When Lyon nodded, he turned to Natalie. \u201cAre you ready now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need my cell phone.\u201d</p><p>Lyon pushed back his chair, opened a drawer in his desk, and pulled out her phone. \u201cKeep your eyes open, all of you.\u201d</p><p>Paenther took the phone and rose. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>As they started out of the office, Tighe clasped Wulfe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll take good care of her.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d But he clearly wasn\u2019t happy.</p><p>As they reached the foyer, Jag strode in from a different hallway.</p><p>\u201cRoad trip,\u201d Tighe told him. \u201cWe\u2019ll be gone an hour or two, tops. Natalie wants to make a couple of phone calls and needs an escort. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p><p>Natalie felt Wulfe\u2019s hand on her shoulder. He turned her to face him fully, his frustration clear, but mixed with such worry, such protectiveness, that she longed to step into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Wulfe,\u201d she said quietly. He was the one she was worried about. And his friends. If the Ferals didn\u2019t catch a break soon, one by one, they were going to start dying. She saw that knowledge in Wulfe\u2019s eyes, that fury, that grief. And she felt it herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>And she prayed that was true.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Wulfe followed his brothers and Natalie down the front walk to Tighe\u2019s Land Rover, then saw Natalie settled safely in the backseat. He didn\u2019t like her leaving without him, not at all. But as he prepared to close her car door, their gazes met, and something raw and electric arced between them, a fullness, a warmth, that pressed against his chest, squeezing his heart.</p><p>Was he imagining that he saw the wonder he felt mirrored in her eyes?</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to her, Dog,\u201d Jag said from the front seat. \u201cBut we can\u2019t return her to you until you let us leave.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe closed the door and stepped back as Tighe drove off with Wulfe\u2019s heart tucked in the backseat of his vehicle. He stood there, the sun beating down on the back of his neck, as he watched the Land Rover traverse the circular drive, turn onto the residential road, and disappear. And he stood there for minute after minute more, half-tempted to remain where he was until she returned.</p><p>Finally, with a sigh, he started back to the house. As he stepped onto the brick stoop, familiar voices began to speak in his head.</p><p>The female leaves the fold.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s heart plummeted, his pulse racing.</p><p>But not my Daemon.</p><p>It is no matter. If we take her, he will come. Then both will be yours, my lord. As you wish.</p><p>Wulfe leaped toward the door and into the house, then shifted, giving no thought to the clothes he\u2019d never see again.</p><p>Tighe. Paenther! Dammit, they were already too far to hear him telepathically. Roar! Inir knows she left. Shifting back to human he grabbed a pair of gym shorts out of the basket in the foyer, yanked them on, then reached for the bowl of car keys, grabbing the first one his fingers came in contact with. \u201cThey\u2019re going to try to take her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Lyon commanded as he came tearing down the hall from his office. \u201cI need an Ilina!\u201d</p><p>A second later, Melisande misted into the foyer. \u201cYou called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMist Natalie back here at once.\u201d Lyon quickly told her where she was.</p><p>No sooner had the Ilina disappeared, then Olivia\u2019s voice echoed from the upstairs hallway. \u201cThey\u2019ve been attacked!\u201d she cried, running down the stairs.</p><p>Wulfe whirled toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, stand down,\u201d Lyon barked.</p><p>\u201cRoar.\u201d Impatience tore at Wulfe\u2019s nerves, every muscle in his body straining with the need to reach Natalie.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing we can afford is a Feral-Mage war in the middle of a heavily traveled suburban street in broad daylight. What in the hell were they thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t thinking,\u201d Wulfe snapped. \u201cOr they don\u2019t care. Satanan\u2019s the one calling the shots now, and he doesn\u2019t give a damn if the humans find out about us. He wants the humans terrified. His Daemons will feed all the more easily once they\u2019re freed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not getting free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Wulfe wasn\u2019t at all sure anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, Melisande appeared, a swaying Natalie in her arms. \u201cThey were hit by two cars, one on either side. They must have been waiting for them on the cross streets as they traveled down Georgetown Pike.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe grabbed Natalie, pulling her tight against him. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just . . . dizzy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIlina travel will do that.\u201d He cupped the back of her head, pressing her face to his bare shoulder as he held her, as he drank in the feel of her body, whole and warm, against his.</p><p>Her arms slid around him, and his heart sighed with pleasure and rightness and relief. They stood like that until Tighe, Jag, and Paenther walked in the front door about ten minutes later. None of them appeared the worse for wear. Reluctantly, Wulfe released Natalie as she pulled away and went to sit on the stairs a few feet from him.</p><p>\u201cThe fuckers sandwiched us,\u201d Jag growled.</p><p>\u201cThey trapped us good,\u201d Tighe confirmed. \u201cThe car in front of me spun sideways, blocking me just as I came even with the intersection. The moment I stopped, the two vehicles flew at us from either side, slamming on their breaks at the last minute, pinning the doors closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t injured,\u201d Lyon confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cNo. They barely tapped the Rover. And the moment Melisande disappeared with Natalie, they backed up and drove away.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe glanced at Natalie. \u201cSatanan can sense us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of us?\u201d Tighe asked. \u201cOr just you and Natalie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. The latter, I think. He knew I was at her house. He knew she\u2019d left just now. And that I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Lyon demanded. \u201cYou, I understand. You have Daemon blood. But how is he sensing Natalie? Does she have some kind of tracker on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have Daemon blood?\u201d Natalie asked, her voice low and shocked.</p> <p>\u201cJust a little.\u201d But apparently too damned much. He turned back to Lyon. \u201cMy instincts say it has something to do with her aura. Whatever it is, he wants us. Both of us.\u201d Wulfe growled low. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not going to succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of you is to leave this house, again,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cPaenther, increase surveillance. I want to know where those Mage are, and I want someone watching them every moment. They\u2019re too damn close if they were able to set up a trap within minutes of your getting into the vehicle.\u201d He turned back to Tighe. \u201cAny witnesses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to say, but I didn\u2019t see anyone snapping pictures. It happened fast, Roar. A minute, tops.\u201d Tighe glanced at Natalie. \u201cAnd you still haven\u2019t made those calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can mist her out of the area,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in and out of there before the Mage can follow.\u201d Without Ilina allies, the Mage still had to travel the old-fashioned way\u2014cars and planes.</p><p>Wulfe met Lyon\u2019s gaze, a hardness in his eyes he\u2019d rarely turned on his chief. \u201cNatalie goes nowhere without me.\u201d</p><p>Lyon just stared at him, the need to argue clear in his expression. Wulfe understood all the logical reasoning against their both leaving together, but it didn\u2019t matter. Inside, his wolf growled in agreement.</p><p>Lyon\u2019s jaw clenched, then he turned to Melisande. \u201cTake them somewhere that\u2019s far enough that the Mage won\u2019t be able to reach them in time, but close enough that Natalie might have logically driven there herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCape May is nice this time of year,\u201d Natalie said, rising to her feet.</p> <p>\u201cNew Jersey?\u201d Lyon nodded and turned to Wulfe. \u201cAll right. Take backup. And get her in and out of there fast.\u201d</p><p>Something brushed across Wulfe\u2019s mind, a voice, a whisper. \u201cDaemon?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe blinked, dropping his gaze before anyone saw his dismay. As his head began to pound, he realized the voice . . . this voice . . . didn\u2019t have the same feel as Satanan\u2019s and Inir\u2019s. He felt no . . . malevolence. Just a demand of sorts, to answer. To reply.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t the fucking Daemons leave him the fuck alone?</p><p>\u201cWulfe?\u201d Lyon asked sharply.</p><p>Shaking his head, he forced his attention back on the situation at hand. \u201cCape May, it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll grab some clothes and be right down.\u201d As he climbed the stairs, his stomach clenched. His Daemon blood was awakening, and goddess only knew what that meant. Nothing good. Of a certainty, nothing good.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Zeeland put his troops through their paces in the gym below Feral House, watching the hand-to-hand combat with satisfaction. There was a tension in the room that hadn\u2019t been there this morning, a new gravity in the eyes of every Therian Guard who\u2019d witnessed the ritual in the backyard a short while ago.</p><p>They\u2019d watched three of the Feral Warriors, the guardians of the race, fail to shift. And for the first time, most finally understood the desperate situation they could soon be facing. He could see the knowledge in the tightness of their jaws and the fierceness of their focus as they trained.</p><p>Many had viewed this assignment as a rare opportunity to visit Feral House and meet the Feral Warriors. Now, they finally understood that Inir was close to winning. And if the Ferals fell, the Therian Guard would be on the front line of a brand-new Daemon war.</p><p>It was enough to make the blood run cold.</p><p>\u201cZee.\u201d</p><p>Zeeland turned to find Olivia standing in the doorway. He\u2019d worked with the petite redhead on and off for decades and knew her to be one of the finest warriors in the Guard.</p><p>\u201cLyon wants a word.\u201d</p><p>Zeeland nodded and turned back to his troops. \u201cRyland\u2019s in charge.\u201d He followed Olivia up the steep cellar stairs and through the foyer. When they reached Lyon\u2019s door, the Chief of the Ferals motioned them to enter.</p><p>\u201cClose the door, Zeeland,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth of you have a seat.\u201d Lyon folded his hands on his desk, his eyes grave, his expression pinched as he met Zeeland\u2019s gaze. \u201cIf the worst happens, and the current Ferals cease to be, Feral House and her occupants will be in your hands.\u201d</p><p>Zeeland started, his gut cramping at the thought.</p><p>\u201cOlivia will be your second,\u201d Lyon continued. \u201cIf she\u2019s able to fulfill that role.\u201d</p><p>If she was able. Understanding washed over him slowly. Olivia was a strong, capable leader, and had been for centuries, but she was now mated to one of the Ferals. And if Jag died, there was no telling what the severed mating bond might do to her. She might not be capable of leading at all.</p><p>\u201cThere are many things our replacements will need to know.\u201d Though Lyon\u2019s words were calm and contained, a thread of desolation lent them a flatness that weighed on Zeeland. \u201cHawke is writing it all down and will go over everything with the two of you plus two or three others of your choosing\u2014Therians you trust above all others, Zeeland. You must learn everything\u2014our rituals, our ways, all the secrets we\u2019ve amassed over five millennia. With us gone, you\u2019ll be the only ones who can pass it on.\u201d</p><p>The terrible responsibility settled heavily on Zeeland\u2019s shoulders. Misery clawed at his guts. The Ferals\u2014a couple of whom were close personal friends\u2014might soon cease to exist, leaving their wives to suffer their loss for an eternity. All of them had been only recently mated, from what he understood. A month ago, not only had Fox, one of Zeeland\u2019s oldest friends, not yet met Melisande, he had yet to be marked a Feral. By everything that was right, the male should be on top of the world. Yet just as his life had taken this pair of rare and wonderful turns, the Mage and their evil threatened to rip it all away.</p><p>The thought of leaving his beloved Julianne alone, damaged and unprotected, was beyond bearing, and he knew the Ferals must be feeling that same excruciating dread.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do what must be done, Lyon. Nothing will be lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect our mates and Tighe\u2019s child, Zeeland, as if they were your own. See to it that they\u2019re safe, above all else. If we fail, we\u2019ll be leaving you a hell beyond imagining. I don\u2019t intend to fail,\u201d he added fiercely. \u201cBut neither can I bury my head in the sand and risk leaving our replacements defenseless. You, hopefully with Olivia\u2019s help, will train them, guide them. I know I can count on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Lyon stood, dismissing him. But as Zeeland rose to leave, Lyon extended his hand, too far. Zeeland took the gesture\u2014the Feral greeting\u2014for what it was, a show of respect and a heartfelt thank you.</p><p>The two men slapped forearms, exchanged nods, and parted. All his life, Zeeland had dreamed of someday being marked a Feral Warrior. But as he left Lyon\u2019s office, Olivia close behind, he thanked the goddess that dream had never come true.</p><p>Wulfe stood in the shade behind a B&amp;B near the beach in Cape May, New Jersey. The four Ilinas who\u2019d brought them had turned back to mist and kept silent watch. Paenther and Jag had each moved to opposite sides of the yard.</p><p>Natalie stood a few feet in front of Wulfe, talking to her office manager in the crisp, professional manner of the medical professional she was. He liked watching her like this, imagining her in her white lab coat peering into the eyes of her human patients. Maybe she didn\u2019t wear a white lab coat. He\u2019d have to ask her. Though he knew what an optometrist did, he\u2019d never been to see one himself. Therian eyes never required glasses. Except sunglasses, of course.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out all week,\u201d she said, then glanced at Wulfe. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll definitely be back in the office next Tuesday.\u201d Uncertainty twisted her pretty mouth despite the certainty in her tone. \u201cThanks, Cheryl. Cell service is spotty here, so if you need me, leave a message. I\u2019ll get back to you when I can.\u201d She hung up, taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly.</p><p>Wulfe could see the tension in her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNow my mom,\u201d she muttered, clearly not looking forward to the prospect. \u201cMom, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m taking a little much-needed vacation. No, I\u2019m fine, I promise. I just needed . . .\u201d</p><p>As Wulfe watched, Natalie\u2019s face began to contort in pain. Wulfe realized what was happening and knew she wasn\u2019t going to be able to finish this conversation. Reaching her, he slid the phone from loose, slender fingers, disconnected the call, and shoved her phone in his back pocket as he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cMy cheek,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His hand covered half of her face as he tucked her close against him. Her sweet scent filled his lungs, her hair brushing his chin, her lush curves an exquisite temptation as they pressed against his body. One part of his mind erupted in thoughts of touching those curves, of exploring every inch of her sweet flesh. But her body was still rigid with pain. The only touch that mattered didn\u2019t seem to be working.</p><p>His pulse began to hammer. \u201cIt\u2019s still just your cheek?\u201d</p><p>The tears were starting to leak from her eyes. \u201cYes. It feels . . . like it\u2019s on fire. Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer, concentrating harder on easing her misery, feeling helpless. And furious. Come on, you son of a bitch pain. Leave her alone! Finally, finally, the rigidity began to ease from her body.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes.\u201d She sagged against him, the tension draining out of her.</p><p>He lifted his hand from her face and pulled her tighter against him. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, now?\u201d</p><p>She took another deep breath and released a long, shaky sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d Stepping out of his embrace, she brushed the tears from her cheeks. \u201cThat was no fun.\u201d</p><p>No fun. He smiled at her understatement and tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. \u201cLet\u2019s get home.\u201d</p><p>She jerked. \u201cWulfe, I can\u2019t leave my mom wondering what happened to me. I have to finish the call.\u201d</p><p>Even as she said the words, her phone started to vibrate in Wulfe\u2019s back pocket.</p><p>With a sigh, he handed it back to her.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. Sorry. I accidentally disconnected us, then had trouble finding a signal again. Cape May,\u201d she said after a short break. Her gaze met his. \u201cI\u2019m going to soak up the sun, enjoy the scenery, and get some badly needed rest. No, I\u2019m fine, Mom. I promise.\u201d</p><p>As she met his gaze, a look of helplessness in her eyes, a familiar buzzing erupted in Wulfe\u2019s ears. Red smoke rushed in to cloud his vision. Before he could say a single word to warn Natalie or his brothers, the darkness once more swept him up and away.</p><p>\u201cMom, why don\u2019t you stay in Birmingham with Aunt Deb a little while longer? You might as well.\u201d</p><p>Natalie saw the instant Wulfe\u2019s eyes changed. One moment he was watching her with soft sympathy, the next, the cold indifference of an unpleasant stranger. Her pulse leaped as she remembered the last time.</p><p>\u201cMom, I have to go,\u201d she said suddenly, struggling to keep her voice even. \u201cLove you!\u201d She hung up quickly. \u201cPaenther!\u201d</p><p>But even as she yelled, Wulfe scooped her up and slung her over his shoulder hard enough to knock the breath from her lungs and send the phone flying from her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cWulfe!\u201d Jag shouted.</p><p>\u201cMelisande,\u201d Paenther called, low. \u201cGet them out of here. Backyard of Feral House. And warn Lyon!\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Natalie\u2019s vision flipped end over end, the landscape disappearing into darkness, then bright sunlight as she found herself staring at soft grass beneath her hands and knees. Half a dozen yards away, Wulfe knelt, retching in the grass. Seconds later, Paenther and Jag knelt on either side of him.</p><p>The back doors of Feral House burst open, Lyon racing out, followed closely by Kougar and Tighe.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lyon demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t himself,\u201d Melisande stated. \u201cHe grabbed Natalie hard enough to hurt her and started running with her over his shoulder.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the Ferals surrounded the three retching Ferals, Lyon looked to Natalie. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He just knocked the breath out of me.\u201d</p><p>Lyon nodded, his attention back on Wulfe as the shifter leaped to his feet, his eyes still those of a stranger as he looked around, spied her, and started toward her with long, determined strides.</p> <p>Lyon and Tighe stepped into his path, blocking his way. Wulfe snarled, his eyes changing to animal eyes, fangs sprouting from his gums.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, dammit,\u201d Tighe growled. \u201cWe\u2019re not immortal!\u201d</p><p>If Wulfe attacked them with his claws and fangs, he could injure them badly. He might even kill them, which would destroy him in turn.</p><p>Natalie pushed to her feet and ran toward the confrontation. \u201cWulfe, no!\u201d</p><p>Even as his muscles bunched as if to spring, his gaze snapped to her, and he stilled, the coldness slowly disappearing from those animal eyes, swept aside by confusion, dismay, and dawning horror.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt anyone,\u201d she assured him, watching with relief as his fangs disappeared, as his face returned to normal.</p><p>Lyon stared at him. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe swung away, his shoulders hunching with shame. \u201cI lost it. That was the second time.\u201d</p><p>And both times . . .</p><p>With a bolt of understanding, Natalie strode through the circle of Ferals, moving in front of Wulfe, forcing him to face her, even as he continued to stare at the ground. \u201cBoth times, my cheek hurt. Both times, you took the pain. Then, moments later, you turned into Wolfman.\u201d She frowned, thinking. \u201cThe first time I experienced the pain, I didn\u2019t tell you. And none of this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you taking her?\u201d Paenther asked. \u201cIn Cape May, he snatched her up and started running,\u201d He explained for the others\u2019 benefit.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Wulfe shook his head as if trying to clear it. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInir has found a way to get his claws into him,\u201d Kougar murmured. \u201cI wonder if we\u2019re next.\u201d</p><p>The look that passed between the shifters was one of raw disbelief. And horror.</p><p>\u201cWe are so screwed,\u201d Jag muttered.</p><p>Lyon watched his wolf shifter consideringly. \u201cI don\u2019t think Inir\u2019s controlling us. I think this is just another factor of your Daemon blood. And, somehow, Natalie\u2019s involved. The next time her cheek hurts, call for backup immediately. And don\u2019t touch her.\u201d His amber gaze swung to Natalie. \u201cThe moment you feel the pain, or the moment you notice Wulfe changing, yell. And don\u2019t stop until we come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>The Chief of the Ferals turned toward the house, and the others followed.</p><p>Wulfe hesitated, watching the sky instead of the ground. Finally, he turned to her, misery in his eyes. \u201cI hurt you.\u201d His voice throbbed.</p> <p>\u201cYou were rough with me, but you didn\u2019t intentionally hurt me. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Nothing broken. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>For moments, he said nothing, his gaze returning to the treetops and the sky. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d He scowled and started forward, then paused and held out his hand for her. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201d</p><p>Taking his hand, she followed him through the back door, through the dining room, and into the hallway.</p><p>Wulfe glanced at her. \u201cI need to work out. The fury is gone, but I still feel this need to fight. I\u2019m going to work it out in the gym. Do you mind spending a little time in your room? I can get you some books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooks would be good.\u201d Honestly, she needed a little time alone, if only to process everything that had happened over the course of the past day and a half. And to get her emotions back under control after talking to her mom.</p><p>Wulfe led her down yet another hallway to a beautiful room lined, ceiling to floor, with bookshelves. A huge fireplace took up most of one wall, comfy-looking reading chairs scattered about.</p><p>\u201cBooks,\u201d he said with a flourish.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d As she perused the shelves, she found every manner of book imaginable, most quite old, most nonfiction, though one entire section was lined with twentieth- and twenty-first-century best-selling novels. As she perused the titles, she thought of the hours her mom had read to her when she was little. Natalie had never tired of the stories.</p><p>At the thought, tears burned her eyes. That brief conversation had thrown her more than she\u2019d like to admit. Despite Wulfe\u2019s assurances otherwise, she was terrified that, like Xavier, she might end up stuck here. She might never see her mother again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me,\u201d Wulfe said, his voice low and stricken.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s gaze snapped to his even as she had to blink back the moisture. \u201cNo. I was thinking about my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. And she\u2019s having such a hard time with Xavier gone.\u201d Her gaze sharpened on his, a plea, a demand. \u201cI can\u2019t go missing again, too, Wulfe. She\u2019s already lost both of my brothers, if in different ways. She can\u2019t lose all of us. It would destroy her.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his eyes deep wells of determination. \u201cI\u2019ll get you home, Natalie. I\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d But within that declaration she detected a thread of uncertainty. As much as he might want to, he couldn\u2019t promise her anything, and they both knew it.</p><p>And truth be told, she was torn, and becoming more so by the hour. Going home meant leaving Xavier behind once more. Never seeing him again. Or Wulfe.</p><p>He reached for her, his eyes as tender as she\u2019d ever seen them as he traced her jaw with the pad of his thumb. As she stared into those dark, fathomless eyes, adoration spread through her chest, sharper and more piercing than ever before. She could hardly breathe and didn\u2019t care. She didn\u2019t need oxygen, didn\u2019t need anything but his touch. Though she\u2019d only just met him, she felt as if she\u2019d known him always.</p><p>How could she walk away from him, knowing she\u2019d probably never see him again?</p><p>Her heart thudded, liquid warmth sliding through her veins, weakening her, strengthening her, awakening every cell in her body.</p><p>Wulfe lifted her hair, letting it slip through his fingers, then leaned forward and kissed her lightly on the forehead. \u201cPick out a few books.\u201d</p><p>As he turned away, she stared at his back, at his broad shoulders, the pressure in her chest so great she feared it would never be contained.</p><p>Heaven help her, she\u2019d fallen in love with a shape-shifter.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>As Wulfe waited for Natalie to choose a few books from the Ferals\u2019 extensive library, he watched her, his chest heavy as lead. She wanted to go home, back to her world, to her mother. He got that. He understood, and he would do absolutely anything to make her happy, even if sending her home was the last thing he wanted for himself.</p><p>He just prayed he could keep her safe that long.</p><p>Finally, she turned to him, three books tucked against her chest\u2014a Jane Austen novel and two others whose titles he couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>A small smile lifted the corners of her lovely mouth. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Together, they left the library and started back down the hall toward the stairs. As they approached the foyer, he overheard Paenther and Vhyper talking.</p><p>\u201cSo what I don\u2019t get,\u201d Vhyper muttered, \u201cis whether the real Satanan, the Daemon still trapped in the Daemon Blade, knows what the lost piece of his consciousness\u2014the one that infected Inir\u2014is up to. Are they working together, or as completely separate entities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Paenther replied.</p><p>\u201cSeparate entities,\u201d Wulfe told them, as he and Natalie entered the foyer. He joined his friends. \u201cOne has no idea what the other is doing, but it doesn\u2019t matter since both are fully focused on freeing the Daemons from that blade.\u201d</p><p>Vhyper\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd you know that how?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe stilled. \u201cI have no clue.\u201d He scowled and started to turn away, but Paenther stopped him.</p><p>\u201cWulfe . . . what else do you know about Satanan, or at least about the piece of his consciousness inside Inir? We need all the insight we can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know most of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor us.\u201d Paenther\u2019s steady gaze demanded cooperation.</p><p>Hell. He didn\u2019t know how he knew this stuff. If he could unknow it, he would. But, yeah, maybe it could help.</p><p>\u201cDuring the years of the Daemons Wars, wraith Daemon consciousness shattered fairly frequently, the wisps hiding in rock crevices, in objects, and in the ground until a person\u2014usually human\u2014came in contact with them. The wisp, what we call dark spirit, would turn the host evil for the course of his or her short life, then both host and wisp would perish.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Lyon and Kougar walked up, joining them, listening.</p><p>\u201cBut of the true Daemons,\u201d Wulfe continued, \u201conly the strongest ever left behind a piece of consciousness, and only in times of fierce desperation. The sliver of Satanan\u2019s consciousness within Inir sheared off when he was being pulled into the Daemon Blade. He resisted the pull so strongly that part of him was actually left behind. Not until Inir accidentally came in contact with it did that piece of Satanan\u2019s soul find a host and come awake again.\u201d</p><p>Hawke and Falkyn joined them. Wulfe saw the surprise on his brothers\u2019 and sister\u2019s faces, but Paenther nodded for him to continue, and he did.</p><p>\u201cIn such cases, the lost sliver is usually never found, and the Daemon himself, though aware of the loss, is rarely incapacitated by it. He may feel the loss as one might feel grief for a long-dead loved one. A literal missing piece. If the missing sliver is found after it has infected someone, the two pieces can be runited only by destroying the host.\u201d</p><p>Silence descended over the foyer as his Feral brothers and sisters stared at him with a mix of interest, surprise, and shock.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all that?\u201d Hawke breathed.</p><p>Wulfe shrugged. \u201cDaemon blood.\u201d He ushered Natalie toward the stairs, through with revealing his weirdness for the day. But he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what other odd Daemon knowledge now resided in his head. And why.</p><p>\u201cThe woman Vhyper saw earlier is back.\u201d Melisande\u2019s voice erupted in the foyer behind him. \u201cShe\u2019s coming up the drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on her.\u201d Lyon leaped into commander mode. \u201cIf she leaves again, follow her. Everyone else, remain inside. I don\u2019t want to scare her off, but she\u2019s not getting away this time. I want to know who she is and what she wants with us. If she\u2019s another newly marked Feral, she\u2019s going straight to the prisons.\u201d</p><p>Jag grunted. \u201cTen bucks says she winds up in the prisons no matter what she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s parking the car,\u201d Falkyn called from the living room. \u201cShe\u2019s getting out and starting for the front walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove away from the door,\u201d Lyon ordered. \u201cOut of sight until we have her in the house.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe took Natalie\u2019s hand and hurried her up to the second-floor landing, where they had a clear view of the foyer over the railing. Fox, Hawke, and Falkyn joined them while the others melted into one or another of the hallways that fed into the foyer.</p><p>A moment later, the doorknocker rang on the wood with hard, confident taps, an interesting counterpoint to the apparently tentative nature of the woman\u2019s initial arrival.</p><p>Lyon swung open the door to reveal a woman of medium stature and girl-next-door looks, dressed in hiking boots, knee-length shorts, and a lightweight vest covered in pockets over a light brown tee. Dark hair, corkscrew curly, fell well past her shoulders.</p><p>The woman stared at Lyon with a combination of wariness, awe, and that surprising confidence as she thrust out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Vivian Mars, Assistant Professor and Director of the International Center for North African Archaeology at Boston University. I believe you have a Daemon in your midst, and I\u2019d very much like to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe jerked.</p><p>Lyon, to his credit, showed no obvious surprise as he shook her hand and stepped back. \u201cCome in, Dr. Mars. I\u2019ll be very happy to talk with you.\u201d</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t move. \u201cBefore I come in, let me explain who I am and why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safer if we talk inside.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s expression lit with wry amusement. \u201cSafer for whom?\u201d She lifted a hand, palm out. \u201cLet me at least tell you that I\u2019m human. Two years ago, during a dig in the East Sahara, I became the unwitting, if not entirely unwilling, host to a wisp of Daemon consciousness who\u2019d been separated from his body sometime ago. He doesn\u2019t know how long. His name is Strome and he desperately wants to know what happened to his race.\u201d</p><p>Lyon turned toward the nearest hallway. \u201cDark spirit or something more?\u201d</p><p>Kougar strode into the foyer and joined him. \u201cFrom my experience, dark spirit craves violence, not answers. I\u2019d like to hear more. Wulfe may know more.\u201d</p><p>Lyon glanced up to where Wulfe stood watching, but Wulfe shook his head. He didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>\u201cStrome has sensed that you\u2019re shape-shifters and wants your guarantee not to hurt me,\u201d the woman stated. \u201cHe\u2019s sensed the strengthening of a powerful force within the Daemons and seeks to warn those who might be able to stop it. About a month ago, he felt the awakening of an honorable Daemon consciousness. It\u2019s taken us all this time to track him down. And we tracked him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came by earlier today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled ruefully. \u201cStrome realized he was leading me into a den . . . a house . . . of shape-shifters and ordered me to leave at once. It\u2019s taken me hours to convince him I\u2019m willing to accept the risk, given all that\u2019s at stake. We\u2019d both appreciate it if you\u2019d listen to what Strome has to say and not shoot the messenger, as it were.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked up suddenly, her gaze finding Wulfe\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d She smiled, stepping into the foyer suddenly, without hesitation, her gaze glued to Wulfe\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s you he\u2019s been trying to contact, you he needs to talk to.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s pulse began to pound. This was his worst nightmare come true. Not only was Satanan getting his claws into him, but now Daemons were starting to come out of the woodwork looking for him. Or slivers of Daemon souls, at any rate. A thought snagged him.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . is he the one who\u2019s been whispering Daemon in my head?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. He was hoping you\u2019d answer and tell him where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the Shaman,\u201d Lyon ordered. He clamped his hand around the woman\u2019s upper arm. \u201cYou won\u2019t be harmed, but neither am I taking any chances. You\u2019ll wait in the prisons until the Shaman can determine what you really are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a little late, pal,\u201d Vivian muttered.</p><p>Lyon stilled, his face turning hard as granite.</p><p>Vivian looked up at him suddenly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you. Strome told me to leave at once, and I told him it was a little late. Am I wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. I still answer him out loud most of the time though he seems to be able to read my thoughts well enough. Keep that in mind, please. It might be a difficult habit for me to break.\u201d</p><p>As Lyon steered the woman out of the foyer, toward the door to the basement, Wulfe turned to Natalie. \u201cI\u2019m following them. Do you want to come with me or go up to your room?\u201d This might be his worst nightmare, but he wanted to know what in the hell that Daemon knew.</p><p>Natalie set the books on the floor. \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe took her hand, pleased. He needed her close right now, her calm strength.</p><p>Together, they descended the stairs to the foyer, then the longer stairs to the basement, following the others through the gym and into the prisons.</p> <p>\u201cIs this where I stayed when I was here before?\u201d Natalie asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t go near the cells,\u201d Wulfe warned her. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the men will hurt you, but I can\u2019t be certain.\u201d He clasped her hand tighter.</p><p>Lyon opened one of the empty cells for Vivian and the woman walked in without complaint, then turned as he locked the door on her.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about Wulfe?\u201d Lyon demanded, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cStrome sensed him, as I said.\u201d Her confidence didn\u2019t appear to have slipped an ounce despite her imprisonment in the shape-shifters\u2019 dungeon. \u201cHe has so many questions, questions I\u2019ve been unable to answer since humans didn\u2019t know that Daemons . . . or shape-shifters, for that matter . . . ever existed.\u201d</p><p>She moved to the door of the cage, gripping one of the bars in a casual manner, her gaze finding Wulfe\u2019s. \u201cWhat happened to the Daemons?\u201d</p><p>He felt her intense gaze like an unwanted spotlight, but she didn\u2019t pause long enough for him to answer.</p><p>\u201cWhen Strome first glommed onto me, he sensed no other Daemons at all,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat was almost two years ago. I\u2019ve been researching like crazy, trying to find any reference to the people or events of his time, but I\u2019ve found nothing. Then a few months ago, he sensed something, a hint of an old enemy, the Destroyer, he calls him. Satanan. Very faint, like a soul not fully formed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware of Satanan,\u201d Wulfe snapped.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThen, suddenly, three Abominations flew free into the world but disappeared within days. About the same time, a bright new Daemon light awakened. Yours. Your awakening wasn\u2019t like a birth, exactly. More like a bloodline triggered\u2014one of the old, honorable lines\u2014and he knew he had to find you, to learn what had happened and to warn you.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s jaw hardened. Though he wanted to hear what she had to say, his muscles tensed with the need to turn and leave. Why did she have to stare at him alone? It was bad enough that he was some kind of Daemon freak. Did she have to flash it like a neon sign over his head?</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Vivian grasped the bars with both hands, her gaze imploring him. \u201cStrome is desperate to know everything you can tell him. The last thing he remembers was Satanan claiming the souls of his people. Daemon souls. Strome fought as long and hard as he could, so hard that a piece of his soul sheared off and became lost, the piece that I inadvertently recovered and that now shares space inside of me.\u201d</p><p>Lyon finally answered her questions since Wulfe had no intention of doing so. \u201cSatanan and his horde nearly destroyed the other races, the humans included. The shifters and the Mage joined forces, and with the help of the Ilinas, managed to incarcerate them in a magical prison, the Daemon Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re not dead,\u201d she asked, turning to Lyon. Finally.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think so, no. We believe that the current Mage leader, Inir, became possessed by a powerful wisp of Satanan\u2019s consciousness some years ago and began stealing the souls of his own Mage in order to begin a campaign to free the Daemons. They\u2019re very close to accomplishing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Satanan isn\u2019t yet free, but he\u2019s becoming very strong within his host. Strome can feel that.\u201d Vivian paused and looked away. \u201cAll right, let me try.\u201d Meeting Lyon\u2019s gaze again, she said, \u201cHe wants to speak to you directly. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s going to work, but I\u2019m going to try to let him borrow my mouth.\u201d She grinned suddenly, a woman\u2019s smile. \u201cBehave, Strome.\u201d</p><p>Vivian closed her eyes and took two long, deep breaths, then went still. When her eyes opened, they turned to Lyon, a hardness in their depths that hadn\u2019t been there before.</p><p>\u201cIf you hurt her . . .\u201d The voice was Vivian\u2019s, yet not. That hard gaze tightened with frustration. \u201cI can do nothing. So I will entreat you . . . do not harm her. She is light and beauty and goodness, and poses no threat to you whatsoever. I will help you defeat Satanan\u2019s rise in any way that I can so long as you vow to protect Vivian Mars. Satanan\u2019s evil knows no bounds. He has destroyed or enslaved more immortal races than you probably knew existed, including his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Satanan doesn\u2019t rise, neither do you.\u201d Tighe lifted a single pale eyebrow. \u201cWhy would you want to keep that from happening?\u201d</p><p>Vivian/Strome turned his way. \u201cEven if the Daemons fly free of the blade, my true self and I cannot be reunited without destroying the vessel in which I reside. Without killing Vivian. That would be a poor way to repay her kindness. And it is unknown if the male I have become is still worthy of this world after being enslaved by Satanan and incarcerated in that blade for . . . how long?\u201d</p><p>Lyon answered. \u201cFive thousand years.\u201d</p><p>Vivian\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cFive thousand?\u201d Her voice suddenly became her own. \u201cNo wonder I couldn\u2019t find a trace of the places or people you knew. They were prehistory in most of the world. Okay, okay, I\u2019ll give you back the mic.\u201d She closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, Strome was back.</p><p>That intense gaze turned to Wulfe. \u201cYou are only part Daemon.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe glared at him for several seconds before answering. \u201cA fraction. At most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a son of Ciroc. I knew him and his shifter mate quite well. She was a beauty and much in love with her Daemon husband, as he was in love with her.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe shook his head, one eye narrowing. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Daemons. They\u2019re feeding machines, pure evil. And they sure as hell don\u2019t have the equipment to father children. So how . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t speak of Daemons, shifter, you speak of Abominations. If the Daemons were imprisoned five millennia ago, perhaps you\u2019ve never seen a true Daemon, only the three Abominations I felt fly free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWraith Daemons,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call them. The Mage managed to free three from the blade a month ago. We killed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen real Daemons,\u201d Kougar said. \u201cI was born before the defeat of Satanan.\u201d He turned to the others. \u201cA true Daemon is much like an Ilina, in that they can become pure energy or take fully corporeal form. Unlike Ilinas, their natural state is corporeal, and they generally look quite human.\u201d</p><p>Vivian/Strome frowned. \u201cSatanan created his Abominations to empower him. Through their terrorizing of others, the Abominations feed him the rancid energy that makes him stronger than any other Daemon\u2014than any other creature of any race. It is why we could not stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would claim that not all Daemons crave death and destruction?\u201d Kougar asked tightly.</p><p>\u201cI would. I do. The Daemons I knew were not evil. Some of us were warriors, certainly, but ours was a great and varied society. We lived in peace with our human and immortal neighbors. As a race, we were once in perfect synchronicity with the earth\u2019s energies\u2014solar, magnetic, heat\u2014giving as well as taking, in a natural cycle that once stabilized the Earth, that healed and strengthened the living beings in our vicinity, humans included. It\u2019s a cycle that has . . . or had . . . existed for hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>\u201cSatanan, alone, fed on human suffering. And he, alone, possessed the powerful ability to tap into the life force of others, stealing our strength. An ability we learned of too late. Once he\u2019d weakened us, he began to control us until we were unable to do anything but what he commanded. I watched it happen to my friends and brothers as they fell under his control. I fought the same fate. And lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen if the Mage free Satanan from that blade?\u201d Lyon demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Those imprisoned with him will likely be free as well, but it\u2019s impossible to say what state they\u2019ll be in or whether he\u2019ll still control them after all this time.\u201d</p><p>Vivian shook her head, her voice slipping through. \u201cFive thousand years.\u201d</p><p>Tighe stepped forward. \u201cHow many Abominations did he make, Strome? How many are in that blade with him?\u201d</p><p>Strome was back in an instant. \u201cBy the time I was enslaved, he had created hundreds. Since I do not know how much time passed between my enslavement and Satanan\u2019s defeat, I cannot begin to guess. Nor do I know how many were captured by the blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than seven thousand Abominations . . . wraith Daemons . . . were captured in that blade with Satanan,\u201d Wulfe told them, \u201cAlong with the captured souls of fourteen other races, including Satanan\u2019s own Daemons.\u201d Why did he keep opening his mouth and letting this crap come out?</p><p>His brothers stared at him as if he\u2019d grown a second head.</p><p>Vivian/Strome watched him with interest, then slowly nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow many Daemons left part of their consciousness behind like you and Satanan?\u201d Lyon asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. From the moment I broke away until Vivian found me, I was lost, inert. I came awake inside her and will live until she dies. If other wisps of consciousness survived as I did, they are likely long gone by now.\u201d</p><p>Vivian/Strome\u2019s gaze turned back to Wulfe. \u201cWhy have you endangered your effort to keep Satanan from escaping?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe frowned, his muscles tensing, the need to do battle leaping inside of him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you make a channel key?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe frowned, then slowly turned to granite. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Vivian/Strome\u2019s gaze turned to Natalie. \u201cHer.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wulfe stared at Vivian and the Daemon consciousness shining from her eyes, then gripped Natalie\u2019s hand tighter. Fuck that. He curved his arm around her shoulder and hauled her tight against him, the fierce need to protect her barreling through him. \u201cI did not make Natalie a channel key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why I\u2019m glowing?\u201d Natalie asked quietly.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck. Wulfe\u2019s head began to pound. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have made her a channel key. I don\u2019t even know how!\u201d</p><p>Delaney had been made into a channel key by Tighe\u2019s evil clone and . . . goddess . . . he\u2019d infected her with Daemon essence, then carved a pentagram into her chest that would have killed her if not for Tighe\u2019s intervention and the miracle that Tighe\u2019s animal spirit orchestrated, making her immortal in the process.</p><p>He had not done that to Natalie. He hadn\u2019t. But inside, his wolf began to howl.</p><p>Vivian/Strome watched him steadily, sympathy in hard eyes. \u201cIt can only happen in one way. A connection must have been opened between the two of you, and dark energy, primal energy, allowed to fill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t . . . I would never . . .\u201d But he had. With a slam of understanding, he knew what had happened. \u201cShe was cut by a wraith Daemon. I took her wound for my own.\u201d</p><p>Vivian/Strome began to nod slowly. \u201cThat might do it. How long ago was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>Hard eyes narrowed. \u201cAbout the time I sensed your awakening. In making her your channel key, you must have triggered your own dormant Daemon blood. What\u2019s more, I now understand the source of the energy that is strengthening Satanan. He\u2019s empowering himself through your connection to your channel key, pulling primal energy through both of you, probably without your even feeling it.\u201d</p><p>This just got worse and worse.</p><p>\u201cHow do we stop him?\u201d Lyon demanded.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s neck muscles felt twisted like a rope. He pulled Natalie in front of him and wrapped both arms around her, the need to protect her screaming through him even as the scent of her, the feel of her warm body against his, calmed him, if only a fraction.</p><p>\u201cHow do I unmake a channel key?\u201d Because he had to undo this. He had to make it right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vivian/Strome glanced from one of them to the other. \u201cI\u2019ll share no more with you until you\u2019ve freed Vivian. The rest will be over the phone.\u201d</p><p>Lyon shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019ll not be harmed unless we deem her . . . or you . . . a threat. But she\u2019ll remain in this cell until I say otherwise. I want the Shaman to examine her. You\u2019ve nothing to fear from him. He\u2019s an ancient and honorable soul who will not harm her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPal,\u201d Vivian said, clearly back in the fore, clearly talking to Strome, now, \u201cI\u2019ve already told them exactly who I am and where I work. Unless I run away from everything I know, they\u2019ll be able to find me within hours. I think we should trust them. I think we can trust them.\u201d She turned to Lyon, her expression rueful. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can understand how hard it is for an alpha male and former commander to ride in the passenger seat. He wants so badly to protect me. But he can\u2019t.\u201d Her gaze sharpened as she eyed Wulfe. \u201cI hope we didn\u2019t make a mistake in seeking you out.\u201d</p> <p>Wulfe glanced at Lyon. He wouldn\u2019t speak for his chief.</p><p>\u201cIf Strome is what he says he is, an honorable spirit,\u201d Lyon told her, \u201cthen neither of you has anything to fear from us. We\u2019re at war with the Mage who are trying to free Satanan. You\u2019ll forgive us if we\u2019re overly cautious. But we would welcome a genuine ally, especially one who can help us to better understand our enemy.\u201d</p><p>Vivian nodded. \u201cStrome wants the mic.\u201d She closed her eyes, and, a moment later, the Daemon was back in control.</p><p>\u201cI will help you because she is inclined to trust you.\u201d His gaze turned to Wulfe. \u201cAnd because it would please Ciroc for me to aid his progeny. But, if you harm this woman in any way . . .\u201d He shook his head, his expression dark with frustration. \u201cDon\u2019t. I have never in my existence begged, but I will beg of you now. Do not harm her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t harm innocents, not if we have any choice,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cWhat will happen if Wulfe were to pull the primal power for himself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRoar.\u201d How could Lyon even ask such a thing? \u201cI would never. I\u2019d have to cut a pentagram . . .\u201d He swallowed back the bile that tried to rise. \u201cIn her chest.\u201d</p><p>Vivian shook her head, her expression\u2014Strome\u2019s expression\u2014horrified. \u201cWhy would you ever cut a pentagram into the chest of a human? You\u2019d kill her.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe stared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what Tighe\u2019s clone did to Delaney when he made her his channel key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis clone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story,\u201d Wulfe muttered. \u201cSuffice it to say, he was evil, through and through.\u201d</p><p>Strome watched him thoughtfully. Slowly, his eyes turned hard. \u201cIn the early days, before I understood what he was about, I watched Satanan pull the primal energies. I know how it\u2019s done. For you to accomplish it, I believe you would need only to fully open the channel you triggered when you healed the human female. You would have to give her back the wound you took. Through that cut, the primal energies will flow. But I warn you, pulling that darkness corrupts even the most honorable of souls. Should you choose that path, you will quickly become too powerful for your friends to stop. You\u2019ll kill them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen only one other ride that wave of energy and not let it consume him. And even he eventually lost the battle because in the end he could not bring himself to give up the power he\u2019d acquired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo once the primal energy is pulled, it can be released?\u201d Kougar asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. The ritual in reverse. The problem is, no one who knows that kind of power has the strength to give it up. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d He turned back to Wulfe. \u201cI should warn you that even if you don\u2019t pull the primal energies intentionally, the moment Satanan is free, he will seize control of you as he has the rest of the Daemons. And when he does, you will pull the power. And you\u2019ll do it for him, without the ability to claim it for yourself. You, too, will become a pawn of his evil as so many have before you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we stop him?\u201d Wulfe demanded, holding Natalie tight against him. \u201cHow do I keep that from happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is only one way. The connection must be broken. You, your channel key, or Satanan\u2019s host . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cInir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of you must die.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie jerked within Wulfe\u2019s hold.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you,\u201d he whispered fiercely. But, goddess. To break this unholy connection he\u2019d inadvertently created without endangering either of them further, he had to kill Inir. Not that he didn\u2019t want to. Hell yes, he wanted to, but they\u2019d been trying to find and kill that sucker for months, now, with no success.</p><p>\u201cThe Shaman\u2019s here,\u201d Tighe said.</p><p>As the youthful-looking ancient entered the prison block, accompanied by Fox, Wulfe straightened. Slowly, he relinquished his hold on Natalie, his head pounding with regret over what he\u2019d done to her. And with shame. How could he have fucked up so badly again? Nothing good ever came of his gift. Ever.</p><p>As he stepped away from her, she looked at him with eyes filled with confusion and worry.</p><p>If only he hadn\u2019t touched her, hadn\u2019t healed her.</p><p>The Shaman walked over to the cell where Vivian stood and peered at her with interest. \u201cI understand you\u2019re host to a Daemon consciousness, one who claims to be an enemy of Satanan\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. His name is Strome, and he\u2019s one of the good guys,\u201d Vivian said. \u201cYou look young to be a shaman.\u201d</p><p>The Shaman smiled. \u201cLooks can be deceiving when you\u2019re dealing with immortals. Many things can be deceiving. I\u2019ve never heard it said that Satanan had enemies among his own. If true, this is enlightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Vivian scowled, and it was clear that Strome was back in control. \u201cSatanan had nothing but enemies. He became too strong before we ever knew the power he possessed. By the time we realized the threat, it was too late. We were already being pulled under his complete control. At the point in time I became lost\u2014and I don\u2019t know how long that was before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour hundred years,\u201d Wulfe said, unable to stop himself when the knowledge was on the tip of his tongue. \u201cSatanan gained full control over the entire Daemon race four hundred years before they all became trapped in the Daemon Blade.\u201d</p><p>Vivian/Strome looked at him with interest. \u201cHow do you come by this knowledge, shifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It just started happening today. I suddenly know things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tapped into Satanan\u2019s consciousness. Or his memories and knowledge. How?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe shook his head.</p><p>Beside him, Natalie placed a slender, yet strong hand on his forearm. \u201cWhen you touch me when I\u2019m in pain, Satanan gains some control over you. Is it possible that that connection is going both ways? That you\u2019re tapping into him, too?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe froze. He was starting to perspire. He hated this. Hated it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very possible,\u201d Strome said evenly. \u201cAnd quite dangerous. If such a small portion of his consciousness is already gaining this kind of connection with you, you\u2019ll stand little chance of escaping Satanan if he becomes free of that blade. You\u2019ll quickly fall under his complete control.\u201d The Daemon\u2019s gaze traveled from Feral to Feral. \u201cThis is something you must be prepared for. Once Satanan has him, there will be no getting him back. I lost many a friend that way. Good men. Honorable men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatanan\u2019s not getting him,\u201d Tighe growled.</p><p>Wulfe stared at the woman, meeting the gaze of the Daemon. All his life, he\u2019d believed Daemons to be evil incarnate. For the past month, he\u2019d been horrified that such evil might be living in his blood, lurking inside him, waiting to come out. But if what Strome said was true, that might not be the case at all. It was a revelation, if confusing as hell. Unless this was all a ruse, an act by the woman, an ingenious way to infiltrate their ranks and gain their trust. But for what purpose?</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t think so. His instincts told him Vivian Mars and the Daemon, Strome, were legit. Either way, he and Natalie were in a shitload of trouble.</p><p>The Shaman held out his hand to Vivian. \u201cLet me touch you, please.\u201d When Vivian slid her hand between the bars, he took it and closed his eyes. Finally, after several minutes, he opened them again. \u201cI sense no darkness within this woman. On the contrary, I see only brightness and light, and a deep, abiding love.\u201d He cocked his head as he looked at Vivian with surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ve fallen in love with the Daemon who infected you.\u201d</p><p>Vivian\u2019s eyes snapped with feminine pique. \u201cHe didn\u2019t infect me. He found me. We\u2019re a team. And, yes, I care for him.\u201d Her expression softened. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d</p><p>The Shaman nodded. \u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, he cares for you equally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not mistaken,\u201d Vivian\u2019s voice snapped in Strome\u2019s distinctive way.</p><p>The Shaman turned to Lyon. \u201cI\u2019m no expert on Daemons, but I sense no darkness.\u201d</p><p>Lyon nodded. \u201cStrome claims Natalie\u2019s become a channel key.\u201d</p><p>Youthful-looking brows shot up. \u201cWho made her one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Wulfe snapped, wishing his brothers would take their claws to him for it. Rip him to shreds. \u201cI did it when I took her wound.\u201d</p><p>As the Shaman turned to Natalie, Wulfe tensed even as he knew the ancient would never hurt her. The Shaman took her hand, once more closed his eyes, then shook his head. \u201cNo darkness, no shadows. I sense nothing amiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet the Daemon claims Satanan is gaining strength through her,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cThrough her and Wulfe both.\u201d</p><p>The Shaman\u2019s eyes opened, and he dropped Natalie\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. I know little about Daemons though I\u2019ve heard it said they\u2019re connected to one another far more than most races.\u201d He looked at Wulfe. \u201cCan you sense Satanan\u2019s hold on you . . . on either of you?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe shook his head.</p><p>The Shaman turned back to Vivian/Strome. \u201cCan you explain?\u201d</p><p>Strome\u2019s hard gleam flared in the archaeologist\u2019s eyes as Vivian turned to Lyon. \u201cI can, but I won\u2019t. Your Shaman has declared Vivian without darkness, therefore you will release her. I\u2019ll share what I know when she is free of this dungeon.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s jaw tensed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you an answer shortly.\u201d As he turned to leave, Kougar, Tighe, Fox, and the Shaman followed.</p><p>Wulfe motioned Natalie to precede him, then brought up the rear.</p><p>The small band weaved their way through the Guards in the gym, but when they reached the hallway that would lead to the stairs, Lyon turned into the ritual room instead, flipping the switch to light the electric sconces. The others started to follow, but the Shaman hesitated.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve no further need of me, Lyon, Ariana and I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Thank you, Shaman.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe led Natalie into the room behind the others and closed the door. Wulfe had always liked this room, with its high, arched ceiling and dark walls that mimicked the feel of the ancient caves in which the Ferals had long ago performed their most primitive rites. While Natalie stood against the wall on one side of the door, Wulfe moved to the other.</p><p>She glanced at him, a wealth of shadows and questions in her eyes. Questions he wasn\u2019t sure he knew how to answer.</p><p>\u201cDo we trust Vivian Mars?\u201d the Chief of the Ferals asked, turning Wulfe\u2019s attention back to the problem at hand.</p><p>\u201cThat tale was too bizarre to be anything but true,\u201d Tighe muttered. \u201cMy instinct tells me Strome sought to protect Vivian, not himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we kill her, he dies,\u201d Lyon countered.</p><p>\u201cI think Tighe has the way of it,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThe Daemon\u2019s demands felt like a male protecting his woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Natalie said with certainty, surprising Wulfe, and pleasing him that she had no compunction about speaking up around his brothers. \u201cI\u2019m very good at reading eyes,\u201d she continued. \u201cIn Vivian\u2019s, I see intense curiosity, but also a total lack of cunning. When Strome takes over, I see fierce honesty. And honor. And the love the Shaman sensed. I absolutely believe Strome, or at least this piece of his consciousness, is in love with Vivian Mars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do we trust them?\u201d Lyon asked. \u201cDo we let Vivian go or keep her locked in the prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the Daemon is evil and/or in league with Satanan,\u201d Kougar said thoughtfully, \u201cletting him go might be a risk, but keeping him here could be more of one. Killing him would be, by far, the safest course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he\u2019s not in league with Satanan,\u201d Tighe countered, \u201ca Daemon could prove a powerful ally.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe grunted. \u201cI think he\u2019s telling the truth. I think he hates Satanan\u2019s guts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Tighe said. Kougar and Fox concurred.</p><p>Lyon nodded. \u201cSo we\u2019ve decided to trust him. Do we keep him here or let him go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImprisoning one\u2019s allies is a certain way to turn them against you,\u201d Fox murmured.</p><p>Tighe nodded. \u201cI have to agree. We let him go.\u201d</p><p>Lyon opened the door. \u201cThen we\u2019ve reached a decision. We\u2019ll reconvene in the war room in ten. Fox, call the other Ferals. I want them all there. Wulfe, see Natalie to her room. Tighe and Kougar, escort Vivian upstairs.\u201d</p><p>As Wulfe led Natalie back to the foyer, he braced himself for her questions or accusations. Both practically danced in the air around her. But she said nothing, climbing beside him without meeting his gaze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had every right to be mad at him for what he\u2019d done to her. Mad and scared. Goddess, he\u2019d never meant to hurt her. That was the last thing he\u2019d ever want to do.</p><p>When they finally reached her room, she walked inside then turned to him, her expression calm and enigmatic. \u201cWhen you\u2019re through with your meeting, you owe me some explanations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>With that, she turned away. Wulfe hesitated, then slowly pulled the door closed and locked it from the outside, consumed by the fear that in making Natalie his channel key, he\u2019d irreparably damaged her chances of getting out of there alive. If she paid the ultimate price for this mistake, he might as well die beside her because it would destroy his soul.</p><p>Natalie stood at the window, looking out over the circular drive. The sun shone on the cars and trucks, filtering through the woods beyond to dot the grass. But though she saw what lay outside, her mind was wholly turned inward. And she was scared.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to get into one of the books she\u2019d brought upstairs with her, Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, but though she\u2019d always loved the story, her thoughts wouldn\u2019t settle long enough for her to make any sense of the words marching across the page. Finally, she\u2019d given up and come to stand at the window.</p><p>How could any of this be happening? Shape-shifters and Daemons, odd glows and channel keys. How on Earth had she wound up smack-dab in the middle of it?</p><p>Wulfe blamed himself. She\u2019d seen it in his eyes, felt it in the way he\u2019d held her so wonderfully tight, then released her as if he couldn\u2019t bear to touch her. And maybe he was to blame. But that hardly mattered now. All that mattered was making certain she didn\u2019t somehow hurt the Ferals in their battle to stop Inir and Satanan.</p> <p>Oh, Wulfe. What have you done?</p><p>Whatever it was, he\u2019d never meant to cause harm. She\u2019d known the wolf but a matter of weeks, and the man but a day, but she saw the honor and goodness inside him so clearly. It radiated from him, a golden soul, at once fierce and gentle, and oh so beautiful.</p><p>It was no wonder she\u2019d fallen in love with him though what could possibly result from her feelings she couldn\u2019t begin to guess. What if he came to love her in return? Would she willingly give up everything she\u2019d worked so hard for to stay here with him? Could she really turn her back on her work and her mom, and go into hiding for the rest of her life? Was the love of any man worth that?</p><p>She honestly didn\u2019t know. And now that she\u2019d apparently been turned into a pawn of evil, she wasn\u2019t sure it mattered. There was a good chance she wouldn\u2019t have a life of any kind when this was over. So many things could go wrong. So many things had already gone wrong even if she didn\u2019t yet understand the ramifications of any of them.</p><p>Turning away from the window, she crossed to the bed, where she\u2019d left her book, and idly traced the title with her fingertip. She might not have a lot of choices, she mused, but she definitely had some. One always had choices, if only whether to fight or submit.</p><p>Long ago, she\u2019d decided that her life\u2019s goal was to make a difference in the lives of others. She\u2019d always believed she\u2019d do that through her work, by helping people, especially kids, see better. Then she and her friends had been captured by Mage and attacked by wraith Daemons, and everything changed. Everything.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t the woman she was before. Instead, she\u2019d become some kind of conduit to terrible power. A pawn, perhaps. But even a pawn could take down a king, under the right circumstances. With the right allies.</p><p>There were always choices. But to make the right decisions, one needed to understand the game. Up until now, Wulfe had been her protector. And, to a lesser extent, her jailer. But they were in this together now, far more than even he had realized. Things were going to change.</p><p>She had a feeling it was the only way they were going to survive.</p><p>Ten minutes later, all the Ferals were sitting or standing around the war room. Vivian, who\u2019d been released from the prison and led upstairs, sat at the head of the table where all could see her and, if necessary, question her. Lyon quickly brought the others up to speed.</p><p>Wulfe stood against the side wall, glaring at his brothers and sister as Vivian\u2019s story unfolded and their gazes kept cutting his way.</p><p>\u201cSo Wulfe-man made his very own channel key,\u201d Jag mused. \u201cDo we even know what a channel key is? Or does?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe looked at the jaguar shifter with surprise because he suspected they didn\u2019t. All they knew, they\u2019d learned from the clone. But it didn\u2019t make one bit of difference because he wasn\u2019t pulling the power through her. Ever.</p><p>\u201cStrome?\u201d Lyon asked, turning to Vivian.</p> <p>The woman sat in her chair, ramrod straight, her gaze . . . the Daemon\u2019s gaze . . . watchful and cautious as he kept an eye on every male in the room. Wulfe marveled that he could so easily tell who was in charge\u2014Vivian or the Daemon. And he sympathized with the male, who so clearly needed to protect his female yet had absolutely no ability to do so.</p><p>\u201cA channel key is a corruption of the ancient process of transforming a female into a Daemon.\u201d As Vivian/Strome began to speak, the room turned silent, every Feral riveted. \u201cWe are not entirely flesh and blood, as one of you stated. Daemons are energy creatures. And born exclusively male. The only way for us to reproduce is by converting a female of another race into a Daemon. This change does not harm her, and at one time, could not be accomplished against the female\u2019s will. It was part of the mating ceremony.</p><p>\u201cAll that changed . . . everything changed . . . when Satanan learned to tap into the primal energies. He found that human females, with their earthly physiology, could be used by almost any Daemon to reach that dark power. Satanan taught his most loyal and encouraged them to empower themselves in this way, for when they did so, they, in turn, empowered him.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe frowned. \u201cThen how did I turn Natalie into my channel key by accident?\u201d</p><p>Vivian/Strome watched him thoughtfully. \u201cYou have feelings for her. Strong feelings.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s mouth compressed. It wasn\u2019t any of the Daemon\u2019s business. And yet, maybe it was. He gave a nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd you say you healed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a gift.\u201d A curse. \u201cI can take the wounds of humans if I want to badly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rare gift. I cannot be certain, shifter, but I believe that in activating your gift with your heart open, you initiated her transformation. However, because it was done through the site of the Abomination\u2019s wounding, it was the corrupted process that took place instead, making her a channel to the primal energies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she in danger?\u201d Wulfe demanded.</p><p>Strome nodded, his expression turning sympathetic. \u201cI am afraid so, yes. Making her your channel key probably would not hurt her if you never used her as such. But Satanan is using her. The more energy he pulls through her, the quicker she will die. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe let out a roar of fury and anguish and turned, ready to plow his fist through the wall.</p><p>\u201cWulfe,\u201d Lyon warned. \u201cYou\u2019re not immortal.\u201d</p><p>Fuck! He pulled his punch at the last minute, going feral instead. Goddess he needed to kick someone\u2019s ass and get his own kicked in return. He needed the outlet!</p><p>Turning back, he captured the Daemon with his anguished gaze. \u201cHow long until it kills her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the rate Satanan is pulling the power through her now, months. If you open that channel fully and start drawing them yourself, she\u2019ll survive a day, at most. Perhaps only hours.\u201d</p><p>Natalie was not going to die. Even as the furious need to protect her drove him to pace the room with hard, angry strides, the truth of the situation unfolded in front of him. The way things stood now, she had months. And he might only have days.</p><p>With effort, he pulled himself back under control. Nothing had changed. Inir had to die, and that evil wisp of Satanan along with him. That was still the only acceptable outcome even if it appeared to be slipping through their fingers more and more each day.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone have any more questions?\u201d Lyon asked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Kougar said. \u201cIf the time comes that Wulfe must pull those energies, we need to know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just heard what he said! I\u2019m not doing it,\u201d Wulfe growled. \u201cI\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must give her back the wound he took . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Kougar pressed.</p><p>Vivian/Strome turned to Wulfe. \u201cWhat did you do to heal her in the first place?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe remained mute until Kougar pinned him with a hard gaze. With a sigh, he said, \u201cI covered her cheek with my hand and called the wound to me. Just that.\u201d</p><p>Vivian/Strome nodded. \u201cDo the reverse. Once that\u2019s done, stand her in the middle of a pentagram and say the words to call the power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe words that are written on every Daemon\u2019s soul. Daemon magic cannot be shared, it must be called on from within, and the words are part of that. They are as individual as a fingerprint and will come to you if you want them badly enough.\u201d Vivian\u2019s brows drew together, Strome\u2019s intensity still in her eyes. \u201cI warn you, shifter, if you pull the darkness, it will try to claim you. There is a possibility, because of the tender feelings you hold for your channel key, that she might be able to tether you, to keep you from falling into that darkness, but it will not be easy. It has, to my knowledge, never been done.\u201d</p><p>All were silent for several moments before Lyon asked again, \u201cAny more questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand,\u201d Hawke murmured. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear about Daemon society before Satanan.\u201d</p><p>Vivian/Strome nodded. \u201cI\u2019m happy to share what I can. Vivian already knows the story, but I see now that it\u2019s important for the immortal races to know the truth of what the Daemons were before the Destroyer, Satanan, came into his power.\u201d</p><p>Hawke fired questions and Strome endeavored to answer them, but Wulfe heard none of it through the pounding in his head, the rhythmic, furious need to get in his truck, drive straight to Inir\u2019s stronghold, and rip his enemy\u2019s heart out.</p><p>Finally, Strome stepped aside, giving Vivian back the helm. She rose, shaking hands with each of the Ferals with a smile. \u201cYou have no idea how exciting this has been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re aware you can never reveal our existence to anyone?\u201d Lyon pressed.</p><p>\u201cFully.\u201d She snorted. \u201cThey\u2019d lock me up if I told anyone I\u2019ve got a Daemon in my head. I understand what\u2019s at risk, Lyon. Thanks to the horror stories Strome has told me of Satanan, I understand, as few possibly could, what the world faces if you fail to keep him from getting free. Strome and I will do anything in our power to help you win this battle, which is why I risked everything to find you in the first place. Satanan must be stopped.\u201d</p><p>Lyon took her hand. \u201cIf you need anything, in any way, let us know. You have an ally in the Ferals.\u201d</p><p>Vivian grinned. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>Hawke exchanged phone numbers with her. As Hawke and Tighe escorted her out to her car, Kougar turned to Lyon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not advocating this, but I\u2019m going to say it because it has to be said. If Strome is correct, we have it in our power to not only break Satanan\u2019s control of Wulfe but to keep him from growing stronger.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe growled, low. \u201cNo.\u201d He knew where this was going.</p><p>Kougar turned to him, something close to compassion in his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s already being harmed by the energy flowing through her. And each time Satanan snatches control of you, you risk killing her.\u201d</p><p>He was talking about ending Natalie\u2019s life. Now. Breaking the connection that way. No. Fucking. Way.</p><p>\u201cIf, during one of those episodes, Satanan forces you to pull those energies fully, you\u2019ll likely turn on her and almost certainly kill one or more of us as well. It\u2019s a terrible risk to take when the one you seek to protect has such a small chance of survival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Wulfe drew fangs and claws, the need to rip Kougar to shreds a fire within him.</p><p>Lyon grabbed one of Wulfe\u2019s arms, Paenther the other. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to touch Natalie but you, Wulfe,\u201d Lyon said evenly. \u201cKougar brought it up because we need to consider every angle, but not a male among us would harm another\u2019s female. Not even Kougar.\u201d</p><p>Though the fury boiled hot, Wulfe allowed himself to be steered out of the room and toward the foyer.</p><p>\u201cWork it out, Wulfe. Go down to the gym and find a Therian willing to give you the fight you need.\u201d The Therian Guards might not be able to draw fangs and claws, but they were, at least, still immortal.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone touches her, I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>But Wulfe heard the unsaid words. No one would hurt her as long as he remained one of them. In control. But if he ever let the darkness, the primal energies, take him, he knew his brothers would do whatever it took to bring him back, including destroying the connection that caused it. Natalie. Assuming he hadn\u2019t already killed her himself.</p><p>Goddess help him.</p><p>With a furious roar, he slammed his fist through the plaster, then started down the basement stairs to find an immortal to fight. If only he could rip out his own Daemon soul instead.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Wulfe climbed the stairs to the third floor with heavy steps. He\u2019d kept his claws and fangs sheathed and taken on five Therian Guards at once, pounding the crap out of them as they\u2019d pummeled him in return. Though, dammit, they\u2019d kept their punches light so as not to badly damage the mortal. He was beginning to think he understood how humans felt as they aged, as their younger comrades started treating them as old men.</p><p>He rubbed his jaw where he\u2019d caught an elbow and squinted out of one eye that was starting to swell on him. Yeah, he\u2019d taken almost as good a beating as he\u2019d given, but he felt two hundred percent better. Not good, of course. Not when his world was still so fucked up. But he felt like he could handle it again without going berserk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least as long as Satanan kept his evil claws out of his mind.</p><p>But as he approached the door of Natalie\u2019s room, his steps slowed. He\u2019d promised her answers, and he wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to tell her. What was there to say? I played God and fucked up your life. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>He rapped on her door.</p> <p>\u201cCome in, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>He unlocked her door and let himself in, wincing at her look of dismay.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to fight. I sparred with some of the Therians.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her book on the bed and strode toward him. \u201cYou need an icepack for that eye.\u201d As she reached for his face, he grabbed her wrist, holding her back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Though she looked like she wanted to argue, she said nothing more, just watched him, her eyes alive with a dozen emotions, a hundred questions. The air sprang to life between them.</p><p>\u201cI need to understand what\u2019s going on, Wulfe. All of it.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he released her arm. \u201cI know.\u201d Pressing his lips together, he walked to the window. Peering out over the drive, he began to relay everything said in the war room. Several times, he swallowed back one truth or another, then forced himself to spit them out, sparing her nothing. Sparing himself nothing. He\u2019d made her a tool of evil. The least he could do was be completely honest with her.</p><p>As he spoke, as his voice rang low in the silent room, he heard the faint squeak of mattress springs and knew she\u2019d sat on the bed. Keenly aware of her behind him, he told her how Strome believed he\u2019d made her a channel key when he took her wound with his heart open. His feelings were his problem, not hers, and she didn\u2019t need that burden, too. But she wanted the truth, and he gave it to her.</p><p>When he\u2019d finished, he continued to stare out the window for several more minutes, the regret and shame thick as mud in his stomach. Finally, he forced himself to turn around, to face her.</p> <p>Natalie watched him with troubled eyes, her brows drawn, tiny frown lines marring the flesh between them. Part of him itched to stride from the room and lock the door behind him. Part of him longed to pull her into his arms. If he thought she\u2019d find any comfort there, he might have. But he\u2019d done this to her.</p><p>For long minutes, she said nothing, just watched him with that troubled frown.</p><p>\u201cYou have more questions,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAsk them, Natalie. I\u2019ll tell you anything.\u201d He owed her that much.</p><p>\u201cHow did I get the wound that made me a channel key?\u201d she said at last. \u201cIf you won\u2019t give me back my memories, at least tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p><p>To his relief, she smiled, if all too briefly. \u201cYes, my wolf, you have to.\u201d</p><p>My wolf. He liked those words. The animal spirit inside of him gave a low bark of agreement. They both liked them.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I sit?\u201d</p> <p>The soft welcome that suffused her features as she patted the bed beside her eased his heart as nothing else could have.</p><p>As he sat on the edge of her bed, his hands between his knees, he turned to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember before . . . everything happened?\u201d</p><p>She looked away, her gaze unfocused. \u201cTwo high school friends of mine and I wanted to spend the day playing tourist and catching up. We decided to drive out to Harpers Ferry. One invited her younger brother and his girlfriend to join us, so I asked Xavier to come along, too. The last thing I remember\u2014and I\u2019ve told the police this a dozen times\u2014was walking through one of the old cemeteries. A woman walked up to us with coupons for free ice cream in town. I vaguely recollect her placing that coupon in my palm, but nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have been a Mage. The moment she touched your hand, she enthralled you and led you away.\u201d</p><p>Natalie turned to him, shadows in her eyes. \u201cWhy, exactly? Were we supposed to be the Daemons\u2019 food?\u201d</p><p>He turned away, the memories of that day far too clear. Memories she didn\u2019t need to share.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Wulfe. Don\u2019t hold anything back. I need to know.\u201d</p><p>With a pained sigh, he told her. \u201cThey needed bait. The wraith Daemons are drawn to pain and suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did they make us suffer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow, Wulfe? You don\u2019t have to share every gory detail, but I need to know something.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his hands. \u201cThe Mage . . .\u201d Goddess, he didn\u2019t want to share this with her.</p><p>\u201cWulfe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey injured your two girlfriends. Cut them . . . badly. The Daemons never touched them, Natalie. Your friends fell into the spirit trap when the Earth opened and died because of that. But it\u2019s unlikely they could have survived what the Mage did to them.\u201d</p><p>He hazarded a glance and met her pained gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the rest of us?\u201d she asked quietly, her voice still strong as steel despite its softness. She would spare herself nothing. The least he could do was find the courage to give her as much of the truth as she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHumans don\u2019t see the wraith Daemons until one has made them bleed. You were clawed in the cheek, Christy across her chest. The other male . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHe died of his wounds, and I\u2019m not describing them to you. Yours and Christy\u2019s injuries were both shallow, and I was able to stop the bleeding on the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Xavier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas never touched. I\u2019m not sure how, but the wraith Daemons must have known he\u2019d never be able to see them.\u201d</p><p>Natalie lifted her hand to her unblemished cheek, to the spot where she kept feeling the pain. \u201cThe Daemon cut me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Deep inside, his wolf growled, as angry as the man that she\u2019d been hurt by such a creature.</p><p>\u201cYou say you stopped the bleeding on the battlefield. Mine and Christy\u2019s both.\u201d Confusion clouded her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI did. I didn\u2019t take your wound until later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you take it? Why?\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. You were too pretty for such an ugly gash. And it hurt you. I didn\u2019t like seeing you suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWulfe?\u201d When he turned back to her, she watched him with stubborn eyes. \u201cTell me how you made it disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a healer. I took it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>Sudden understanding leaped into her eyes. \u201cYou took it. You literally took it for your own.\u201d Her calmness shattered, and she leaped to her feet, whirling on him.</p><p>Lifting a single finger, she traced the path from his left cheekbone nearly to the corner of his mouth. He jerked back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the scar from the wound you took from me. It\u2019s yours now. When you take a wound, you keep the scar.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cYour face . . .\u201d</p><p>Wulfe grabbed her hips, lifting her out of his way as he stood and brushed past her.</p><p>But she followed. \u201cMy god, Wulfe, how many people have you healed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have healed hundreds.\u201d</p><p>He turned on her. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m no hero. I healed two. Just two.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her mouth slowly dropping open. \u201cOut of all those scars, only one is mine?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched hard, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe other person . . .\u201d Her eyes filled with pain. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to talk about it. He\u2019d never talked about it, not with another living soul, and he wasn\u2019t starting now. She\u2019d demanded truths, and he\u2019d given them to her, enough for one day. More than enough. With long strides, he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t figured you for a coward, shifter.\u201d Natalie\u2019s cool words stopped him cold, and he looked at her over his shoulder, everything inside of him clawing to reach the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d He\u2019d meant to sound fierce, or at least certain, but he heard the plea that rang in his voice.</p><p>As she moved toward him, he found himself unable to turn away, not when the annoyance slipped out of her eyes, leaving only pain.</p><p>\u201cWulfe.\u201d Natalie stepped in front of him and reached for him, laying her palms against his scarred, miserable cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he whispered. But he couldn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened. The story is festering inside you. It\u2019s poisoning your soul. Share it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d Her thumbs stroked his cheekbones, a featherlight touch that raked furrows in his mind even as it caressed his heart. With one hand, she pushed a lock of hair back from his forehead, her touch like the softest down, and his wolf whined with pleasure.</p><p>She said nothing more, made no more pleas, no more demands, as she stroked his face and his hair, pulling him completely under her spell, shattering his defenses. He didn\u2019t want to tell this story. He didn\u2019t even want to think about it himself. But he was helpless to deny her when she stared at him like that, with a softness bordering on adoration. And when she stroked him so tenderly.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Liesel.\u201d The sound of her name after all these years felt like a punch to the gut. He pulled away and stepped past Natalie, needing to put some distance between them before he spilled this miserable tale. Moving to the window, he gripped the frame with both hands, looking out over the front yard, seeing only the past.</p><p>\u201cLong before I was marked to be a Feral Warrior, in my early years of adulthood, the mortal daughter of one of the Therians came to live with the enclave where I\u2019d been born. Liesel was pretty, though not as pretty as you. And I . . . I wasn\u2019t scarred in those days. The women thought me beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still beautiful,\u201d Natalie murmured.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say to that obvious lie. \u201cAll of the males of the enclave became smitten with her. But I was the only one who interested her. And my interest in her was primarily . . . physical. One day she cut her hand, a small cut across the palm, and I stopped the bleeding as I\u2019d done with mortals a few other times. But it still hurt her, so I held it tight and willed it away, completely away. Suddenly, it was on my hand, but it healed within moments, leaving a scar as no other wound before it ever had. I was stunned. I spoke to the enclave\u2019s mystic and was told I had a rare Daemon gift. Any strange gifts in my enclave were called Daemon gifts. The mystic told me the gift would only work on mortals and that I should never use it. No good would ever come of it.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe ran a hand\u2014the one that still had that faint scar\u2014across the back of his neck, feeling the dampness of perspiration. The words felt like glass in his throat. He heard Natalie\u2019s soft footfalls as she crossed to the window, then felt the light pressure of her slender hand on his back, stroking him. He tensed, wanting her to move away, to put distance between her and this ugliness. But her sweet scent filled his nose, easing the terrible pressure, calming him. And all he wanted was for her to stay.</p><p>His gaze glued to the trees outside, he continued his tale, keenly aware of the woman at his back.</p><p>\u201cLiesel was too young for sex, only eighteen, but she enjoyed my kisses, and I enjoyed kissing her. Several times, we snuck into the woods together. She was a pretty thing, but my mind was on more important matters. Despite my own relative youth\u2014I was in my thirties\u2014I was not only the biggest male, but the finest fighter in the enclave, and our clan chief had told me I had what it took to be a leader.</p><p>\u201cOne afternoon, I promised to meet Liesel in the woods after the midday meal at our usual rendezvous point. But before I could slip away, our chief took me aside and told me he wanted to make me his second-in-command, a tremendous honor. I followed him into his hut, where we talked for hours.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI was so full of myself and my own self-importance that I completely forgot about Liesel.\u201d</p><p>Strong, slender arms wrapped around him from behind as a soft body pressed against his back, filling him with a tenderness he thought might crush him.</p><p>\u201cWhile Liesel waited for me, three young human males found her. Even a Therian female is as strong as a human male, and Liesel knew how to fight.\u201d His mouth twisted wryly. \u201cThe girl hadn\u2019t possessed an ounce of caution. When the males appeared, she\u2019d likely welcomed them as friends until they\u2019d proved they had less friendly sport in mind. Then she undoubtedly fought like a wildcat. When I found her . . .\u201d He had to suck in a breath against the stark picture that still throbbed in his mind six centuries later. \u201cShe was still conscious. Her only words, \u2018I cut his face. He cut mine more.\u2019 Goddess, but he\u2019d cut her, Natalie. They were just shallow cuts, but he\u2019d slashed her everywhere, every which way. And not just cuts. He\u2019d hit her repeatedly, shattering her nose. The blood . . .\u201d</p><p>He loosened Natalie\u2019s grip on him and turned within the circle of her arms, needing to face her. \u201cYou can see exactly what he did to her by looking at me. I was desperate to make it up to her, so I used my gift. She was so pretty, Natalie. All I could think about was that I couldn\u2019t be the reason she lost her beauty. I took wound after wound, feeling the burning cuts erupting all over my face, then the misery of her broken nose. Finally, I got them all. With the hem of my tunic, I wiped the blood from her face, once more as lovely as it had been at noontide. For one perfect moment, she opened her eyes and looked at me with such sorrow. And then she died.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d raped her. She\u2019d hemorrhaged. I never even thought to look, never noticed that she was lying in a pool of blood, that her skirts were soaked with it. While I\u2019d been intent only on restoring her beauty, she\u2019d bled to death.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould you possibly have healed internal wounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t matter because I never even tried. I\u2019d sought only to preserve her beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was vain, Natalie. I was full of my own beauty and strength and self-importance. And the goddess punished me for it, turning me into a monster none could stand the sight of.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away from her, unable to bear her sorrowful gaze. \u201cI didn\u2019t learn. There you were, so beautiful, even with that wound, but I couldn\u2019t handle it. I couldn\u2019t let you suffer. So I took your injury and made you a pawn of evil.\u201d</p><p>He felt her hand on his back again, as if she hadn\u2019t heard a word he said. He shuddered beneath her touch, hating it. Needing it.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, turn around.\u201d Natalie\u2019s words were so quiet, so gentle, he had to close his eyes against the aching tenderness of them. Slowly, he did as she asked, forcing himself to meet her gaze. In those gray depths, he found the same quiet gentleness he\u2019d felt in her touch and heard in her voice.</p><p>She reached up as if to press her hands against his cheeks again, but he grabbed her wrists and stopped her.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear anything I said.\u201d</p><p>A sad smile breached her mouth. \u201cI heard everything you said and much you didn\u2019t say. I heard the story of a young man who knowingly destroyed his own handsome face in order to try to help a young woman he had only a passing interest in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let her die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know she was dying. You had no idea she\u2019d been raped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have. Her clothes were torn, her arms were scratched and bruised. I should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe subconsciously you suspected, but such a fate for a virgin, one you cared about, was more than you could wrap your mind around, so you healed the wounds you could see. You tried, Wulfe. You sacrificed everything to try to save her.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled her hands out of his softening grip and reached for his cheeks again, and this time he didn\u2019t stop her. \u201cYou view your scars as punishment for what you failed to prevent, marks proclaiming your guilt. I see them as marks of compassion, a reflection of the selfless nature of your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the fault of the men who attacked her. The only mistake you made was in missing an appointment, an assignation. If you\u2019d believed she might come to harm in those woods, you wouldn\u2019t have let her meet you there. You\u2019d have escorted her out there.\u201d</p><p>It was true. \u201cThe humans never came that far into our woods. Ever, until that day.\u201d And they never did again. He\u2019d tracked them down, every one.</p><p>\u201cExactly. The very fact that you\u2019ve taken that guilt and owned it for so long proves what a good, unselfish man you really are.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head even as her fingers traced the ruined shape of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou are the kindest, most gentle, most extraordinary man I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe stared at her. She didn\u2019t understand. How could she be watching him with such softness in her eyes after what he\u2019d told her? His hands found her waist, whether to push her away, or hold on to her, he wasn\u2019t sure. But the next thing he knew, he was pulling her closer, needing her closer.</p> <p>Natalie smiled and continued to stroke his face, her fingers tracing his crooked nose. \u201cYou\u2019re a part Daemon, shape-shifting immortal. How do you even exist? Yet I\u2019m so glad you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be safer if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. If not for you and your friends, I\u2019d be dead. Daemon bait.\u201d Soft fingers traced his eyebrows, making his heart clench, making his arms ache to lock her against him and never let her go. But he forced himself to do nothing, to simply hold on to her waist as she explored his ruined face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blind.\u201d He sucked in a breath, afraid he\u2019d offended her. But the sweet smile she gifted him with melted him instead.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much more to you than your scars. I wish you could see that. I wish you could see what I see, the gentleness, the fierceness in defense of the vulnerable, and the honor, and valor, and goodness. Your skin may be scarred, but it doesn\u2019t dim your beauty, not even a little.\u201d</p><p>So mesmerized was he by her words and her soft touches that he barely registered what she was doing until the fingers she\u2019d burrowed into his hair suddenly gripped his head and pulled him toward her.</p><p>Natalie kissed him, full on the mouth.</p><p>Wulfe shuddered at the sweetness of her warm lips brushing his, closing his eyes against the torrent of emotion that flowed into him through that small joining, lighting him up inside. He gathered her closer, kissing her back, gentle, tender kisses on her lips, her soft cheeks, her eyes, her forehead. Tenderness welled up hot and full until he felt as if his chest would crack open from the pressure of it.</p><p>Beneath his hands, she began to tremble. He heard the soft catch of her breath and felt the tension coiling in her body. The musk of her desire wove around him, filling his mind until his own hands began to shake. She wanted him. Her rising passion transmitted itself to him through the fingers still burrowing in his hair. But his body refused to respond, and it saddened him beyond measure.</p><p>Slowly, he pulled back, meeting her gaze, slain by the heat in gray eyes turned silver. He stroked her cheek, then caressed her silken hair. \u201cI can\u2019t give you more, Natalie. I wish I could.\u201d</p><p>A shudder escaped her on a hard, pent-up breath. Disappointment pinched her eyes, and she dropped her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re not into me in that way. That\u2019s too bad, but I understand.\u201d</p><p>Gripping her chin, he forced her to look at him. \u201cThen you understand nothing. Mentally, I yearn to strip you naked, toss you onto that bed, and follow you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWulfe.\u201d Her eyes went molten with desire, and he kicked himself for a moron.</p><p>\u201cBut my body and mind are no longer connected in that way. I was mated . . . married . . . to our previous Radiant, Beatrice, for over 140 years. She died nine months ago in a Mage attack. It damaged me, Natalie, in many, many ways. I no longer . . . rise . . . with desire, not for any woman. Food has lost its taste, colors their brilliance. My senses and my libido are shot, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re ever coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than . . . you know . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpotence?\u201d He snorted. \u201cYeah. I can get it up manually. And I can get off . . . pardon my crudeness. But I can\u2019t feel. I can\u2019t want.\u201d He stroked her hair, loving the springy feel. \u201cIf I could, I would want you. Only you.\u201d</p><p>The disappointment in her eyes slipped away, turning them incandescent. \u201cDo you enjoy touching me? Holding me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly, a smile tugging at his mouth. \u201cI love touching you.\u201d</p><p>The smile she gave him was nothing short of brilliant, stealing his breath. Had the goddess ever created a woman more beautiful?</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you can\u2019t give me more, I\u2019d very much like for you to touch me, or hold me. Do you like to cuddle?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m a wolf.\u201d His heart rose, feeling lighter than it had in a long, long time, as if a terrible weight had been lifted. And maybe it had.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI want whatever you can give me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could bring you pleasure.\u201d The thought tantalized.</p><p>Her lashes swept down, her breath turned ragged. When she looked at him again, her eyes were smoking. But she shook her head. \u201cMaybe later. For now, just hold me, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>His animal whined with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d enjoy more.\u201d He lifted her into his arms in a move that felt as natural as breathing, then deposited her on the bed, and joined her. As he pulled her into his arms, his world righted itself, the terrible tension escaping his limbs as he cradled her against him, her precious head on his chest. He stroked her silken hair, filled with an incredible sweetness, marveling at the miracle of her acceptance, and vowed that if he managed to do nothing else right, he would keep her safe.</p><p>But deep down, he feared that he\u2019d already failed.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Natalie reveled in the feel of Wulfe\u2019s strong arms around her as they lay together, fully clothed, on his bed. His body was like granite, his arms as thick as tree trunks, yet he held her so gently, as if she were made of the most fragile glass. He smelled of dark forests and sunlit meadows, and his warm, masculine scent intoxicated her. His jaw rested against her head, her cheek against his shoulder, and nothing had ever felt so intimate, so right.</p><p>She\u2019d lain like this with Rick from time to time, but she\u2019d never felt as if they shared the same air, as if their hearts beat in time. And she did with Wulfe.</p><p>Her arm curled tighter around his waist as love, pure and bright, rushed up inside of her, stinging her eyes. Nothing would likely ever come of it. Certainly nothing physical. But she longed to pull off his shirt and rub her cheek against his bare chest. She longed to feel his nakedness pressed against hers. The thought shattered her breath. But he didn\u2019t feel the same, he couldn\u2019t feel the same after the damage he\u2019d suffered.</p><p>If she could just be something to him, make a difference to him in some way. Sliding her hand across his chest, she looked up at him. \u201cWulfe, I know what Strome said, that pulling the primal energies through me could be dangerous. But if you ever need to, if it\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to beat Satanan, don\u2019t hesitate.\u201d</p><p>Rolling onto his side, he levered himself onto one elbow and stared down at her with vehement eyes. \u201cI will never use you in that way, Natalie. Never.\u201d He stroked her cheek, his fingers as gentle as rain despite the intensity of his look.</p><p>\u201cIf the time ever comes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to make sacrifices, too.\u201d</p><p>He covered her lips with his finger, his eyes luminous. \u201cI know. But I will never be okay with anything that harms you.\u201d</p><p>He tensed suddenly, going still as a frozen pond.</p><p>\u201cWulfe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he said quietly, his gaze rising to the ceiling even as he stroked her hair.</p><p>Impatiently, she waited for him to explain, loving the sweet feel of his hand on her head. Finally, his body relaxed on a deep breath and an exhale. His head dipped, resting lightly against her temple and she stroked his hair in return, thrilled to finally be able to do so.</p><p>\u201cI heard Inir and Satanan again,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnything important?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and stroked her cheek. \u201cYes and no.\u201d</p><p>His fingers traced her nose, her eyebrows, her ear, his touch so gentle, so sweet. Her heart contracted even as her pulse kicked up, her breathing turning shallow. If only touching her affected him in the same way.</p><p>\u201cSatanan\u2019s mad that the Mage keep failing. I\u2019m kind of amused. Inir started out the one in charge, with Satanan nothing more than an advisor, but Inir\u2019s starting to get pushed aside.\u201d He grunted. \u201cThat should probably scare the crap out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to tell Lyon?\u201d She stroked his cheek, her finger tracing one scar in particular, the one she knew to be hers.</p><p>He watched her, his body tensing slightly as she traced that scar. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him when I go downstairs. It doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>His gaze sharpened slightly, his nostrils flaring, and he buried his nose against her neck. \u201cYou smell like heaven.\u201d Slowly he lifted his head, longing filling his eyes. \u201cI want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath trembled out, heat racing straight to her core. \u201cAnywhere. However . . . wherever . . . you want.\u201d</p><p>She felt him shudder, watched his eyes fill with soft wonder as his warm hand burrowed beneath the hem of her shirt to palm her abdomen.</p><p>Her breath caught. Mesmerized, she watched his face lower, felt his lips on her jaw, then her neck. She turned her head, giving him full access, gasping with pleasure as his tongue stroked her pulse point.</p><p>As heat suffused her body, she buried her fingers in his hair, trailing them down his neck to his broad shoulders. \u201cDoes it bother you that I\u2019m so affected by you when you can\u2019t . . . reciprocate?\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed her jaw. \u201cI\u2019m in awe that you\u2019re affected by my touch.\u201d The truth rang in his words and throbbed in the tenderness of his lips as he rained kisses on her cheek, her temple, her brow. \u201cI love the way you smell, the way you taste.\u201d His hand slid up and over one breast. His breath hitched. \u201cThe way you feel.\u201d</p><p>As his strong fingers caressed her breast through her bra with infinite tenderness, he rose to look down into her face, his eyes shining with a soft need that lacked a carnal sharpness. \u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p><p>Arching her back, she reached behind her and unhooked her bra. Pulling her shirt off over her head, she tossed both onto the far side of the bed, then lay back. With a shiver of excitement, she watched as Wulfe reached for her, the most reverent expression on his face.</p><p>His big hands stroked her with featherlight touches as he gazed at her breasts as if they were the most beautiful things he\u2019d ever seen. His thumb traced one tight nipple, making her gasp. With a flick of his gaze to hers, he lowered his face, tracing that same bud with his tongue. Sensation shot straight through her, making her gasp and arch into his touch. Her hands slid into his hair and she cradled him close as his lips explored her, tasted her, sucked her flesh into his warm mouth.</p><p>By the time he lifted his face and met her gaze again, her body was flushed with need, her breath a wreck. In his eyes, she saw joy tempered by uncertainty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she asked, caressing his cheek, running her thumb across his bottom lip.</p><p>He kissed her thumb but continued to watch her with that intent gaze. \u201cWill you let me pleasure you?\u201d</p><p>Her limbs went weak. \u201cI\u2019m yours, Wulfe. All I am, all I have, is yours. In any way you want me.\u201d</p> <p>A small frown appeared between his brows as if he didn\u2019t precisely know what to make of that. And perhaps she didn\u2019t either. All she knew was that it was true. In some strange, elemental way, she\u2019d been made for this moment, for this man.</p><p>She reached for the button of her jeans. \u201cWill you tell me how I can pleasure you, too?\u201d</p><p>His fingers moved hers aside. \u201cYou are pleasuring me.\u201d</p><p>With slow, easy movements, he unzipped her jeans and removed them, leaving her in nothing but a pair of white lace panties. Then, with gentle hands that belonged more to a man admiring a fine piece of sculpture than to a male in the throes of passion, he stroked her legs, one after the other, ankle to thigh, then her abdomen, and again, her breasts. Pleasure drenched his features, if not in the carnal way she might have liked.</p><p>Finally, his fingers dipped beneath the waistband of her panties and he pulled them down and off, tossing them aside.</p> <p>His gaze found the juncture of her thighs, his body stilling. \u201cLet me see you.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her knees, she let them drop, opening herself to his sight, to whatever he wanted. Fire licked between her legs as he gazed at her, as wonder once more lit his face.</p><p>\u201cHow I wish . . .\u201d he murmured with a sorrowful shake of his head. He looked up at her, meeting her gaze. \u201cYou are the most beautiful woman ever created.\u201d</p><p>It was flattery in its finest form, but she saw truth in his eyes and knew he believed it. Holding her gaze, he slowly lowered himself between her thighs to kiss her belly, then lower still, finding the place where her need coalesced.</p><p>At the first brush of his tongue on that sensitive spot, she cried out.</p><p>She heard him growl, a low sound of male satisfaction and stroked her again, a long stroke that traced the full length of the place she longed for him to fill. If only . . .</p> <p>As if sensing her need, he slid one thick finger into her, and she moaned with satisfaction. As he stroked that finger in and out, he licked and sucked and tugged with his lips and teeth until she came with a startling crash, convulsing around him, gasping.</p><p>Slowly, he pulled away from her. As she tried to reclaim her breath, he lay down beside her and gathered her against him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he murmured against her temple, then kissed her there.</p><p>As she laid her head on his chest, she heard his heart beating, strong and steady. Far too evenly. \u201cThat didn\u2019t excite you.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt delighted me.\u201d</p><p>But there was something wrong about taking from a man to whom she couldn\u2019t give. As she lay beside him, naked and sated, while he remained fully dressed, she felt suddenly awkward. Pulling away, she sat up, reached for her clothes, and dressed quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Natalie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Wulfe.\u201d Down the hall, she heard voices and the sound of a barking dog. Skye must be upstairs.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d His mouth twisted ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you shift for me?\u201d she asked, slipping on her shoes. \u201cI miss my wolf buddy.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cYou do realize he\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed \u201cOf course. I still want to see you like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not just trying to get me naked?\u201d He was teasing, yet a gleam entered his eyes that she found too endearing.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI love you naked.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, he stripped for her, and she thoroughly enjoyed the sight. Then, in a spray of sparkling lights, the man disappeared, the wolf taking his place.</p><p>A different kind of pleasure burst within her at the sight of her old friend. Kneeling on the rug, she opened her arms and he ran into them, licking her neck as she wrapped her arms around him and rubbed his fur. Joy vibrated through his wolf body.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t entirely understand where you, your wolf, and your animal spirit begin and end, but the spirit is stronger in you in this form, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Hmm. I\u2019d say no, but my animal\u2019s disagreeing. At least, where you come in. He feels closer to you in this form. He feels that he\u2019s yours. Or perhaps thinks of you as his. Definitely the latter. You\u2019re his. Ours. I think he adores you as much as I do.</p><p>She stroked him, looking into those intelligent eyes. \u201cDo you . . . adore me?\u201d</p><p>You know I do.</p><p>A rap sounded at the door. \u201cWulfe? Is Natalie in there with you?\u201d</p><p>Natalie glanced at the door. \u201cCan I let her in?\u201d</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Rising to her feet, she crossed the room, the huge wolf all but pressed against her side. She opened the door to find Olivia and Skye. Both women grinned and reached for Wulfe, stroking his head.</p><p>In Natalie\u2019s head, Wulfe chuckled. There are advantages to being a canine. Even the puppy, Lady, went crazy, trying to greet her oversized pack mate.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having happy hour in Lyon\u2019s room with Kara,\u201d Olivia said, smiling at Natalie. \u201cCome join us.\u201d</p><p>Natalie grinned. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d She glanced at Wulfe, stroking his back. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>A smile lit those dark wolf eyes. She can come if you take responsibility for her, Olivia. Lyon\u2019s orders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d Olivia said, lifting her hand solemnly. \u201cI promise not to let her glass get empty.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe snorted. That\u2019s not the responsibility I meant.</p><p>Olivia threw Natalie a quick grin.</p><p>Natalie bent and kissed Wulfe\u2019s furred head. As she stepped away, he lowered himself to the floor, lying flat where the puppy could finally reach him, yipping and pouncing with delight. All three women laughed.</p><p>I\u2019ll bring her to you in a few minutes, Wulfe assured Skye. We need a little playtime.</p><p>Natalie watched the huge wolf and tiny puppy romp for a few moments, grinning at the sweetness of it, then followed the two women next door. Lyon\u2019s room was no bigger than hers or Wulfe\u2019s, which surprised her considering Lyon was the chief and Kara the Radiant. Then again, it didn\u2019t surprise her at all. Kara, especially, was as unpretentious as anyone Natalie knew.</p><p>The room had been painted a rich orange-gold, the curtains dark brown. Paintings covered most of the walls, an eclectic mix\u2014everything from sailing vessels to jungle animals to landscapes.</p><p>In the center of the massive bed sat Kara, lounging against half a dozen pillows, dark circles under her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHi, Natalie,\u201d she said cheerily despite her less than healthy pallor. She patted the bed. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>Falkyn, Delaney, and Julianne strode into the room, Falkyn carrying two bottles of wine in each hand, Delaney holding a large water bottle and corkscrew, and Julianne a platter of canap\u00e9s, which she placed in the middle of the bed. A row of pretty hand-painted wineglasses sat on the dresser.</p><p>Olivia and Skye each uncorked a bottle of wine and began filling the glasses.</p><p>\u201cMelisande popped out for a minute, but she\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Kara told them. \u201cShe decided we needed chocolate-covered strawberries to go with the Chardonnay.\u201d</p><p>Olivia lifted a brow. \u201cWhere\u2019s she going for those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia.\u201d</p><p>Delaney smiled. \u201cOnly an Ilina could pop across the country and back in ten minutes. Well, ten seconds. The minutes will be for the actual purchase. Sit,\u201d Delaney commanded. \u201cAll of you. I\u2019ll serve the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should sit,\u201d Skye countered. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, which is why I\u2019m not drinking the wine. It makes perfect sense for me to serve it.\u201d</p><p>Skye shook her head with a smile. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Thanks, D.\u201d</p><p>Natalie joined the others as they climbed onto the bed to sit cross-legged in a semicircle around Kara and the platter of food. Delaney handed them each a glass, then joined them with her water bottle.</p><p>\u201cWe do this every afternoon,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cIt\u2019s our way of thumbing our noses at the Mage, even if those pricks don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care. We refuse to give in to the fear of what might happen. And if worse comes to worse, we\u2019re going to continue this ritual of sisterhood. Because we\u2019ll still have each other.\u201d</p><p>As one, Delaney and Olivia gripped Falkyn\u2019s knees, one on either side, their expressions pained. \u201cMost of us.\u201d Falkyn would share the fate of the Ferals.</p><p>Movement caught Natalie\u2019s eye on the far side of the room as Melisande appeared suddenly, a white box in her hands.</p><p>\u201cSuccess!\u201d Melisande announced. \u201cI bought three dozen because they\u2019re exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrawberry. Now,\u201d Delaney moaned. \u201cI\u2019m suddenly having a massive craving.\u201d</p><p>Melisande grinned and joined them on the bed, placing the box beside the tray of canap\u00e9s, then taking the extra wineglass Skye held for her.</p><p>When they were all seated, Olivia lifted her glass. \u201cTo sisterhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo sisterhood,\u201d the others replied.</p><p>Natalie lifted her glass with a smile, saying nothing, and noticed that Julianne did the same. The pretty brunette with the bright blue eyes was a wife, but not a Feral wife, if Natalie remembered correctly. Yet both of them had been included in this extraordinary group.</p><p>As Natalie took a sip, her gaze roamed the circle, and she marveled at the welcome she\u2019d received from every single one of them. They were a wonderful group, women she\u2019d love to keep as friends. When and if the day came for her to return home, for Wulfe to take her memories again, she was going to lose so much.</p><p>As the women shared wine and strawberries, the talk steered resolutely away from the topic that Natalie knew must consume them all\u2014the Ferals\u2019 waning immortality. Soon, she found herself the focus of their attention.</p><p>Olivia eyed her curiously. \u201cSo . . . what\u2019s up with you and Wulfe? You like him. Maybe more than \u2018like\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Natalie looked down at her wineglass, startled by the sudden rush of emotion. She loved him. But that was a foolish thing to admit when it was still all too likely she\u2019d be sent back to her world with no memory of him. It was best for both of them if he never knew how she felt.</p><p>\u201cI do like him,\u201d she said evenly, looking up to meet Olivia\u2019s gaze. \u201cWulfe is one of the finest men I\u2019ve ever met. Wolf eyes or human, his soul shines through, and it is truly beautiful. He\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. \u201cI like you, Natalie. You\u2019re the real deal.\u201d</p><p>Natalie smiled. For several moments, they sipped their wine in silence, but the pall they\u2019d pushed to the corners of the room began floating forward to hang, once more, heavily over their heads.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something we can do to stop all this, to stop Inir,\u201d Kara murmured. \u201cThere is so much cruelty, so much evil in that man. And he\u2019s nothing compared to Satanan.\u201d</p><p>Natalie opened her mouth to ask more, then closed it. Then decided if anyone would tell her the truth, these women would. \u201cWill you tell me about the Daemons?\u201d Natalie asked. \u201cAt least the wraith Daemons. I was attacked by one, but I have no memory of it. I keep hearing that life will be terrible if they\u2019re freed, but I need to understand.\u201d For a moment, the others were silent, shadows in their eyes, and Natalie regretted bringing it up. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the time or place, was it?\u201d</p><p>Delaney patted her shoulder. \u201cYou have every right to ask. The guys keep trying to protect us, but if the Daemons rise, we need to know what we\u2019re facing. All of us.\u201d</p><p>Skye nodded. \u201cOur silence wasn\u2019t because you shouldn\u2019t have asked, Natalie. It\u2019s because it\u2019s hard to know where to start or what to say. I saw the three wraith Daemons who were freed in the caverns. I saw them feed.\u201d Her eyes flinched with remembered horror.</p><p>Natalie took her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. You need to hear this. They\u2019re truly terrible, monsters who feed on the pain and terror of their victims. Imagine the worst torture your mind can come up with, then multiply it by a hundred. That\u2019s the way they kill.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s stomach clenched, her forehead turning hot.</p><p>Kara nodded. \u201cKougar says that in the old days, before they were captured in the blade, they tortured human children. By the thousands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did,\u201d Melisande concurred. \u201cThey\u2019d round them up\u2014\u201d</p><p>Natalie lifted her hand. \u201cI get the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wraith Daemons have no consciences,\u201d Olivia added. \u201cI\u2019m not at all sure they\u2019re even sentient beings.\u201d</p><p>Falkyn nodded. \u201cFrom what Strome said, they were created by Satanan for the sole purpose of creating the pain and fear that empowers him. Wulfe says that over seven thousand of them will be set loose upon the world if that blade opens. They can\u2019t be freed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ferals won\u2019t let it happen,\u201d Kara said fiercely.</p><p>No one contradicted her, but the looks that passed between them told Natalie that none of them were certain of that, Kara included. And the Ferals were running out of time.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>After checking on Natalie and sending Lady back to her two-legged mom, Wulfe headed downstairs. As he descended the final steps, Lyon strode into the foyer, followed by the Shaman, Paenther, Tighe, and Kougar.</p><p>\u201cJoin us, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>He did, falling into step beside Tighe. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just got another call from our escapees, this time from Grizz. They found the woman they were searching for. Apparently, she\u2019s half Valkyrie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cValkyrie?\u201d</p><p>Kougar glanced at him. \u201cValkyries were members of the Nyad race, one of the races destroyed by Satanan early in his rise to power. This woman, Sabine, apparently survived, thanks to her mixed blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s willing to help us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not willing at all. She\u2019s an empath, far too sensitive to be around others. Grizz is bringing her anyway.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe frowned. \u201cAnd why does he think she\u2019ll cooperate? If she\u2019s being forced, we won\u2019t be able to trust a thing she says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Valkyrie can\u2019t lie, not when proclaiming a soul good or bad.\u201d</p><p>Lyon opened the door to the basement and started down, the others following. \u201cGrizz asked for Ilina transport, and Ariana\u2019s sending it. The Ilinas are about to deliver them directly to the prisons.\u201d</p><p>The implications spun in his head. \u201cThis is great. If the woman can tell us whether the new Ferals are good or bad, we can bring the good ones into their animals, which should heal Kara. And since the new Ferals haven\u2019t been affected by the dark charm, there\u2019s no danger of their losing their immortality. Inir\u2019s plot to free the Daemons fails.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping,\u201d Tighe said, but while his voice contained a measure of relief, it lacked true jubilation. Because the original Ferals were still in trouble. None of this would solve the problem of their waning immortality.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone else lost the ability to shift?\u201d Wulfe asked.</p><p>\u201cHawke did,\u201d Tighe said, glancing over his shoulder as they descended the last of the stairs. Tighe waited for him to join him and met him with a bleak, somber gaze. \u201cAbout twenty minutes ago, so did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. I\u2019m sorry, Stripes.\u201d If Tighe ever saw his unborn son, it would be a miracle.</p><p>They strode through the gym, the Therian Guards parting like a disciplined sea. At the back of the gym, Lyon opened the hidden door in the glass that led to the prisons, releasing a woman\u2019s cry of agony.</p><p>Lyon took off running, the others close behind. They burst into the prison block to find six cells full. Three new Ferals and now Grizz, Lepard, and Sabine. The Ilinas who\u2019d transported them stood outside the cells, waiting for Kougar\u2019s or Lyon\u2019s dismissal.</p> <p>Lyon held up his hand for them to wait, then turned to Grizz ,who was cursing a blue streak.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? You fuckheads! I said transport, not prison.\u201d Grizz grabbed the bars, shaking them hard. \u201cShe\u2019s a fucking empath! What part of empath don\u2019t you understand? I told you she wouldn\u2019t be able to tolerate this without touching me. Let me go to her. Now!\u201d</p><p>Sabine leaned against the bars of her own cage, her head caught in her hands, keening with pain.</p><p>The place was in chaos.</p><p>\u201cI can help her,\u201d Grizz said, reining back his temper with obvious effort. \u201cTouching me eases her.\u201d</p><p>Lyon swung to the nearest Ilina. \u201cPut the woman in Grizz\u2019s cell.\u201d</p><p>The Ilina disappeared, and a moment later deposited Sabine beside Grizz, as directed. Grizz swept her up, cradling her against him as Sabine curled into him, burying her face against his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, over and over.</p> <p>But despite the way she clung to him, Sabine\u2019s response was harsh and pained. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>Grizz lifted his head, glared at them through the bars of his cage, and snarled, \u201cGet this done and send her the fuck home. I don\u2019t know how long she can take this.\u201d</p><p>The Shaman stepped forward. \u201cRemarkable. I\u2019ve not seen a Nyad in well over five millennia. I believed you all dead, Sabine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be,\u201d she gasped, \u201cif you don\u2019t free me soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you help us determine the souls of the males in these prison cells?\u201d Lyon asked.</p><p>Sabine lifted her head and met his gaze, pain bracketing her mouth. \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Lyon said nothing. \u201cIf you lie about what you find, my wife may die. And not only will my own heart cease to beat, but without our Radiant, the Ferals will be unable to keep the Mage from freeing the Daemons. I imagine you\u2019re familiar with the Daemons?\u201d</p><p>Sabine glanced up, looking at Grizz with such a depth of fury that Wulfe suspected she\u2019d happily yank his heart out of his chest if she didn\u2019t need him to manage the pain.</p><p>\u201cLet me down,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Grizz set her on her feet, keeping one arm tight around her, an arm she gripped with both hands.</p><p>\u201cI am called the Shaman, Sabine,\u201d the youthful-looking male said, stepping close to the cage. \u201cI am ancient, despite my appearance, and once knew Nyads. I would touch you, if you\u2019ll allow it, to verify you are what you say and that you\u2019ve not been infected with the darkness that plagues the world.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cIf my pain at being near others is terrible, touching is ten times worse.\u201d</p><p>Lyon stepped forward, his expression determined if not unsympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I must insist you cooperate with the Shaman, Sabine. You understand my concern.\u201d</p><p>Sabine closed her eyes, her mouth tight, as if trying to gather her courage. She stepped out of Grizz\u2019s embrace, but took his hand and gripped it tight as she walked to the bars of the cage and thrust her hand through.</p><p>The moment the Shaman took her hand, she threw her head back, her back bowing in pain. Grizz pressed himself against her, holding her as closely as possible, his jaw rigid. The male might have anger-management issues, but he was clearly suffering at the woman\u2019s misery.</p><p>\u201cA good soul,\u201d Sabine cried.</p><p>The Shaman dropped her hand and stepped back gingerly. \u201cShe is Nyad, as she claims. And pure. There is no darkness here, I\u2019m certain of it.\u201d</p><p>Sabine sank against Grizz, and he pulled her tight against him. Wulfe could almost see the grizzly shifter flaying himself alive for hurting her.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she calmed by your touch?\u201d the Shaman asked.</p><p>Grizz looked up and met the male\u2019s gaze. \u201cI have no fucking idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish this!\u201d Sabine cried. \u201cAnd then let me go. Please.\u201d</p><p>Lyon strode to the door of Grizz\u2019s cage and opened it. Grizz stared at him for a moment, then swept Sabine up into his arms and carried her into the open space.</p><p>Lyon motioned him to the cage where Castin watched with piercing eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour hand.\u201d</p><p>Castin pushed his hand through the bars of the cage.</p><p>Sabine hesitated, shaking now. Wulfe could see her terror of the touch to come and imagined being told he had to reach into the fire and grasp hold of a red-hot iron. Considering her reaction, he thought it might be just that bad for her.</p><p>Grizz, clearly thinking the same, shuddered, tipping his head against the top of hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>Slowly, Sabine reached for Castin\u2019s hand and held on until she was quaking violently. \u201cOld,\u201d she gasped. \u201cSo much death, so much suffering. A good soul,\u201d she cried at last and released the hand.</p><p>The Ferals watched the proceedings with a mix of fascination, hope, and unhappiness. Not a one would let a woman suffer needlessly and it cut at every one of them that they were forcing this woman to suffer now.</p><p>At Lyon\u2019s direction, Grizz approached the cage of the silent, dark-skinned male with the watchful eyes. As the male extended his hand, Sabine took it weakly, and screamed. \u201cDeath. Pain.\u201d She was trembling, now, shuddering. But her declaration was strong and sure. \u201cA good soul.\u201d</p><p>Goddess, how much more of this could she take? How much more of this could any of them take? Wulfe was ready to declare enough! They already had two they should be able to bring safely into their animals. But to leave the others in limbo, when they had this opportunity to learn the truth, was unthinkable. There was no choice but to force Sabine to press on, and Lyon did just that.</p><p>Grizz turned to the cages across the aisle, to where Lepard stood, his hand extended, his brows drawn.</p><p>Sabine didn\u2019t reach for him. She was shaking so badly, Wulfe wondered if she could even if she wanted to. Grizz lifted her hand, his face lined with misery, and handed it to Lepard.</p><p>Sabine screamed, her body bowing in agony. But her pronouncement was the same as the others. \u201cA good soul,\u201d she announced in that singular voice that was hers and yet sounded almost a thing apart.</p><p>The moment she spoke, Lepard released her, and she fell against Grizz\u2019s chest, gasping for air.</p><p>Grizz cradled her as gently as a child. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sabine. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cThen yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she gasped. \u201cCan\u2019t read Grizz. It\u2019s why I can touch him.\u201d</p><p>As if dragging leaden feet, Grizz turned toward Rikkert, who glared at him with a raw hatred the Ferals had yet to understand.</p><p>Grizz lifted Sabine\u2019s hand to him, and the male took it carefully. Sabine\u2019s scream was terrible, enough to shatter eardrums.</p><p>Finally, in that same, strong voice, she declared, \u201cA good soul.\u201d A moment later, she fell limp in Grizz\u2019s arms.</p><p>Grizz whirled on Lyon. \u201cIt\u2019s done. Send her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back in your cage first.\u201d</p><p>Grizz glared at the chief of the Ferals but did as commanded. As the door clanged shut behind him, he dipped his head close to Sabine\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d Her words were barely audible even to Feral ears, and broken.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>As Wulfe watched, one of the Ilinas appeared in Grizz\u2019s cage, and in the blink of an eye, Grizz once more stood alone.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to perform the Renascence, now, or wait for nightfall?\u201d Tighe asked, a thread of excitement weaving through his words.</p><p>Kougar stroked his beard. \u201cShe claimed every one of them a good soul.\u201d</p><p>Paenther nodded. \u201cAnd Kara\u2019s told us she was wholly unimpressed with the two Ferals she was forced to bring into their animals by Inir. Neither revealed much courage, let alone honor. It makes sense that the honorable ones were drawn to us, the evil ones to Inir.\u201d</p><p>Lyon turned and strode out of the prisons, his expression grim. Glancing at one another, Wulfe and the others followed silently.</p><p>\u201cMy office,\u201d Lyon said, as they reached the foyer.</p><p>A moment later, Paenther roared, \u201cNo.\u201d The male turned ashen, his eyes filling with anguish. \u201cMy panther . . .\u201d</p><p>Another one down. Wulfe clasped him on the back and they followed, single file, into Lyon\u2019s office. As Lyon rounded his desk, his hand went out to steady himself.</p><p>\u201cRoar?\u201d Kougar reached for him, but Lyon reared back with a shout of agony and despair, and Wulfe knew he\u2019d lost his animal, now, too.</p><p>They were falling like flies.</p><p>\u201cYou still have yours?\u201d Tighe asked.</p><p>Wulfe nodded. As far as he knew, there were only five of them who could still shift now, himself and the four newest Ferals\u2014Falkyn and Fox, Lepard and Grizz. How long until their lights, too, went out?</p><p>Deep inside, his wolf howled in misery.</p><p>Lyon sank onto his chair, burying his face in his hands. The others took seats or stood silently, waiting for him to grieve and to gather his thoughts. Finally, he looked up, his expression more than fury, more than grief. In that strong visage he respected above all others, Wulfe saw fear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s critical that we bring the new Ferals into their animals as quickly as possible.\u201d Lyon\u2019s jaw turned hard as granite, his voice dropping to an anguished whisper. \u201cBut what if Sabine was wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Valkyrie can\u2019t lie,\u201d Kougar said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the animals always mark the strongest, most honorable Therians to become new Ferals,\u201d Lyon countered. \u201cWe believed that, too. What if both are wrong?\u201d</p><p>Kara would die.</p><p>Paenther sighed. \u201cWe only have to bring one new Feral into his animal to stop Inir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Lyon turned to him, his eyes as bleak as an arctic storm. \u201cIs there one of the three you would stake Skye\u2019s life on?\u201d His gaze swung around the room, pinning them in turn. \u201cOr Ariana\u2019s? Or Delaney\u2019s? Or Natalie\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s reaction was fierce and immediate, his hands fisting at his side. He didn\u2019t care what the hell Sabine had claimed, there was no way he\u2019d risk Natalie on the word of a stranger. And no way they could risk Kara. Yet the fate of the world might ride on this decision.</p><p>To a male, they looked away, unable to hold their chief\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Lyon shot to his feet with a furious roar. \u201cWe must bring one of them into his animal. We must.\u201d His voice fell to nothing as he leaned on his desk, palms flat, his head bowed. \u201cBut goddess help me, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t risk Kara, even to save the world.\u201d Slowly, he lifted his head, staring at them, one by one, his expression a mix of guilt, desolation, and belligerence, as if he expected a fight. As if he wanted one.</p><p>But not a male there had it in him to argue. Not only would they have made the same decision in Lyon\u2019s shoes, but every one of them adored Kara. None would risk her life.</p><p>\u201cGrizz is going to be furious when he realizes his efforts were all for nothing,\u201d Tighe murmured. His gaze turned to Lyon. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same as before. We figure out how to get our immortality back, then we go after Inir and stop him before he can free the Daemons.\u201d</p><p>So very simple.</p><p>So fucking impossible.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Wulfe climbed the stairs, his heart heavy with worry and dread, his nerves frayed. He needed to see Natalie, to settle his wolf and quiet his own desolate soul. He found her sitting on the bed with the other Feral wives, sipping a glass of wine as Kara talked about her time as Inir\u2019s captive. If this was meant to be a party, it was a failure, in his estimation. Then again, every woman there was as sharp as the tip of a spear and knew exactly what the Ferals were facing. It only made sense that they\u2019d discuss their worries among themselves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gaze followed Natalie, watching her as she listened somberly to Kara describe the cruelties she\u2019d seen in that place, and how she\u2019d been forced to bring two new Ferals into their animals, two males she believed were evil. As he watched, Olivia picked up the box in the middle of the bed and offered it around the circle. One by one, the women pulled out a chocolate-covered strawberry, but it was Natalie he watched, his gaze following the sweet fruit as she lifted it to her mouth and closed her teeth and lips around it.</p><p>Something stirred deep inside of him, a surprising rush of heat that flowed down through his body and into his loins, making them grow heavy and full. He sucked in a startled breath at the unmistakable feel of his first hard-on in months, maybe years. Why now? There were too damn many things happening to him!</p><p>He pulled away from the door before anyone even knew he was there and went in search of advice. He found Kougar in the library talking to Hawke, and shut the door behind him.</p> <p>Both Ferals turned, concern in their eyes.</p><p>Hawke sighed. \u201cYou lost your animal, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hell, no. I\u2019ve got a woody.\u201d</p><p>Kougar said nothing, made no indication he\u2019d even heard him.</p><p>Hawke merely lifted a brow. \u201cWhat caused it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just watched Natalie eat a chocolate-covered strawberry.\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded, all seriousness. \u201cYou like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m damaged, Wings. I haven\u2019t gotten a woody without effort since Beatrice died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you heal from a broken mating bond?\u201d He whirled to Kougar. \u201cIs it possible?\u201d</p><p>Kougar stroked his beard. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of its happening before, but only in cases where the original mating wasn\u2019t right. And only when the right person came along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd your mating to Beatrice was never right, buddy,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cWe all knew that. If it had been . . .\u201d Hawke shook his head, his eyes glowing. \u201cWhat I feel for Falkyn, my Faith, I have trouble vocalizing, because finding the words for such depth of emotion stymies me every time. She\u2019s the world to me\u2014my heart, my life, the breath in my body. There are no words to express such overwhelming love. A love I\u2019m almost certain you never felt for Beatrice.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d loved her, and he might have if she\u2019d ever cared for him at all. But what Hawke described resonated inside of him. Because of Natalie.</p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Kougar asked. \u201cDid you kiss her?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe hesitated, then decided he might as well come clean. \u201cShe kissed me.\u201d</p><p>Hawke smiled. \u201cThat must have been a hell of a kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was as chaste as they come.\u201d</p><p>Kougar plucked at his beard. \u201cIt may have been chaste, but the emotion behind it was powerful indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think my feelings for her did this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd her feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe blinked, confusion colliding with joy. She liked him, he knew that. But Kougar had used the word powerful. \u201cI have no idea what she feels for me.\u201d</p><p>Hawke clasped him on the shoulder. \u201cWhatever the reason for your woody, it\u2019s a blessing. Go find her and kiss her back.\u201d</p><p>As if he hadn\u2019t already done that and much, much more.</p><p>Wulfe nodded. His friend was right. With his body stirring like a summer storm, he could finally share the intimacy with Natalie they both wanted.</p><p>The question was . . . should he, when everything was so screwed up?</p><p>Wulfe was halfway up the second flight of stairs, his blood on fire with dreams of pulling Natalie into his arms and stripping both of them bare, when the sound of pounding footsteps had him glancing back. Lyon and Tighe were running up the stairs, taking the steps two at a time.</p><p>\u201cWulfe,\u201d Tighe called.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s mouth compressed. \u201cNatalie. Melisande found me.\u201d</p><p>Hell. Natalie was in pain and the women had sent for Lyon, not him. Turning, he ran up the remaining stairs and started down the hall.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her!\u201d Lyon called from behind.</p><p>Wulfe strode into his chief\u2019s bedroom to find Natalie hunched over on the bed beside Kara, her hands clenched against her knees, tears glistening on her cheeks.</p><p>The women looked up as he entered the room, Delaney and Falkyn scooting aside to give him access. But as he reached Natalie, as he pulled her into his arms, she threw up her hands, blocking her face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Please. It\u2019ll stop.\u201d She grabbed his hand. \u201cJust hold me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d But it flayed him alive to see her in such pain and not do what he could to end it.</p><p>Lyon and Tighe rushed into the room, coming to a standstill halfway to the bed. Lyon began issuing orders. \u201cMelisande, move Kara to the Radiant\u2019s room. All non-Ferals out of here. Now.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stood her ground. \u201cLet me help, Lyon. I can weaken him if you need me to, and he can\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019m still immortal.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe felt like a fucking wild animal on the verge of going rabid.</p><p>Lyon nodded, then turned to Melisande. \u201cI could use you, too, once you have Kara settled.\u201d</p><p>One Ilina couldn\u2019t mist an unwilling Feral Warrior, but one Ilina could call half a dozen more in two seconds. And half a dozen Ilinas could mist him to the North Pole, if they wanted to. Or the Crystal Realm, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d A moment later, Melisande and Kara disappeared.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s jaw worked as he swallowed the need to yell at them all that he wasn\u2019t going berserk, dammit! Because, hell, he didn\u2019t know what he might do. Even if he managed to keep from easing Natalie\u2019s pain, for all any of them knew, he might still go crazed. Because none of them really knew what the fuck was going on with him.</p><p>In his arms, Natalie\u2019s shaking grew worse, the tears a steady flow down her cheeks, now. How much more of this could she take? How much more could he take?</p><p>He pulled her tighter, his big hand stroking her hair, her back. \u201cNatalie, sweetheart . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Wulfe. I\u2019ll get better.\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cRoar, what if each time Satanan tries to set up a steady flow of the primal energies through us, I disconnect it by closing the loop and stealing Natalie\u2019s pain? If I don\u2019t do that this time, her suffering might never end. Satanan might just get stronger and stronger.\u201d</p><p>Lyon frowned. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that\u2019s how it works.\u201d</p><p>How the fuck were they supposed to tell?</p><p>His hand shook with the need to cover that wound and end her suffering. And she was suffering. Goddess, she was in pain. He could feel the tension in her muscles, the trembling. Her skin was damp with perspiration, her cheeks wet with tears.</p><p>Small cries began to escape her throat, tiny, strangled screams that tore at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stopping, Roar. It\u2019s not going to stop.\u201d And he\u2019d taken all he could take. Lifting his hand, he pressed his palm against her cheek, closed his eyes, and willed the pain away. But like before, it fought him. Satanan fought him, struggling to keep the connection intact.</p><p>\u201cGet two more Ferals up here, ASAP,\u201d Lyon barked.</p><p>Wulfe gritted his teeth, growling low in his throat as he pulled at the pain, as he battled back the Daemon\u2019s hold on it. On her. Finally, finally, he felt it give way. Deep inside, his animal whined with relief.</p><p>Natalie sagged against him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe shuddered with relief, cradling her close. She felt so good, so right, in his arms. Her sweet scent warmed the air between them, weaving through his senses, lighting tiny fires in his blood. Now that she was no longer in pain, his body sprang to life, suddenly, intensely aware of the touch of her hand where it clung to his wrist, and of the press of her soft breast against his arm. His own hand traced the contours of her slender back, her spine, her elegant neck, his fingers sliding into the spun-gold silk of her hair. It was all he could do not to bury his face in the clean, feminine scent of it.</p><p>His hands began to shake with need. With every beat of his heart, the desire to pull her closer, to taste her again, grew more intense, more difficult to control.</p><p>His pulse quickened, his breath becoming increasingly shallow. The last time, he\u2019d felt her silken flesh beneath his palms and lips, he had not been moved. Never had he been physically moved in her presence.</p><p>Until now. He throbbed with the need to slide deep inside of her.</p><p>Natalie pulled back. Their gazes caught, locked, and he watched lovely, if tired, gray eyes light with wonder, then fill slowly with dawning passion. Her own breath hitched.</p><p>\u201cOh, Wulfe.\u201d Her words were the barest whisper.</p><p>\u201cWulfe,\u201d Lyon barked. \u201cWe need to get you out of here. Down to the gym.\u201d</p><p>All he wanted was to sweep Natalie into his arms and into his bed. Instead, he stroked her hair with a shaking hand. \u201cGo. Melisande will take you back to your room.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, the familiar buzzing began in his ears. A split second later, the red fury swept across his mind, stealing his will.</p><p>\u201cWulfe!\u201d a male yelled.</p><p>Enemies. He drew fangs and claws, leaping from the bed and whirling toward the ones who would attack him.</p><p>\u201cWatch his claws! Get Natalie away from him.\u201d</p><p>Two males tackled him to the floor. \u201cJag, Fox, give us a hand.\u201d Two more locked his wrists against the hardwood. \u201cOlivia, weaken him. Not too much!\u201d</p><p>Wulfe fought against their hold, struggling against the four who held him down, but lethargy began to steal through his limbs.</p><p>The sound of shattering glass had him turning to find the female he\u2019d been holding now wielding a broken wine bottle like a weapon, a wildness in her eyes that gut-punched him.</p><p>\u201cNatalie.\u201d The name tore from between his lips and fangs. \u201cNatalie, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, not her, too,\u201d one of the males muttered. \u201cThat bastard has his claws in both of them.\u201d</p><p>As Wulfe fought his captors, struggling to reach her, to reach Natalie, the darkness and fury dissolved and he came back to himself in a rush.</p><p>\u201cLet me up,\u201d he snapped, his fangs and claws retracting. \u201cLet me go to her!\u201d</p><p>The hands holding him down disappeared, and Wulfe leaped to his feet as Natalie struggled in Jag\u2019s far stronger hold.</p><p>\u201cShe tried to cut me,\u201d Jag told him. \u201cI think she was trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie.\u201d Wulfe reached her, gripping her jaw carefully, forcing those wild eyes to meet his. \u201cNatalie, come back to me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, the wildness slowly sliding from her eyes, and she blinked with confusion.</p><p>\u201cWulfe?\u201d</p><p>He took the broken wine bottle from unresisting fingers and handed it to Jag before pulling her into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d But as he said the words, his gaze rose to his chief\u2019s, and he knew the words for the lie they were. Because it wasn\u2019t okay. Nothing was.</p><p>\u201cIs it the primal energies or Satanan that\u2019s affecting them?\u201d Tighe asked, his gaze meeting Wulfe\u2019s. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This connection needed to end, and soon. Goddess help them. He curled his arm around Natalie\u2019s shoulders and ushered her toward the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in my room.\u201d Not only did he need time to think, but he needed to get away from the wary, worried eyes of his brothers.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Lyon asked evenly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you if anything happens.\u201d His head was beginning to pound, his body about to implode.</p><p>He needed Natalie Cash in his arms.</p><p>Natalie followed Wulfe out the door of Lyon\u2019s room and the few steps to her own. What in the heck had happened? One minute she\u2019d been watching, terrified that Wulfe would attack his friends with those deadly claws. The next thing, Wulfe was holding her, taking a broken wine bottle out of her hand, and everyone was staring at her as if she\u2019d grown a second head.</p><p>Wulfe ushered her into her room, then closed the door and pulled her around to face him. His hands caressed her shoulders as he studied her with soft, worried eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her pulse was pounding. Her hand slid up to cover her chest. \u201cMy heart\u2019s racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no longer in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. Thank you for that. But, Wulfe . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen again.\u201d Her brows drew together. \u201cWhat if, next time, you knock me out?\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted, his expression turning thoughtful. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s possible that would disconnect you. We can try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Good.\u201d The tension began to ease from her shoulders. \u201cWe have a plan.\u201d For now. Until that didn\u2019t work, either. And then what? She\u2019d heard Strome as well as Wulfe had. The only way to break this connection was through the death of one of the three of them. And while it might be heroic to offer to give up her life, Wulfe would never go for that. He\u2019d blame himself for it, hate himself for it. Besides, she liked her life, thank you very much, even as strange as it had become. No, Inir was the one who had to die. For both their sakes.</p><p>Wulfe lifted a hand and stroked her cheek. \u201cLet me hold you.\u201d Something in his expression crumbled for the barest second. \u201cI need to hold you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the only one shaken, she realized. Sliding into his arms, she pressed her body against the hard, muscular planes of his and knew that nothing had ever felt so right. Wulfe pulled her closer still, locking his arms around her, brushing his chin against her hair on a deep, heartfelt sigh.</p><p>As her arms went around his waist, she pressed her cheek to his T-shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be okay,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to work out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her hair. \u201cDo you know something I don\u2019t?\u201d His voice almost teased. Almost.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s the only acceptable outcome.\u201d Slowly, she pulled back and gazed up into his beautiful, beloved face. \u201cWe\u2019re going to beat Satanan and Inir, Wulfe. We\u2019re going to win because I know you. Your soul is too honorable, too filled with light for darkness to ever cling there for long. Satanan will never control you. You\u2019re going to beat him.\u201d</p><p>The look he gave her was at once filled with wonder and doubt. \u201cI wish I could be so sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish you could be, too. But I\u2019m certain. No matter what happens, you won\u2019t hurt me. Evil won\u2019t take you. It won\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>The wonder flared in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a miracle.\u201d Tenderness drenched his liquid gaze. His lashes swept down, his hands falling from her shoulders to her hips. Strong fingers encircled her waist, gripping her flesh, kneading her hips with what, from another man, would indicate rising passion. He pulled her closer, tight against his hips and the thick protrusion in his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWulfe?\u201d She stared at him, remembering the desire she\u2019d imagined seeing in his eyes just before he lost it.</p><p>His lashes swept up, revealing dark eyes ablaze with a wondrous heat. Her heart began to pound, her body melting in response.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she breathed.</p> <p>His hand rose, his warm palm cupping her throat and sliding slowly downward until it rested firmly against her upper chest. His pulse, quick and unsteady, pounded so hard in that hand that she could feel it.</p><p>He wanted her. And her own body flushed with answering desire.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he breathed, sliding his hand up to her jaw. \u201cYou happened.\u201d His head dipped, and he kissed her with all the fierce need, all the tender passion she could have dreamed of. His lips brushed hers, warm and firm, his tongue traced her lower lip. She opened for him and he dove inside, his tongue stroking hers, twining with hers, sending a fireball of heat exploding in her chest and rushing lower, a storm of need and sensation, chaos and wonder. He tasted like summer rain and winter forests, clean and fresh and wholly, wonderfully male.</p><p>One of his hands slid into her hair, the other down her back to pull her hips tight against his and she felt, again, the very massive evidence of his desire.</p><p>As her breath trembled out, she found herself smiling.</p><p>He pulled back, looking down at her with passion-drugged eyes and a gleam that made her chest ache with tenderness. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot funny. Wonderful. You really do want me.\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed her cheek, trailing down to her neck, licking, nipping, making her shiver with delightful longing. Her breasts tingled, her knees weakening as, deep within, her body began to pulse and contract, begging to be filled.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he groaned against her neck. \u201cI want you so badly . . .\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he rose again, pulling back, his breath ragged, his gaze hot and troubled.</p><p>\u201cWulfe . . .\u201d</p><p>His gaze roamed her face, his eyes incandescent with heat and tenderness. \u201cYou are so lovely.\u201d Unsteady fingers slid into her hair, his thumbs stroking her cheekbones.</p><p>With her own hands, she stroked his chest, then began yanking his T-shirt out of his jeans, the need to feel his flesh against hers a monstrous thing.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, Wulfe.\u201d Her hands slid under his shirt, against his warm, solid flesh. Electricity arced between them, making her gasp. Between her legs, she began to throb. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p> <p>His big hands rose to her breasts, making her cry out with pleasure and frantic desire. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. You won\u2019t ever hurt me.\u201d Her fingers moved to his waistband, and she began to unfasten his jeans.</p><p>His hands stopped her. \u201cI\u2019m big, Natalie. And you\u2019re human.\u201d His voice shook. His forehead tipped to hers, his breathing ragged. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to lose control.\u201d</p><p>She reached up, gripped his face, and kissed him hard. \u201cI want you to do that, Wulfe. I want that.\u201d</p><p>He resisted for all of a second and a half, then he was hauling her tight, kissing her madly, doing precisely what she\u2019d asked him to, at last. In the same fierce, tender manner that Wulfe did everything, he lost control.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Wulfe was going to die if he didn\u2019t soon slide inside the woman in his arms, his Natalie, his heart. Fire and beauty and laughter, she was everything to him. Everything.</p><p>He tore at her clothes as she tugged at his jeans and T-shirt until they were both breathing hard, both wild with need. They came together in the middle of the room, mouths fusing, her sweet breasts tight against his chest, the skin of her back, her rear, like warm silk beneath his shaking fingertips.</p><p>Her nails dug into his shoulders as he kissed her, inhaled her, her tongue rubbing against his with as much desperation as her hips rocked against his thick erection. Never had he known such a violent need to join his body with another\u2019s.</p><p>His hands roamed her back, her flesh, her hair. He couldn\u2019t get enough. He would never get enough of her. Swinging her into his arms, he carried her to the bed and tossed her into the middle, tearing a husky laugh from her throat. As she grinned at him, watching him with eyes that gleamed like polished silver, his heart contracted tight and hard. When had he known such exhilaration, such pure joy?</p><p>With a low laugh, he followed her down, his mouth finding her neck, her breast, sucking hard as his hand burrowed between her legs. The moment he touched her in that sensitive spot, she cried out and rocked against him as if desperate for his touch. She was open, wet, ready.</p><p>Wonder barreled through him that this woman, this beautiful, marvelous, brilliant woman wanted him. Him.</p><p>He lifted his head from her breast and looked at her, meeting her incandescent gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou take my breath away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you take mine.\u201d</p><p>His hand fisted gently in her hair, and he kissed her with an urgency that bordered on madness even as he shoved a finger deep inside of her. She moaned into his mouth, then began to whimper with need, rocking against him, kissing him like a wildcat, shattering with the sexiest, throatiest of cries.</p><p>She pulled back, desperate, her fingers clawing at his shoulders. \u201cCome inside me. Please. Now.\u201d</p><p>His body tensed, terrified he\u2019d be too much for her. But she wasn\u2019t a small woman, and maybe, maybe it would be all right. His cock found her moist welcome, and she surged up, swallowing the tip of him with a moan of pure pleasure. Wulfe held back, holding on to his last thread of control, but Natalie was having none of that.</p><p>Her hands gripped his head. \u201cDon\u2019t tease. I need you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, goddess. With a groan of pure pleasure, he sank deep into her wetness, into her tight, slick channel, amazed when he felt no resistance to his width. He was a tight fit, but she was big enough. And far more importantly, ready for him.</p><p>Rocking against him, she swallowed him deeper, and deeper still, until he\u2019d sunk up to his balls. Goddess have mercy, she\u2019d taken all of him. With a growl of pure need, he pulled almost free of her and sank all the way to the hilt again.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s back arched, her mouth falling open. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. You\u2019re perfect. Make love to me, Wulfe. Hard.\u201d</p><p>As he drove into her, his vision became bathed in a golden light, a light that seemed to settle inside of him, warm and wonderful. Love.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s eyes widened as if she felt it, too. Then she smiled and threw her head back, moaning with pleasure. \u201cHarder, Wulfe, harder.\u201d</p><p>He ground his hips into hers until sweat slicked their bodies, until they were both grunting and groaning, racing to the top of the highest peak. And beyond. Far, far beyond. As they approached that far-flung precipice, their gazes met, locked, and Natalie smiled as her orgasm began to roll through her, an arrow straight to his heart.</p><p>With her body contracting around him, her low, sexy cries filling his ears, he came with a roar, the beauty of the moment, the perfection, beyond words, beyond imagining.</p><p>And then she began to laugh, that throaty laugh that shot straight to his groin, as he collapsed, spent, on top of her. Not wanting to crush her, he forced himself to roll, taking her with him, still buried to his balls inside of her. Her golden halo of hair flew around her face as she righted, and she laughed again, then covered his mouth with hers, kissing him as if he\u2019d just given her the world.</p><p>His heart swelled until he thought it would burst from his chest.</p><p>With his hands tight on her sweet ass, he kept them fused below while their mouths joined above. Goddess, he didn\u2019t want to let her go. He wanted to stay like this, just like this, forever. Or at the very least, for days and days and days.</p><p>As one hand gripped her soft, perfect rear, his other slid up and down her slender back, love barreling through him, hard and fast. A golden thread began to weave around his heart, a thread that flowed outward to hers. The beginning of a mating bond.</p><p>Deep inside, his wolf howled, Wulfe\u2019s own need echoed in the lonely sound. Mine. She was his, dammit. Theirs. His and the wolf spirit\u2019s. And they weren\u2019t letting her go.</p><p>Unless he couldn\u2019t convince her to stay. The prospect tightened his hold, making his soul cry out. But he would never force her to remain with him against her will. Never. That would be tantamount to holding her captive.</p><p>The moment they figured out how to disentangle her from this mess, he\u2019d give her the choice, and if she wanted to return to her world, he\u2019d take her memories, as he had before, and send her back. What she wanted, what would make her happy, was all that mattered.</p><p>But the thought of losing her again nearly had him drawing fangs and claws. Burying his face in her hair, he held her tight against his heart, and loved her.</p><p>Wulfe was dressed, Natalie combing out her wet hair after the shower that had become far more play than washing, when he heard the rap on his door. He opened it to find Vhyper.</p><p>\u201cAriana thinks she\u2019s found the ritual you told her to look for. Lyon wants everyone in the ritual room, pronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPraise the goddess. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Wulfe closed the door as Natalie poked her head out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her naked body. In her eyes he saw the same flare of vulnerable hope that he felt. \u201cIf the knowledge I stole from Satanan is true, this is the ritual that should reverse the damage done to us by Inir\u2019s dark charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness,\u201d Natalie said fervently.</p><p>Wulfe strode to her, cupped her damp head with his hand, and kissed her soundly. \u201cRest while I go reclaim my immortality. Then I\u2019ll make love to you again.\u201d</p><p>A too-wise smile lifted her mouth, but didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. \u201cThe moment you\u2019re all immortal again, you\u2019ll be going after Inir. Just don\u2019t go without saying good-bye.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny her words. \u201cI won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d Sliding his fingers through wet hair, he caressed her head. \u201cDo you want me to ask Melisande to keep you company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I could use a little time alone.\u201d</p><p>He respected that, but he worried, too. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s someone nearby who\u2019ll hear you if you need help. If the pain comes back, yell, sweetheart. Don\u2019t hold it in. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her against him and kissed her again, drinking her in, certain he would never get enough. Certainly not in the few decades they might have together. Or the few days.</p><p>Finally, with a kiss to her nose, he left her, locking the door behind him.</p><p>After securing the promise of one of Ariana\u2019s Ilinas to hang out in his room where she could hear Natalie if she called, Wulfe followed Vhyper down to the basement, then strode into the cavelike ritual room, a room now lit by half a dozen ritual fires. Circling the edges of the room, the flames cast darting shadows on the ceiling and walls, giving the space an ancient, mystical feel.</p><p>Most of the other Ferals were already there, gathered in the middle, stripping off their shirts. Wulfe found his own expectant mood mirrored on the faces of his brothers. Hell, even the smoke from the fires smelled of hope. Inside, his wolf howled, the sound imploring, beseeching, as if the animal spirit begged the goddess for triumph. Or mercy.</p><p>Wulfe stripped off his own shirt, turning toward the door as Fox, Jag, and Olivia strolled in, the last to arrive.</p><p>\u201cTake your places around the circle,\u201d Ariana commanded. The Queen of the Ilinas was in charge. She met Wulfe\u2019s gaze. \u201cI found the words of the ritual you told me about in my memory banks. I\u2019ll feed them to Kougar through our telepathic link, and he\u2019ll repeat them. Blood is involved, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake the cuts shallow and small,\u201d Lyon warned. \u201cAnd don\u2019t cut your sword hands.\u201d</p><p>If this worked, they\u2019d quickly heal any wound, but Lyon was a cautious leader when it came to the well-being of his troops, and Wulfe appreciated that.</p><p>Excitement pulsed in the air, heavily tempered by the failures that had come before. Wulfe knew this ritual would work. How, he wasn\u2019t certain, but deep within his Daemon blood, he knew this was the one. Still, he wouldn\u2019t breathe easily until his friends were back in their animals, their immortality fully restored.</p><p>As they took their places around the circle, Kougar lit the last fire, this one in the middle. The light from the flame glittered on their golden armbands, sending their faces into hard relief, revealing granite expressions and rigid jaws as if every male believed this ritual would succeed through the power of his will alone. They were warriors trained to take on any foe with blades and claws, but they\u2019d been fighting an enemy armed with magic, a weapon that had nearly defeated them. They hungered for real battle. If this worked, they\u2019d get it. Finally, they\u2019d be able to descend upon Inir\u2019s fortress and destroy their enemies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kougar grabbed the ritual blade, then pulled the bowl\u2014the top of the skull of a long-dead shape-shifter\u2014from its shelf. He handed the blade to Lyon. The Chief of the Ferals made a small slice in his left palm, squeezed his fist, letting the blood run into the bowl, then handed the blade to Paenther, who did the same. One by one, each Feral added his blood to the bowl.</p><p>When it was Wulfe\u2019s turn, he made the requisite cut across his palm, the sting of the blade sharp. Squeezing his fist over Kougar\u2019s bowl, he handed the blade to Fox, beside him.</p><p>Kougar was the last to add his blood, and when he\u2019d done so, he began to chant in the language of the ancient shifters. Slowly, the rest of them took up the chant, their voices low, then building, as Kougar dipped two fingers into the blood and streaked them across the heart of each male, one after the other.</p> <p>Their voices grew, the chant turning into a pulsing beat in Wulfe\u2019s blood. Magic rode the air, melding with the growing excitement.</p><p>And yet something was wrong, dammit. Something was off. He felt it deep inside.</p><p>\u201cRadiance,\u201d the Shaman called out. \u201cYou need radiance.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s face turned to stone. He\u2019d been trying to save the last of Kara\u2019s strength to bring a new Feral into his animal, hoping one would be marked that they were sure enough about. But that had yet to happen.</p><p>Finally, Lyon nodded, and Delaney and Olivia rose from where they watched against one wall and helped Kara into the circle, setting her on the ground at her mate\u2019s feet.</p> <p>\u201cContinue the chant!\u201d Ariana ordered, and the males did so.</p><p>As Lyon stroked the hair back from Kara\u2019s face, she closed her eyes. But when she should have lit up like a sunbeam, she instead struggled, her face turning red, perspiration dampening her brow as she tried to pull the radiance. Wulfe felt his own muscles bunching as he willed her to succeed, hating that she was so weak, that this was so hard on her.</p><p>Finally, after long, gut-wrenching minutes, Kara went radiant. Relief flowed through the room as her soft glow slowly grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>\u201cTouch her,\u201d Lyon commanded.</p><p>Though Wulfe had felt the life-giving energy slide through his body the moment Kara lit up, when his hand slid around her upper arm, the pure energy of her radiance barreled through him. He threw his head back, drinking in the strength that came directly from the Earth. The chant resumed, the tight knot of Ferals lifting their voices until the words pounded against the walls, hammering in his veins.</p><p>\u201cStand back,\u201d Kougar told them and, one by one, they released Kara to reclaim their places around the circle. As they continued to chant, Kougar poured the remaining blood into the central fire, making the flame flare and spit.</p> <p>Tossing the bowl aside, Kougar raised both hands high above his head. \u201cReclaim your animals!\u201d</p><p>Deep inside, Wulfe\u2019s animal suddenly howled in pain, a pain Wulfe shared as fire exploded in his head. His animal snarled and growled, howling with agony, with fury. A terrible grief raked at Wulfe\u2019s mind, wrenching a cry from his throat.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Then all went silent. His wolf was gone. Gone. Wulfe roared, the cry of fury echoing back on him, suddenly the only sound in the room.</p><p>Belatedly, he realized that Kara\u2019s glow was out. The chant had gone silent.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work,\u201d Lyon said, his voice like gravel as he knelt to gather Kara into his arms. His gaze swung to Wulfe, devastation in his eyes. \u201cYou lost your animal.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe nodded through the ice forming in his veins. His mind had turned all but numb like it often did during those first seconds of disbelief after one of his limbs was torn off, before the shock set in and the pain exploded. Gone. A shifter no more.</p><p>The ritual had failed.</p> <p>Ariana stared at him, a hint of accusation in her eyes. \u201cThat was the ritual you told me to find, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>Every pair of eyes in the room turned on him. Wary eyes, hard eyes filled with devastation.</p><p>\u201cI could feel the magic trying to rise,\u201d the Shaman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe words were right,\u201d Wulfe said tonelessly. \u201cThey were right.\u201d They\u2019d fucked up in some other way. And suddenly he knew how. \u201cWe used the wrong blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat blood should we have used?\u201d Paenther asked, a thread of barely leashed fury in his words.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jag let loose a string of invectives. \u201cIt was a fucking Daemon ritual! It probably calls for the blood of virgins or firstborn children or baby bunnies or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the blood of Daemons,\u201d Kougar said thoughtfully.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s head pounded. \u201cWe could try it again using my blood alone.\u201d But as he turned to Lyon, he saw that Kara was asleep in his arms. Pulling the radiance had taken everything she had.</p><p>Lyon shook his head, his jaw rigid, his eyes bleak.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was all wrong.\u201d Wulfe shook his head back and forth, frustration and fury building inside of him. \u201cWhat if Satanan\u2019s fucking with my head, making me think I know things? He could have told me about that ritual specifically to destroy any chance that we might succeed. Fuck!\u201d</p><p>Fury barreled up and out of him on a ferocious yell of anger, grief, and pain. When he\u2019d quieted, as his gaze slowly roamed the circle, he saw despair in his brothers\u2019 eyes, a despair he knew must darken his own.</p><p>Their last chance had failed.</p><p>Natalie stood in front of the window of her bedroom, Jane Austen\u2019s Emma clutched against her chest. She\u2019d tried to read, but her mind simply refused to quiet long enough for the words in front of her eyes to register. It didn\u2019t matter that she\u2019d already read the book three times in years past and practically knew it by heart. For a short while, she\u2019d worked on her computer, but that had been even less productive.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the fact that she\u2019d shattered an empty wine bottle against the edge of Kara\u2019s dresser. Had she really intended to attack shape-shifters? Maybe she had. Or maybe she\u2019d been out of her mind and would have turned on anyone within reach.</p><p>The thought scared her. Twice now, she\u2019d lost time, though the first time her memory had been intentionally taken from her, presumably for her own good. This time she found far more disturbing because she hadn\u2019t been in her right mind. She hadn\u2019t been conscious of her actions at all. And there was a chance Satanan had been controlling her in some way.</p><p>Turning away from the window, Natalie set the book on the nightstand, then sank onto the edge of the bed and stared at nothing. She felt as if she\u2019d awakened in an alternate universe where nothing she knew or believed was true anymore. Shape-shifters, Daemons, magic all existed in this world. Xavier lived. And she, herself, was somehow being used to empower a Daemon, perhaps the most evil creature ever to walk the Earth.</p><p>For the first time, she thought she understood what it felt like for some of her patients, when, after years of seeing one way, of their brains processing the words on the page in a way that sometimes made the words all but impossible to read, their eyes were opened. What was once invisible or distorted finally became clear. Just last week, she\u2019d gotten a call from the mom of one of the kids she\u2019d taken through a full course of vision therapy. The woman was in tears because her daughter was now reading at grade level, a thing they\u2019d feared would never happen. Words that had appeared to her seven-year-old\u2019s eyes, to leap and bounce across the page, now lined up straight and still as they were meant to.</p><p>Seeing clearly in the child\u2019s case was a blessing. Natalie wasn\u2019t so sure she could say the same. Not when her eyes had been opened to a truth she was beginning to fear she wouldn\u2019t survive.</p><p>Pushing to her feet, she walked back to the window, turning her gaze northwest, toward Frederick, toward home and the life she needed to return to. She had work to do there, still. There were too many kids at risk and too few doctors available to help them. How many times had she heard otherwise excellent eye doctors disparage vision therapy as voodoo? Many viewed it with the same skepticism she suspected medical doctors viewed acupuncture, unwilling to explore a specialty they knew little about, thereby leaving at-risk patients without the options that could profoundly change their lives.</p><p>Yet, returning to that life meant leaving this one and never seeing Wulfe again. Or Xavier. And the thought felt like a fist to the solar plexis.</p><p>Cut yourself.</p><p>Natalie stilled, her pulse leaping erratically at the strange thought that blazed suddenly in her mind.</p><p>Draw your blood.</p><p>To her disbelieving horror, she lifted one hand and began to claw at her opposite wrist, raking the tender flesh with her fingernails.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was a bare whisper, uttered between clenched teeth. Pain tore along her wrist, ice filling her veins, because she couldn\u2019t move of her own free will. She couldn\u2019t call out. She could do nothing but what the voice in her head told her to do.</p><p>Satanan. This was his doing!</p><p>Suddenly, pain sliced across her cheek. Oh, God, no. Not now. Not this, too.</p><p>She opened her mouth to call for help, but she could force no sound between her lips. He was controlling her completely. Eyes filling with tears, heart pounding with terror, she tore at her wrist until her fingertips were slick with blood.</p><p>Finally, the words came, but they weren\u2019t her own. They fell from her lips in a whispered, frantic torrent, in a language she\u2019d never heard. If only she could make some kind of sound, even just bang against the wall. But her body refused to cooperate. It was no longer her own.</p><p>She\u2019d been caught fast in the web of a Daemon.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cI need to get out of this fucking house!\u201d Wulfe shouted, slamming his fist into the wall of the ritual room so hard that plaster rained down on him from above. He was trapped within a body that could no longer shift, within a four-story prison from which Satanan just waited for a chance to come after him again.</p><p>Worst of all, he feared Satanan might be fucking with his mind.</p><p>If only he could take a run in his wolf, but his other half was lost to him, now. He couldn\u2019t even walk out to the goddess stone to listen to the rumbling falls of the Potomac River and feel the wind in his face.</p><p>He was so fucking angry! So frustrated. So . . . terrified . . . that this nightmare would never end.</p><p>Hawke clapped him on the back. \u201cCome on, buddy. Get Natalie. It\u2019s almost time for dinner. You\u2019ll feel better after you\u2019ve eaten.\u201d Hawke grunted, the shadows from the loss of his own animal clouding his eyes. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. But your stomach will feel better, and that\u2019s something, at least.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe nodded. But as he turned for the door, he felt an odd tug at his mind as if his subconscious was trying to get his attention. Had he forgotten something?</p><p>He shook his head. No, this tug felt external. Satanan? The thought chilled.</p><p>\u201cWulfe?\u201d Kougar asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He felt the tug again, hard and insistent. Was his animal trying to reach him? The thought lifted his heart until he realized that it was coming from another place, his heart and that gossamer thread that he\u2019d recognized as the beginnings of a mating bond.</p><p>Down that finest of threads, he heard something, as faint as a whisper in a gale.</p><p>A scream.</p><p>\u201cNatalie.\u201d He shoved forward, pushing his brothers aside. \u201cNatalie\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>The others parted for him, and he ran, up the stairs, through the foyer, up two more flights. But as he neared the third-floor hallway, wisps of red smoke began to seep into the edges of his field of vision.</p><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d He couldn\u2019t lose it. Not now, not when Natalie needed him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re right behind you,\u201d Lyon said.</p><p>Wulfe ran down the hall, hearing the reassuring footfalls of his brothers following close. \u201cShe\u2019s in pain, and the darkness is gunning for me. If I don\u2019t reach her before it gets me, knock her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>But as he neared her door, he heard nothing. No scream, no sound of pain or shout for help. Just a perfect, terrible silence. Either the Ilina had already whisked Natalie away, or Natalie had never called out. Wulfe burst through the door, then came to a sudden halt at the horrible sight that met his eyes.</p><p>Natalie stood in the middle of the room, facing him, blood dripping from her fingertips onto the carpet, her head thrown back in agony, tears running into her hair as she whispered words he didn\u2019t understand. No, words he did understand. Daemon words.</p><p>\u201cSatanan has her.\u201d Wulfe lunged forward, gathering her close, and watching as terrified gray eyes swung toward him with relief. Placing a kiss on her brow, he jammed his thumb beneath her ear, then swung her into his arms as she fell unconscious.</p><p>Shaking badly, he turned to where Lyon, Hawke, and Kougar stood just inside the door. \u201cThe words were Daemon words designed to open the channel to the primal energies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should put her down, Wulfe,\u201d Lyon said evenly. All three males watched him as if they thought they were going to have to tackle him to the ground again at any moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. The shadows have subsided.\u201d For now.</p><p>\u201cIs the channel open?\u201d Kougar asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He could feel a slight buzz of energy he hadn\u2019t before. Goddess, what if that darkness started to build in him? What if he lost it and never came back? But even as the worry flew through his head, knowledge followed. He wouldn\u2019t lose control to such a small amount of primal energy.</p><p>With a shake of his head, he met Lyon\u2019s gaze. \u201cThe channel has only been opened a crack. I\u2019m the one who needs to say the words to open it, not Natalie. But Satanan has managed to get himself a steady, if small, flow of power. It\u2019s going to strengthen him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes he have complete control over her now?\u201d Hawke asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He frowned, his stomach full of lead shot. \u201cI hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis connection Satanan has with you is no good, you know that,\u201d Lyon said evenly.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Wulfe\u2019s grip on Natalie tightened, and he knew what was going through Lyon\u2019s head. Probably all of their heads. The safest course of action would be to sever the connection. Here. Now.</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d He met the gazes of each of his brothers in turn, men he\u2019d lay his life down for in an instant. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you before I let you hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s jaw tightened, but he nodded. \u201cWe risk much for the women we love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout them, what do we have that\u2019s worth fighting for?\u201d Hawke asked philosophically.</p><p>To Wulfe\u2019s surprise, Kougar nodded. \u201cNatalie lives. It\u2019s Inir that dies.\u201d</p> <p>But they were back to square one. Wulfe looked down at the woman in his arms and wished he could pack her up and take her somewhere, away from the wary gazes, somewhere that Satanan and Inir couldn\u2019t send Mage sentinels after them.</p><p>He turned to Kougar suddenly. \u201cWould the Ilinas host a couple of corporeal visitors for a few hours? I\u2019ll go stark, raving mad . . . again . . . if I don\u2019t get out of this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ilinas would welcome you, but I suggest Melisande accompany you.\u201d</p><p>Lyon nodded. \u201cIf you have any trouble, she and her mist warriors can either whisk you both back here, or us up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe enough there,\u201d Kougar added. \u201cAs safe as anywhere.\u201d</p><p>And that was the real crux of the matter. As long as Satanan had his claws in them, there was nowhere they could really hide.</p> <p>Natalie came awake to the feel of a large, tender hand stroking her hair. Wulfe\u2019s. Even without opening her eyes, she knew he was the one who held her on his lap, cradled against his strong chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you back?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>With a deep breath, she opened her eyes and met his concerned gaze, then tensed as she saw the bleakness there. Struggling to sit up, she reached for him, her hand pressing against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Something terrible happened. Someone died.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, shook his head. \u201cYou amaze me with your perception. No one died, not exactly. I lost my animal.\u201d At those last words, his brow tightened, grief slashing across his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, Wulfe.\u201d This was bad, in so many ways, she knew that. But in that moment, all she could feel was his anguish, and it slew her. Sliding her arms around his neck, she pulled him close, held him tight as he buried his face against her shoulder. Fear washed through her in an icy flow because she knew that a Feral without his animal would not survive.</p><p>Her hold on him tightened until her muscles began to quake. \u201cYou can\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to come to that,\u201d he said against her hair. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let it come to that.\u201d But while he made a decent effort to reassure her, she heard no certainty in his voice.</p> <p>As her gaze slowly took in her surroundings, she began to frown. They appeared to be sitting at the base of a cascade of rocks, beneath a bright blue sky. But the air . . . It was sparkling, as if filled with tiny crystals!</p><p>She jerked upright and peered around. In front of her sat a lovely pool of clear water fed by a small, tinkling waterfall. It was lovely in a stark kind of way. There wasn\u2019t a plant or flower in sight despite the fact that she smelled the unmistakable scent of pine.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d she asked, pushing off Wulfe\u2019s lap to stand and look around.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re safe here.\u201d Wulfe\u2019s bare feet dangled in the water. \u201cWe\u2019re in the Crystal Realm. The Ilinas\u2019 castle is just beyond the rocks.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head at him, narrowing her eyes. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the clouds.\u201d</p><p>Natalie scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a race of women who can turn to mist, disappear at will, and travel anywhere in the world in seconds is?\u201d</p><p>Natalie stared at him a moment more, then blinked, giving up. She\u2019d already accepted shape-shifters, Daemons, and Mage. And she\u2019d seen the Ilinas appear and disappear, had even traveled with one. What was a castle in the clouds compared to all that?</p><p>Of far more concern was why they were here. \u201cWhat happened, Wulfe? The last thing I remember, you were about to perform some ritual with the Ferals to reclaim your immortality.\u201d With a frown, she understood. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you remember anything of what happened in your room?\u201d</p><p>The way he was looking at her, she knew it must be bad. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand to her and when she took it, pulled her onto the rock beside him and slid his arm around her shoulders. \u201cSomehow, Satanan forced you to perform a ritual that opened the channel a little bit.\u201d When her jaw dropped, he added hastily, \u201cNot far. I knocked you out and brought you here afterward.\u201d</p><p>Vaguely, she remembered . . . something. More like a nightmare than reality. \u201cI hurt myself, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He forced you to scratch open your wrists and whisper a string of ritual words. I got there in time to stop you before it accomplished much.\u201d</p><p>She lifted one of her wrists and looked at clear, uninjured flesh. With a purse of her lips, she reached for his free arm and turned it over, eyeing the thin scratches.</p><p>\u201cYou took my wounds again.\u201d</p><p>Eyes filled with infinite warmth watched her softly. \u201cI will always take your injuries. I can\u2019t stand to see you in pain.\u201d</p><p>Love welled up, filling her chest until it nearly cut off her breath. She lifted a hand to his cheek, lifted her face for his kiss, and he met her halfway. Warm lips brushed hers, featherlight. Strong arms pulled her tight against his muscular chest, and he kissed her with increasing urgency, with rising need and passion. Her pulse took off, her breath growing shallow, then disappearing altogether as their mouths merged, their tongues twining, their limbs shaking with need and desire.</p><p>His hand slid into her hair, cupping her head, as he deepened the kiss. His need transmitted to her through desperate hands and fierce kisses, and the growing erection that pressed more and more insistently against her hip. Liquid heat slid through her, and she shook with the desire to feel him inside her again, to become one with him once more.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s hand slid down her back, then up under her shirt to press against her warm flesh. His mouth tore from hers, his lips pressing against her cheek, her eye, her temple.</p><p>\u201cI need to be inside you, Natalie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>He moved with swift grace for such a big man, stripping them both of their shirts and her of her bra before she could lift a trembling hand to help him. As she pulled off her shoes, he rose to his feet and divested himself of the remainder of his clothes. Laying their T-shirts on the rocks, he scooped her up and set her atop them, then quickly stripped her bare.</p><p>For long moments he sat back on his heels, gazing at her, naked except for the gleaming golden wolf\u2019s-head armband, his gaze skimming slowly over her bare flesh, setting every single inch on fire.</p><p>Watching him filled her with such happiness, despite everything, that a fleeting smile found its way to her mouth. His gaze flicked to hers, a wry, answering smile lighting his eyes as his hand reached for her, skimming up her abdomen, then cupping her breast. A moment later, she was on her back, his mouth on her breast, his hand between her legs. He drove her up, hard and fast, until she was crying out from an exquisite release. Finally, he settled between her thighs, met her gaze with an expression so full of heat and tenderness that it melted the heart in her chest, and slid thickly, deeply, wonderfully inside her.</p><p>Natalie reached up and clasped her hands behind his neck, holding on as she met him, thrust for thrust. Their gazes locked, her heart opened so fully she began to think their hearts, too, were becoming one.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d he asked with wonder.</p><p>The love overwhelmed her, misting her eyes with tears. \u201cYes.\u201d Yet neither of them had ever said the words. And then no words were possible as her body began to rise again, higher than before. Wulfe drove into her harder and faster, following her to those impossible heights, shattering right alongside her as she cried out with triumph and stunning release, and a love so deep she wondered if, within its glorious depths, she might drown.</p><p>Bracing himself on his forearms, he watched her, his eyes softer than she\u2019d ever seen them. \u201cI love you, Natalie Cash.\u201d</p><p>Tears misted her eyes all over again. \u201cI love you, too, my wolf.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her nose and lifted up again, a gentle smile on his mouth. \u201cI know. Your love is a miracle. It\u2019s healing me in more ways than I\u2019d imagined.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an impudent grin. \u201cEverything\u2019s in fine working order, now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThank the goddess.\u201d But his gaze turned serious. \u201cIt was the strength of your love that broke through the tangled mess of my shattered mating bond, sweeping it all away. The sweetness of your kiss.\u201d He stroked the hair back from her face. \u201cFood has taste, colors are back to their true, vibrant beauty. And I can feel again. Passion, desire, need.\u201d</p><p>As she watched him, as she loved him, her heart pinched. Because what would come of this love? What could come of it? Despite his words, he\u2019d said nothing about the future.</p><p>Then again, given the precariousness of their current situation, any future might be very, very short.</p><p>Wulfe pulled out of her and rolled to her side, gathering her against him. She curled into him, her cheek on his shoulders, her arm around his waist, as he stroked her back. His mood, too, had lost its buoyancy, and she knew he had many of the same thoughts she did, the same concerns about the hours to come.</p><p>His fingers slid into her hair, and he kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep you safe. Whatever else, I promise you that.\u201d Quietly, they lay together, enjoying the feel of one another\u2019s body pressing close. He traced the curve of her ear with his thumb. \u201cTalk to me, sweetheart. Tell me about your life, your work. I want to know everything there is to know about Natalie Cash.\u201d</p><p>As she lay curled against him, a warm, comfortable breeze wafting over her bare skin as his hand moved to rub her back, she told him what she did, and why. How her brother James\u2019s struggle to learn to read had all but destroyed his life. How she was determined to keep that from happening to other children.</p><p>Wulfe stroked her hair. \u201cI love that your work matters to you. That it matters, period.\u201d He brushed her forehead with his lips, then rose on one elbow to peer down at her, his gaze fervent. \u201cI\u2019ll get you home, Natalie. I\u2019m not sure how, but I will.\u201d</p><p>Even as she nodded, his reassurance made her ache. For the first time in her life, she\u2019d truly lost her heart to another. How would she ever live the rest of her life without it? Without the man, the shape-shifter, she\u2019d fallen in love with?</p><p>Together they rose and dressed. Wulfe took Natalie\u2019s hand, loving the way she instinctively brushed against his side as they wandered among the stone formations of the Ilinas\u2019 rock garden, brushing her shoulder against his arm as if she sensed his Feral need for touch\u2014a need heightened by the empty chasm inside him that, for nearly six hundred years, had been occupied by his wolf. The silence in his head threatened to deafen him.</p><p>Yet, as empty as he felt without his animal, he knew he\u2019d feel ten times more lonely once he\u2019d taken Natalie\u2019s memories and returned her to her world. The thought was enough to drive a blade through his heart, yet there was nothing he wouldn\u2019t do to make her happy. Nothing.</p><p>But, goddess, he would suffer.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens, now?\u201d she asked softly beside him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d They were fucked. The ritual that should have worked hadn\u2019t, and they didn\u2019t know why. The Daemons were going to rise. And when they did, if he wasn\u2019t dead already, he\u2019d likely fall under Satanan\u2019s control. He might turn on his friends. On Natalie.</p><p>Royally, royally fucked.</p><p>\u201cI think you should consider pulling the primal energies, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>His mind shut down. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith that kind of power, you might be able to beat Inir.\u201d</p><p>Shadows darkened his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m asking. More than asking. I\u2019m demanding that you not compromise the Ferals\u2019 ability to win this battle, certainly not for me. If the Daemons are freed, Wulfe, I\u2019m going to die. Likely in a horrific way. We all are. Please don\u2019t ever lose sight of that fact.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, needing her to understand. \u201cJust the little bit of that power that I consume when Satanan pulls it through us is enough to send me out of my mind. What do you think will happen if I open the channel? I\u2019ll be swamped by it. I could kill every one around me. Everyone I care about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you have more control in that state than you think. Every time you blank, you come back to me. To me, Wulfe.\u201d She stared at him, such certainty in those gray eyes. \u201cI can pull you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the Daemons rise, we\u2019re all dead either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He dropped her hand and moved away from her, watching one of the small waterfalls, its spray welcome against the heat of his flesh. She didn\u2019t know what she was asking. He wouldn\u2019t even consider it.</p><p>He felt her arms go around his waist from behind and he slid his hands atop hers. A small shudder went through him as her welcome touch soaked into him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re connected, Wulfe,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBeyond the channel key. I don\u2019t understand it, I just know that it\u2019s true. From the start, you\u2019ve protected me. You won\u2019t hurt me. I know that. And just as you\u2019ll protect me, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Wulfe. Far more importantly, trust yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Wulfe stared at the water tripping down the rocks, his heart pounding because the Ferals\u2019 needed a miracle. But how could he possibly pull this off? How could anyone? If he lost control of the darkness, he could become the instrument of the world\u2019s destruction.</p><p>Goddess, he prayed silently. I beg of you, don\u2019t let that happen. I know you\u2019ve been disappointed in me. I know you punished me for my vanity and my mistakes all those years ago. I\u2019m reminded every time I look in the mirror. His hands gripped Natalie\u2019s tight. I\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t make Natalie pay for my sins, too. Please protect her through this. And protect my brothers. If a life must be forfeit, let it be mine.</p><p>He felt a soft cheek rub against his shoulder. \u201cI won\u2019t let the darkness take you, Wulfe. I promise.\u201d</p><p>With a shudder, he pulled her around in front of him, until he could hold her precious face in his hands. Her eyes were so calm, so sure.</p><p>\u201cHow do you have such faith in me?\u201d he asked with wonder.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I know you.\u201d She placed a slender hand over her heart. \u201cIn here.\u201d</p><p>As he stared into those gray eyes, alight with conviction, he felt a calmness beyond reckoning, a joy without bounds. \u201cGoddess, how I love you.\u201d Pulling her close, he kissed her, drinking of her essence, her strength, even as he shared his in return.</p><p>Slowly, they pulled apart. He caressed her cheek, subconsciously tracing the line of her missing wound, until he realized what he was doing. Strome\u2019s words came back to him, that in order to pull the primal energies for himself, to open the channel fully, he had to give Natalie back the wound he\u2019d taken.</p><p>\u201cHow could I ever intentionally hurt you?\u201d he whispered, tracing that invisible line down her cheek.</p><p>Her hand covered his. \u201cYou won\u2019t be hurting me, Wulfe. You\u2019ll simply undo what you did before and give me back the cut that was always mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would take a hundred to keep you from suffering that one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small price to pay to save the world. Besides, I\u2019d kind of like a rakish scar. A battle scar.\u201d Her smile turned impish. \u201cI rather like yours, Shifter. I rather fancy having one of my own.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, then snorted, remembering her as he first knew her\u2014with her hair unwashed and tangled, that jagged wound across her cheek. From the very start, she\u2019d never been anything but beautiful to him. From the first moment he\u2019d spoken with her, that calm poise and courage of hers had shone through so brightly that her imperfections had faded to obscurity. He\u2019d fallen in love with her then, wound and all. No simple scar would ever change that. A hundred scars wouldn\u2019t change it.</p><p>And he finally understood that it was the same for her. His scars truly meant nothing to her, nothing but a chronicle of past events. As hers, if the day ever came that he felt driven to return it, would become a sign of her courage and a mark of battles fought.</p><p>\u201cYou humble me.\u201d He stroked her hair back from her face and kissed her, caressing her lips with his, sliding his tongue into her sweet mouth, pulling her tight against his heart as he loved her. As she loved him in return. But as their tongues stroked one another, voices began to whisper in his head, and he jerked back, freezing.</p><p>My lord, it is done. My sorcerers have accomplished the impossible. They\u2019ve created the unascended Radiant\u2019s blood needed to open the Daemon Blade. All but two Feral lights have been doused, and the last two should be choking out any minute.</p><p>Gather your Ferals.</p><p>Done. The moment the true Ferals are no more, the ritual will begin. You will be free at last.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Natalie asked, her expression worried.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve done it. They have what they need to open the Daemon Blade. We\u2019re out of time.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe grabbed Natalie\u2019s hand and started running toward the Ilinas\u2019 castle. \u201cMelisande!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>A second later, the petite Ilina materialized in front of him, her expression battle ready. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet us back to Feral House, now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Wulfe raced into the Feral dining room through the back door, Natalie and Melisande close behind. Paenther, Fox, and Zeeland sat at the table.</p><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d he shouted at the top of his lungs, knowing his chief could be anywhere in the house. \u201cFoyer!\u201d</p><p>The three at the table leaped up and followed as he grabbed Natalie\u2019s hand and ran down the hall. All the Ferals, hearing his shout, converged in the foyer within a minute.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve created unascended Radiant blood,\u201d Wulfe told them. \u201cInir says only two of us can still shift. He\u2019s preparing his Ferals to open the blade the moment they can\u2019t. We\u2019re out of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve still got my animal,\u201d Falkyn said.</p><p>Fox nodded. \u201cAs have I.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s gaze snapped toward the basement door. \u201cGrizz and Lepard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check,\u201d Melisande said, and disappeared. Four seconds later, she was back. \u201cThey both lost theirs within the past hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Inir was right,\u201d Fox muttered. \u201cWe\u2019re down to two.\u201d</p><p>Jag\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cLet\u2019s go kill that bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Olivia said beside him. \u201cThe Therian Guard should go after Inir. You\u2019re still mortal. Let us try to capture him and bring him to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance, Red.\u201d Jag hauled her close. \u201cThis is our fight.\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned on her mate, her expression warrior-hard. \u201cKara saw hundreds of immortal sentinels. Too many for you to take on in this condition, Jag, and you know it. And that\u2019s if you can find your way through the warding again.\u201d</p><p>Fox joined the argument. \u201cThe Guard is unlikely to have any better luck breaching that warding, Olivia, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Ariana appeared suddenly in the midst of them, frustration in her Ilina eyes. \u201cI finally know what went wrong with the ritual to restore your animals.\u201d Silence dropped like a blanket over the foyer as all heads turned her way. \u201cThe ritual requires the blood of the one who made the charm. The Shaman has felt Inir\u2019s magic in it from the start. We need Inir\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Fox muttered. \u201cSo there\u2019s no fecking way out of this. We\u2019re attacking that stronghold just as we are, as nonshifting mortals.\u201d</p><p>Vhyper shrugged. \u201cBetter nonshifting than dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe attack Inir\u2019s fortress immediately,\u201d Lyon snapped. \u201cThe ten Ferals will head out first along with Zeeland and Olivia and however many Guards the Ilinas can take. The rest will follow as quickly as the Ilinas can get them there. Say good-bye to your mates, grab food, and arm yourselves well since you won\u2019t be shifting.\u201d He turned to Ariana. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve delivered us close to the warding, the same place you did last time, return here with your Ilinas to protect our women. Mist them out of here if you need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going?\u201d Tighe asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you see an alternative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re going to need every man. What about Grizz and Lepard? They delivered themselves back here, knowing we might kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey stay in the prisons. Trusting them is a risk we can\u2019t afford.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe had to agree. As much as they could use Grizz\u2019s and Lepard\u2019s help, Grizz was a time bomb with a short fuse. If Inir found a way to turn him against them, he could kill two or three of them before they realized what was happening.</p><p>\u201cGather your weapons and meet back here immediately,\u201d Lyon commanded. \u201cThe Ilinas will transport you as you arrive.\u201d Lyon swept Kara into his arms and ran up the stairs.</p><p>Wulfe took Natalie\u2019s hand and followed. The moment he ushered her into his bedroom, he gathered her close and kissed her with all the worry and frustration that battled inside him.</p><p>Finally, he pulled back, cupping her face. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with the other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Satanan takes control of me again?\u201d</p><p>He tipped his forehead to hers. \u201cI pray that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Lifting his head, he met her gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s far too dangerous to take you into battle.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw hardened, a warrior\u2019s strength shining in her eyes. \u201cIf you need me, send for me. Don\u2019t hesitate, Wulfe.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her creamy cheek, then pulled away to arm himself, strapping his knife-laden hunting belt around his waist and two swords across his back, one for each hand. Finally, he slid a pair of knives into his boots.</p><p>As he straightened, shouts and whoops blasted suddenly from the foyer two stories below.</p><p>\u201cGoddess, please let this be good news for once,\u201d Wulfe muttered. Grabbing Natalie\u2019s hand, he ran.</p><p>Zeeland stood in the foyer, surrounded by the Therian Guards, Olivia, and Fox, the shouting in his ears and the hands slapping his back barely breaching the shock as he stared at the claw marks that had erupted on his forearm seconds ago, four parallel marks, each several inches in length, that looked like long-healed scars.</p><p>His heart pounded, goose bumps rising on his flesh as understanding slowly penetrated his stunned mind.</p><p>\u201cLyon!\u201d Olivia shouted beside him. \u201cZeeland\u2019s been marked!\u201d</p><p>Marked. To be a Feral Warrior.</p><p>His jaw had dropped and still hung open as he met Fox\u2019s grin. Fox held out his hand and slapped forearms with him in the Ferals\u2019 traditional manner.</p><p>Julianne flew into his arms, and he held her tight against him as he buried his face in her hair.</p><p>A Feral Warrior. At last.</p><p>But was the animal who\u2019d marked him one of the seventeen who\u2019d been infected? It might be one of the two who\u2019d been infected and died, an animal spirit that should be clear of Inir\u2019s poison this time. There was no way to know.</p><p>Would the Ferals imprison him now, too?</p><p>Goddess.</p><p>He looked up to find Lyon at the top of the stairs, joined in quick succession by most of the other Ferals and many of their mates.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d Lyon demanded.</p><p>Zeeland held up his arm.</p><p>\u201cHot diggity damn!\u201d Jag crowed.</p><p>\u201cPraise the goddess,\u201d Hawke said starting down the stairs, Falkyn beside him. \u201cRoar, I\u2019ve known this male since he was a child. I would stake my life and that of my mate on Zeeland\u2019s being the best of the best. There\u2019s not an ounce of darkness in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Fox said from beside Zeeland. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with him for decades, and he\u2019s as honorable as they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cA sure thing.\u201d</p><p>The Ferals were all streaming down the stairs, now, all but Lyon. When Hawke reached Zeeland, he slapped forearms with him, his grin wide and delighted. \u201cBringing a good Feral into his animal will reverse the damage done to Kara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our ace in the hole.\u201d Wulfe extended his arm to him, too. \u201cThe moment we bring you into your animal, we halt Inir\u2019s ability to perform the ritual to free the Daemons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for a Renascence, boys and girls,\u201d Jag said, slapping Zeeland on the shoulder as he extended his arm.</p><p>\u201cThe goddess stone, ASAP.\u201d Lyon\u2019s voice boomed down the stairs, and Zeeland looked up to find him carrying Kara down. \u201cFerals only. And Julianne. Olivia\u2019s in charge here.\u201d</p><p>Kougar looked up. \u201cRoar, it\u2019s still daylight. There will be humans all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo. Raise the warding. The rest of us will arrive by Ilina.\u201d</p><p>Groans peppered the foyer, but Kougar nodded as Ariana turned to mist beside him. A moment later the pair disappeared. The rest of the males stripped off their shirts, many laying knives and swords of every length into a pile against one wall. Pulling away from Julianne, Zeeland did the same, then kicked off his boots. In a few minutes, he\u2019d be shifting, and he had no idea if he\u2019d be able to hold on to his clothes and weapons.</p><p>The chills raced over his skin. Shifting.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Falkyn cried.</p><p>Hawke grabbed her as she swayed. \u201cFaith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy falcon. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>The Ferals\u2019 exchanged ominous glances. They were down to one.</p><p>Two minutes later, Ariana was back. \u201cHe\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Zeeland grabbed Julianne\u2019s hand, meeting her bright blue gaze and the love and pride in her eyes. She grinned at him, slaying him all over again as she did every single time she smiled. Goddess, but he loved this woman.</p><p>As Ilinas appeared out of nowhere, all around the foyer, he released Julianne\u2019s hand and, a heartbeat later, was swept into a tingling, scratchy cloud that spun until he was sick with dizziness. Almost as soon as it began, the ride ended, and he found himself on the rocks overlooking the Potomac, retching his guts out. All around him, the other Ferals were doing the same. He finally understood why they complained so much about Ilina travel. What a miserable ride.</p><p>Ariana joined Kougar and began chanting, while the rest of the Ilinas gathered close to the short rock face farthest from the river below.</p><p>As Zeeland rose to his feet, he found Julianne and went to her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head with a rueful smile. \u201cQuite a trip.\u201d</p><p>He tucked a lock of her hair behind her ear and pulled her close. The sun was low in the western sky and would be setting soon, the day warm and bright. A perfect day to turn into a shape-shifter. His grin escaped, and he kissed his mate soundly, needing to share his joy with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quickly, the Ferals gathered into a circle around the rock, Lyon depositing Kara in the middle, cupping her face.</p><p>\u201cTake your time, little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do this, Lyon. I will do it.\u201d</p> <p>But, goddess, the woman looked like death warmed over. She swayed, dipping her head as if holding it up was too much effort.</p><p>\u201cRoar?\u201d Paenther asked.</p><p>\u201cPulling the radiance earlier took a lot out of her,\u201d Lyon admitted, stroking his mate\u2019s head. \u201cBut this is what she needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pull it,\u201d Kara said so softly, Zeeland barely heard her.</p><p>Finally, Lyon stepped back and took his place. \u201cThe warding will keep Zeeland from escaping if he\u2019s been marked by one of the still-infected animal spirits and the darkness takes him. If he turns into the eagle or sabertooth, both of which should be clear of the poison, now, we\u2019re good. If not, the Ilinas will whisk the rest of us out of here so that he doesn\u2019t injure anyone while Ariana cures him.\u201d</p> <p>The thought that he might, like Ewan, be turned to evil, even temporarily, raked at his mind. But the Ferals had been taken by surprise by the first batch of new Ferals, unaware they\u2019d been infected. They would not be caught unaware again.</p><p>Golden armbands gleamed in the bright setting sun as Kougar began to chant in some kind of ancient language, and the others joined him. How they expected him to learn all this well enough to pass it on, he didn\u2019t know. The thought that he still might have to be the keeper of the Feral legacy smothered his euphoria, dampening his joy. But he would do what must be done, no matter the cost or the difficulty, as he always had.</p><p>Kougar lifted the ritual knife and cut his palm, then curled his fingers into a fist around the blood and handed the knife to Lyon who did the same. Each warrior followed, one after another. Finally, Paenther handed the knife to Zeeland and motioned with his head for him to follow suit. When he had, Kougar shoved his fist into the air and the others followed.</p><p>\u201cLittle Radiant,\u201d Lyon said softly, his tone tight with worry.</p><p>From where she sat on the stone, Kara attempted to lift her arms to the sky, her face pale, her eyes dulled from the poison that had attacked her too many times as she brought evil Ferals into their animals without knowing it. But her arms dropped again, as if too heavy for her.</p><p>\u201cKara.\u201d Lyon\u2019s voice throbbed with misery. He knelt at her side, stroking her hair.</p> <p>\u201cI can do this,\u201d their Radiant said, her voice determined if far too soft.</p><p>Lyon kissed the top of her head and once more took his place in the circle.</p><p>\u201cShite!\u201d Fox exclaimed suddenly. \u201cI just lost my animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Jag muttered. The hopeful air disintegrated into a tight, heavy cloud of tension. The last of the Feral lights had gone out. Zeeland\u2019s own had yet to come on. Inir\u2019s evil Ferals were beginning the ritual to free the Daemons from the Daemon Blade.</p><p>The race was on.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be close,\u201d Paenther murmured.</p><p>Or not close at all, if Kara couldn\u2019t pull the radiance.</p><p>This time, Kara pressed her palms to the stone beneath her, closing her eyes, and tilting her head back, her face tight with lines of concentration. The seconds ticked by, then a minute. Two. Zeeland\u2019s pulse pounded as he prayed for her to find the strength she needed. Come on, Kara. Come on, sweetheart.</p> <p>Silence blanketed the goddess stone as every man and woman held his or her breath, waiting. Praying. If this didn\u2019t work . . .</p><p>Suddenly, Kara went radiant, light erupting within her, a dim glow at first that quickly grew brighter and brighter until it shone through her skin as if she\u2019d swallowed a small piece of the sun. Zeeland\u2019s mind sang with relief and excitement, his gaze finding Julianne\u2019s as she stood beside Ariana, his heart warming.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, Zeeland,\u201d Lyon ordered. \u201cIf you touch her without an armband, the radiance will kill you.\u201d</p><p>As the rest of the Ferals stepped forward, closing around Kara, clasping her arms or ankles, or pressing a palm to the top of her head, Zeeland remained still, and watched. Kougar was the first to release Kara and walk toward him. He pressed his bloodied fist on top of Zeeland\u2019s. The others joined them, Lyon pressing his fist atop Kougar\u2019s, Paenther\u2019s atop Lyon\u2019s, Wulfe\u2019s atop Paenther\u2019s. One by one they added their blood until all pressed close around him.</p><p>Kougar began to chant, switching to English as the others joined in. \u201cSpirits rise and join. Empower the beasts beneath this moon. Goddess, reveal your warrior!\u201d</p><p>Thunder rumbled across the clear sunset sky, a roar of powerful magic. The rock beneath Zeeland\u2019s feet trembled, as if in anticipation. Or dread. Zeeland\u2019s pulse thudded in his ears. Power raced through his body, a joy and pleasure and rightness of extraordinary proportions. And suddenly his vision shifted until he was staring at the belts of the males and female encircling him. His senses exploded\u2014sights, sounds, scents. He heard the heartbeats of every person around him, smelled them individually.</p><p>A cheer went up.</p><p>\u201cThe sabertooth!\u201d Jag cried. \u201cSo it was you the animal meant to mark, not that bastard Maxim.\u201d</p><p>Incredible. A saber-toothed tiger, an animal not seen in nature in ten thousand years.</p><p>\u201cShift back, Zeeland,\u201d Kougar said. \u201cChoose to be a man once more, and it will be so.\u201d</p><p>Zeeland did as he was told and in a burst of colorful lights and intense pleasure, he shifted back into a man. And he still had his pants on!</p><p>The others gathered around him, clapping him on the back and slapping forearms with him.</p><p>\u201cHenceforth,\u201d Kougar intoned. \u201cYou will be known as Zaber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara,\u201d Paenther breathed and all turned to find Lyon grinning as he lifted Kara high, their Radiant\u2019s face aglow with health, at last.</p><p>The moment Lyon set Kara on her feet again, she strode to Zeeland and threw her arms around his neck, hugging him close.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Zee. You just saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my honor, Radiant. You may have just saved the world.\u201d</p><p>The reminder was like ice water, dousing the jubilation. As one they turned to Wulfe. But even before Wulfe uttered a word, the paleness of his skin told them all they needed to know.</p><p>Tighe scowled. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get Zeeland brought into his animal in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A mix of fury and pain glowed in Wulfe\u2019s eyes. \u201cFor a few minutes the only Ferals who registered were Inir\u2019s evil ones. It was enough. They\u2019ve begun the ritual to free the Daemons.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>\u201cHow long do we have before they free the Daemons?\u201d Lyon demanded, pushing himself off the ground in the backyard of Feral House where the Ilinas had deposited them after bringing Zeeland . . . now Zaber . . . into his animal.</p><p>Wulfe rose beside him, his mind numb, still ringing with Inir\u2019s triumphant shout. In that strange place inside him that Wulfe was beginning to think of as his Daemon soul, he could swear he felt that blade coming alive, little by little. He could feel it preparing to open.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know,\u201d Kougar replied, watching them with the dispassion that had once been such a part of his nature and was now only a fa\u00e7ade. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the Daemon Blade will open quickly. It was never meant to open at all.\u201d He reached for his mate. \u201cAriana and I will mist to West Virginia, first. If Inir expanded his anti-Ilina warding, we need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Ariana bursts into flames?\u201d Lyon asked. They\u2019d lost an Ilina to the warding the last time they\u2019d tried to reach Inir, desperate to rescue Kara.</p><p>Ariana kissed her mate. \u201cI\u2019m going alone. I\u2019ll test for the warding as I approach the mountain.\u201d</p><p>As Kougar opened his mouth as if to protest, she disappeared.</p><p>Behind him, the back door opened and Wulfe turned to find Natalie rushing toward him, the sunlight in her hair. His heart tumbled. He opened his arms, and she ran straight into them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your weapons!\u201d Lyon called to the group, then turned to Olivia. \u201cIs the Guard ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady and waiting, Lyon.\u201d Olivia threw her arms around a bright-eyed Kara as the other wives gathered around them. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe kissed Natalie\u2019s forehead. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He raced into the house, where several other Ferals were already retrieving their shirts, boots, and weapons. A minute later, dressed and armed, he strode back out through the dining room and into the sun just as Ariana returned.</p><p>\u201cThe spot we landed last time is still safe,\u201d Ariana announced as Kougar hauled her against him, burying his face in her hair.</p><p>Wulfe returned to Natalie, pulling her close. \u201cWish me luck.\u201d</p><p>Instead, she kissed his cheek. \u201cBe careful.\u201d Turning to him fully, she reached for him, cupping his face with her hands, meeting his gaze with a look of such unbounded love that it made his breath catch. He reached for her hips, pulling her close, drinking in her warmth, her sweetness, her strength.</p><p>\u201cWulfe.\u201d His name sighed from her lips. \u201cYou are the finest man I\u2019ve ever known. I know you can do this.\u201d</p><p>He stared into those calm gray eyes. \u201cGoddess, how I love you.\u201d He kissed her, softly at first, tenderly, with wonder and care. Then more fiercely as she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him back as if staking her claim. As if sealing their fate.</p><p>\u201cWulfe!\u201d Paenther called. \u201cWe\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>With difficulty, Wulfe pulled away, but continued to touch her, stroking her cheek, sliding his head down her soft, silken hair. \u201cStay in the house. There are Ilinas here to watch over all of you and to mist you away if there\u2019s any danger.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but they both knew the greatest danger to her was nothing the Ilinas could keep her safe from. It was Satanan.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, get us to that fortress!\u201d Lyon called.</p><p>The Allegheny Mountains rose all around them, thick with spruce and hardwoods beneath a rose-colored sunset sky. Wulfe turned toward the direction he knew Inir\u2019s fortress to lie, the direction he felt in his Daemon blood would lead him to Satanan, and started to run. Goddess, he could feel the son of a bitch.</p><p>Behind him, his Feral brothers and sister, and the more than 150 Therian Guards, mobilized. The pounding of their feet vibrated across the mountainside, resonating deep in his blood. They were an impressive force though they\u2019d have been far more so if the Ferals were still able to shift. At least they had one shifter among them, now. Zeeland.</p><p>Wulfe picked up speed, the knowledge that the evil Ferals were even now opening the Daemon Blade screaming like a siren in his head. For five thousand years, they and their Feral predecessors had kept Satanan from breaking free. Now they were minutes away from failure. Their only chance of success meant battling fully shifting, fully immortal evil Ferals. Goddess knew, it wouldn\u2019t be a picnic, but at this point, he didn\u2019t give a damn. He was so tired of sitting on his ass, so ready to fight!</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only got about an hour until the draden come out,\u201d Hawke commented, as they ran. No longer able to shift, they\u2019d be sitting ducks.</p><p>Vhyper grunted. \u201cIf we haven\u2019t stopped the ritual in an hour, it\u2019s not going to matter. We\u2019re going to be dead either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got company,\u201d Paenther warned. \u201cMage. More than a dozen of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of them,\u201d Olivia called.</p><p>As half the Guard peeled off, Wulfe pressed forward, Lyon on one side of him, Paenther on the other, the rest of the Ferals close behind.</p><p>The seconds ticked away with his heartbeats, and he felt every fucking one. They had miles to go. Miles. And in addition to the Mage welcoming committee, they still had warding to get through and possibly something far worse. The last time they\u2019d tried to breach this mountain, they\u2019d found themselves eyeballs deep in a mind fuck of a labyrinth. If not for Fox, they might still be lost in there.</p><p>As the sound of battle rose behind them, Wulfe\u2019s muscles tensed with the need to join in. Around him, he felt the restlessness of his brothers and knew he wasn\u2019t the only one. It wasn\u2019t in a Feral\u2019s nature to run away from a fight, but the bigger battle lay ahead. And there was no time to waste.</p><p>The clouds rolled in suddenly, dark and full. The wind began to whip.</p><p>\u201cDead Mage,\u201d Jag murmured, his voice tight and hard. It must be killing the male to remain with his Feral brothers when Olivia, his mate, was leading the charge in that battle.</p><p>Thunder rumbled across the sky. Mother Nature got pissy when her Mage, who\u2019d once been as close to nature spirits as any being alive, were killed. The rain began to fall, hitting Wulfe\u2019s shoulders, sliding through his hair.</p><p>Moments later, as he crested the rise, Wulfe saw what he\u2019d been looking for\u2014the curtain of shimmering color, blues and purples and reds, rippling and flaring across the entire landscape. In front of it sat a small, crystalline lake, its surface boiling with raindrops.</p><p>He raised his hand and slowed. \u201cThe warding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t see it,\u201d Hawke murmured.</p><p>\u201cGood thing we have Daemon Eyes on our side,\u201d Jag said.</p><p>\u201cWait here while I test it,\u201d Wulfe commanded, surprised at how comfortable the mantle of leadership felt on his shoulders. He\u2019d been good at this once, in the old days. Until the goddess took umbrage and struck it all away. Would she do so again? The thought had his gut clenching.</p><p>The warding flowed, swaying back and forth like a sheet on a clothesline on a breezy day. \u201cIt looks thicker than before,\u201d he told the others, his voice partly drowned out by a hard crack of thunder. \u201cFar more substantial.\u201d Energy sparked and spit as if the warding had been supercharged and was still plugged into some giant electrical outlet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be good,\u201d Vhyper muttered.</p><p>As Wulfe neared that shimmering curtain, the hair rose on his arms and his throat began to itch and crawl. The last time, he\u2019d felt nothing. Maybe it was just a factor of his having lost his animal. And, shit, that could be a problem because last time, they\u2019d only gotten through it in their animals. He\u2019d hoped his Daemon blood would allow him to breach it this time, and hand his friends through, even if he couldn\u2019t shift. If not, they were in deep shit.</p><p>They were probably in trouble either way. Neither Inir nor Satanan were fools. They knew the Ferals would be back to try to stop them. It only stood to reason they\u2019d have beefed up the warding to keep them out this time.</p> <p>There was only one way to find out.</p><p>Small pellets of hail joined the rain, stinging Wulfe\u2019s bare arms as he pressed forward cautiously, stopping a foot in front of the warding to reach out his hand. Electricity bolted through his body, knocking him back with a powerful blow, setting every nerve ending on fire. With a roar of pain and fury, he landed on his rear in the wet grass.</p><p>\u201cWulfe!\u201d Lyon yelled.</p><p>\u201cStay back!\u201d Wulfe pushed himself to his feet with effort, the jolt still searing the blood in his veins. He wiped the rain from his eyes and stumbled back to the others. \u201cIt\u2019s far stronger than before.\u201d</p><p>But Lyon was used to giving orders not taking them, and strode forward to try the warding for himself. A moment later, he, too, was picking himself up off the ground.</p> <p>As Lyon rose, they all stared at one another, an unspoken, What the fuck do we do now? hanging in the rain-soaked air.</p><p>Dammit, Wulfe thought, staring at that colorful barrier. He knew what had to be done. And he was the only one who could do it. He could almost see Inir\u2019s eyes lighting with evil glee at the prospect. Inir would know, of course, that if Wulfe pulled the energies through his channel key, he\u2019d almost certainly be able to crash through the warding. But he\u2019d know, too . . . or Satanan would . . . that no Daemon had ever retained control after pulling that power. The two of them were counting on Wulfe\u2019s losing it. Inir had already said it. The Daemon shifter will come to us, my lord. I promise you. And when he does, he will be yours.</p><p>He heard Natalie\u2019s words again. You are the finest man I\u2019ve ever known. Just as you\u2019ll protect me, I\u2019ll protect you. I won\u2019t let the darkness take you.</p><p>Wulfe turned to Kougar, his gut cramping. \u201cHave the Ilinas bring Natalie. I\u2019m pulling the primal energies. It\u2019s the only way to get through.\u201d</p><p>His brothers exchanged wary looks, but Lyon nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re out of options. Satanan cannot rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do this, Wulfe,\u201d Paenther said. \u201cThere\u2019s no better man.\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t sure about that, but somehow, he had to pull this off. Every one of them was counting on him. Natalie most of all.</p><p>Wulfe began to run back the way they\u2019d come, back to the drop-off site, knowing the Ilinas couldn\u2019t risk getting too close to the warding. Minutes later, Natalie was in his arms, rain-soaked, warm, and loving.</p><p>\u201cI believe in you, shifter.\u201d</p><p>He stared into those calm, beloved eyes beneath lashes spiked with rain, and nodded. \u201cI know. You\u2019re going to keep me tethered.\u201d But his heart was pounding with uncertainty and dread. He pulled Natalie tight against his chest, holding her against the buffeting wind as his gaze watched the storm play out on the now-churning lake.</p><p>Goddess, please protect this woman who is my heart, my life, against all dangers, including me. Help me stay strong against the darkness, so that I don\u2019t hurt her. And please help us defeat Satanan and Inir. I ask this not out of pride, but because so many will suffer if we fail. I beg you to forgive my errors in the past. I beg you . . .</p><p>Without warning, the sun broke through the storm clouds, a single, thick sunbeam illuminating the nearby landscape. And in that sunbeam, a rainbow appeared, running from one end of the sky to the other, a perfect, glorious rainbow beneath still stormy skies. Beauty within the darkness. A miracle. Forgiveness. He felt it shower him, felt his heart cleansed and lifted, buoyed with joy over this omen, this blessing.</p><p>Thank you, Goddess.</p><p>He kissed Natalie\u2019s hair, hugging her tight, and blinked back the moisture in his eyes. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p> <p>With a nod, she pulled back and kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m ready. We can do this.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t convinced, but they were out of options.</p><p>He could not fail.</p><p>As the rain pounded, Natalie ran over the wet ground, Wulfe\u2019s hand tight around hers.</p><p>\u201cThe warding is just up ahead,\u201d he told her. \u201cOnly I can see it.\u201d</p><p>All Natalie saw was grass, trees, mountains, and rain. Mostly rain. Wulfe finally came to a stop and pulled her close. Within his hold, she felt his tension and knew how much he dreaded this.</p><p>A chill shivered through her, her own muscles tensing. Despite all the times she\u2019d urged him to do what he had to, now that he intended to call that power through her, she was scared. If the little bit of energy Satanan had pulled had hurt so badly, how much more would this? Most of all, she worried about Wulfe.</p><p>She would keep him tethered. She had to.</p><p>As his hand pressed against her rain-chilled cheek, pain sliced through his gentle eyes.</p><p>Natalie covered his hand. \u201cI love you, and I\u2019m not letting you go. Fair warning.\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly and said nothing, his jaw tight. \u201cIt\u2019s not working,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to chant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for this, no. Strome said I had to reverse what I did the first time. I healed you by calling your wound to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can only heal a human\u2019s wounds if I want to badly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow badly did you want mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiercely.\u201d He blinked against the rain.</p><p>\u201cYou have to want to give it back to me just as much.\u201d She gripped his hand where it covered her cheek. \u201cWulfe, I want that wound back. I\u2019ve always known I had some purpose, that I was chosen for this life because I was needed here. I believed, until now, that my purpose was to help people see better and to ensure the children can read. But I was wrong. I\u2019m here because you need me. As your channel key. Perhaps as more. This is what I was born to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as I believe that you were born for this, too. You were born who you are, what you are, because at this critical moment in time, only a Daemon-wolf could possibly stand against a consciousness as powerful as Satanan\u2019s. This is your destiny, Wulfe. Claim it. Let us both claim ours.\u201d</p><p>His gaze bore into hers, searching, finding. His big body sighed, the tension easing out of his shoulders as his spine straightened, as his shoulders fell back. Acceptance entered his eyes though the worry remained.</p><p>With a tight nod, he shifted his hand on her cheek, holding the back of her head gently with his other. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly. \u201cOf course I\u2019m right. Now give me back my wound, shifter, so that we can stop those bad guys.\u201d</p><p>His smile was fleeting as he closed his eyes. At first nothing happened. Then a throb erupted in her cheek beneath his hand, uncomfortable, but not truly painful, as his scar\u2014the one that should have been hers\u2014began to fade.</p><p>Wulfe pulled his hand away suddenly and peered at her with concern. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Now call the power you were destined for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a pentagram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Hawke said. Kneeling, he quickly dug a pentagram in the wet ground with his knife.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s big hand closed carefully around hers, and he led her into the center. Turning her to face him, he cupped her face gently in his hands, his mouth compressing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>In his eyes she saw dread, but also the acceptance of the responsibility that he\u2019d been laden with thanks to his Daemon blood. Taking a deep breath, he closed his eyes and covered her wound with his palm. Then he began whispering in a language that sounded like nothing Natalie had ever heard.</p><p>Deep inside her, something began to happen. She felt a tingling in her feet that rushed suddenly upward, through her legs, her body, her chest, her neck, then into her face, finally coalescing in the cheek beneath Wulfe\u2019s hand. As the words flowed from his lips in a never-ending stream of visceral sound, he threw his head back as if in pain . . . or ecstasy.</p><p>The words flew from his mouth, faster and louder, no longer a whisper.</p><p>The tingling in Natalie\u2019s body began to sting, then burn, but she clamped down on the groan that clawed at her throat.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s grip on her face tightened, the words shooting from his mouth, the power rushing up through her, hot and furious, until she feared she would scream. She couldn\u2019t breathe, could barely stand. Too much. Too much.</p><p>Suddenly, Wulfe released her.</p><p>As Natalie fell to her knees, gasping for breath, Wulfe let out a bark of alien joy. A roar of power and strength, of invincibility and cruelty.</p><p>With dread, Natalie looked up into the eyes of a stranger, eyes glowing bright red. Eyes filled with evil.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Natalie stared, her vision narrowed from the pain, her heart pounding as the man she\u2019d fallen in love with stared down at her as if he\u2019d never seen her before. She\u2019s promised to keep him tethered, but she\u2019d never had a chance to grab hold! And he was already gone.</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t gone, he couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she pushed past the physical discomfort to concentrate on the man she knew, the one who looked at her with such soft adoration, not this red-eyed stranger. She thought of him in his wolf, protecting her with his life. And his gentle, tender touch when he\u2019d made love to her as a man.</p><p>Emotion rushed through her, raw and bright, and something moved inside of her, a thick, irregular beat. Not her heart. His. She could swear she felt Wulfe\u2019s heart, covered in shadows.</p><p>Impossible. Then again, what was truly impossible in a world with shape-shifters and Daemons?</p><p>Beneath the shadows, Wulfe\u2019s heart still beat whole, bright, and golden. She could feel it. It wasn\u2019t lost. Not yet. But the darkness attacked that core of his goodness, of his honor, and if she didn\u2019t find some way to stop it, and soon, it would steal him away for good.</p><p>Fire shot down her limbs as she tried to stand, and she gasped, sinking back to her knees.</p><p>\u201cNatalie?\u201d Hawke asked, warily.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Lifting her hand to her eyes to block the worst of the rain, she looked up. \u201cWulfe, I love you. You love me, too.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, and she sensed the shadows darkening inside him. They were already winning. Desperation rushed up inside of her. The golden light flared suddenly, the edges of the shadows curling away as if her need to save him had driven them back. Maybe it had. Maybe, within the strange connection they\u2019d developed, her thoughts and will really were that powerful. The thought filled her with a fierce determination.</p><p>Wulfe swung toward her suddenly, his face a mask of fury. With a growl, he grabbed her by the neck, his rain-slicked fingers nearly encircling it, lifting her to her feet. The pressure against her windpipe choked. He\u2019s going to kill me. Her heart raced, her mind began to scream, and she struggled, clawing at his hand, his wrist. But he was far, far too strong.</p><p>\u201cNatalie!\u201d one of the Ferals called.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, stand down,\u201d Lyon shouted.</p><p>For one bright moment, she thought rescue was on the way. But all hope was dashed a moment later when Wulfe raised his free hand and the Ferals flew back as if they\u2019d simultaneously hit warding.</p><p>The Ferals couldn\u2019t help her.</p><p>Hope died. The next moments, perhaps her last, were utterly out of her control. But it was that knowledge, that kernel of truth that stole fear\u2019s power over her, easing her panic long enough for rational thought to intrude. The man she loved would never be able to live with taking her life, if he ever returned.</p><p>The need to protect him burst within her, hot and bright. That golden glow flared, sizzling the shadows, burning the edges away. The fingers that gripped her neck loosened just enough for her to breathe\u2014but not to escape\u2014as if she\u2019d somehow brushed the mind or heart of the honorable male inside. But not enough. Not yet.</p><p>With every ounce of concentration she possessed, she stared into the red eyes of the stranger and loved the man within. As she did, she watched the shadows retreat from her assault, then push back, then retreat again.</p><p>Around them, the Ferals recovered, rising to their feet. Kougar and Hawke circled behind Wulfe, and she knew they were looking for a way to take him. But her focus remained steady.</p><p>For just a moment, she saw a flicker of recognition in his eyes, a glimmer of horror, but it lasted only seconds, then was gone. Dammit.</p><p>But even as the darkness rushed back into his eyes, he released her, snatching his hand away as if she\u2019d burned him. And maybe she had. Or maybe touching him gave her far more power over the shadows.</p><p>Wulfe spun, suddenly, facing the brothers he no longer recognized. \u201cYou think you can harm me?\u201d With a flick of his wrists, he sent Hawke and Kougar flying back a second time, then turned back to her as if somewhere inside he recognized her as the true danger. Fangs erupted in his mouth, claws from his fingertips. A feral snarl rose from his throat, terrifying her at her most primitive level. But she was going to pull him back from this if it was the last thing she did.</p><p>Sweat ran down the back of her neck, melding with the cold raindrops. The primal energies ran through her, a steady, painful stream, but no longer incapacitating. Only one thing mattered\u2014winning this battle for Wulfe\u2019s soul.</p><p>Slowly, she took a step toward him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNatalie, get back,\u201d Lyon warned.</p><p>She kept her gaze pinned on Wulfe. \u201cYou\u2019ve never forgiven yourself for failing Liesel, Wulfe, even though what happened to her was never your fault. I know you won\u2019t hurt me. You won\u2019t fail me. Fight the darkness. Come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie, he could kill you with those claws.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She took another painful step toward Wulfe, then another, praying she was right.</p><p>Power swirled inside Wulfe, smoke and fire, consuming his gaze, his mind, his soul\u2014the power to take on every one of the insects that surrounded him.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t the female cower before him?</p><p>He swatted at her, his claws coming close to her face, yet not touching her. Something inside of him growled at him not to touch her.</p> <p>Rain poured down upon him, soaking his clothes. Lightning split the skies.</p><p>The female grabbed his wrist, and he pulled away, but she held on tight and nearly fell against his chest. Her scent assailed him, sweet and intolerable. Gray eyes. The thought rose from the smoke as her touch burned his wrist, but that snarling thing inside him ordered him to let her do what she wanted. A word burst out of the haze.</p><p>Natalie.</p><p>His head began to pound, his heart to thud. Dangerous. Light shone through the darkness, a golden glow threatening to burn away the shadows. A glow that was hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cLoving you.\u201d There was such agony in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Instinct told him to pull away before it was too late, and he did, jerking his hand from her hold, catching her palm with one of his claws as he jerked free of her. A faint ribbon of blood bloomed on her flesh, and something deep inside him howled.</p><p>Fighting it, he pulled back his lips and snarled at her. She was small compared to him, female and human and should be terrified. But instead of retreating as she should have, she lunged at him, grabbing his bare forearm, pressing against his side.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me, Wulfe. I know you\u2019re in there. Fight it. For me. For your friends.\u201d</p><p>Her hands shook, her warm blood smearing his arm. Lines of pain bracketed her mouth, making him ache. He didn\u2019t want her in pain.</p><p>Why did he care? The thought roared in his mind. He was power incarnate. With a swipe of his clawed hand, he could rip off her head.</p><p>The thought of it nearly brought him to his knees.</p><p>Natalie.</p><p>Protect her. Protect her.</p> <p>The thought, the need grew and grew, pulsing in his veins, battering and silencing the shadows that yelled for him to push her away, ripping through the power, through the darkness, through the light.</p><p>Wulfe blinked, disoriented and confused, at the woman tight against his side, clinging to his arm. Natalie. He\u2019d drawn fangs and claws. She\u2019s in danger. The thought exploded in his head even as he took in the sight of his brothers, weapons drawn staring at him as if he\u2019d become the enemy.</p><p>Understanding slammed into him like a rock. He\u2019d lost it again. Badly. As he retracted his fangs and claws, his gaze flew to Natalie, to the agonized lines of her face, to the warm stickiness beneath the hand that still grasped his arm.</p><p>\u201cI hurt you.\u201d The words tore from his throat, cutting like razor blades.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d Her grip fell away and she sagged against him, clearly injured.</p><p>\u201cI hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just a little. It\u2019s the primal energies . . . I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>The primal energies.</p><p>\u201cWulfe,\u201d Lyon called. \u201cDestroy the warding.\u201d</p><p>And everything snapped back into place\u2014West Virginia, Inir\u2019s ritual to free the Daemons, the heavy warding that surrounded the mountain that even he hadn\u2019t been able to get through.</p><p>Turning until he once more gazed upon that colorful curtain of energy snapping in the wind, he lifted his hand with a snap and willed that curtain destroyed. As he watched with satisfaction, it hissed and popped, exploding into a million bits of light that winked out, one by one, until they were no more.</p><p>Goddess, he had power.</p><p>Deep inside, he could feel that golden thread, the beginnings of the mating bond, pulsing with light. It was Natalie\u2019s love that had pulled him back, her love that had tethered him, just as she\u2019d promised, but at what cost? She was shaking, the energies hurting her. And that golden filament was already beginning to tarnish and fade.</p><p>He pulled her around to face him, holding her up. \u201cI have to shut off the primal energies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Natalie\u2019s voice was strong, her gaze unyielding. \u201cStop Inir from freeing Satanan. Only that. Then turn them off.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his heart threatening to shatter. \u201cYou\u2019ll be dead by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She smiled at him through the pain with a strength that he envied. \u201cI\u2019m tougher than that.\u201d</p><p>Lyon strode up, joining them, pushing his rain-drenched hair from his face. \u201cHow much of the warding did you disable? Is it safe for the Ilinas to mist us closer to Inir\u2019s stronghold?\u201d They were still miles away from the fortress. And, he remembered now, quickly running out of time.</p><p>Wulfe sent his senses flying outward, taking in the energy of the mountain, feeling the warding as if it were a part of him. And in a Daemon sort of way, it probably was. The sudden, unnatural storm had turned day to night.</p><p>\u201cThe outer warding has shattered,\u201d he told his chief. \u201cThe inner is still strong, but I can get us through. It extends two hundred yards around the stronghold in every direction. It\u2019s Ilina-proof, but the Ilinas are in no danger as long as they remain outside that.\u201d</p><p>Lyon swung to Kougar. \u201cIt\u2019s your call.\u201d</p><p>Kougar closed his eyes for several seconds. \u201cAriana\u2019s already on her way to test it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they freed the Daemons?\u201d Paenther asked, striding up.</p><p>In the part of him that was connected to Satanan, Wulfe could feel the ritual proceeding. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Ariana appeared from mist beside her mate. \u201cWe can deliver you to the base of the hill, a short distance from the stronghold.\u201d</p><p>Lyon nodded. \u201cTake us.\u201d</p><p>Ilinas appeared out of thin air all around them, snatching up Ferals and Therians alike.</p><p>\u201cHold on to her, Wulfe,\u201d Ariana said. \u201cI can take you both.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, Wulfe was spilling his guts on the ground at the base of the stronghold, Natalie sitting a short distance away. Wulfe pushed to his feet, then helped Natalie to hers. She gasped with pain, a soft sound that stabbed him in the heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shutting the energies off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not. I can handle this.\u201d She met his gaze with granite in her eyes.</p><p>A shout went up. Moments later, Mage sentinels began to rush out of the stronghold by the dozens.</p><p>\u201cGet the Ferals through those gates,\u201d Olivia yelled to her troops.</p><p>Wulfe kissed Natalie gently. How could he leave her like this?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her, Feral,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe nodded, sliding his palm along Natalie\u2019s jaw, his own jaw hardening. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll keep you tethered. Stay away from the darkness.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDeal.\u201d He kissed her soundly, then ran to join the others just as Zeeland . . . Zaber . . . shifted into a saber-toothed tiger with a furious roar.</p><p>Deep in his mind, Wulfe heard his wolf howl in answer.</p><p>Thank the goddess. His animal was back. But he felt his wolf spirit\u2019s pain, felt him at a distance. The Daemon energy might have cracked the wall the dark charm had erected between them, but it hadn\u2019t destroyed it.</p><p>He pulled on his animal, trying to shift, but nothing happened. Dammit. The wolf whined and snarled. Then pain shot through his body in a searing rush, and slowly, slowly, in a spit of dark lights, he managed to shift.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do that, Wolf-man?\u201d Jag shouted.</p><p>Daemon blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to envy you, Dog.\u201d</p><p>As the Therian Guard surged forward to take on the Mage sentinels, the Ferals charged. Wulfe and Zaber took point, a huge wolf and sabertooth tiger, attacking sentinels only when they had to, preferring to just run them down. This was not the battle that mattered.</p><p>The wind began to howl again, rain slashing, hail pounding, lightning bursting across the sky as Inir\u2019s evil Mage died by the dozens. As Wulfe and Zaber approached the gate through which the sentinels had rushed from the castle, the heavy metal bars of the portcullis began to descend.</p><p>Acting on instinct, Wulfe shifted back to a man in the same flare of pain and dark, spitting lights, then lifted his hand and, with the force of his mind, stopped the gate\u2019s descent, halfway down. He grunted. Daemon power was damn useful. Shifting back into his wolf, he dove under the gate after the sabertooth. Behind him, the other Ferals ducked beneath the half-lowered gate and followed them into the courtyard. Massive, steel-reinforced, wooden doors barred their access to the castle itself, but Wulfe sensed no magical warding blocking their way.</p><p>Wulfe looked at that door. Zaber, let\u2019s take it together on the count of three. One, two, three!</p><p>The two huge beasts made a running charge, lowered their heads, and plowed through the massive doors, splintering them.</p><p>With a triumphant growl, Zaber leaped through the opening, and Wulfe dove through after him, the other Ferals following close behind.</p><p>As more Mage ran at them, the Ferals drew their swords. \u201cWe\u2019ve got these, Wulfe,\u201d Lyon shouted. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>Come on, Zee, it\u2019s up to us. Wulfe raced forward, leading the way through the massive castle, running down one shadowed corridor after another. As he ran, the smoke began to curl in from the edges of his mind as if the darkness sought control again. His wolf snarled.</p><p>In his head, he heard Satanan\u2019s voice. It\u2019s taking too long!</p><p>My lord, the blood is not truly that of an unascended Radiant, so it will take time. But the ritual is working. The blade is opening.</p><p>The Daemon shifter nears, and he is not mine. His channel key interferes.</p><p>Can you tear him loose without breaking the connection?</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s heart dropped to his stomach. Natalie?</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Natalie!</p><p>When she still didn\u2019t answer, he tried another route. Melisande?</p><p>Something\u2019s happening, Wulfe. Natalie ran, and I caught her, but she\u2019s not herself. She\u2019s fighting me.</p><p>Dammit, dammit, dammit.</p><p>Wait. I think she\u2019s snapping out of it.</p><p>Wulfe? Natalie\u2019s voice. I don\u2019t know what happened.</p><p>Satanan feels you tethering me. He\u2019s trying to stop you.</p><p>He won\u2019t. A bright pulse of her energy flowed through the slowly tarnishing thread that connected them, a pulse layered with determination. You battle him on your end, shifter, I\u2019ll battle him on mine. Just the sound of her voice sent the smoke and shadows scurrying away.</p><p>He felt a fierce surge of pride and gratitude that the goddess had gifted him with the love of such a strong and glorious woman.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t fail either of them.</p><p>Finally, he and Zaber burst through yet another thick door and into the pouring rain. They were on the back side of the castle, overlooking the cliffs behind the stronghold. On the rocks, not twenty yards below, six bare-chested men stood in a circle ringed by fires that flickered and spit in the rain. On the rock at their feet lay a dagger.</p><p>The Daemon Blade.</p><p>Wulfe recognized four of the males\u2014Polaris, Lynks, Croc, and Witt. The other two must be the pair Inir had forced Kara to bring into their animals when she was a captive here. They knew Lynks was an asshole\u2014a coward and a pedophile. Polaris, whom they\u2019d known as Ewan, was a good man who they believed to be the one the animal had meant to mark, but he\u2019d been subsumed by the dark infection carried to him by his animal spirit, and an unwitting pawn of Inir ever since. Whether the other four had honor or evil in their souls was anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>Outside the circle, watching with eager eyes, stood a man dressed in a blood red ceremonial robe, his short hair, even wet, gleaming with a copper sheen. Deep within his Daemon blood, Wulfe sensed Satanan\u2019s consciousness in the male. With a surge of hard satisfaction, he knew he was staring at Inir.</p><p>Inir is in a bright red robe, he told Zaber and the other Ferals. His hair\u2019s as copper as his eyes. As Inir turned toward him, Wulfe realized his last observation was all too true. Inir\u2019s Mage eyes weren\u2019t just ringed in copper, they were copper through and through. And in them, Wulfe read dismay and a sudden, raw desperation.</p><p>His wolf howled in delight.</p><p>\u201cKill them!\u201d Inir shouted, and the dozen Mage sentinels who stood between the Ferals and their targets drew their swords and started rushing up the stone walkway.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s muscles bunched. I\u2019ll crash the ritual while you stop Inir, Zee. Don\u2019t kill him. We\u2019re going to need his blood to reclaim our immortality, and I don\u2019t know how much. Bite off a leg or two, and he won\u2019t be able to get away. You\u2019ll enjoy the taste when you\u2019re in your cat.</p><p>Zaber grunted. He won\u2019t get away. Let me take lead. I\u2019ll heal. As Wulfe, still mortal, would not.</p><p>Go.</p><p>Zaber leaped forward, the stocky, muscular cat bulldozing the Mage, taking their slashing swords without slowing. But as Wulfe followed, one of those swords caught him, slicing through his shoulder in a searing flash of pain. And with the pain, the tendrils of darkness began to crowd in on him all over again.</p><p>Natalie.</p><p>I see them. I\u2019m here. But her voice was losing strength, and it was long moments before the shadows reacted, and they backed off too slowly, as if at any moment, they\u2019d spring again. Natalie was weakening. And the distance between them was growing too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Melisande, can you bring her any closer without endangering her? Maybe the woods on the other side of the fortress?</p><p>No problem, Wulfe. I\u2019ll mist her there, now.</p><p>Thank, Mel. Hold on, Natalie. This will all be over soon. He prayed. And keep talking, if you can. Recite the alphabet or just keep talking. Your voice grounds me. And reassured him that she was okay.</p> <p>Low, husky laughter sounded in his head, but there was a pained quality to it that made him ache. The alphabet it is.</p><p>Wulfe took two more wounds before he and Zaber fought past the sentinels and their blades. Finally, nothing stood between them and their targets.</p><p>Inir raised his hands, his eyes closing as if in prayer, though Wulfe suspected his intent was to draw magic. But Inir wasn\u2019t Wulfe\u2019s problem, not yet. He turned fully to the six Ferals gathered around the Daemon Blade. With a growl, he leaped, intending to fly into the middle of the circle. Instead, he hit a solid wall of energy that threw him back, hard, onto the stones. Pain shot through his spine.</p><p>He shifted to human and the moment he did, the warding became visible\u2014a glimmering blue dome around the evil Ferals and the Daemon Blade. Wulfe lifted his hand, willing this warding to shatter as had the last, but nothing happened. Dammit.</p><p>With his fist, he tried to breach it in human form and nearly shattered the bones in his hand. He might as well have hit a brick wall.</p> <p>Shifting back into his wolf, he called to his brothers. I can\u2019t get through.</p><p>At the cry of a man\u2019s agony, Wulfe swung his head to find Zaber tearing off one of Inir\u2019s legs.</p><p>My lord! Inir cried. Why are you withholding your power from me?</p><p>Because I need it to rise!</p><p>But I am your servant, your right hand.</p><p>You are nothing, Inir. My vessel. My tool. And I need you no longer.</p> <p>Wulfe grunted. After all these years, after all the death and misery Inir had caused, Satanan had forsaken him. Karma was a bitch.</p><p>Wulfe ran toward them, limping, one of his hind legs almost certainly fractured. Try to get through the warding, Zaber. I\u2019ll handle Inir. And, goddess, would it be a pleasure.</p><p>As the sabertooth took off, Wulfe faced the male, the creature, responsible for so much pain. At Wulfe\u2019s snarl, Inir threw up his hands, real terror in his eyes. Wulfe almost felt sorry for him. If Inir had been a good man controlled by Satanan\u2019s will, he might have. But he knew better. And Inir would die. Soon.</p><p>Wulfe leaped, grimacing at the fire in his hip, and grabbed Inir\u2019s other leg. With his massive jaws, he bit it clean off, the warm blood tasting right and fine in his mouth. The blood of his enemy. The son of a bitch would not escape his fate.</p><p>I can\u2019t get through, either, Zaber said.</p><p>Wulfe limped toward him, meeting him halfway. Let\u2019s try it together. They leaped as one, and Wulfe felt the warding give ever so slightly. But not enough. We need the others. Together, they\u2019d be able to break through, he was certain of it.</p><p>While Zaber stood guard over Inir, Wulfe turned and loped back up the path to where the rest of the Ferals dispatched the last of the Mage. The doors to the fortress swung open, and Olivia stepped out, followed by a flood of Therian Guards. In their midst, he glimpsed Kara, and he wished Natalie were with her.</p><p>Belatedly, he realized she\u2019d stopped talking to him.</p> <p>Natalie? Melisande, is she okay?</p><p>She\u2019s fine, Wulfe. But Melisande lied. If Natalie were fine, she\u2019d have answered him herself.</p><p>The truth, Mel.</p><p>The truth is, she\u2019s fighting Satanan with everything she has. You have to do the same.</p><p>What he had to do was help her. Concentrating, he found Natalie in his mind, in his heart, through that gossamer, fraying thread, and loved her violently, passionately, tenderly, pouring everything he had down that pathway between them, willing her to hold on.</p><p>A thin, weak pulse returned to him through that cord. Fear curled around his heart, the need to go to her clawing at his insides, but Melisande was right. They each had their battles to fight.</p><p>As the Therian Guard delivered Kara to her mate, Lyon took her hand and strode toward Wulfe. \u201cDid you get through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe warding\u2019s too strong. It\u2019s going to take more than two of us in our animals to breach it. But Inir\u2019s down and ready for the ritual.\u201d</p><p>Lyon nodded. \u201cQuickly.\u201d</p><p>As one, the Ferals raced back to where the great sabertooth stood guard over the moaning, legless Mage. But as Zaber and Wulfe shifted back to men, and the Ferals gathered around, Inir suddenly began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou are fools to think you can stop me. I will rise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatanan,\u201d Tighe muttered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t protect his boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about his boy,\u201d Wulfe replied. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need him anymore.\u201d But while his gaze was riveted on the sight of this terrible enemy finally prone at their feet, Wulfe\u2019s mind was consumed by worry for Natalie. The primal energies were too much for her. They were weakening her. Killing her. Please goddess, don\u2019t let her die.</p><p>Kougar strode to Inir and, without hesitation, cut off one of his hands. As Inir screamed, Kougar cut off the other, holding both of them wrist-side up, cradling the blood. Turning toward the others, he began to chant as he had in the ritual room, repeating the words they\u2019d used before, words that Ariana and the Shaman believed would reverse the dark charm\u2019s damaging magic.</p><p>\u201cThe ritual fires?\u201d Tighe asked. The fires ringing the other Ferals were long out.</p><p>Kougar shook his head, a quick, silent, \u201cnot going to bother.\u201d</p><p>As the Ferals ripped off their shirts, they all took up the chant. Kougar began to swipe Inir\u2019s blood across each of their hearts, one by one. Their voices grew louder, the magic beating at the air, pounding in Wulfe\u2019s blood. A soaked-to-the-skin, yet proud and once-more-healthy Kara strode into the middle of the circle, waiting for the signal.</p><p>On the alternate goddess stone, where the evil Ferals\u2019 ritual continued, an eerie red-orange light suddenly blasted from the Daemon Blade, an unearthly scream tearing through the night like the voices of a thousand damned souls suddenly freed.</p><p>Inir began to laugh like a madman. \u201cYou\u2019re too late. It\u2019s done! The blade has been opened. Satanan rises!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>The Ferals\u2019 worst nightmare had come true.</p><p>In the midst of a hurricane-like storm, the Earth screaming in outrage, shapes began to fly out of the Daemon Blade through that swirling red-and-orange energy\u2014dozens of them, hundreds.</p><p>\u201cHoly goat fuck, Batman,\u201d Jag muttered.</p><p>The Daemons were free.</p><p>Their chant had died abruptly, Kougar and Lyon, as one, murmuring the words to throw up a powerful feral circle that should, goddess willing, keep the Daemons out. At least until they could retrieve their immortality.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s gaze flew to Fox. \u201cWarn Melisande. Tell her to get Natalie out of here.\u201d Only the Ferals mated to Ilinas had the ability to speak to their mates telepathically when they weren\u2019t in their animals.</p><p>\u201cShe knows,\u201d Fox assured him.</p><p>But Wulfe knew, deep inside, the women hadn\u2019t left. Natalie wouldn\u2019t leave him as long as he needed her. The knowledge both warmed and terrified him.</p><p>\u201cFinish the ritual,\u201d Lyon ordered.</p><p>Kougar took up the chant again as he swiped Wulfe\u2019s chest with Inir\u2019s blood, then Fox\u2019s, then Zaber\u2019s.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s pulse pounded in disbelief as wraith Daemons flew past by the dozens, their black, ropelike hair rippling back from horrific faces contorted like wax figures\u2019 left too long in the sun. Sharp fangs dripped from their mouths, claws from their fingertips, their black, cloaklike bodies rippling in the wind.</p><p>Five thousand years the Ferals had fought to keep this from happening. Five thousand years.</p><p>The need to reach Natalie, to protect her, thudded in his mind, in his chest. Wulfe took up the chant with the others because the sooner this was over, the sooner he could save her.</p><p>In front of him, Kara went radiant, brilliantly so. Magic tore through him, cleansing, renewing, regenerating. He could feel his wounds healing, his breath filling his lungs with life and light. Radiance and Feral energy rushed through his body, strengthening him in the way he was meant to be strong. Feral. Immortal.</p><p>Deep inside, he felt the last of the wall erected by Inir\u2019s poison\u2014a wall intended to destroy his connection with his animal\u2014some crashing down, then obliterated into nothing. His wolf howled with triumph as they were fully joined once more.</p><p>All around him, the Ferals shifted into their animals with relieved growls and whines and sighs. But no sound of victory. Except one.</p><p>Lyon swung his heavily maned lion\u2019s head toward Inir with a deep, rumbling growl. This is for harming my mate. With a feral roar loud enough to wake the heavens, he bit off Inir\u2019s head.</p><p>Wulfe shifted into his wolf and immediately called to Natalie, for once hoping she wouldn\u2019t answer, that she was too far away.</p><p>But she answered immediately. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. The Daemons are free! Melisande, take her to the Crystal Realm. Quickly.</p><p>But it was Natalie who answered him. We see them, Wulfe. Awe and fear wove through her too-soft voice. But I\u2019m not going anywhere.</p><p>Natalie . . .</p><p>No, Wulfe.</p><p>Goddess. Now that the Daemons are free, Satanan has no more need to pull the primal energies. There\u2019s no danger.</p><p>We don\u2019t know that. I\u2019m not leaving.</p><p>Deep inside, he knew her caution wasn\u2019t misplaced. The darkness could try to claim him even without Satanan\u2019s interference. But he needed her safe!</p><p>\u201cLook at the blade!\u201d Hawke shouted.</p><p>They all turned. Directly above the Daemon Blade, the colors swirled, dense and fast. At the top of that twisting mass, the head of a male had begun to form.</p><p>All around them, flying shapes began to materialize. Wraith Daemons by the score, but also human-looking men and women dressed in fur or leather or naked, and armed to the teeth with knives and blades of every length and size. Suddenly, the human-looking ones\u2014were they Daemons, too?\u2014began attacking the wraith Daemons as if their lives depended on it.</p><p>Shite, Fox murmured.</p><p>One of the leather-clad men, a tall male with thick dark hair tumbling to his shoulders and black tattoos covering nearly every inch of his body and half his face, turned to the animals, the Ferals.</p><p>\u201cStop Satanan before he\u2019s free! We can\u2019t touch him, but we can hold off the Abominations.\u201d</p><p>Abominations. The same term Strome had used for the wraith Daemons. The real Daemons looked human, just like the Therians and Mage.</p><p>Wulfe leaped toward the evil Ferals, who continued to chant as Satanan slowly formed in that swirling color, his neck and shoulders now visible.</p><p>It\u2019s going to take all of us to breach the warding of that circle, he told his brothers, then realized Lyon would never leave Kara to fend for herself among the Daemons. If only the Ilinas could mist in.</p><p>Sending his senses outward, he realized they could.</p><p>The anti-Ilina warding must have been destroyed with Inir, he told his brothers. It\u2019s gone. The only warding now is the one encircling the evil Ferals. Have the Ilinas mist Kara out of here.</p><p>The moment Kara was out of danger, the eleven good Ferals raced to the ritual stone. Around the edges of Wulfe\u2019s mind, the smoke began to gather again, nipping at his control, at his conscience. Concern gripped his mind.</p><p>Natalie?</p><p>I\u2019m fine, Wulfe.</p><p>But, dammit, she didn\u2019t sound fine. She sounded as weak as a newborn kitten. His wolf whined in distress. Wulfe knew he didn\u2019t dare disengage from the primal energies yet, but goddess, he\u2019d better do it soon.</p><p>The good Ferals circled the evil. Within that swirling color, Wulfe could feel the darkness growing stronger. A pressure began throbbing in his chest and head, and he imagined that swirl of color calling him, trying to drag him toward it. Or trying to yank the soul out of his body. Was this what had happened to the rest of the Daemon race? Was it happening to the newly freed Daemons even now?</p><p>If the tattooed Daemon was right, the moment Satanan was loose, he\u2019d snatch control of them all once more. This time, Wulfe included.</p><p>Roar, Satanan\u2019s calling my soul. If he gets free, I may turn on you.</p><p>He\u2019s not getting free.</p><p>As he watched, the evil Ferals suddenly shifted into their animals, turning to face the impending attack\u2014a polar bear, white tiger, crocodile, lynx, black bear, and giant-ass wolverine. Powerful, yes, but too few against their far more experienced and more numerous opponents. Six evil against eleven good. It wouldn\u2019t be much of a fight if the good guys could just get through the damn warding.</p><p>Spread out, Lyon ordered. Falkyn, get the Daemon Blade.</p><p>The little falcon shifter, their sole female Feral, was by far the fastest of the lot. On the count of three. One, two . . .</p><p>Suddenly, the polar bear shifted back into a man, grabbed the sword he\u2019d dropped to the rock at his feet, and lopped off the head of the wolverine standing beside him, then whirled and took off the head of the white tiger.</p><p>Polaris . . . Ewan . . . was clearly free of the dark magic that Inir had used to control him.</p><p>Three! Lyon yelled.</p><p>Wulfe leaped, feeling the warding resist, then give with a soft, sucking pop. They were in! Falkyn zipped past him, barely visible from the corner of his eye. And then suddenly she was all too visible as she flew back onto the stone as if in slow motion.</p><p>As Hawke darted after his mate, Satanan laughed within that swirling storm of energy and color.</p><p>Inner warding. Falkyn\u2019s voice was breathless in his head. Satanan\u2019s warded himself in the middle.</p><p>As his brothers and Polaris took on the remaining evil Ferals, Wulfe leaped at the Daemon Blade and, just like Falkyn, flew back, slamming into the rock in a blaze of pain.</p><p>Wulfe! Natalie cried.</p><p>I\u2019m okay. We\u2019ve almost got him. But, goddess, he didn\u2019t know if that was true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the animals battled around him, Wulfe scrambled to four feet and shifted back to a man. Breaching Daemon energy might require taking Daemon form. And, much to his surprise, Daemon form was not all monstrous.</p><p>\u201cThe Destroyer attempts to reclaim my soul!\u201d yelled one of those fighting the wraiths.</p><p>\u201cShifter, hurry!\u201d the tattooed Daemon called. \u201cIf Satanan regains control of us, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p> <p>And Wulfe had no doubt that was true, not when he could already feel Satanan pulling at his own soul. The smoke and shadows once more began to curl around the edges of his mind.</p><p>Wulfe thrust himself into that swirling mass of orange and red, fighting the darkness that sought to ensnare him. Suddenly, the warding parted, and he was in. Standing before him with eyes that glowed bright red in a hard, if distinctly human-looking face, was the High Daemon, Satanan, the most powerful, most evil being ever to walk the Earth.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s pulse pounded as he stared at his nemesis, at the dark hair blowing in every direction, caught in that wind of power, and at the broad shoulders covered in a silver robe. From the waist up, Satanan now appeared fully corporeal.</p><p>A smile broke across that hard mouth, a smile of such evil, such malevolence that Wulfe\u2019s skin crawled.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine, shifter.\u201d</p> <p>Wulfe didn\u2019t bother to answer. Instead he lunged for the blade that lay on the rock between them, the swirling red-and-orange energy flying from its etched and enchanted steel. But before his fingers could close around it, Satanan\u2019s hand shot up, palm out, and Wulfe was slammed back against the warding. Pain tore through his back, then raced through his flesh as if he\u2019d been electrocuted. He struggled to right himself, to pull free of that blazing current, but he couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Inside his head, the shadows multiplied, as if fed by his pain, ready to steal his mind even as Satanan prepared to steal his soul.</p><p>Wulfe roared with frustration. He would not let this son of a bitch win! Struggling to concentrate when his mind was consumed with pain, he gathered the primal energies that continued to rush through his body, then threw the power as Satanan had. But the High Daemon only laughed, threw back his head, and inhaled it. With horror, Wulfe felt his soul, his very life force trying to follow.</p><p>Goddess, goddess, goddess. He couldn\u2019t fail. Natalie was counting on him, as were his brothers and, hell, the whole damned world.</p><p>\u201cWulfe?\u201d Lyon called.</p><p>He was going to have to pull the energies harder. Which would hurt Natalie. It might even kill her.</p> <p>His mind screamed in denial. His wolf howled in misery, then growled low, reminding him without words that above all . . . above all . . . Satanan could not be allowed to win. As he faced the greatest evil the world had ever known, Natalie\u2019s words came back to him. You were born for this. You were born who you are, what you are, because at this critical moment in time, only a Daemon-wolf could possibly stand against a consciousness as powerful as Satanan\u2019s. This is your destiny, Wulfe. Claim it!</p><p>As if Natalie felt his hesitation, at that very moment, a pulse of energy flowed into his heart through that wisp of a mating bond. A soft, loving energy filled with the infinite strength of Natalie\u2019s will. Her body might be weakening, but her determination to help him succeed remained as strong as ever.</p><p>Together, they would win the day. Or die trying.</p><p>The fear that he would lose her flared in his mind, but he shoved it back. Letting the world fall to Daemons would not save her. Their only way through this maelstrom was together.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Wulfe pulled on the power, on the primal energies. They came, as they had before. And then suddenly they were rushing into him a dozen times faster and harder than before. What the fuck? Natalie. She was helping him, pulling them with him.</p><p>No! Instantly, he shut down the flow. It was too much. They were going to kill her.</p><p>Again, he felt that pulse of pure love, one with a decided edge of demand. Hell.</p><p>Satanan\u2019s hips had formed, now, and his thighs. Only his lower legs and feet remained trapped by the swirling mass of color. They were out of time.</p> <p>With a prayer to the goddess, he took a deep breath and called once more on the primal energies, embracing the rush this time because he had to and because, woven within that swirling, terrible power, he felt Natalie\u2019s calm certainty, her courage, her love.</p><p>Calling on the power inside of him, Wulfe finally broke free of Satanan\u2019s invisible hold. But when he pushed forward to try again to retrieve the blade, Satanan\u2019s power slammed into him like a two-hundred-mile-per-hour headwind, and he couldn\u2019t move. Lifting his hand, he tried calling the blade to him, but that didn\u2019t work any better. Dammit. He couldn\u2019t push forward, let alone attack.</p><p>All the while those primal energies swirled inside him, smoke and shadows, gleeful of the darkness, of Satanan\u2019s evil. One wrong step, and he was going to become lost in that dark power, whether his own or Satanan\u2019s.</p><p>A faint pulse of soft, loving energy brushed his heart, making his gut clench with anguish. Natalie\u2019s brightness, her strength and light were almost out. Pulling the energies was killing her, yet he couldn\u2019t stop. He had to win.</p><p>Satanan began to laugh. His legs had formed, his feet were becoming visible as the red-and-orange swirl slowly died. The pull on Wulfe\u2019s soul grew stronger by ten. He could feel it being sucked out of his body!</p><p>Desperation tore through him, his muscles straining against the unnatural power. He was a Feral, dammit!</p><p>A Feral. Only part Daemon.</p><p>In a flash of insight, he finally understood. It had taken his Daemon form to breach the warding, but only in his non-Daemon animal form was he protected from Satanan\u2019s growing control. Only in his wolf would he prevail.</p><p>As the animal inside him gave a howl of approval, Wulfe shifted with ease and joy into his furred form and lunged for the Daemon Blade. As he\u2019d hoped, his wolf\u2019s body slid through the power blast as his man\u2019s . . . his Daemon\u2019s . . . could not.</p><p>Snatching up the blade in his teeth, Wulfe tossed the magical steel into the air, then shifted back, and caught it with one hand. Without pause, he whirled and stabbed the Daemon Blade deep within Satanan\u2019s chest.</p><p>The High Daemon roared with fury, the scream echoing across the mountain and far into the sky. And a second later, Satanan disappeared, sucked back into the blade.</p><p>Shadows began to fly at Wulfe from all directions, following Satanan, vanishing, one after another, by the score.</p><p>With a roar of triumph, Wulfe lifted the blade aloft, the wind whipping at his face and hair, energy crackling over his skin. Victory sang in his blood. And more.</p><p>Power.</p><p>The primal energies rushed through him in a torrent, no longer siphoned by Satanan. Dark, rich, and seductive, they filled him, strengthened him.</p><p>The shadows rushed in, clouding his vision and his mind as the power consumed him.</p><p>Natalie lay on the rain-soaked ground, beneath the trees, her knees pulled against her chest, her teeth grinding against the horrific pain. Wave after wave of fire rushed up through her feet, through her body, a constant, steady stream of molten energy.</p><p>On one side of her, Kara stroked her face. On the other, Melisande pressed her hand to her arm, stealing as much of the pain as she could. Not enough. Not nearly enough.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s love caressed her mind, lending her strength, helping her heart continue to beat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s won!\u201d Ariana cried, taking form a few feet away. She\u2019d been moving between them and the Ferals, giving the women a play-by-play as she stood ready to call in her mist warriors if the Daemons turned against the Ferals. \u201cWulfe stabbed Satanan, and the wraith Daemons are following him into the blade!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not the other Daemons?\u201d Melisande asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I guess we\u2019ll find out what that means soon enough.\u201d She knelt beside them. \u201cHow\u2019s Natalie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep hold of her much longer. Wulfe has to shut down the channel, or he\u2019s going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>But it was too late. As she lay there in misery, the soft flow of Wulfe\u2019s love suddenly shut off. And a moment later, a piercing cold rushed into her in its place.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . . lost,\u201d Natalie gasped. \u201cTo the darkness.\u201d</p><p>Kara made a sound of despair, but Melisande only growled. \u201cHe\u2019s not lost, yet. Get back, Kara. Natalie and I are going for a little ride.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Natalie\u2019s world flipped end over end, then righted itself suddenly as she came to lie on her back upon cool, wet stone, her stomach turning. The rain beat softly against her face and hair, telling her she was still alive. For now.</p><p>\u201cNatalie\u2019s dying, Wulfe,\u201d Melisande announced. \u201cThe woman you love, is dying.\u201d</p><p>With a start, Natalie forced her eyes open, turning instinctively toward the male who held her heart and her life in his hands. Electricity arced all around him as if he stood in the middle of his own private lightning storm. His eyes stared at her without recognition, once more glowing red. Around him, the Ferals circled, ready to attack him, to kill him if they had to.</p><p>Strome had warned that the darkness always won. She\u2019d pulled him back once. But heaven help her, it was all she could do to keep breathing through the pain. Where was she going to find the strength to save him one more time?</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Extraordinary, magnificent, glorious power raced through Wulfe\u2019s veins. They would bow before him, the insects. They would worship at his feet!</p><p>If only he could silence the one inside, the wolf, and his snarling, his fury, his howling.</p><p>The shifters\u2014he\u2019d known them once\u2014surrounded him, their weapons drawn.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, buddy, don\u2019t let the darkness win,\u201d one of them said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Wolfman. We need you, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWulfe, release the darkness. That\u2019s an order!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie is going to die, Wulfe,\u201d yet another said quietly, his voice throbbing with emotion. \u201cDon\u2019t let her die, Wulfe. If she does, you\u2019re both gone.\u201d</p><p>But the male they spoke to was already gone. Couldn\u2019t they see that?</p><p>\u201cWulfe.\u201d The female on the rock at his feet spoke, her voice a mere whisper. He recognized her, his channel key. Once she died, he\u2019d gain no additional power, which was a pity. But he could barely hold all he\u2019d claimed already, so it was no matter. All would kneel before him!</p><p>Something pulsed in his head, a small golden glow that flared, then disappeared, again and again, each pulse igniting the darkness of his mind, dissolving a few of the shadows, but it was no matter. The pulses grew weaker, fainter. Dying.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s dying.</p><p>The words broke through the shadows, stabbing him through the gut. The wolf trapped inside him howled with fury and desperation.</p><p>He gathered the shadows close, pushing back the words and their inexplicable pain, concentrating only on the power. But the words pushed again, attacked again, over and over and over.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s dying. Natalie\u2019s dying. Natalie\u2019s dying.</p><p>The pain grew. Emotion began to break through the wall of shadows, at first a mere trickle, slowly becoming a small stream, then a flood.</p><p>No. He didn\u2019t care. He wouldn\u2019t care.</p><p>He was panting as he fought it back, fought against the love that battered at the walls he\u2019d thought impenetrable. Though he struggled to destroy all emotion and shore up the walls, the light slipped through his defenses, burrowing deep, filling him with warmth and love and fear. Scattering the darkness to the winds.</p><p>Wulfe came back to himself in a dizzying rush, his gaze dropping to the woman lying dead at his feet.</p><p>\u201cNatalie!\u201d He fell to his knees beside her, his heart splintering as he gathered her cold hand in his warm one. And felt life. Not dead. Thank you, goddess. His own heart began to beat again even as he knew she must be at death\u2019s door. Scooping her unconscious body against his chest, he turned to the throngs who stood all around him, watching.</p><p>\u201cHow do I save her?\u201d he yelled.</p><p>A deep male voice he didn\u2019t recognize answered him. \u201cRelease the primal energies, shifter. Send them back through her, back where they came from, and close the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d But even as he asked the question, he knew the answer. He found it written on the Daemon sliver of his soul.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he began to say the words\u2014words he\u2019d never known yet had always known. Words that repudiated the darkness, banishing it back into the bowels of Hell.</p><p>The darkness inside him resisted, trying to seduce, to beguile, but Wulfe had no need for power beyond what he\u2019d always had. He needed Natalie. Only that. Only her. Though the darkness fought valiantly, it was no match for the determination of a man in love and, slowly, it lost its hold on him and slipped away. He felt it flee back through Natalie, back to where it had come from. Out of his head, his blood, his bones, draining, evaporating, until it was no more.</p><p>Taking a deep, cleansing breath, Wulfe blinked, feeling odd and yet wonderfully himself again. From his mouth, slipped another string of unknown words, words he knew would close the channel once and for all. Lifting Natalie closer, tucking her head against his chest, he bent and kissed her lips.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me. Please come back to me.\u201d</p><p>Her aura was gone, now. Amazingly, so too was the wound on her cheek.</p><p>She stirred in his arms and his heart began to beat again. Slowly, her lashes lifted. As she saw him, a small, calm, gray-eyes smile lifted her lovely mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou did it.\u201d</p><p>A shudder went through him, and he pulled her tight against him. \u201cWe did it together,\u201d he whispered against her hair. Inside, his wolf let out a howl of pure happiness.</p><p>Lifting his head, Wulfe faced his brothers. Behind them stood several dozen Daemons of the human-looking variety, each armed with a sword or knife, though none appeared to be actively threatening. In fact, unless he was mistaken, the expressions on most of their faces were a mix of gratitude and disbelief, of relief and wonder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can stand,\u201d Natalie said quietly, and he set her on her feet, if reluctantly, keeping an arm tight around her.</p><p>His brothers surged forward, gathering around him, slapping him on the back. Lyon grasped his forearm. \u201cA hell of a job, Wulfe. One hell of a job.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe handed his chief the Daemon Blade.</p> <p>\u201cWolfman,\u201d Jag crowed. \u201cYou just saved the whole fucking world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Paenther said quietly, drawing their attention back to the dozens of Daemons watching them, reminding them that although Satanan might be defeated, much of his horde was still loose.</p><p>The tattooed Daemon stepped forward. \u201cWe are in your debt, shifter.\u201d</p><p>Lyon faced him. \u201cYou\u2019re Daemons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of us, yes. But there were many races subjugated and ensnared by Satanan, and all those who survived were freed this day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe world you left is no more.\u201d Lyon\u2019s voice resonated clearly across the gathering. \u201cThe humans now number in the billions, and they\u2019ve acquired great power. They don\u2019t know the immortal races exist and they must never know if we wish to survive. Find a way to live in this world without discovery and without harming the other races, including the humans. Or we\u2019ll be hunting you down.\u201d</p><p>The tattooed male nodded. \u201cSatanan\u2019s way was never ours. We wish only to return to the mountains and live in peace.\u201d</p><p>Jag snorted. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>The Daemon\u2019s jaw hardened. \u201cMany of those who were freed today have already escaped, many whose souls were long ago destroyed by Satanan. They have neither heard your warning nor would likely pay it any heed if they had. We will hunt them and destroy those who cannot be saved.\u201d</p><p>Lyon nodded. \u201cIf you need assistance\u2014and you may until you learn the ways of this world\u2014we\u2019ll help you. I am Lyon, Chief of the Feral Warriors, the shifters.\u201d</p><p>The Daemon male nodded. \u201cI am Strome, the last true king of the Daemons.\u201d</p> <p>Wulfe jerked. Around him, several of the others made noises of surprise.</p><p>The male eyed them curiously. \u201cYou have heard of me.\u201d</p><p>Fox gave a small smile. \u201cYou\u2019re something of a legend where we\u2019re from, boyo.\u201d None of them, it seemed, were willing to endanger Vivian\u2019s life, not when she\u2019d risked so much to help them.</p><p>Lyon looked around. \u201cYou may remain here, in this fortress, for as long as you wish. The owner no longer needs it. But the humans inside will be set free. Leave the humans alone. All humans.\u201d</p><p>Strome turned to Wulfe. \u201cYou, shifter, are part Daemon.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe nodded, wondering if they\u2019d always know he was one of them. \u201cApparently I have a Daemon ancestor.\u201d</p><p>Strome nodded. \u201cCiroc.\u201d</p><p>That was the name Vivian\u2019s Strome had given him.</p> <p>A fur-clad Daemon stepped forward, his beard full, his shoulders nearly as wide as Wulfe\u2019s. \u201cI am Ciroc.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe stared, a chill dancing over his skin. This male was his . . . how many greats? . . . grandfather.</p><p>Ciroc smiled with a startling pride. \u201cYou honor me and all who have come before and after me, son of my son of my son. Relinquishing, nay shoving away that kind of power was a sight to behold, a display of strength and nobility few men possess. Of any race.\u201d</p><p>Strome nodded. \u201cYou honor all who challenge evil. You would be most welcome should you wish to join my tribe, shifter of Ciroc\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>The distinctive sound track of the original Star Wars movie cut the stillness suddenly. All heads turned toward the door, where one of the Daemon males held a laptop like he feared it would explode in his hands. As he approached, all the Daemons stared, wide-eyed, many of them backing away.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Strome demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s harmless,\u201d Lyon assured him. \u201cHuman technology. Playacting.\u201d</p><p>The Daemon moved to where he could watch the battle on the screen, then shook his head, his eyes wide. \u201cThe world has indeed changed.\u201d</p><p>Lyon grunted. \u201cWe don\u2019t live in the Star Wars universe, but yes, it\u2019s changed. More than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Strome moved away from the laptop and extended his hand to Lyon. \u201cI thank you, shifter. You and your people have freed me and mine. We are in your debt.\u201d</p><p>After only a moment\u2019s hesitation, Lyon met him halfway. \u201cYou have a lot of catching up to do. I suggest you coerce the remaining Mage into showing you how to use the televisions and computers, and learn how to live in the twenty-first century. I\u2019ll send Wulfe back to see how you\u2019re doing in a couple of days. Right now, we have other things to attend to.\u201d</p><p>Lyon turned to Ariana.</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Ariana asked.</p><p>Lyon smiled, reaching for Kara as he turned to Wulfe with a lift of a tawny eyebrow.</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s still-stunned gaze returned to Ciroc. He nodded, getting a nod and a smile in return, then glanced down to find Natalie watching him with color in her cheeks and an incandescent joy in her eyes.</p><p>The smile tugging at his mouth bloomed fully. \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, the Ferals sat or stood around the massive dining table in Feral House with their mates. Their numbers had swelled, and would continue to, it seemed, until they were twenty-six once more. The moment they\u2019d returned to Feral House, a carafe of Inir\u2019s blood in hand, they\u2019d performed a series of rituals to bring the new Ferals residing in their prisons into their animals. Castin, as they\u2019d expected, had shifted into a cheetah. Rikkert, into a rhino. Kougar had declared their Feral names to be Cheet and Rhyne, respectively. The third male, now known as Dact, had shifted into a startling creature\u2014a long-extinct pterodactyl with a twenty-foot wingspan. A one-man demolition team if he ever shifted in the house.</p><p>With each Renascence, Kara had felt stronger and better, making it clear that the souls inside these Ferals were honorable and good. Sabine had been right, and they had no more qualms about Lepard, whom she\u2019d declared also good. Only Grizz\u2019s soul remained in question, though only, it seemed, to the grizzly shifter himself. No one else doubted the honor of a male who\u2019d risked his life to save his brothers.</p><p>The second ritual had cleared the new Ferals and Polaris of the dark magic that had infected all the animal spirits of the seventeen. The third had cleared Lepard and Grizz of the dark charm\u2019s curse, restoring their immortality.</p><p>Now, seventeen Ferals sat or stood around the table.</p><p>Nine new Ferals had yet to come in\u2014the ones who would be marked to replace the evil Ferals and the three who\u2019d yet to appear. Kougar had finally revealed the ones missing to be the horse, the gorilla, and the arctic wolf.</p><p>Wulfe liked the idea of another wolf in the house.</p><p>In addition to the Ferals, all the wives had joined them. And Natalie.</p><p>She sat beside him, leaning against him, his arm around her shoulders. Her sweet scent filled his senses, her nearness, his heart. Goddess, he loved her. As if she felt that surge of emotion, she turned to meet his gaze, her eyes soft as a summer breeze, setting his pulse to flight at her loveliness. Her eyes were bright, her cheeks rosy. Pulling the energies through her hadn\u2019t injured her permanently from what he could tell. She\u2019d recovered almost immediately. All he wanted to do now was sweep her up to his room and make love to her until neither of them cared about the future, about anything but lying in one another\u2019s arms.</p><p>But now wasn\u2019t the time. And he was dreading getting her alone as much as he was looking forward to it. Because the moment he did, they were going to have to have the talk. He intended to pop the question. And he was terrified she was going to kiss him and tell him that her life was in Frederick, not here.</p><p>How could he ask her to give up her work, her mom, her home? Everything?</p><p>But, goddess, he wanted her to stay with him.</p><p>\u201cVictory to the Feral Warriors!\u201d Tighe shouted, thrusting his fist into the air.</p><p>\u201cVictory to the Feral Warriors!\u201d the others shouted in reply, their fists rising as one. Only Grizz, standing apart, didn\u2019t participate.</p><p>\u201cCan we claim victory?\u201d Hawke asked, ever practical. \u201cWith the Daemons now free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wraith Daemons are gone,\u201d Lyon replied. \u201cAs is Satanan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Inir,\u201d Paenther added. \u201cPerhaps now, some of the Mage who\u2019ve lost their souls will begin to reclaim them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to keep a close eye on the Daemons and the others who escaped.\u201d Kougar took a sip of his whiskey. \u201cMore than one has traditionally fed on humans though I\u2019m the first to admit I know little about most of those races. They inhabited a different part of the world from the shifters in those ancient times, and they were already firmly under Satanan\u2019s control by the time I was born. Perhaps, as Strome indicated, the evil we\u2019ve always attributed to Daemons in general was only a reflection of Satanan\u2019s control over them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can hope,\u201d Lyon said somberly. \u201cIf they prove otherwise, we\u2019ll have our work cut out for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the draden?\u201d Fox asked, his arm around Melisande\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe always believed they were the remnants of the Daemons incarcerated in the blade, but there\u2019s no doubt they\u2019ve multiplied a thousandfold since ancient times. Do you think they\u2019re gone now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Grizz suddenly pushed away from the wall and strode to Melisande. \u201cI need to find Sabine.\u201d</p><p>Melisande nodded, then gave Fox a quick kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d A moment later, she and Grizz disappeared.</p><p>\u201cNatalie,\u201d Kara said with surprise. \u201cYour wound. I just realized it\u2019s gone again.\u201d</p><p>Natalie reached for her cheek with a look of disappointment. \u201cMy badge of honor.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe smiled and kissed her temple. \u201cIt disappeared along with your aura once I released the primal powers and closed the door on them. I can cut you a new one.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sound the most beautiful beneath the heavens. \u201cThanks, but no.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and kissed her soundly on the mouth this time.</p><p>\u201cI wonder . . .\u201d Kougar murmured.</p><p>Delaney made a funny sound and Wulfe lifted his head to find her watching him with wide eyes, her hand covering her mouth. Tighe gripped his mate\u2019s shoulder, the look on his face half disbelief, half smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wulfe demanded.</p><p>\u201cPrick her finger,\u201d Tighe said.</p><p>Wulfe scowled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s smile escaped, his dimples flashing. \u201cWhen Delaney was made the channel key, she became immortal. We thought it was pulling the clone\u2019s half of my soul through her body that changed her, but now I\u2019m wondering.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cImmortal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeculation, only,\u201d Wulfe murmured, but his heart began to pound. If Tighe was right, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily change anything. Natalie wouldn\u2019t have to stay with him, even then. She could go wherever she wanted, do whatever her heart desired. But if she did want to stay . . . they would have forever.</p><p>\u201cHow do we test it?\u201d she asked, breathless, her eyes wide.</p><p>With an unsteady hand, Wulfe released her to pull a small switchblade from his pocket, then he held out his hand for her. \u201cJust a prick,\u201d he promised, but she placed her hand in his without hesitation.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Wulfe gripped one slender finger and nicked the very end. A tiny pearl of blood appeared. He waited two seconds, then brushed it away, revealing skin uninjured. She\u2019d already healed.</p><p>Joy lifted inside him.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s wide-eyed gaze locked on his. \u201cDo it again. A bigger cut this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll hurt.\u201d</p><p>Her calm gaze bore into his. \u201cI need to know.\u201d</p><p>So did he. This time he cut her palm, a shallow, half-inch slice. The blood welled again, and healed before their eyes.</p><p>\u201cImmortal,\u201d Tighe crowed.</p><p>The table fell silent. Because none of them, Wulfe included, knew if this was good news or bad.</p><p>Wulfe stood suddenly. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Natalie, stunned, nodded, and he grabbed her hand and led her up to his room.</p><p>Wulfe ushered Natalie into his bedroom. As he closed the door, she turned to him, her heart pounding, her mind in chaos. Immortal. She\u2019d been turned immortal.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d she asked, sounding as bewildered as she felt.</p><p>Wulfe stood as if frozen, watching her with liquid eyes. \u201cIt means you\u2019re one of us, now. In a way. You have to hide what you are from the humans. From the mortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go home.\u201d The thought tried to catch at her emotions, but found only small purchase, because the truth was, she didn\u2019t want to go home. That wasn\u2019t what she wanted at all.</p><p>\u201cYou can go wherever you want. We won\u2019t be able to take your memories, now, and you will have to be careful of a lot of things, but I trust you, Natalie.\u201d</p><p>She watched him, her pulse pounding. Emotions threatened to overwhelm her. \u201cWulfe . . . what if I don\u2019t want to go home?\u201d</p><p>A light sparked in his eyes, hope and joy, and she knew, in that moment, that he wanted her to stay. \u201cBut . . . your mom. Your kids with the vision problems.\u201d</p><p>Her heart caught. How could she turn her back on them? The kids would find another doctor. But her mom would never survive the loss of all three of her children. Tears burned her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d And suddenly she was in his arms, his hands in her hair as he gripped her head, as his gaze bore into hers. \u201cTell me what I can do to make you stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind a way for my mom to remain part of Xavier\u2019s and my lives.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know, but I\u2019ll fly to the moon and back if that\u2019s what it takes to make you stay.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart filled, a smile lifting her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat else, Natalie? I don\u2019t see how you can keep your practice\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014but tell me how I can help you make a difference, and it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>A small laugh escaped her throat because her dreams\u2014dreams she hadn\u2019t even known she possessed, were all coming true in one swift rush. \u201cMaybe you can help me open the minds of a few more eye doctors to the benefits of vision therapy?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe\u2019s smile bloomed slowly. \u201cStart setting me up with eye appointments.\u201d His smile dimmed, his gaze turned piercingly raw. \u201cWhat else do you want, Natalie? Anything. Anything at all if you\u2019ll just stay.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the lump that had risen into her throat as she saw so clearly what he wanted her to say.</p> <p>\u201cYou, Wulfe. I want you. Forever. For eternity. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEternity is a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He pulled her tight against him, burying his face in her hair as his big body shuddered. When he pulled back, moisture glistened in the velvet depths of his beautiful eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve waited for you all my life, Natalie. Even eternity won\u2019t be enough.\u201d A precious smile broke across his handsome, beloved face. \u201cWill you marry me, Natalie Cash? Be my mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Wulfe. A thousand times, yes.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe let out a whoop that she feared might bring down the ceiling, then swept her into his arms and kissed her until she was breathless, wanting, and dizzy with love.</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cWoof! Woof!\u201d</p><p>The toddler\u2019s voice and the small, pounding feet had Wulfe turning and grinning as he strode through the foyer of Feral House.</p><p>\u201cHey there, tiger.\u201d He knelt as the dimpled, towheaded two-year-old flew into his arms.</p><p>\u201cUp!\u201d</p><p>Wulfe rose and lifted the boy until they were eye to eye. \u201cThis high?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Up!\u201d A chubby hand shot into the air.</p><p>Wulfe lifted him until he could blow bubbles in the boy\u2019s soft belly.</p> <p>The child screeched with laughter. \u201cUp! Up!\u201d</p><p>Wulfe lifted him all the way over his head. \u201cThis high?\u201d He couldn\u2019t wait until he could hold his own child like this.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d the boy squealed, and Wulfe pulled him down, placing a quick kiss on his forehead before he set him on his never-still feet.</p><p>\u201cAnders, buddy!\u201d Tighe grinned and scooped up his son. They were a pair, those two.</p><p>Little Anders, named for Tighe\u2019s Therian father all those years ago, pressed small hands to his father\u2019s cheeks and kissed Tighe\u2019s nose.</p><p>Wulfe pretended not to notice the moisture that gleamed in Stripes\u2019s eyes, as he blinked back the moisture in his own.</p><p>Delaney strode into the foyer, Kara on one side, Melisande on the other. Delaney was just beginning to show with her second child, a daughter this time. Therians rarely conceived, but apparently humans-turned-immortal conceived as easily as humans, which thrilled all of them. The more children in Feral House, the better.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, did you wake her?\u201d Delaney joined her husband and son, pulled close by Tighe\u2019s strong arm. \u201cWe\u2019re ready. Everyone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll go get her.\u201d He took the stairs three at a time, then strode to his bedroom, opening the door quietly. The last thing he wanted to do was startle his sleeping wife, but he found her brushing her hair in front of the mirror.</p><p>She turned to him with a smile so full of love it nearly drove him to his knees even after nearly three years of marriage.</p><p>\u201cAm I late? You were supposed to wake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to let you sleep. You girls need your rest.\u201d</p><p>Natalie laughed, her hand stroking her distended belly. \u201cOnly one of us slept. Your daughter does not like it when I lie still.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe knelt before her and pressed his hand to Natalie\u2019s pregnant stomach. A small foot pressed back. His eyes lifted to Natalie\u2019s in wonder. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I can hold her.\u201d</p><p>Natalie gave a small laugh. \u201cTrust me, you\u2019re not the only one.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe pulled her against him as best he could and kissed her soundly. \u201cYou are the most beautiful woman who ever lived.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hand to his cheek. \u201cAnd you are the most beautiful man.\u201d Her words weaved deep down inside, finding truth and purchase. In all the ways that mattered, to Natalie, he was. And he would always, always endeavor to make certain she felt that way.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Is it just the Ferals and their wives?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe smiled as he steered her down the stairs. \u201cWith twenty-six of us now, how would we fit anyone else?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d put an addition on the house last spring, doubling the size of the kitchen and dining room, and adding living quarters for the kitchen staff Pink and Xavier now oversaw. They\u2019d also added a playroom for Anders and the soon-to-be-born girls, and a far larger gathering place with sofas and tables for social events like Natalie\u2019s baby shower\u2014a space large enough to hold them all. Plus a few more.</p><p>Wulfe steered her there now and watched with pleasure as she saw the decorations\u2014the pink balloons and streamers\u2014and the people.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Natalie gasped, as her mother strode forward and enveloped her in her arms. Natalie threw him a look of gratitude. Though he hadn\u2019t told Natalie he was bringing her mom to her shower, the woman had been to visit, now, many times. He had to wipe her memory, to some extent, each time, but he\u2019d figured out how to do it in such a way that she never forgot that her kids were okay, and she\u2019d see them again soon. She knew the visits had to remain a secret for her children\u2019s safety.</p><p>Around the room stood twenty-five of the twenty-six Ferals, the Feral wives, half a dozen Daemons, and several others new to the modern world. Even after more than two years, they were discovering additional races of creatures who\u2019d escaped the Daemon Blade. They\u2019d found some strong allies among the escapees, but also made some bitter enemies. Life was never dull in Feral House.</p><p>Only Grizz was missing, on yet another search for Sabine. When he\u2019d returned to Montana after Satanan\u2019s defeat, he\u2019d found her house empty. Deserted. Not even the male tasked with delivering her supplies knew where she\u2019d gone. Grizz had been trying, without success, to find her ever since.</p><p>Kara raised a toast. \u201cTo our soon-to-be newest edition. And her wonderful mom and dad. Have you decided on a name, yet?\u201d</p><p>Natalie glanced at him, a soft smile breaking across her mouth before she made their announcement. \u201cLiesel. We\u2019re naming her for a girl Wulfe knew in his youth, a lovely young woman whose life was cut short and who needs to be remembered.\u201d</p><p>When Natalie first suggested the name, he\u2019d balked. The memory of Liesel still had the power to cut. But the more he\u2019d thought about it, the more he knew his wife was right. The name would become his daughter\u2019s, no longer bound to his nightmare. At the same time, this was a fitting way to give the girl he\u2019d failed one final gift. Immortality.</p><p>The Feral wives surged forward, surrounding Natalie and whisking her to the chaise that was already surrounded by presents of every shape and size. As the pack of females passed Pink and Xavier, Natalie grabbed a feathered hand, dragging the ever-shy Pink along with her to a peal of sweet, high-pitched laughter. More than a dozen Ilinas had arrived at Ariana\u2019s and Melisande\u2019s invitation, and they stood on the periphery of the feminine clutch, laughing and smiling.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s gaze found him through the throng. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to help open presents?\u201d</p><p>Wulfe laughed and shook his head as Tighe handed him a beer. He lifted the bottle. \u201cCan\u2019t. Got my hands full.\u201d</p><p>Natalie threw back her head and laughed, then tore open the first present.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s hand landed on Wulfe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re in for, my friend. Kids explode into your life, leaving everything you thought you knew in shambles. That daughter of yours is going to transform you. After Natalie, she\u2019ll be the best thing that ever happened to you.\u201d</p><p>The emotion in Tighe\u2019s voice had Wulfe looping his arm around his friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOur daughters are going to be virtually the same age.\u201d</p><p>Tighe grunted. \u201cYou thought we had our hands full with Inir\u2019s evil Mage. Just wait until those two become teenagers.\u201d</p><p>Hawke and Kougar joined them, Jag and Fox striding up a moment later, followed by Vhyper, Paenther, and Lyon. One by one, they slapped forearms with Wulfe, congratulating him on the child that would soon be born. Then as one they turned and watched their wives.</p><p>\u201cHow did we stand this place when it was just us rattling around here?\u201d Paenther mused.</p><p>\u201cAll those years, just nine Feral Warriors.\u201d Lyon grunted. \u201cCompared to now, this place was like a morgue.\u201d</p><p>Tighe lifted his beer. \u201cTo the women who\u2019ve brought us light and life, laughter and love. May we make them as happy as they\u2019ve made us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d Jag said, taking a swig of his beer.</p><p>The women exclaimed over one of the gifts, their sweet voices raised in pleasure. But it was only one woman Wulfe had eyes for. His precious Natalie.</p><p>She held up a ruffled pink dress that was smaller than his hand for him to see, grinning with delight. But all that mattered to him was the joy that radiated from those calm, gray eyes.</p><p>And the love.</p><p>For him. </p> </body></html>"]
