A woman who should have been a ghost. \u201cGoing to leave me to die alone? Again?\u201d</p><p>Drake Archer circled her. They were in a small apartment, and the scent of death already filled the air around them.</p><p>The beautiful woman before him\u2014Anna Jean\u2014she had a knife. He had to get that knife away from her.</p> <p>She\u2019s already hurt too many people. I have to stop her. He opened his hand. Held it out to her. \u201cGive me the knife.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him.</p><p>Her laugh was so familiar. Once that laughter had seemed to warm him, now it made ice grow around his heart because he saw her for exactly what she was.</p><p>Her beauty only went skin deep. Evil was at her core.</p><p>Drake started to shake his head. How had he been so wrong about her? How?</p> <p>And in that one moment, Anna Jean attacked. She lunged forward and drove her knife into Drake\u2019s stomach, and then she yanked, jerking the blade to the right. He fell back, stunned, as his blood pumped from him and a chill seemed to consume his whole body.</p><p>\u201cThis time, you get to die,\u201d Anna Jean told him and she was smiling.</p><p>His knees sagged. Drake hit the floor.</p><p>No, no, he wasn\u2019t supposed to go out like this. And...it was all his fucking fault. He\u2019d trusted the wrong woman. Fell for lying eyes.</p><p>Anna Jean wasn\u2019t going to stop. She was a killer, straight to her soul. There were others in the apartment. Others that she would take out with a cold, calculated brutality. He had to stop her.</p><p>His blood soaked his shirt. He tried to look up, to move, but his whole body trembled.</p> <p>Anna Jean drew closer to him. He could feel her gaze, even though he couldn\u2019t see her face. \u201cMaybe he did love me,\u201d she mused. \u201cBecause if he\u2019d been smart, he would\u2019ve shot me when he had the chance. Instead, I had the pleasure of gutting him.\u201d Her voice dropped. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for leaving me in the cold.\u201d</p><p>I never loved you. When Anna Jean moved to step around him, his hand flew out. His fingers locked around her ankle. \u201cNo...\u201d Drake growled.</p><p>\u201cOh, darling, relax, I\u2019ll slit your throat and end things soon.\u201d</p><p>And she would. Without any hesitation. When he\u2019d been the one to foolishly hesitate.</p><p>He would never hesitate again. Drake tried to heave his body up. I have to stop her.</p><p>He would do anything...anything...to stop her.</p><p>Drake pushed through the pain even as more of his blood pumped from his body. He managed to grab the knife that Anna Jean had used on him. She wasn\u2019t expecting another attack from him, not then. She thought he was too weak.</p><p>Her mistake. Drake lunged up, and he drove the knife into her heart. Anna Jean gasped. Her eyes widened. She turned her head to look at him.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t...miss this time,\u201d he managed to tell her. No, he\u2019d ended Anna Jean.</p><p>She died in his arms.</p><p>And his blood kept flowing out...</p><p>Drake jerked upright in bed, his body soaked in sweat and the memories still twisting in his head. Because that hadn\u2019t been a dream. No nightmare to mess with his head.</p><p>That had been his sick reality.</p><p>His hand slid over the newest scar on his stomach. A wound that had come far too close to taking him out.</p><p>Only he\u2019d survived.</p><p>His ex-lover hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Anna Jean...</p><p>She wasn\u2019t his first kill. Not even close. But she was the one who haunted him. Because of her, he\u2019d learned an important lesson.</p><p>Drake would never again fall for another woman\u2019s lies.</p><p>Not-fucking-ever.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Drake Archer wasn\u2019t looking for trouble. He didn\u2019t want complications. He didn\u2019t want questions.</p><p>He wanted to fuck. Wanted to sink into the arms of a sweet-smelling woman and pretend the nightmares that chased him every time he closed his eyes weren\u2019t real.</p><p>Even though he knew they were.</p><p>The club was packed. His club. He owned the casino and the club that was attached to it. So he stood on the top floor of his domain, behind the tinted glass, and he watched the crowd. Bodies gyrated down there. Women and men heaved against each other. Music was pounding, but he didn\u2019t hear the beat or any of the voices that must be rising down there. He\u2019d soundproofed this room. He liked to watch the others, but he sure as hell didn\u2019t want anyone seeing\u2014or hearing\u2014him.</p><p>Some women wore glittering dresses. Some wore scraps that were designed to turn men into lusting monsters.</p><p>His gaze swept over the crowd, moving a few more feet, as his attention slowly shifted toward the bar.</p><p>Then his eyes narrowed.</p><p>The woman standing at the bar\u2014her fingers curled around the slender stem of a martini glass\u2014she wasn\u2019t like the others.</p><p>Her hair was a dark red, glinting under the lights. It skimmed her shoulders, moving slightly as she turned her head and gazed\u2014right up at me.</p><p>She wore all black. Not some seductive dress. But pants and a form fitting turtle-neck. She reminded him of a sexy jewel thief for a moment, and his lips quirked at the image.</p><p>He put his hand to the glass when another man approached her. A slickly dressed guy, oozing pompous confidence and cash. The jerk put his hand on her shoulder.</p><p>She shrugged him away.</p><p>Then she kept staring right up at Drake.</p><p>His jewel thief truly acted as if she saw him. Impossible, of course. There was no way that she could see through that tinted glass.</p><p>She crooked her finger at him.</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>A wide smile flashed across her face, and the redhead crooked her finger one more time. A dare. A taunt.</p><p>She did know he was there. Maybe she\u2019d gotten chatty with the wait staff. Maybe the bartender had told her that Drake would occasionally invite women up to his private lounge.</p><p>But the redhead was dead wrong about the way this scene was played. He didn\u2019t dance to anyone else\u2019s tune. A pretty face and a sexy body wasn\u2019t about to get to him.</p><p>He needed, he wanted, but he was the one always in control.</p><p>In business and in the bedroom, Drake knew how to dominate.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be going to the little redhead.</p><p>He dropped his hand.</p><p>That just wasn\u2019t the way he worked.</p><p>Jasmine Bennett\u2019s heart was about to burst right out of her chest. And, thanks to the ever pounding music, she was pretty sure that her ear drums might be about to burst, too.</p><p>\u201cLet me buy you a drink,\u201d the guy next to her said, and the fellow\u2019s lips brushed over her ear as he leaned in real close to make that offer.</p><p>She shoved him back. He was in the way. The last thing she wanted was for Drake Archer to think that she was involved with this bozo. She\u2019d planned too hard for this moment. There was no way some drunk playboy was going to wreck her night.</p><p>\u201cNot interested,\u201d Jasmine gritted out. Talk about not taking a hint. The guy just couldn\u2019t get it to save his life. This was the third time. The third time that she\u2019d told him to back off. But he wasn\u2019t backing anywhere.</p><p>He was crowding even closer to her. The guy seemed to have bathed in cologne, too\u2014the cloying scent was about to choke her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got other plans for the night,\u201d she told him, keeping her voice firm. Plans that involved her getting invited for a personal meet and greet with Drake Archer. Failure wasn\u2019t an option for her. She had to get up there. Access to that private lounge of his was her end-goal for the night.</p><p>A desperate woman would do some very, very desperate things.</p><p>\u201cNo, love, you don\u2019t have other plans.\u201d His hand locked around her wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>That was the moment when Jasmine realized that the guy wasn\u2019t quite as drunk as he\u2019d appeared to be. Swallowing, Jasmine glanced down at her wrist. His fingers had closed around her in a too tight grip. An unbreakable one.</p><p>Oh, hell. Had her past just caught up with her?</p><p>\u201cNow you don\u2019t want to start a scene here, do you?\u201d he murmured. \u201cBecause that could just get embarrassing for you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thought her heartbeat was racing before. The frantic beat now shook her whole chest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna walk out of here,\u201d he said, his mouth right against her ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll head to the parking garage, and then you\u2019re gonna play things nice and easy.\u201d</p><p>She was? Since when?</p><p>But he kept talking. The guy told her, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get in my car, and I\u2019ll be taking you back home.\u201d</p><p>Since he was being all chatty, Jasmine could hear the Texas drawl in his words.</p><p>That drawl had her muscles locking. Home was the last place she wanted to be, and she sure as heck wasn\u2019t going to play the good girl and just march along with the man.</p><p>\u201cYou have me confused with someone else,\u201d Jasmine said. She tugged on her wrist. No give at all. \u201cBefore this goes too far, you need to let me go. Then you need to walk out of this club. Just\u2014go.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. He was a fairly handsome guy, but he creeped her out. \u201cNo,\u201d he told her, \u201cI know exactly who you are\u2014and you\u2019re worth way too much money for me to walk away.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d tried to warn the guy. He should have listened to her. Did the fool really think she cared about making a scene? Like embarrassment was an issue for her.</p><p>The way Jasmine figured it, she had two options right then. She could scream her head off, but with the music pounding, it was highly doubtful that anyone would hear her\u2014or try to intervene.</p><p>So that left option two. Throw the jerk off-guard. He was stronger than her physically\u2014hence the unbreakable grip\u2014but...all attacks didn\u2019t have to involve physical strength. There were lots of other areas in which she excelled.</p><p>She\u2019d always been told that she was one hell of a kisser.</p><p>Instead of trying to pull away from him, she turned toward him and Jasmine put her mouth right on his. She felt the ripple of surprise that went through him. Obviously, the guy had expected her to fight for her freedom.</p><p>He should have read her file more. She was all about doing the unexpected. She leaned into him, arching slightly and, sure enough, she felt his grip on her wrist start to ease.</p><p>Your mistake, buddy.</p><p>The redhead was kissing the jerk.</p><p>What kind of game was she playing? Drake had been about to turn away from the glass when he saw her rise onto her toes and push her mouth against the man\u2019s.</p><p>Drake\u2019s hands clenched at his sides. He didn\u2019t know the woman. Didn\u2019t care who she kissed. No, he shouldn\u2019t care.</p><p>But I want her.</p><p>And if Drake wanted her...</p><p>I\u2019ll take her.</p><p>He pulled out his phone. \u201cGet the redhead at the bar,\u201d he barked the order. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d</p><p>She yanked away from the dark-haired stranger\u2019s embrace. Turned on her heel and ran.</p><p>Drake\u2019s brows shot up.</p><p>The crowd swallowed her almost instantly and Drake saw the fury harden the other man\u2019s face as he surged after her.</p><p>\u201cStop the redhead and the asshole who is following her.\u201d She\u2019d been the only redhead at the bar, and Drake knew his security team would already have her image in front of them.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see her in that crowd. Not even a glimpse of her hair.</p><p>But he did notice that the STAFF door to the right of the bar was swinging closed. That door led to the stock room\u2014and to a flight of back stairs that his employees used. He knew exactly where those stairs would take the redhead.</p><p>The night had just gotten a little more interesting.</p><p>He turned on his heel and decided to give chase.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like he had to even work hard at the chase. Just a few feet outside of his lounge, a private elevator waited for him. That elevator was the only way to access his lounge. Drake pushed a button on the wall, and his elevator immediately opened. When he stepped inside, the mirrored walls tossed his reflection right back at him.</p><p>A flick of his hand and a quick press of his fingers had the elevator heading straight down to the parking garage.</p><p>At this rate, he just might beat her before she had a chance to escape.</p><p>In seconds, the elevator doors were opening again. He took his time strolling down the hallway, and when he reached the end of that small space, he typed in his security code on the keypad. The door opened and Drake found himself in the cavernous parking garage.</p><p>It was close to three a.m., and the folks in his club and casino weren\u2019t about to pull it in for the night. Vegas didn\u2019t sleep, and he knew this town was going strong.</p><p>He stilled for a moment and heard the fast and frantic pounding of footsteps as someone rushed down the stairs to the right. Leaning back against the stone wall of the garage, Drake crossed his arms over his chest and he waited.</p><p>Five...</p><p>Four...</p><p>Three...</p><p>Two...</p><p>She flew down the stairs. Her hair swirled around her face as she ran out of that stairwell and\u2014</p><p>The dark-haired man was right behind her. He grabbed her arm and yanked her back.</p><p>The man snarled, \u201cYou\u2019re not getting away, Jasmine!\u201d</p><p>Drake was in the shadows, and he knew they hadn\u2019t seen him, but he could see the woman\u2019s face clearly\u2014and he didn\u2019t like the fear that flashed across her delicate features.</p><p>Women were to be fucked. They were to be enjoyed. They weren\u2019t to be afraid.</p><p>They also weren\u2019t to be trusted, but that was another rule he\u2019d learned...</p><p>The man\u2019s hands were locked tightly around the woman\u2019s arms, and she was struggling against him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake!\u201d She fired at the guy. \u201cJust stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d Drake stepped from the shadows as his arms fell back to his sides. He hadn\u2019t raised his voice. Just kept it low. A few ladies from his past had told him that he had a low and lethal voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the hell ever.</p><p>All Drake knew was that his voice usually got action.</p><p>It got action right then, too. The woman gave a yelp, and the man swore.</p> <p>But the fool didn\u2019t let the lady go.</p><p>Jasmine.</p><p>Drake liked that name.</p><p>\u201cThis is personal, buddy,\u201d the man snapped at him. \u201cYou just need to mind your own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but it is my business.\u201d Drake waved a hand toward the parking garage. \u201cMy casino, my club, my parking garage. All very much my business.\u201d He cocked his head as he studied his prey. \u201cSo when a lady gets accosted at my place, well, you can imagine that tends to piss me off.\u201d He kept his eyes on the man. The guy had dark hair, thinning a bit, a broad forehead, and a too perfect tan. Drake pretty much hated the fool on sight. \u201cLet her go,\u201d Drake ordered, \u201cthen get the hell off my property.\u201d</p> <p>More footsteps pounded in that stairwell. Drake\u2019s gaze lifted just a bit, moving over the man\u2019s shoulder. The security team was right on time.</p><p>Swallowing, the guy dropped his hold. \u201cThis is a huge mistake,\u201d he began.</p><p>Nodding, Drake said, \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>The redhead quickly made her way to Drake\u2019s side. As she neared, Drake caught the sweet rush of her vanilla scent.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The man\u2019s face had flushed a dark red. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who she is! She\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men just can\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d the redhead murmured. \u201cYou would think when a woman ran away that would be enough of a clue.\u201d</p> <p>The guy growled and lunged toward her.</p><p>The security team locked their arms around him and jerked the idiot right back.</p><p>And the redhead sidled even closer to Drake. That vanilla scent was tempting. The lady smelled good enough to eat.</p><p>Drake had a very big appetite.</p><p>\u201cGet him off my property,\u201d Drake ordered. He pointed at the struggling SOB. \u201cIf I ever see you at any of my casinos or clubs again,\u201d and Archer Entertainment was becoming huge, \u201cthen you\u2019re going to be sorry.\u201d Because Drake knew too many ways to make a man pay.</p><p>He had his own law. His own rules.</p><p>The redhead\u2019s hand curled around Drake\u2019s arm. \u201cI-I...thank you.\u201d</p><p>The guards hauled away the jerk. But he kept shouting. Dumbass. The man didn\u2019t know when to shut up.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019ll be sorry!\u201d The words thundered from the dumbass in question. \u201cI\u2019m Wayne Hardin. I\u2019m a bounty\u2014\u201d</p><p>Heavy, metal doors swung shut behind him, finally stopping the guy\u2019s snarling words.</p><p>The woman stepped in front of Drake. She was about five foot eight, maybe five nine so she had to tilt her head back to stare up at him. This close, he could see that her skin was a light gold, and a faint dusting of freckles scattered across her nose. Her eyes were dark\u2014deep. He hadn\u2019t expected that darkness. Her lips were red and full.</p><p>A beauty, no doubt, with her heart-shaped face, sharp cheekbones, and kiss-me lips. Plump, full, and red, those lips begged him to take a bite.</p><p>Her body was slender, but curved in all the right places. And her scent...</p><p>\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t kiss strangers...\u201d His words came out as a growl. \u201cThat\u2019s a real bad habit, princess.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but then said, \u201cDesperate times can call for desperate actions.\u201d</p><p>Those sure weren\u2019t the words he\u2019d expected. He leaned toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Drake Archer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty.\u201d He\u2019d confessed to owning the casino, so her knowing his identity wasn\u2019t exactly a huge surprise. He\u2019d made headlines in the Vegas press when he opened the Archer\u2019s Arrow Casino a month before. He owned four other casinos, but three of them were in Biloxi, Mississippi, and his biggest place was in New Orleans.</p><p>He was already jonesing for a trip back to the Big Easy. That place had become home for him.</p><p>And I\u2019ll be heading home very soon.</p><p>She smiled up at him. Her smile took him off-guard because he hadn\u2019t anticipated the woman\u2019s dimples. Cute, curving dimples that winked on either side of her mouth.</p><p>The lady was sexy. She had deep, dark, bedroom eyes. Curves that made him hard.</p><p>And...a damn cute smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks for being my hero tonight, Drake Archer.\u201d</p><p>He had to laugh at that. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m not exactly hero material.\u201d He was more used to playing the villain of the piece.</p><p>She was still touching him. He was far too aware of her touch. He could actually feel the warmth of her hand through his suit coat. What was up with that?</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kiss him?\u201d Wait, shit, had he just asked that question?</p><p>Her head tilted a little to the right as she studied him. \u201cYou were watching me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. She already knew he\u2019d been watching from upstairs. She\u2019d crooked that finger, after all.</p><p>And here I am.</p><p>His shoulders stiffened as he stepped away from her.</p><p>She blinked a few times, appearing a bit lost.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d wanted to get fucked...\u201d he said, and it wasn\u2019t hard to make his voice cold and unemotional. Plenty of folks said that ice water ran through his veins, not blood. \u201cThen all you had to do was ask.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted in surprise, but she didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Fair enough. Drake gave a little nod. He\u2019d never been the sort to ask twice. He also wasn\u2019t the romancing kind. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe for the rest of the night. My men won\u2019t let that guy get within fifty feet of the Arrow.\u201d But now it was time for him to leave. He\u2019d thought that getting close to her would satisfy his curiosity. He\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Instead of being satisfied, he wanted to learn more about her.</p><p>Drake knew that was a definite sign he needed to back off. He eased to the side. Straightened his coat. And took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just...going to leave me now?\u201d</p><p>She had a faint accent in her voice. There one second, gone the next. Definitely something from the West. Maybe Texas? There were times when Drake\u2019s voice slipped, too, and he let his southern accent roll out with a hard rumble.</p><p>That usually happened when he was angry. Or aroused.</p><p>\u201cHead back into the club,\u201d he told her and he didn\u2019t look back as he began to make his way toward the elevator that would take him to his private lounge. \u201cI\u2019ll send orders for the bartender to give you whatever you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I want.\u201d Her voice was soft. Seductive.</p><p>Drake stopped.</p><p>\u201cI-I have to ask, though...is that the way it works?\u201d</p><p>His back teeth clenched.</p><p>\u201cThe ladies you take upstairs to your private room...they all ask?\u201d</p><p>Those women knew the rules going in. Sex. Hot. Fast. Hard. No promises. No ties.</p><p>Ties were the last thing he wanted.</p><p>He turned back to look at her. \u201cYou came to this place looking for me.\u201d</p><p>She backed up a bit.</p><p>He let his lips curl and knew his smile wasn\u2019t going to be reassuring. \u201cBe very careful. You don\u2019t want to play with me.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to scurry away then.</p><p>But her chin notched into the air. \u201cMaybe I do,\u201d she said and her voice made his cock jerk. Sex and sin\u2014that was what she sounded like just then. Taking her time, she walked toward him. He noticed her shoes then. High, black heels. So she wasn\u2019t as tall as he\u2019d thought.</p><p>And those heels were definitely fuck-me shoes. She can keep them on for me, but I don\u2019t want her wearing anything else.</p><p>The vanilla scent teased his nose once more. \u201cI came here looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Ah, a confession.</p><p>\u201cI know you watch from up above, like a king surveying his land.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t like crowds.\u201d A car horn echoed through the garage.</p><p>Why was he still standing there? Why hadn\u2019t he left her already?</p><p>Her hand touched his chest.</p><p>The heat hit him again, rushing right from her hand to his heart.</p><p>And his dick.</p><p>Ah, yes, that would be the reason I haven\u2019t left.</p><p>\u201cI want to go upstairs with you.\u201d She licked her lips, a sensual glide of her little pink tongue. \u201cI need to go up there.\u201d</p><p>He cocked a brow.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m asking, all right?\u201d Her voice was breathy, and he hesitated. Was that quiver from excitement\u2014like he sure wanted to think?</p><p>Or fear?</p><p>Unfortunately, Drake was too well-acquainted with fear.</p><p>But he offered his arm to her. He saw the quick exhale that she gave. That smile of hers flashed again.</p><p>Drake had to reassess then. The smile was disarming with its flashing dimples. But it wasn\u2019t cute, as he\u2019d first thought.</p><p>The woman\u2019s smile was a killer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake!\u201d Wayne Hardin snapped as the two goons dragged him out of the casino\u2019s parking garage.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s your mistake buddy.\u201d Goon Number One shoved him so hard that Wayne stumbled out onto the street. A taxi missed him by about five inches, and the angry horn had him jerking.</p><p>The guards glared at him as Wayne staggered to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou heard the boss,\u201d Goon One said. \u201cStay away from his business.\u201d</p><p>And the guy\u2019s business was now Jasmine? This was a headache he didn\u2019t need.</p><p>He reached inside his coat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d The sharp bark came from both guards.</p><p>Wayne stilled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t reaching for a weapon. You two already patted me down. You know I\u2019m not armed. I was getting my ID!\u201d</p><p>They turned away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bounty hunter! That little redhead who just sucked in your boss\u2014she\u2019s wanted in Texas!\u201d</p><p>The door slammed shut behind them.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch.\u201d Wayne huffed out a hard breath as the lights of Vegas blazed down on him. Bright, blinking lights. So far away from the darkness of his Texas nights. \u201cI hate this town,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He tilted back his head and stared up at the Arrow. Jasmine was in there. Thinking she was all nice and snug. Safe for the night. Safely away from him.</p><p>She was dead wrong.</p><p>He intended to collect on the bounty that was being offered for her. Giving up wasn\u2019t part of his personality.</p><p>Soon enough, she\u2019d be the one tossed into the street. Maybe she thought cuddling close to Drake Archer would offer her some kind of protection.</p><p>Think again, sweetheart.</p><p>He\u2019d be waiting for her ass to hit the street. And when it did...</p><p>You\u2019re mine, Jasmine. He\u2019d take her back to Texas, bound and gagged if necessary.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The door shut behind her with a faint click. Jasmine absolutely didn\u2019t flinch, but she wanted to, and her muscles ached from stiffness. Her whole body was locked down because she didn\u2019t want to show any weakness in front of Drake.</p><p>I\u2019m here. I just have to take this whole business one step at a time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>His voice rolled over her. Low and hard, a sexy, deep growl that had caught her off-guard when she\u2019d heard him speak in the garage.</p><p>He had caught her off-guard. The shadows had surrounded him. Made Drake appear dark and dangerous. Well, he was dark and dangerous. Tanned skin. Tall and muscled, with broad shoulders that just stretched and stretched.</p><p>Yum.</p><p>\u201cYour name.\u201d</p><p>Crap. She\u2019d just been standing there, staring into his green eyes. Talk about not playing it cool. \u201cJasmine.\u201d</p><p>Wait, she probably should have given him a fake name, but no...that jerk downstairs had called her Jasmine, hadn\u2019t he? It was better to just stick to the truth. A bit, anyway. She forced herself to smile. \u201cLast names aren\u2019t important, are they?\u201d</p><p>Hers was, and she planned to keep her mouth closed about it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like the type.\u201d He headed toward the bar on the right side of the room. There were at least four giant bars downstairs, but the guy had his own stash up there in his private lounge area.</p><p>Someone was overindulged a bit.</p><p>He popped open a champagne bottle. Poured the bubbly into a slender flute, then brought it back to her.</p><p>She took the flute quickly. Gulped down the champagne.</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cNot the type,\u201d he said again, voice musing.</p><p>She was so messing this up. \u201cWhat type is that?\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept over her. Lingered on her breasts. Her hips. Her legs. The green of his eyes seemed to heat, and Jasmine found herself clutching that champagne flute in a too tight grip. So tightly that she was afraid she might just shatter the thing.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t dressed for seduction.\u201d</p><p>Mostly because she didn\u2019t have tons of clothing options at that moment. But, jeez, hadn\u2019t he seen her shoes? Those were kick-ass sexy. She shifted her feet a bit, hoping to draw his attention there.</p><p>His gaze came back to her face. \u201cThief.\u201d</p><p>It was a good thing she\u2019d gulped the champagne. If she\u2019d been lightly sipping right then, Jasmine would\u2019ve choked. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. His smile made her nervous. It was too knowing. And it seemed to hold a threat. Smiles weren\u2019t supposed to be threatening. They were supposed to be warm and reassuring. Apparently Drake had missed the memo on that one.</p><p>He took the empty champagne glass from her hand. His fingers brushed hers. Okay, now the guy was just making it hard for her to breathe. He put the flute down on a nearby table and then his hand came back. Those fingers of his\u2014warm, strong, and slightly callused at the tips\u2014curled under her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re dressed like a jewel thief or a cat burglar.\u201d</p><p>She felt heat sting her cheeks. \u201cKnow a lot about burglars, do you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know you aren\u2019t what you seem, not at all. This isn\u2019t about sex, is it?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine inched closer to him. \u201cKiss me, and find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you said to the jerk downstairs?\u201d Anger hummed in those words.</p> <p>Jasmine shook her head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t just watch...\u201d And wasn\u2019t that exactly what he was doing? Shutting himself away up there and watching the world below?</p><p>She pushed higher onto her toes.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t need to press upward. He was already bending over her. His mouth pressed to hers.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t anything like the kiss downstairs. His mouth was hard, but sensual. He explored her lips. Stroked her, and when she gasped against him, his tongue thrust into her mouth.</p><p>Wow. The guy definitely knew how to kiss. He\u2019s better than I am. A whimper built in her throat. She\u2019d thought\u2014mistakenly, obviously\u2014that she was skilled. Drake was in a whole new category. The make-you-weak-in-the-knees category. Her knees were already jiggling.</p> <p>Her lips parted even more for him\u2014because Jasmine wanted to make sure that she savored this experience. The man\u2019s taste was incredible. Enough to make her feel a little drunk, and, as a rule, Jasmine never got drunk.</p><p>Her hands grasped his shoulders. Her short nails sank into his coat. Her breasts were aching, the nipples tight...just from his kiss.</p><p>He was controlled. Deliberate. He seemed to take his time caressing her, and she liked that. She liked far too much about him.</p><p>A pity, since she\u2019d been sent to betray him.</p><p>His head lifted, and their lips broke apart. She sucked in a breath then, gasping for that last taste of him. A girl had to enjoy her moments when she could. Then she forced her eyes to open.</p><p>There was desire on the hard planes of his face. In the glint of his green eyes. He wanted her, as much as she wanted him. She could certainly feel that proof in the hard thrust of his cock against her.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t speak for a moment. Jasmine normally had plenty to say, but she found that she didn\u2019t want to speak at all in that moment. Maybe because she didn\u2019t want to lie to Drake.</p><p>Maybe because she wished that things were different.</p><p>\u201cUnexpected...\u201d His voice came out as a deep rumble.</p><p>Yes, he certainly was unexpected. Not an easy mark. Not a man to use and forget. More like a man who would haunt her long after she\u2019d slipped from his life.</p><p>She was too conscious then of the watch around her wrist. Jasmine knew she should be monitoring the time. Oh, so carefully, especially because of that little detour she\u2019d been forced to take to the parking garage.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t move. She kept her body against his and kept pretending that she was just a woman who wanted the man before her.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you taste,\u201d Drake told her.</p><p>She could\u2019ve given the same words right back to him, only \u201clike\u201d seemed to be far too tame of a word. She wanted to drink him in, to take more...to take everything that the guy had to give.</p> <p>A faint vibration shook her wrist. Her alarm. Quickly, Jasmine pulled her left hand away from Drake, hoping that he hadn\u2019t felt that slight movement of her watch. But he was still staring at her with the gaze that had gone hard and dark with lust.</p><p>She had a role to play. Jasmine was supposed to smile up at him then, give some flirtatious line, and keep him distracted for a few more minutes. She should have done that, but instead, she heard herself say, \u201cI have a problem. I tend to want what I can never have.\u201d</p><p>Holy hell. Those words had not been on her agenda.</p><p>A faint furrow appeared between his brows. \u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201d</p><p>Right then...you. Jasmine pulled in a deep breath. One more. She tried to steady her racing heartbeat. No luck there. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even have a hotel room in Vegas. It wasn\u2019t a pleasure trip. Just business.</p><p>She was there to destroy Drake.</p><p>The man had no idea just how many enemies he\u2019d made. Or maybe he did know, and he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cWe can have tonight,\u201d she said, lifting her chin before she realized what she was doing. Jasmine could\u2019ve cursed herself for that little \u201cgive.\u201d She\u2019d been warned about it before. She notched her chin when she was scared, and she was never, ever supposed to show fear\u2014not real fear, anyway.</p><p>But Drake\u2019s big, warm hand curled around her waist. \u201cDamn straight,\u201d he said, voice thick with his own hunger. \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy the night.\u201d</p><p>His head lowered toward hers once more.</p><p>His lips were an inch away from hers. A breath of space. Jasmine wanted that space gone.</p><p>A shrill alarm cut through the room. Right on time.</p><p>Drake jerked away from her. \u201cWhat in the hell?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine let surprise flash across her face. \u201cWh-what\u2019s happening?\u201d She rather thought that the tremble in her voice was a lovely touch. \u201cIs that a fire alarm?\u201d Hurrying now, she rushed toward the tinted glass so that she could look down at the crowd. \u201cNo one is moving.\u201d The alarm kept beeping\u2014the sound was making her ears ache. That noise was worse than the music had been. \u201cThey have to hear it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a fire alarm.\u201d Now he was grim. \u201cThose people down there don\u2019t hear anything. It\u2019s a private alarm\u2014a signal just for me and my security team.\u201d</p><p>She whirled toward him and gasped dramatically. \u201cAre you being robbed?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s jaw had locked down as he checked his phone. Got the system linked in there, do you? \u201cThe warning alert is coming from the casino\u2019s vault.\u201d Um, his expression was deadly. \u201cSomeone\u2019s tampering with it.\u201d He rushed for the door.</p><p>Jasmine hurried after him. Now he had his phone to his ear, and the guy was barking orders like mad to whoever was on the other end of that line.</p><p>\u201cNo one screws with my business,\u201d she heard him snap.</p><p>She gulped at that. He had the door open. She was just a step behind him.</p><p>Drake whirled around. The phone was still at his ear, but now he seemed to be focused on her. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, with you?\u201d Wasn\u2019t that obvious?</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cStay here. We\u2019re not done. Not even close.\u201d</p><p>A vault break-in hadn\u2019t stopped the guy from wanting sex?</p><p>His eyes gleamed. \u201cNot even close.\u201d Then he shut the door and vanished.</p><p>Jasmine didn\u2019t move. The alarm stopped after a few more tense seconds, and then she heard nothing. Nothing but her own drumming heartbeat, anyway.</p><p>How long would Drake be gone? And he truly expected her to just sit and wait for him like a good little girl?</p><p>Poor guy. He didn\u2019t realize that she\u2019d never been good. Not really.</p><p>Turning, she let her gaze sweep over the room. Leather couch. Bar. And...</p><p>His desk. His computer.</p><p>Because this place wasn\u2019t just a private lounge. It was his inner sanctuary at the Arrow.</p><p>Jasmine sidled toward that desk. Her avid stare skimmed over its surface. Then she reached down and opened the top drawer. Business papers were inside. Spreadsheets. Profit projections.</p><p>The second drawer contained some mail. One big, brown package had already been opened. She lifted that package. Let the contents spill into her hands.</p><p>But the only thing inside that package was a picture. Black and white. Drake was there...so were two other men. Men she recognized because they were famous and infamous.</p><p>Trace Weston, the man behind Weston Securities. Weston Securities was the biggest private security firm in the U.S. From the rumors she\u2019d heard, Weston had plans to make his firm the biggest in the world.</p><p>The other man she recognized was Noah York, a hotel magnate who\u2019d made headlines because he and his fianc\u00e9e had both barely escaped death a few months before.</p><p>Only he wasn\u2019t engaged any longer. Noah York was married now. She was staring at his wedding picture. Noah was in his tux, and his bride beamed at his side. A woman stood with Trace, too\u2014a delicate ballerina type. Well, that fit since Jasmine knew that Skye Sullivan-Weston was a ballerina.</p><p>In that picture, there was no woman on Drake\u2019s arm. He had a faint smile on his lips, not the wide grin that Noah sported.</p><p>A note was attached to the pic.</p><p>Thanks for being my best man. \u2013N.</p><p>Her hand trembled a bit.</p><p>She pushed the photo back into the package. Shut the desk drawers. Then Jasmine sat behind Drake\u2019s desk. She slipped her equipment from the little case she\u2019d strapped to her ankle.</p><p>Drake had been wrong about her. Well, partially wrong. She wasn\u2019t a jewel thief. Her business was information.</p><p>She stared at the computer. Getting to his computer had been the trick. The rest...it would be easy.</p><p>Jasmine knew that she just had to work fast.</p><p>Her gaze strayed to that second drawer once more.</p><p>Thanks for being my best man. \u2013N.</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, Jasmine went to work.</p><p>\u201cSmoke bombs?\u201d Drake demanded in disgust as he watched the pink flumes\u2014seriously, pink\u2014drift just outside of the vault door. No one had breached the casino\u2019s vault. The guards there had panicked when they saw the smoke. They\u2019d been the ones to pull that alarm and get the whole security team mobilized.</p><p>\u201cLooks like they were on a timer,\u201d Chad Thatcher, Drake\u2019s chief of security said as he lifted one of the little, pink smoke bombs. It wasn\u2019t smoking anymore. \u201cReal clever device...looks handmade.\u201d The guy\u2019s tone was admiring.</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t exactly feel admiration. \u201cSomeone tried to break into my vault.\u201d</p><p>Chad\u2019s lips twisted as he eyed the three nervous guards who\u2019d pulled the alarm. \u201cNot with this thing. This is a prank. Not a threat.\u201d Chad would know threats. Drake had recruited the man because of his diverse background. Swat Team leader. Undercover police officer. Bomb squad technician.</p><p>Yeah, Chad knew his bombs. Very well.</p><p>Chad tossed the little device lightly in his hands. \u201cSomeone was messing with you guys,\u201d he told the flushing guards.</p><p>Drake looked around the room. The other security team members were all starting to relax. The core team had been called in\u2014his strongest men and women, but other guards were still positioned throughout the casino. Just not as many as he normally had at the Arrow. \u201cA distraction,\u201d Drake realized as his gaze turned back to Chad.</p><p>Chad\u2019s fingers closed around the device. The smile left his face. \u201cNo one is stealing your money,\u201d Chad said. \u201cWe\u2019re right here. No one is getting past us.\u201d</p><p>Drake whirled away from him. Sexy jewel thief. \u201cThat\u2019s because she\u2019s busy stealing something else.\u201d Dammit, he should have known better. A pretty face could hide the best lies.</p><p>He ran for the elevator. \u201cGet a lockdown in place!\u201d Drake shouted over his shoulder. \u201cThe redhead I took upstairs earlier\u2014Jasmine\u2014she doesn\u2019t leave the premises.\u201d</p><p>There was no way that woman was going to escape from him.</p><p>Jasmine backed away from the computer. She knew time was running out and she had to make her exit.</p><p>The thick carpeting swallowed the sounds of her footsteps. She reached for the door handle.</p><p>Only it didn\u2019t turn beneath her hand.</p><p>Jasmine jerked it harder. No give at all. He locked me in? She hadn\u2019t exactly counted on that part. And she was sure looking at a maximum lock, too, not the easy pick-me-in-a-moment variety.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Drake\u2019s image flashed before her mind. Stay here. We\u2019re not done. Not even close.</p><p>The only window in that place overlooked the club. It wasn\u2019t like she could jump through it.</p><p>Her fingers skimmed over the lock once more. She\u2019d wrangled the invitation up to this room because she knew that guards watched the entrance to this private lounge. The only way up to the area was Drake\u2019s elevator and once up there, she would\u2019ve had to contend with the lock. If she\u2019d stopped to work her wiles on the lock in order to gain entrance, a guard would\u2019ve seen her.</p><p>But the guards are distracted, and I\u2019m not on the outside. So she should be able to finesse that lock, no problem.</p><p>It was an electronic lock after all. She\u2019d always had a knack for working electronics.</p><p>A few seconds later, the lock slid open. \u201cPiece of cake,\u201d Jasmine murmured as she slid her little packet of tools back into place on her ankle once more. Her fingers slipped around the door knob. The door opened with a soft click.</p><p>Jasmine grinned. She pulled open the door\u2014and found herself staring right up into a pair of glinting green eyes. Very, very, angry green eyes.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d Drake drawled. Ah, there it was. The hint of the south, Mississippi if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, rolled beneath those two words.</p><p>Her heartbeat sounded like a drum in her ears. \u201cI was coming to find you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. She did not like that smile. Goosebumps rose onto her arms.</p><p>He stepped forward.</p><p>Jasmine fell back.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you should know about me,\u201d Drake said as he took another stalking step toward her.</p><p>Jasmine found herself retreating again even as her chin notched up.</p><p>Stupid move. She had to learn how to control that chin move.</p><p>He shut the door behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars, Jasmine.\u201d</p><p>I am so screwed. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking hate betrayal.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>His hands lifted. His hold was hard and tight as he grasped her shoulders and pulled her up against him. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me.\u201d Total truth there. A lot of Drake\u2019s past had been shrouded in secrecy, and when she started searching online in order to learn more about him, she\u2019d come across some strong government security measures. She could\u2019ve hacked past the red tape, of course, but she hadn\u2019t wanted to raise too many flags with Uncle Sam\u2014or anyone else who might have been watching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With his hold still tight on her, he pushed her back against the nearby wall. \u201cYour name,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>\u201cJasmine!\u201d She gave it willingly enough, just as she had before. Her first name would mean nothing to him.</p><p>\u201cLast name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBennett.\u201d He had no reaction to her name. Awesome. Fantastic. Now to get out...Jasmine shook her head. \u201cWhat is happening here?\u201d She huffed out a hard breath and tried to look properly insulted. \u201cBecause if this is your idea of seduction, buddy, then we are totally not compatible. I was thinking we\u2019d enjoy a few hot hours...\u201d</p><p>His hold loosened and she yanked away from him. Since her back was against the wall, though, there wasn\u2019t exactly any place for her to go.</p><p>\u201cBut I never thought I\u2019d have to deal with a psychotic episode.\u201d Jasmine drew herself up, straightening her spine but not, not notching up her chin. \u201cI want to leave now.\u201d</p><p>One golden brow rose. \u201cThe cameras caught you.\u201d</p><p>Liar. When she\u2019d set her timers earlier, she\u2019d made sure no cameras were close by. This wasn\u2019t amateur hour. \u201cCaught me doing what? Having a drink at the bar?\u201d She lifted her hands before her, trying to appear innocent and confused. \u201cGood for the cameras.\u201d She tried to sidle around him.</p> <p>But Drake\u2019s hand flew out and he grabbed her wrist. \u201cThe cameras in here, princess.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sank. She\u2019d done a quick sweep for cameras in this room. There hadn\u2019t exactly been time for a thorough search. She hadn\u2019t seen any, so she\u2019d hoped... Jasmine cleared her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of joke you\u2019re trying to pull here, but it\u2019s not funny.\u201d Maybe he was bluffing about the cameras, just to see her reaction. She\u2019d keep playing the injured party a bit longer and see how that worked for her. If she could just get to the door...</p><p>Wait, does he have his security team waiting in that hallway? And if they weren\u2019t in that narrow hallway, would they be waiting for her at the elevator?</p><p>It was just not her night.</p><p>She tried to break away from him again, but he moved in a flash. He twisted his body, twisted her, and in the next moment, Jasmine found herself pinned to the wall. He was in front of her, solid, unmovable, furious. He\u2019d pushed her wrists back against the wall, and he glared down at her.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like things a little rough,\u201d she tossed that out, hoping to distract him.</p> <p>His pupils seemed to swallow the green of his eyes. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>That response got right past her guard. Her mouth dropped open and\u2014and his hands flew over her body.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Jasmine shouted at him. \u201cYou have no right to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Search her? Yes, dammit, that was exactly what he was doing. She recognized a pat-down when she felt one. She\u2019d had her share of brushes with the law over the years. When you were on your own at fifteen, staying on the right side of the law wasn\u2019t always an option.</p><p>She tried to shove his hands away.</p><p>It was like shoving away steel.</p><p>\u201cSo I poked around your desk,\u201d she told him, getting a little desperate now. \u201cI was curious about you, okay? I\u2019m not curious anymore. Not even a little bit. I\u2019ve learned from my mistakes. I am not\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled near her left ankle.</p> <p>Hell.</p><p>He lifted the leg of her pants. She felt the pull of the strap that held her gear set in place.</p><p>Then he rose to his feet.</p><p>She tried to grab his hand.</p><p>Too late. He\u2019d opened his prize. He stared down at the lock picking set.</p><p>She never left home without one of those.</p><p>There was a flash drive nestled beside the lock set, too. Make that three flash drives. Some wires. A very small screw driver.</p><p>Tools of her trade.</p><p>\u201cJasmine...\u201d He sighed out her name as his gaze came back to her. \u201cI think we have a problem.\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed in his jaw.</p><p>I fucking hate betrayal.</p><p>Her body trembled. He was a businessman, despite those somewhat shady governmental ties. He wasn\u2019t just going to\u2014to\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou came to steal from me, and now you\u2019re going to have to pay the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal from you!\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. His laugh was rough and angry and it sure didn\u2019t alleviate any of the tension that she felt.</p><p>His face was locked in hard, furious lines. Rage glowed in his eyes. He looked scary as hell and\u2014</p><p>Sexy, still.</p><p>What was with her and her stupid attraction to bad boys? Would she never learn that bad boys were considered \u201cbad\u201d for a reason?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal,\u201d Jasmine repeated. \u201cCheck the flash drives. Nothing is on them. I came up here to be with you, not to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you still want to fuck me?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine licked her lips.</p><p>His gaze immediately fell to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTempting...\u201d And his head lowered. Before she could speak again, his mouth was on hers. Hot and hard. Not as controlled as before. Actually, there was no control now. The kiss was wild and rough, and if she\u2019d thought her toes curled before, well\u2014she nearly lost her shoes then.</p><p>Liquid heat spilled through her body. She wasn\u2019t supposed to react to him that way. She wasn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>His head lifted. \u201cCause I can always fuck you before I call in the cops.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned to slits at that.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m wondering about the guy I tossed outside,\u201d he nearly growled those words. \u201cMaybe I was too hasty. Maybe I should\u2019ve listened to just what the fellow had to say.\u201d</p><p>Then the cops would already be here.</p><p>\u201cCheck the flash drives,\u201d Jasmine said. Her voice was husky, but steady. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the truth.\u201d</p><p>His eyes held hers. \u201cHow do I know you haven\u2019t hidden more drives...?\u201d Now his gaze dropped to her body once more.</p><p>\u201cBecause you already searched me, jerk.\u201d She shoved against him. Hard. Hard enough to send him stumbling back a step. Not because she\u2019d gotten some super strength, but mostly because she was pretty sure the move had caught him by surprise.</p><p>How do I get out of here...how do I get...</p><p>He turned away from her. Stalked toward his desk. She didn\u2019t move as he searched through the flash drives. Jasmine was too busy trying to figure out what story to give him.</p><p>She even considered the truth. Like he\u2019d believe that.</p><p>His fingers rapped over the keys. \u201cThey\u2019re empty. All of them.\u201d He straightened.</p><p>She gave a firm nod. \u201cLike I said. Now, as un-fun as this little night has been, it\u2019s time for me to leave.\u201d</p><p>His head tilted a bit as he studied her. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to let you get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything to you. So I carry a lock picking set. Big deal.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t like to get locked out\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. It wasn\u2019t the hard laugh from before. It was more surprised, more real.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken nothing from you,\u201d Jasmine said, knowing that she sounded like a broken record. He had no idea how much that non-theft was going to cost her. But she was trying to be good. It was a fairly new thing for her. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t steal anything, but I am leaving.\u201d She turned, took some fast steps, and reached for the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cYou planted the smoke bombs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d She didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a thief...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took nothing from you.\u201d She had the door open and a quick peek showed her that\u2014thank goodness\u2014there wasn\u2019t a whole security team waiting to drag her away in that little hallway.</p><p>She stepped over the threshold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just going to let you slip away.\u201d</p><p>Try to stop me. \u201cIt\u2019s better this way. Meeting you...it certainly was interesting.\u201d Scary, too.</p><p>She marched forward. Her heels sank into the carpet. She thought he\u2019d grab her again. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>She didn\u2019t break and run, though she sure wanted to do that. She walked away, real nice and slow, totally not like a thief running in the night.</p><p>Even though he was right. That was exactly what she was.</p><p>Probably all she\u2019d ever be.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t steal from him.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t even sure why she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s fingers reached out for the elevator. She\u2019d memorized his security code when he typed it in earlier, so getting those doors to open wasn\u2019t hard.</p><p>Now to just get out of here...</p><p>Even before Jasmine had left the room, Drake had a security team trailing her. \u201cWatch her,\u201d he barked into his phone. A few clicks of his computer had given him access to the club\u2019s security footage. Her image was currently on his screen. He was following her, without stepping a single foot outside of his sanctuary.</p><p>Did the woman really think he\u2019d just let her vanish? No, not happening.</p><p>But he had wanted privacy to view the video footage...and he\u2019d also wanted to see just where her grand exit would take the lovely Jasmine. Maybe she would lead him straight to a partner that she had waiting in the wings...</p><p>\u201cKeep a tail on her until I say otherwise,\u201d Drake added. This wasn\u2019t over. But he was willing to give the woman a false sense of security...the better to make her vulnerable for his attack.</p><p>Betrayal.</p><p>It burned like acid within him. He\u2019d been betrayed too many times in the past. Another pretty face, another woman ready to wreck him.</p><p>Jasmine wasn\u2019t running away. No blind flight for freedom from her. Instead, she was strolling slowly, appearing to take her sweet time as she left him.</p><p>He tapped on his keyboard again, accessing the security footage for this room. He rewound the images, determined to see exactly what Jasmine had been doing in his office. He wasn\u2019t a fool\u2014he\u2019d deliberately started the recording as soon as he\u2019d left his office. A quick tap on his phone had triggered the hidden camera.</p><p>Jasmine filled his computer screen. In that video, she walked toward his desk. She opened the drawers. Pulled out the package that his buddy Noah had sent to him. Stared at the photograph.</p><p>Her expression tightened as she stared at that image, and longing flashed in her eyes.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Jasmine put the photo and the package back in the drawer. She pulled out one of her flash drives. She pushed it into the computer.</p><p>She glanced back at the shut drawer.</p><p>She pulled the photo out for a second time.</p><p>Then she gave a hard, negative shake of her head.</p><p>She yanked out her flash drive. Didn\u2019t access any of his files.</p><p>She didn\u2019t steal from me.</p><p>In the video, Jasmine rose quickly. She hurried toward the door\u2014and when she realized he\u2019d locked her in, the woman used her lock-picking set and had that door open in seconds.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t been able to flee. He\u2019d been there.</p><p>Frowning now, Drake opened his desk and pulled out the package Noah had sent to him.</p><p>Both of his best friends were married now. Both claimed to be deliriously happy.</p><p>Both were fools, of course. And they were too obsessed with their women. They\u2019d risked their lives for their ladies, and Drake had seen their desperation.</p><p>Noah York and Trace Weston. His friends in battle. His friends through blood and death.</p><p>They were smiling in the picture. He was, too, and for once, the smile hadn\u2019t been forced.</p><p>His gaze swept the image. Just what had Jasmine seen in that picture? Whatever the hell it was, she\u2019d changed her plans because of it.</p><p>He had no doubt that she\u2019d come to the Arrow in order to steal secrets from him. Intel. But she\u2019d left with nothing.</p><p>The phone on his desk began to vibrate. Noah grabbed it and put it to his ear. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d Drake said because he\u2019d recognized Chad\u2019s number on the screen.</p><p>He heard the head of security inhale sharply. Oh, the hell, no.</p><p>\u201cSir, I, um, the team on her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me that she\u2019s in their sights right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey thought she was just heading to the bar, but in the crowd, she slipped away from them and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need to call in the authorities? Did she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo authorities. She\u2019s mine.\u201d His hand was too tight around the phone. \u201cNow get out there...find her.\u201d</p><p>He rewound the image on his screen. Froze it at the moment when Jasmine first stared down at the photograph.</p><p>The longing on her face was so strong. Longing. Sadness.</p><p>That woman was a mystery. He headed for the door. She only had a few moments lead on him.</p><p>And he never let his prey escape.</p><p>The Arrow\u2019s goons had no idea how to deal with a woman like Jasmine Bennett.</p><p>But Wayne did. So he wasn\u2019t waiting for her near the hotel\u2019s main entrance. He was in the back. In the alley. And when Jasmine slipped out, joining with the shadows, he was right on her trail.</p><p>The woman was good, he\u2019d give her that.</p><p>But he was better.</p><p>He reached into his pocket. While he\u2019d been waiting, he\u2019d taken the liberty of getting a few things from his car. The handcuffs would definitely come in handy. And if she fought, he\u2019d have to use the knife, too.</p><p>He smiled as he followed Jasmine into the darkness.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Jasmine knew she was being followed. Unfortunately, her list of enemies just kept growing and growing, so she wasn\u2019t exactly sure who might be shadowing her through Vegas.</p><p>The city had too many lights. Way too many. She stuck to the shadows as best as she could, and she hunched her shoulders each time she heard a voice floating on the wind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d made it at least a mile from the Arrow. In her heels. Damn impressive\u2014especially considering the path she\u2019d taken.</p><p>Jasmine wanted to jump toward the main strip, hail a taxi, and get out of there but\u2014</p><p>Someone is following me.</p> <p>At this point in her life, she knew better than to ignore her instincts. And the tenseness at the base of her neck, that too-aware intensity, it told her that she was being followed through those Vegas alleyways.</p><p>Was it that bozo who claimed to be a bounty hunter? Like she believed that BS.</p><p>Was it Drake\u2019s security guards? Drake?</p><p>No, she discarded that idea almost immediately. Drake wouldn\u2019t bother coming after her himself. If he\u2019d had cameras in that room, like the guy claimed, then he would\u2019ve watched them by now and seen that she hadn\u2019t taken anything.</p><p>So that left her with option three...the man who\u2019d put her on Drake\u2019s trail...he could be the one in the shadows. She did not want to come face to face with him. Especially since she had to let the guy know that she hadn\u2019t managed to get the information he wanted.</p> <p>Her back brushed against a brick wall. She strained, trying to listen desperately for a sign of her pursuer. But the fellow was good. She\u2019d give him that. No rustles. No heaving breaths. No\u2014</p><p>\u201cGot you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The rough words came from her left. Jasmine rushed forward as the dark form of a man pulled away from the shadows.</p><p>The bounty hunter. Something was glinting in his right hand. She didn\u2019t know if that glint was from handcuffs or from a knife, and Jasmine wasn\u2019t in the mood to find out.</p><p>She kicked off her shoes and sprinted for the safety of that main Vegas strip.</p><p>The pavement bit into the bottom of her feet, and she heard the bounty hunter huffing behind her. Ah, now there was the huffing breath. If only he\u2019d given away that sound earlier!</p> <p>Jasmine jumped from the shadows and ran for the brightly lit street. Horns honked. Cars whizzed past. She only had a few seconds lead on the guy. She raised her hand. \u201cTaxi\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand and whirled her around in his arms. Jasmine was pretty sure that she felt the sharp tip of a knife shove into her side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away this time.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned, and her eyes met his. Even in the darkness, she could see the evil twist of his lips.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s gonna save you now, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>That was the story of her life. Good thing she\u2019d learned to save herself.</p><p>The knife pricked her side. Jasmine gasped.</p><p>\u201cThis time, you\u2019ll pay.\u201d</p> <p>Jasmine.</p><p>Drake saw her, on the side of the street. A taxi was pulling away from the curb, as if she\u2019d just tried to hail it.</p><p>She was in a man\u2019s arms. It was too dark for Drake to see the man\u2019s face, but a nearby street lamp spilled light right onto Jasmine\u2019s dark red hair. He saw the back of her head, but he knew it was her. Same dark clothes. Same tempting thief.</p><p>He jerked his steering wheel to the side, parking as quickly as he could.</p><p>Jasmine and the man were rushing away. The guy glanced back, and Drake caught a glimpse of his face then.</p><p>The jerk from my club.</p><p>Had he been working with Jasmine all along? Were the two running a scam together?</p><p>Only...Jasmine was fighting with the guy. Struggling against him.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Drake shouted as he hurried after them.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s head whipped back. The man didn\u2019t stop, though. He started rushing forward even harder, nearly dragging Jasmine with him.</p><p>Jasmine drove her fist into the guy\u2019s face.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>They were heading for the alley, and Drake raced into that darkness too. He wasn\u2019t just\u2014</p><p>\u201cMan, you need to back off.\u201d</p><p>Drake stilled. He couldn\u2019t see the guy, but he had caught the flash of light. A knife. The SOB had a knife pressed to Jasmine\u2019s side.</p><p>Fury pumped through Drake. \u201cLet the woman go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before...\u201d The man inched forward a bit, and the blade of the knife glinted even more. What had been the jerk\u2019s name? Hardin. Wayne Hardin. \u201cI\u2019m not letting her just get away again. She\u2019s a wanted woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have a knife to her side. Drop it.\u201d Or Drake would drop that bastard.</p><p>But Hardin just shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s her eyes, isn\u2019t it? You aren\u2019t the first dumbass to get pulled in by them. She looks all innocent, then you blink, and that innocence is gone. If you gave her the chance, she\u2019d rob you blind, just like she did to the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me...\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice was so low that Drake had to strain in order to hear it. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to explain before,\u201d Hardin said, his words rolling right over her soft plea, \u201cbut you didn\u2019t give me a chance. I\u2019m a bounty hunter. She\u2019s wanted in Texas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Jasmine said, sounding desperate.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I\u2019m taking her back. I\u2019m gonna collect on everything that\u2019s owed to me.\u201d</p><p>A bounty hunter? Interesting. Drake braced his legs apart. He kept his hands loose at his sides. \u201cThe first thing you\u2019re going to do is drop the knife.\u201d</p><p>Hardin laughed. \u201cSeriously? Dumbass, we\u2019re not in your casino anymore...\u201d He pushed forward, coming more into the light, but carefully staying away from the street. So no one else will see you\u2019re a bastard with a knife against a woman\u2019s side. \u201cYour goons aren\u2019t here, and a useless playboy like you sure doesn\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><p>Drake almost smiled at that. He was far, far from useless, especially in a fight. He\u2019d seen more blood and death than Hardin could imagine.</p><p>\u201cFirst, you drop the knife,\u201d Drake said. \u201cThen you let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never letting her get away\u2014she\u2019s gonna be my payday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...\u201d Drake said, because he wanted to be clear. \u201cI\u2019m going to hurt you. Because I think you hurt her.\u201d That knife was far too close to Jasmine\u2019s side. He knew the fool had cut her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to pay for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked her,\u201d Hardin said with certainty. \u201cYou fell for the eyes, you fucked her, and now you want more just like\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jasmine drove her elbow back into the guy\u2019s stomach. He grunted and his hold eased on her. When his hold eased, Jasmine shot forward, rushing right toward Drake.</p><p>She ran straight into his arms.</p><p>And she seemed to...fit.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch...\u201d Hardin snarled as he leapt after her.</p><p>Drake pushed Jasmine behind his back. He kept his focus on Hardin. \u201cI told you what to do...I gave you a chance...\u201d Now he\u2019d just take care of things. His way.</p><p>Hardin lunged at him. The guy still had the knife in his hand. A quick chop and Drake sent that knife falling from what he knew were Hardin\u2019s now numb fingers.</p><p>First order...drop the knife.</p><p>Drake kicked the knife aside. \u201cBounty hunters don\u2019t drive a knife into women. That\u2019s not the way their business works.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine was silent behind him.</p><p>\u201cDid he cut you?\u201d Drake demanded without taking his gaze off his current prey.</p><p>Hardin swung at him then, a left hook that Drake easily caught\u2014and held\u2014in his fist.</p><p>\u201cJ-just a little...\u201d Jasmine whispered back.</p><p>\u201cA little is too much.\u201d Drake slammed his forehead into Hardin\u2019s. The guy stumbled back, and Drake let loose then. His hits made instant contact, they were brutal in their intensity, and in seconds, Hardin was on the ground. He was\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Jasmine was in front of Drake. His fist was up, ready to strike again.</p><p>But he\u2019d never hit her.</p><p>And no one else will, either.</p><p>He shook his head as that thought snaked through his mind.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fight. You need to get out of here.\u201d Jasmine looked back down at Hardin. The guy was rising to his feet. \u201cJust leave him here.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cHe attacked you with a knife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just beat the shit out of him.\u201d Her voice lowered and he was pretty sure he heard her mutter, \u201cScary. So didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her scared of him. Wait...what the fuck is happening here?</p><p>Her hand went to her side. He grabbed that hand and felt the warmth of her blood on his fingertips. Fury spiked through him. \u201cThat beating is just getting started.\u201d She\u2019d lied to him. It wasn\u2019t a little cut. The guy had sliced her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jasmine said. Her fingers tangled with his. \u201cJust get me out of here, okay?\u201d</p><p>Hardin was on his feet. Not advancing. But backing up.</p><p>Drake pulled Jasmine closer to his body. \u201cYou\u2019re no bounty hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck my ID, check\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to see your fake ID. No bounty hunter in his right mind would use a knife on a woman. I\u2019ll call the cops and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hardin laughed. \u201cHero, you don\u2019t even know the game that\u2019s being played.\u201d</p><p>Game. \u201cI know that in any game, I win.\u201d</p><p>Hardin backed deeper into the shadows.</p><p>\u201cI warned you before to stay away from her. You didn\u2019t listen.\u201d Drake was pretty sure he\u2019d broken the guy\u2019s nose. Good. \u201cI\u2019m not warning you again.\u201d And he also wasn\u2019t done. He was going to\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one who\u2019ll be coming for you.\u201d Hardin was still retreating and still making threats. \u201cGet ready, hero. Get. Ready.\u201d</p><p>Then Hardin turned and fled into the darkness. Drake heard the sound of his pounding footsteps and he wanted to rush after the guy, but he knew that the second he gave chase, Jasmine would vanish.</p><p>His hand still held hers. That was probably the only reason she hadn\u2019t already run from him.</p><p>He stared into the darkness, listening to those fleeing footsteps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jasmine said, her voice as soft as a breath.</p><p>He gazed down at her. Her head was bent.</p><p>\u201cI-I got blood on you.\u201d</p><p>He caught her chin with his left hand. Forced her head to rise, but in the darkness, he couldn\u2019t read her expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again, then softer, \u201cfor everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie, princess.\u201d</p><p>Then he was pulling her from that alley. The light of the strip seemed even brighter as he hustled her into his car.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m bleeding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t get you some help, you\u2019re gonna keep bleeding.\u201d She would need stitches. He\u2019d take her to a doctor. Then he\u2019d get his answers. Drake hurried around the car. It was a sleek, sexy ride. A black Porsche that could cut right through the night. The seats were leather and\u2014</p><p>And now the car smelled of vanilla.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t go to a hospital. They\u2019ll ask questions. Questions that I can\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened around the steering wheel. \u201cAre you wanted in Texas?\u201d Had that part been true?</p><p>\u201cNot by the cops.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t quite a full answer, now, was it?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch,\u201d Jasmine said, her voice a little stronger. \u201cI can slap some bandages on it and be fine.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful. \u201cYou\u2019re still bleeding.\u201d That bastard had wanted to hurt her. He had.</p><p>And I want to destroy him.</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath. Another. What in the hell was happening to him? Sure, control was never actually his strong suit, but wanting to pound a man into the ground?</p><p>Not...me.</p><p>Drake turned his head and stared at Jasmine. She wasn\u2019t looking at him. Her eyes were on the alley.</p><p>\u201cJasmine.\u201d He liked her name. Sexy. Feminine. Drake liked the way her name rolled off his tongue.</p><p>Her head turned. Her hair slid over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIf the cops aren\u2019t after you, who is?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip.</p><p>He wanted to be the one doing that biting.</p><p>You fucked her. You fell for the eyes, you fucked her, and now you want more just like\u2014</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jasmine told him.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving me. That doesn\u2019t happen a lot for me.\u201d</p><p>He cranked the car. The engine immediately purred to life.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The word seemed to be a bit hard for her to say. Interesting. \u201cDon\u2019t...don\u2019t take me to a hospital. I\u2019m staying in a motel just outside of town. Just drop me off there, and I\u2019ll vanish from your life. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He pulled into traffic. He was far too aware of her next to him.</p><p>\u201cIf you turn right at the next intersection, you\u2019ll be able to get back to my motel.\u201d</p><p>Drake stared at the road ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cThe turn is here,\u201d Jasmine said, her voice breaking a bit. From pain? From fear? \u201cYou should go right\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t go right.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you turn? I told you, I\u2019d vanish. I won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p><p>She was already bothering him plenty. He should drop her off at the nearest hospital. Get on a plane and head down to New Orleans. Find another woman and forget about her. But he heard himself say, \u201cYou\u2019re not vanishing.\u201d</p><p>The Porsche accelerated.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t done with Jasmine yet. She wasn\u2019t going any place, not until he\u2019d figured out just who had sent her into his life...and why the sight of a wedding picture had made her nearly crumble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dammit. Wayne slammed his car door shut. He turned the key, but the old engine didn\u2019t spark to life. Not on try number two or three. On the fourth try, the thing finally sputtered to life.</p><p>Good.</p><p>He had a meeting, one that he was way overdue for, and the boss sure wasn\u2019t going to like the news that Wayne had to share.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t have Jasmine.</p><p>And Drake Archer did.</p><p>Wayne swiped his hand over his face. His nose throbbed like a bitch. He\u2019d be sure to pay Archer back for those blows. So he\u2019d cut Jasmine a bit. Wasn\u2019t like it was the first time she\u2019d been roughed up. He\u2019d read her file. The woman spent most of her nights on the wrong side of town and with the wrong people.</p><p>Archer had enemies. Plenty of them. Did the fool even realize how intimately connected Jasmine was with those who wanted the casino mogul taken down?</p><p>\u201cThe bigger they are...\u201d Wayne muttered. The more they should suffer when they fall.</p> <p>Drake drove through the heavy gates that led to his estate. A new acquisition, much like the Arrow. Drake didn\u2019t like staying in hotels. That was his buddy Noah\u2019s bit. Hell, hotels were Noah\u2019s life. Drake needed privacy. A sanctuary away from the rest of the world.</p><p>Guards waved to him from their post at the gate.</p><p>\u201cUh, want to tell me what\u2019s happening?\u201d Jasmine's voice was low.</p><p>He pulled up near the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cDrake.\u201d Now anger vibrated in her voice. \u201cAnswer me. You\u2019ve been dead silent the whole drive. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>He killed the ignition and slowly turned to face her. \u201cYou said no hospitals, so I brought you here.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd you know it\u2019s my house. The way I figure it, you must have conducted some research on me. So I\u2019m sure you recognize this place.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t deny the charge. Instead, Jasmine asked, \u201cWhy would you bring me to your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean...why would I trust you enough to let you inside? Princess, it\u2019s not about trust. Because I don\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>He caught the faint flicker of her eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cYou know I made a phone call on the way here.\u201d She\u2019d asked who he called, but he hadn\u2019t told her. He\u2019d been too pissed for much talking. Pissed at her, at Wayne, at himself. Why am I keeping her so close? \u201cA friend of mine is waiting inside for you.\u201d</p><p>He slid from the car. She didn\u2019t move. He hurried around to her side of the vehicle. When he opened her door, the Porsche\u2019s interior light came on, and as the illumination poured down onto Jasmine, he realized that she\u2019d turned pale. The gold of her skin was a pallor that he didn\u2019t like.</p><p>Drake reached for her.</p><p>She pulled back. \u201cIs this...friend...a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure have some cop issues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>She rose from the car. Swayed a bit. He grabbed her, and she just felt so slight in his arms. He\u2019d noticed it before. A delicacy that he didn\u2019t expect. Back at the Arrow, she\u2019d seemed full of energy and life, but when he\u2019d touched her, Drake had thought...I have to be careful.</p><p>\u201cIs the friend a cop or not?\u201d</p><p>Then her knees buckled.</p><p>He held her easily. Lifted her into his arms. \u201cDammit, you\u2019re worse than you said! You need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let...anyone take me away.\u201d</p><p>He hurried up the steps. The front door opened as if on cue for him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something I didn\u2019t expect to see...\u201d An amused voice drawled from the doorway.</p><p>Drake\u2019s hold tightened around Jasmine. \u201cHe\u2019s not a cop. He\u2019s a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA doctor who had other plans for the night,\u201d Carson Thorn muttered as he stepped out of the doorway. \u201cI left one very hot blonde in the lurch, and you so owe me for that.\u201d</p><p>Drake grunted. Carson could be an ass, but he was one useful commodity. Drake had discovered early on that it paid to have connections\u2014legal, social, and medical. In Drake\u2019s world, there were plenty of times when a doctor\u2019s services were needed.</p><p>Jasmine isn\u2019t the only one who doesn\u2019t always trust the cops.</p><p>He had an agreement with Carson. Carson took care of Drake\u2019s employees and any...unusual situations that might occur. And Carson kept a fat bank account.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your bedroom set up for her.\u201d Carson waved his hand down the hallway. \u201cStandard rate will apply, of course.\u201d</p><p>Drake carried Jasmine down the hallway. He carefully arranged her on the bed, and when he pulled back, he saw her blinking groggily. Hell, had the woman passed out for a few moments? Just how much blood had she lost? His hand went to the hem of her shirt. Blood was thick on her side, soaking the material.</p><p>She tried to bat his hands away.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to sedate her?\u201d Carson asked. He already had a syringe in his hand.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s head turned at his voice. Her eyes widened. Sounding utterly horrified, she demanded, \u201cWhy is a GQ model coming at me with a needle?\u201d</p><p>Carson flushed a dark red.</p><p>Drake laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s the doctor, and he\u2019s coming at you because he\u2019s worried you won\u2019t stay calm while he sews you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay calm.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNot my first time...to be stitched.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed at that. \u201cYou get sliced up a lot?\u201d</p><p>Carson put down the syringe. He arranged his instruments, and then his gloved hands reached for Jasmine\u2019s shirt. He cut the shirt away when it stuck to her.</p><p>Drake\u2019s teeth clenched as he got a look at the damage. That was sure no little scrape. \u201cHe wanted to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t like being out\u2014outsmarted at the Arrow.\u201d She hissed out a breath when Carson started probing her wound, but her eyes didn\u2019t leave Drake\u2019s face. \u201cIt was his payback.\u201d</p><p>Carson was carefully cleaning the wound. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna need about five, maybe six stitches. Not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I\u2019ve seen a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I,\u201d Drake said. Back when he\u2019d been in the military, he\u2019d seen images so brutal and bloody that they still chased him into his nightmares. And after he\u2019d left duty, well, his business dealings hadn\u2019t exactly gotten any prettier.</p><p>His gaze slid over Jasmine\u2019s wound, then up...almost helplessly. She still had on a bra, a black, lacy thing that pushed up her breasts. Fabulous breasts. She was hurt and weak and he shouldn\u2019t be noticing them but he did and\u2014</p><p>\u201cAt least this side will match the other,\u201d Carson said, voice droll. \u201cGuess someone likes to play with knives, huh?\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s attention immediately shifted to her left side. Sure-damn-enough, there was a faint white scar there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who plays.\u201d Her voice was quiet. \u201cI\u2019m the one who has the bad luck to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>His gaze came back to rest on her face.</p><p>Her eyes were waiting for him. So dark and deep.</p><p>\u201cTurn more onto your left side,\u201d Carson instructed her. \u201cI need a good angle for the needle.\u201d</p><p>She started to turn. Drake quickly leaned forward. His hands eased her over and, once she was positioned for Carson, he didn\u2019t let her go. Her skin was so soft and warm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>\u201cYou sure that you don\u2019t want something for the pain?\u201d Carson asked her.</p><p>\u201cI hate drugs.\u201d Her stare still held Drake\u2019s. \u201cNever touch them. Alcohol is as far as I will go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you want some booze to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Jasmine said, cutting through Carson\u2019s words. \u201cOr else I might be passing out again soon. I hate the sight of blood. Especially when it\u2019s my own.\u201d</p><p>Carson went to work. Jasmine sucked in a sharp breath and her hand flew out.</p><p>Her fingers, still marked by her blood, locked around Drake\u2019s. She held him tightly. Tighter than anyone had ever held him before. As if he were her lifeline.</p><p>When he wasn\u2019t. He was more like her destruction.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she get sliced?\u201d Carson asked as he leaned over.</p><p>Drake shook his head. \u201cYou know the drill. You don\u2019t get to ask questions.\u201d Mostly because the guy was better off not knowing the answers.</p><p>A tear slid down Jasmine\u2019s cheek. But she didn\u2019t make a sound, and her expression never altered. She just kept staring up at Drake. Kept holding his hand. \u201cI love your eyes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He blinked at that. Uh, was the lady getting delirious?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen quite that shade of green before. Your eyes...they tell me that you can\u2019t be as bad as the stories say.\u201d</p><p>Drake knew there were plenty of stories circulating about him.</p><p>His right hand kept holding hers. His left rose and wiped away the tear tracks on her cheek. Then he leaned in close to her. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m even worse than they say.\u201d</p><p>If she knew the full truth about him...but then, only Noah and Trace were aware of all he\u2019d done. The deaths. The lies.</p><p>They knew because their pasts were as twisted as his own.</p><p>\u201cWhy did the picture matter?\u201d The question slipped from him.</p><p>A furrow appeared between her brows.</p><p>\u201cTwo more,\u201d Carson said, voice sounding strangely chipper.</p><p>She flinched. Held Drake even tighter.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to steal my files, but you saw the picture in my desk, and you changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled. \u201cSo you did have a camera up there.\u201d He heard the faint click of her swallow. \u201cWere you going to record us having sex?\u201d</p><p>Carson coughed. \u201cWow. I don\u2019t think I need to hear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Drake ignored him. \u201cWhen we have sex, that\u2019s for us. You and me, and no one else. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cSounds like someone still has plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t crying anymore. Not those silent tears that had made his chest ache. She was staring at him with a sharp gleam in her eye.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Carson said, sounding exceedingly relieved. \u201cNow I can get the hell out of here, but I do think I need to give some doctorly advice...no rough sex for a bit, okay? Hold off on that chandelier swinging a while because I just patched the girl up.\u201d</p><p>Drake looked over and saw that Carson had put a bandage over Jasmine\u2019s wound. The tightness in his chest eased. No more pain for her.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>He shook his head. His thoughts were screwed up tonight. Probably because he\u2019d been up for nearly twenty-four hours straight. He should crash but...</p><p>He had some business to take care of first.</p><p>He was also still holding Jasmine\u2019s hand. She seemed to realize that fact at the same instant he did because she tried to pull away from him.</p><p>He let her go. She was in his house. In his bed. The woman wasn\u2019t going far. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Her lips lifted in the faintest of smiles. \u201cSince it looked like this place was surrounded by miles of desert and I just got stitches in my side, I was just planning to stay right here for a bit. Not because you just ordered me to, but because I don\u2019t feel like falling on my face right now.\u201d</p><p>Carson laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s got some fire, doesn\u2019t she? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard about redheads. Once they\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake grabbed his arm and hauled the doc out of the room.</p><p>When they were near the front door of his estate, Drake glared at Carson. \u201cThis never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never does,\u201d Carson agreed as he rolled back his shoulders. \u201cBut that money sure looks nice when it appears in my bank account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already on the way.\u201d</p><p>Carson turned to leave. Then he hesitated. \u201cIs she...safe?\u201d</p><p>He sure hadn\u2019t expected that question.</p><p>\u201cI mean...\u201d Carson cleared his throat. \u201cShe\u2019s not one of your employees\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Carson gave a rough bark of laughter as he glanced back over his shoulder. \u201cBecause even though the woman was bleeding all over your bed, you still stared at her as if you could eat her alive. And you don\u2019t exactly get all touchy and hold hands with my usual patients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your concern anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Carson was annoying him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying be careful, okay? She might not be up to your usual games. Hell, I\u2019m not up to them, and I\u2019m the guy who has to patch up all the players.\u201d</p><p>Then Carson was gone. Drake locked the door behind him.</p><p>You don\u2019t know her, Carson.</p><p>And neither did Drake, but he needed to learn more about her. In general, he had a rule about secrets. He didn\u2019t want to hear them. He didn\u2019t want to share his own past, and he didn\u2019t want to dig into the hell that could be someone else\u2019s sordid history.</p><p>But he wanted to know more about Jasmine.</p><p>He pulled out his phone. Called the man that he knew could give him the information he wanted.</p><p>The phone rang once, twice, then a groggy Trace Weston picked up. \u201cAre you dying?\u201d Trace wanted to know. \u201cBecause, seriously, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Noah have woken me plenty of nights. And it\u2019s too freaking early for you to be sleeping any way. It\u2019s barely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour a.m.,\u201d Trace growled.</p><p>Drake\u2019s lips twisted.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re dying,\u201d Trace pointed out. \u201cSo I\u2019m about to hang up\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need background intel.\u201d</p><p>And Trace was the best in the business at gathering intel. Investigation was Trace\u2019s business. Weston Securities was the most respected security firm in the U.S., thanks to Trace.</p><p>Drake, Trace and Noah had formed a private company of their own after they\u2019d left the military. They knew how to get in and out of every hotspot on earth, and they\u2019d used their special talents to their advantage. They\u2019d retrieved wealthy businessmen and women who\u2019d found themselves in some very serious and deadly situations...for a hefty fee.</p><p>After a while of earning as much cash as they could, Trace had decided to expand the business\u2014he\u2019d hired new teams. Developed Weston Securities. Noah had turned his attention to growing a hotel empire, and Drake...</p> <p>Life\u2019s a gamble. His philosophy, and the reason he\u2019d opened his first casino with his share of the security profits.</p><p>\u201cDrake...who do you want me to investigate? What dumb bastard has pissed you off now?\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s gaze slid toward the dark hallway. He didn\u2019t hear a sound coming from the bedroom. Was Jasmine awake?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d he heard himself say. \u201cI just need...I need background on a woman with the name of Jasmine Bennett. She\u2019s from Texas, about twenty-eight years old. Red hair, brown eyes. Her eyes have a little gold in them and\u2014\u201d</p><p>It sounded like Trace was choking. \u201cHer eyes have what in them?\u201d</p> <p>Asshole. Drake growled, \u201cShe\u2019s five foot six,\u201d without those sexy shoes to bump her up. \u201cAnd the woman probably weighs about one thirty-five. She\u2019s got a knife scar above her left hip,\u201d and now one above her right. \u201cI want to know everything you can find on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis business or is this personal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d he said as he turned to type in his security code on the control panel.</p><p>Silence, then... \u201cWhere is Ms. Bennett right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...then you probably should\u2019ve gone for the background check first.\u201d</p> <p>He had to unclench his jaw. \u201cJust get me the intel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work it personally,\u201d Trace promised him. \u201cBut man, just...be careful okay. Last time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what happened last time, and I\u2019m not ever going to make that mistake again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you hurt.\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was lower now.</p><p>Drake laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. She doesn\u2019t matter enough to hurt me. None of them do.\u201d</p><p>The floor creaked, and he looked up\u2014and right into Jasmine\u2019s dark eyes. She stood in the hallway, her hand pressed to the wall.</p><p>\u201cGet me that information as soon as you can.\u201d Drake ended the call and marched toward Jasmine. \u201cYou should still be in bed.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little shrug. \u201cI...um, I figured since I was all stitched up, I should probably get out of your way now.\u201d</p> <p>Bullshit. She was trying to run again. \u201cI told you to stay in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cYour bed? That was your room?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any pictures or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t put fucking pictures all over my room. I sleep there. I screw there. And I move on.\u201d</p><p>She backed up a step.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t leave until you tell me everything I need to know.\u201d Actually, she didn\u2019t leave until Trace gave him the intel he wanted. Drake didn\u2019t trust her not to lie. He didn\u2019t trust her at all.</p><p>His gaze slid over her. She\u2019d put her bloody shirt back on. That wasn\u2019t going to do. And there were dark shadows under her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome on...\u201d He took her arm.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you wanted to take something from me.\u201d He stared into her eyes. They did have fucking flecks of gold. He\u2019d just been stating a fact when he told Trace that detail. Asshole. Drake had wanted to be thorough. How was that wrong? \u201cNo one takes from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to hand me over to the cops?\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t handing her over to anyone. He shook his head as she began to walk down the hallway with him.</p><p>When they were back in his room, she hesitated near the bed.</p><p>\u201cTake off the shirt,\u201d Drake told her flatly. The woman couldn\u2019t sleep in a blood-soaked shirt.</p><p>He caught the fast sound of her indrawn breath. \u201cBut...that GQ doctor said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking you tonight, Jasmine.\u201d Tomorrow night? Maybe. He went to this closet. Came back out with one of his shirts. \u201cPut this on.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers reached for the offered shirt. Brushed against his. An electric current seemed to shoot right through his hand.</p><p>He\u2019d felt attraction before. Plenty of times. After all, the world was full of beautiful women, and he could certainly appreciate beauty. But this was different.</p><p>He looked at her, and he ached.</p><p>He touched her, and he craved.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d Jasmine told him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He did raise his brows. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you without a shirt before.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cTurn. Around.\u201d</p><p>Pity. He turned. Heard the soft rustle of clothing behind him.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her voice was hesitant.</p><p>He looked back. She had on his shirt, and it swallowed her. It also made her look delicate, vulnerable. Sexy. \u201cYou still have on the pants.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as she glanced down at herself.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep in them. Finish stripping, then get in bed.\u201d He motioned to said bed.</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to sleep with you?\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest. This shouldn\u2019t be so hard to explain. The woman obviously had issues following orders. \u201cI expect you to get in bed before you collapse.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip.</p><p>Shit. Shit, shit. He wanted a bite.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d Jasmine murmured. \u201cIf you want answers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a fainting woman on my floor, and princess, I\u2019m dead on my feet, too. We\u2019re crashing. Everything else can just wait until the sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid to the king-sized bed. \u201cI\u2019m just supposed to trust that I can sleep here, safely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her dark stare snapped right back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t trust me, because I sure don\u2019t trust you.\u201d But he\u2019d give her tonight\u2014or what was left of the night. Because he could still see the image of a needle sliding into her delicate flesh. \u201cRest.\u201d The order came out hard and gruff as he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Her soft words stopped him at the threshold. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do? Walk away and just let you keep bleeding out in the alley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the door frame. Held it too tightly. It won\u2019t happen again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to repay you,\u201d Jasmine promised. \u201cI always repay my debts.\u201d</p><p>He spared her a brief glance. \u201cGood...because I always collect on the debts owed to me.\u201d He figured that she deserved that warning.</p><p>Then, because the bed behind her looked too good\u2014no, she looked too good, wearing his shirt, waiting by his bed, Drake left her. He shut the door firmly, and headed down the hallway. Even though he was bone weary, Drake knew sleep wasn\u2019t going to come easily for him.</p><p>It never did. The dead haunted him too much.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be missing someone...\u201d</p><p>Wayne tensed when he saw his boss stride toward him. The dawn Vegas sky was streaked with lines of red and gold. They were meeting in the middle of nowhere, a spot that his GPS hadn\u2019t been able to find, and Wayne was nervous as all hell.</p><p>This place is too much like a body dump site.</p><p>No one would find remains out here in the desert. If the animals left any remains.</p><p>\u201cJasmine Bennett was supposed to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Wayne didn\u2019t try to hide the truth. He knew better than to lie to this man. \u201cShe\u2019s with Drake Archer.\u201d</p><p>He expected fury. He expected the boss to take out a gun and shoot him right there. According to the stories he\u2019d heard, the guy had done that before. Wayne tried to brace for impact.</p><p>Instead, the man smiled. \u201cIs she now?\u201d</p><p>Wayne nodded. Sweat drenched his forehead.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then keep an eye on her until she leaves him, and when she does...bring her in to me.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>The guy turned on his heel and headed back toward the limo that waited for him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Wayne called after the man. \u201cYou\u2019re not\u2014you\u2019re not angry?\u201d</p><p>The boss stopped. \u201cWhy would I be angry? I told Jasmine to get close to Archer. Seems like she\u2019s done her job very well.\u201d</p><p>He was so lost. \u201cBut...but my job was to bring her in. You hired me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour job was to make sure she didn\u2019t run from me. She\u2019s not running...not yet. She\u2019s doing exactly as I ordered.\u201d He turned his head. The sky was on fire behind him. \u201cYou\u2019re my security, in case Jasmine tries to go soft on this one.\u201d</p><p>Soft? The report he\u2019d read on the woman sure didn\u2019t indicate any \u201csoft\u201d tendencies.</p><p>\u201cJasmine is important to me. I don\u2019t want to lose her talents.\u201d</p><p>Oh, damn. Talk about misreading a situation. When he was hired to tail someone, it was usually because that someone had screwed up.</p><p>Only I\u2019m the one who screwed up this one. He should\u2019ve asked more questions, instead of just taking the money.</p><p>But he liked money.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want Jasmine hurt?\u201d Wayne asked carefully. There was, ahem, no need to mention that she\u2019d already been hurt. The boss didn\u2019t need to know about the little knife incident. He hadn\u2019t meant to slice her.</p><p>Okay, he had.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose her,\u201d the boss said again, but then his face hardened. \u201cBut I would see her dead before I\u2019d let her betray me.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s where I come in. \u201cThat\u2019s why you hired me. In case she turns on you.\u201d It would have been helpful to know this earlier.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hunter. She\u2019s your prey...the instant she runs.\u201d</p><p>He realized the truth. \u201cYou thought she\u2019d run last night!\u201d No wonder he\u2019d gotten the call to close in. He\u2019d thought the order meant he needed to detain Jasmine, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cJasmine has a...special connection with Archer. I was worried it might prove to be a weakness for her. I sent you after her because if she wasn\u2019t doing her part, I wanted her brought to me.\u201d The boss waved his hand. \u201cShe\u2019s not here...so she\u2019s still in play.\u201d</p><p>Wayne had no clue what was going on. Above my pay grade.</p><p>\u201cJasmine had her orders. She\u2019ll make contact with me in twenty-four hours, and if she doesn\u2019t, then...well, everything will change for her. She won\u2019t have my protection any longer\u2014and she will feel the force of my fury.\u201d</p><p>Wayne edged back a bit. He sure didn\u2019t want any of the boss\u2019s fury to be turned on him. I\u2019m not telling him about the knife. What he doesn\u2019t know...</p><p>\u201cBetter see about that nose,\u201d the boss ordered with a wave of his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve heard Archer can throw a killer punch.\u201d</p><p>The man truly had eyes and ears everywhere. But he doesn\u2019t know I sliced, Jasmine. Not yet. Talk about a lucky break.</p><p>Wayne stood there, at that body dump site, frozen, until the boss vanished in his fancy limo.</p><p>If I\u2019m the security to make sure Jasmine doesn\u2019t screw him over...then who the hell is watching me?</p><p>Because the twist in his gut told Wayne that the boss was all about contingency plans. Screw him over...and you die.</p><p>Wayne hurried back to his car. He knew better than to screw over that man.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cRise and shine, princess...\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s eyes flew open and she jerked upright, a gasp shaking from her as her hands immediately flew out toward the rickety nightstand and the weapon that had better be there\u2014</p><p>This isn\u2019t my motel room.</p><p>Her hand slammed into a lamp and it went crashing to the floor.</p><p>\u201cInteresting wake-up method you have there,\u201d that deep, rumbling, very male voice told her.</p><p>Her gaze shot toward the doorway. Drake stood there, one sardonic blond brow lifted, a faint smirk quirking those sexy lips of his.</p><p>No, not sexy. They were hard. They were cruel. They were\u2014</p><p>She focused on his eyes even as her hands snatched up the covers. \u201cDid you ever think of knocking politely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house. My bedroom.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s getting close to noon. I was afraid you were dead in here.\u201d</p><p>Noon? She never slept to noon. Not ever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some clothes for you.\u201d He glanced down at the bag in his right hand. Wait, that was\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy bag.\u201d She scrambled from the bed, pulling the covers with her. She kept them around her, toga style, and Jasmine ignored the ache in her side.</p><p>\u201cI had one of my men collect your things from that little motel.\u201d</p><p>Did she look stupid? \u201cYou mean you told the guy to rifle through my stuff.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the bag toward her. \u201cI thought you might like some non-bloodstained clothes to wear. And some shoes. Guess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>She hurried across the room and grabbed the small duffel bag.</p><p>But he reached out before she could retreat from him, and his fingers wrapped around her wrist. \u201cYou keep a gun in your nightstand drawer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she was betting that gun wasn\u2019t tucked securely in her bag. \u201cA lady traveling alone has to protect herself.\u201d Especially when she was dodging trouble.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Drake told her.</p><p>Did he realize that his thumb was slowly rubbing against her inner wrist? Because she did, and that teasing contact was making her all kinds of nervous. \u201cTime for what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe truth. You put on your clothes, then you come to the den and you tell me everything I want to know.\u201d</p><p>Not going to happen. \u201cOr what?\u201d He\u2019d already said he wasn\u2019t planning to call the cops on her. So as far as she was concerned, he had zero leverage.</p><p>The smirk was gone from his face. He looked...cold then. Hard. Dangerous.</p><p>Don\u2019t fall for the bad boys, don\u2019t!</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me for an enemy, Jasmine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought that you already were my enemy. Didn\u2019t realize I had a choice in the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, now that scared her. Her chin started to lift.</p><p>\u201cBut one way or another, you will be answering my questions, and if you lie to me...that will be a mistake I punish you for.\u201d</p><p>Then he freed her wrist. Only she felt like he was still touching her. Her skin was hot and sensitive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes to dress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you sure like giving orders.\u201d</p><p>He flashed her a wide grin. Wow. The man had a really nice, sexy smile.</p><p>\u201cTime\u2019s ticking...\u201d</p><p>He shut the door.</p><p>Her gaze darted around the room. There had to be a way out of there. A way to escape Drake...</p><p>Because that man wouldn\u2019t like her secrets. She knew because Jasmine hated them, too.</p><p>Drake was waiting in the garage. He stood in the back, keeping his body hidden as Jasmine snuck inside. He almost smiled. Did she even realize how predictable she was? She\u2019d ducked out the back of the house, circumventing his security\u2014a nice touch\u2014but he knew the woman would need a ride for her escape off his property.</p><p>His garage had, of course, been her most likely destination. So he hadn\u2019t bothered waiting inside the house for her.</p> <p>He\u2019d just made himself comfortable out there.</p><p>Her shoulders were hunched as she made her way to the line of cars. Which one would she pick? The Corvette? The Lincoln?</p><p>His lips firmed. Oh, hell, no, the woman was not planning to take his Porsche.</p><p>She was.</p><p>She slipped inside the car, then disappeared beneath the dash. He stalked toward her as anger pumped in his blood. \u201cIf you mess up those wires, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her head shot up, and she screamed.</p><p>He took that opportunity to haul her out of his Porsche. That car was his favorite, his favorite in Vegas, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on us talking out here,\u201d he murmured as he held her. \u201cPrincess, you missed the den by about fifty feet.\u201d</p><p>She jerked against his hold. He didn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>She still smelled like vanilla.</p><p>He still wanted a taste.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t miss your dang den. It took me five minutes to get out of that house.\u201d She sounded disgruntled enough that he wanted to smile. Again.</p><p>Then he remembered that she\u2019d been intent on wrecking his baby. \u201cYou don\u2019t touch the wires, got it? You don\u2019t damage the Porsche.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine rolled her eyes at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been hot wiring rides since I was fifteen. Your precious little baby wasn\u2019t in any danger from me.\u201d Her eyes narrowed and she appeared insulted. \u201cI\u2019m a professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you now?\u201d Ah, so there was secret number one. \u201cA...professional.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed a dark red but her eyes\u2014they seemed to darken even more with...pain? \u201cI\u2019m not a whore.\u201d She pulled away from him and started heading back toward the house.</p><p>He stared after her a moment, aware that he felt...shame. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were a whore. I\u2019m...sorry.\u201d His words hadn\u2019t come out right. He\u2019d meant to taunt her, not accuse her of\u2014shit.</p><p>She glanced back at him, frowning. The light hit her hair. Rolled over her skin. Made the woman seem to glow. \u201cDid you almost choke as you just said those words? Because it sounded like that apology got stuck in your throat.\u201d</p><p>It had, a little bit.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou like trouble, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine gave a slow shake of her head. \u201cThen you need to just take me out of this place. Let me get away from you, and then we can both never look back.\u201d</p><p>He took his time closing the distance between them. Mostly because he was enjoying the view of her in the sunlight. \u201cYou made a mistake, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like I\u2019ve made a few of those,\u201d she groused.</p><p>Dammit, she kept making him want to smile. What in the hell was up with that? \u201cYou interest me.\u201d</p><p>Surprise rippled across her face. \u201cYou make me sound like some kind of weird science project. You know, when it comes to talking with ladies, you rather suck at it. How, how do you have so many chicks throwing themselves at you?\u201d</p><p>That should be obvious. \u201cI\u2019m rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sexy.\u201d She glared at him. Like he was the one who\u2019d committed a crime. \u201cBad boy appeal.\u201d</p><p>Uh, okay.</p><p>She pointed at him. \u201cYou need to keep your hands off me.\u201d</p><p>He wanted his hands all over her. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to get involved with you. It would be a mistake, for us both.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand. Yes, he was touching her. He liked doing it, and she didn\u2019t pull away. Because she liked his touch?</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak again until they were near his house. Drake nodded to a guard who was watching them. \u201cDid he even see you slip out?\u201d Drake asked her, curious because the man had his narrowed gaze on Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think he was taking a potty break.\u201d</p><p>Laughter broke from Drake.</p><p>\u201cI had to pick my moment,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>He tugged her into the house. Shut the door. Instead of heading to the den, he took Jasmine into his study.</p><p>Once they were there, Jasmine glanced down at her hand. \u201cYou can let go now. You\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he dropped his hold on her. \u201cDo you...hurt?\u201d</p><p>He should\u2019ve asked her that before.</p><p>Again, surprise flashed across her face. What? Had no one ever asked the woman how she felt?</p><p>\u201cJust a little ache,\u201d Jasmine said as she walked around the study, poking and gazing at different things. \u201cNothing to worry about. I\u2019ve had plenty worse.\u201d</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t like hearing that news. \u201cHow many times have you been stitched up?\u201d He eased into the chair behind his desk. His hands flattened on the wooden surface.</p><p>\u201cMaybe three times. Everyone has accidents.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. \u201cThat was no accident last night.\u201d</p><p>She put down the hourglass that she\u2019d been examining \u201cYou\u2019re right. That was my mistake. I should\u2019ve moved faster.\u201d Her breath expelled on a sigh. \u201cSo there are accidents and there are...non-accidents.\u201d</p><p>Locking his jaw, he motioned to the leather chair in front of his desk.</p><p>She didn\u2019t sit.</p><p>The woman just liked to be difficult.</p><p>\u201cWho are you working for?\u201d Drake asked her.</p><p>\u201cMyself?\u201d Yes, she made it sound like a question, but then she nodded, as if she\u2019d reached an important decision. \u201cFrom here on out,\u201d Jasmine said softly, \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>She was making his head ache. \u201cWho sent you to the Arrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came on my own. I figured I had a better shot at getting to you there. Your house here...\u201d She waved her hand. \u201cIt was too isolated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you knew I kept my files there and you wanted access to them.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tapped against a bronze statue. The woman was touching everything. But me. \u201cIf you know all the answers, why ask the questions?\u201d</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t have the answers for the big questions. \u201cTell me who sent you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we can both make his hit list? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>She looked too confident and in control. The woman should have the sense to fear him. She didn\u2019t. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you afraid of what I\u2019ll do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBones can be broken, flesh can be cut. Been there, done that.\u201d</p><p>He shot to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI survived those non-accidents,\u201d she continued, her voice quiet, calm. \u201cSo I figure I\u2019ll survive whatever you do to me, too.\u201d</p><p>His hands had clenched at his sides. \u201cWho hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLists are long...and boring. The past is over. Let\u2019s just stick to the here and now.\u201d She turned her back. Gazed up at a painting of wild horses on the wall. \u201cThis is hideous, by the way. Why would you ever pick this out to hang it up in your study?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. It came with the house.\u201d She was trying to distract him. Nice.</p><p>He was ready to distract her, too. So he threw out the question that he knew would get a response. \u201cWho interested you the most in that photo?\u201d</p><p>He saw her shoulders tighten. \u201cWhat photo?\u201d</p><p>Drake sighed. \u201cEach time you lie to me, I\u2019ll expect something from you. An apology, of sorts.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Drake closed in on her. Pinned her between him and that freakishly ugly painting. \u201cYou just lied. Make it up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d He didn\u2019t think she would. He just\u2014</p><p>She leaned up on her toes and pressed a quick kiss to his lips.</p><p>\u201cNo, princess, not like that.\u201d He tipped up her chin and he took her mouth. Deep, thorough. Rough. \u201cMy way.\u201d</p><p>Her breath rasped out against him.</p><p>\u201cEvery time you lie to me,\u201d Drake told her, aware that his voice had thickened, \u201cyou pay for it.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze searched his. \u201cI probably should confess...I lie a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll pay...a lot.\u201d</p><p>Her hands pressed to his chest. But she didn\u2019t push him away. Instead, it was more as if she were trying to get a feel for him. Testing his strength.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you to the Arrow? To me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man with enemies. Maybe you can figure that part out yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your role? Seduction?\u201d</p><p>She pushed against him. Hard. A shove. But he didn\u2019t step back so much as an inch.</p><p>Jasmine swallowed. \u201cI told you before, I\u2019m not a whore. Don\u2019t ever make the mistake of calling me that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between seduction and prostitution. From where I\u2019m standing, seduction seems to be one of your key talents.\u201d She sure had made him want her easily enough.</p><p>Red lit her cheeks again. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used your body to get to me before.\u201d When she\u2019d seemed so eager for him back in his private lounge. \u201cDon\u2019t like being called on it now?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered, shielding her eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew I wanted you. You used that. And I\u2019m betting you\u2019ve used men\u2019s desires against them plenty of times.\u201d The thought had his muscles clenching. He didn\u2019t want to think of any others in Jasmine\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cWeaknesses can always be exploited.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid down her neck. Her pulse raced frantically beneath his fingertips. \u201cYou\u2019re too delicate for the danger you seek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks can be deceiving.\u201d</p><p>No, in her case, they weren\u2019t. A twist of his hand, and she\u2019d be dead. Maybe he should tell her about his past.</p><p>But...</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re wasting time with me. Don\u2019t you have a flight today?\u201d Jasmine asked him as her pulse kept racing beneath his fingers. \u201cI remember reading someplace that you were working on some big casino deal in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe eyes do help you play innocent,\u201d he allowed as he studied her. \u201cBut that innocent routine doesn\u2019t really work for me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze held his. She seemed to come to some decision as she told him, \u201cTake some advice from me. You need to pay attention to what\u2019s happening down in New Orleans. You\u2019ve pissed someone off, and that particular person isn\u2019t going to stop until he gets his pound of flesh from you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around her throat. \u201cA name, Jasmine. That\u2019s what I want. Neither of us will leave this room until I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElvis Presley.\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a name. My favorite all-time performer.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cBe careful what you ask for, you just might get it.\u201d Her pulse kicked up even more. \u201cDo you know what will happen to me...if I talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted, but her smile was sad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect you,\u201d he added. With his resources, protecting her would be easy.</p><p>Her smile slipped. \u201cNo, you\u2019ll throw me away. Because you\u2019ll have what you need from me. I know how it works. I\u2019ve been a tool before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you supposed to steal from me?\u201d Drake demanded as his patience fled.</p><p>Her breath whispered out. \u201cThe plans for the casino expansion in New Orleans. The projections for your future projects in Biloxi. You\u2019ve got some competition...someone who wants to cut you off at the knees.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And things started to click into place for him. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do. You don\u2019t take jewels. You\u2019re an information thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I prefer the term...information retrieval specialist.\u201d</p><p>His jaw nearly dropped.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds better.\u201d</p><p>He could only shake his head.</p><p>\u201cIt does. It sounds a lot better than thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cops are after you in Texas.\u201d He freed her and stepped back. \u201cHell, you\u2019re wanted and that bounty hunter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wanted because I haven\u2019t been caught before!\u201d</p> <p>His gaze pinned her. He\u2019d caught her.</p><p>\u201cYou were the first,\u201d she allowed, obviously reading his thoughts. \u201cNo one else ever held me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the others were idiots.\u201d</p><p>She looked away from him. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He just couldn\u2019t figure her out. \u201cYou were hired to do a job. You didn\u2019t do it...because you saw a wedding photograph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just changed my mind, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>Lie. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that one,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>She tensed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go to her and collect. Not yet. She\u2019d revealed good information to him, and he just had to work this situation out in his mind.</p><p>Casinos...it was about the business. His business. Someone wanted him to crash and burn financially.</p><p>Hell, there was quite a list out there for that. When it came to the casinos, Drake didn\u2019t exactly play nicely. Playing nicely wasn\u2019t part of his vocabulary.</p><p>But Jasmine was afraid of the person targeting him, and Drake didn\u2019t think Jasmine scared easily. He knew that she didn\u2019t.</p><p>So it was business, and it was personal.</p><p>He watched her. Waited. Narrowed down his enemies. Someone tied to the casino industry. Someone who would be willing to destroy a man\u2019s life in an instant. Someone he\u2019d recently pissed off...</p> <p>Luckily, that list was fairly short. At the moment. \u201cMaxwell Case,\u201d Drake threw the name out as a test.</p><p>Her chin notched into the air. \u201cIs that name supposed to mean something to me?\u201d</p><p>He was on her in a flash. \u201cThat\u2019s lie number three. Collection time.\u201d His mouth sank on hers. Damn but he liked her taste. Liked the way she gasped and arched against him. Liked the sting of her nails along his shoulders.</p><p>His tongue thrust into her mouth. He savored her. He wanted to taste every single bit of her. He\u2019d gone too long without a woman. Need rode him hard. Only...</p><p>It wasn\u2019t need for just any soft, feminine body beneath his. It was a dark, aching need for her. Jasmine.</p><p>His head lifted. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who sent you after me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, but she stubbornly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThe Arrow used to be another casino.\u201d A rundown dump that needed new life. A spot that had been ripe for the picking. \u201cCase wanted the place. I bought the casino before he could. Found out the SOB\u2019s bid, and I took it.\u201d When Vegas was supposed to be Case\u2019s domain. Screw that shit. Drake took what he wanted.</p><p>And he\u2019d wanted Vegas.</p><p>\u201cI took what was his, and now he\u2019s trying to take what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>She gazed up at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you told me to head down to New Orleans. He\u2019s trying to take my casinos from me. The bastard thinks he can run me out of business.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together.</p><p>\u201cNot happening.\u201d He marched for the door. \u201cNo one takes what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I...can I go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d he repeated as he turned back to her.</p><p>Her hands twisted in front of her. \u201cYou think you know everything, so you don\u2019t need me now.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. \u201cOn the contrary, I think I need you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes could bring a man to his knees.</p><p>But Drake bowed for no one.</p><p>\u201cGood thing your bag is packed, princess, because we\u2019ll be leaving for New Orleans soon.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of leaving you behind.\u201d</p><p>Fear flashed in her eyes. \u201cYou should, though. You need to leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Because he had plans for Jasmine. So many plans. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>No one takes what\u2019s mine.</p><p>Drake\u2019s words echoed through Jasmine\u2019s head. He\u2019d sounded so fierce and determined.</p><p>But Drake was wrong. This wasn\u2019t just about his casinos.</p><p>It was about his life.</p><p>Maybe...maybe if she played things just right, she\u2019d survive what was coming.</p><p>Perhaps they both would.</p><p>Then Drake would think that she was worthy enough, then he\u2019d help her. He\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cComing?\u201d</p><p>She schooled her expression before she glanced up. Drake was back in the doorway. The guy hadn\u2019t gone far at all.</p><p>\u201cYou really should leave me behind.\u201d She was trying to be fair. \u201cI told you that before. You don\u2019t want the kind of trouble I can bring to your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Jasmine, you don\u2019t know the kind of trouble that I am.\u201d He flashed her a tiger\u2019s grin. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be finding out. Very, very soon...\u201d</p><p>A shiver slid down her spine.</p><p>He slipped into the Arrow. Headed inside as easily as could be. The security guards at the front of the place didn\u2019t notice him\u2014mostly because they thought he was one of them. Getting the guard\u2019s uniform had been too easy.</p><p>He made his rounds, like a good security guard would. Then he went to the area that interested him the most.</p><p>\u201cHeard there was some action here last night,\u201d he murmured when he saw the two uniformed men near the vault.</p><p>One guard grunted. \u201cDamn smoke bomb.\u201d</p><p>This time, it wouldn\u2019t just be about smoke.</p><p>But the guard to the right frowned at him. \u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to be here. You\u2019re not part of the usual rotation.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so security had been stepped up.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your credentials,\u201d that guard barked. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>Now both guards were eyeing him with suspicion.</p><p>He raised his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me because I\u2019m the new guy on the team.\u201d He flashed a friendly smile. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m getting out of here. Just wanted to see where all the cash was kept. Curious, you know.\u201d</p><p>His smile and easy attitude should have reassured them. But one of the guards was pulling out his radio. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cI need the chief,\u201d the guard snapped. \u201cThere\u2019s some guy down here who won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already leaving,\u201d he murmured as he edged away. Hell. This wasn\u2019t part of his plan.</p><p>He turned his back, intent on getting out of there.</p><p>But one of the guards grabbed his shoulder.</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cWasn\u2019t supposed to go down like this,\u201d he murmured, but a smile pulled at his lips.</p><p>Sometimes, violence was the best answer.</p><p>He turned around and attacked.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Jasmine had her nose pressed to the window as the plane landed.</p><p>\u201cFirst time in New Orleans?\u201d Drake asked her, curious. This woman carried so many secrets.</p><p>\u201cFirst time on a private jet.\u201d Her right hand was tight around the armrest. \u201cAnd this plane is lush.\u201d Her tone was admiring.</p><p>The plane bounced a bit as it landed.</p><p>Jasmine glanced his way. He wondered if she\u2019d be afraid or if\u2014</p><p>A wide smile winked her dimples. \u201cAnd, yes, this is my first time in New Orleans, so I want to see everything.\u201d</p><p>That smile was going to cause serious problems. Carefully, Drake shifted his position. A smile shouldn\u2019t make him that aroused, that fast.</p><p>But hers did.</p><p>When they were clear, he unhooked his belt.</p><p>Jasmine began, \u201cMy bag\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being taken care of.\u201d Everything would be taken care of now.</p><p>Jasmine nearly skipped down the runway. An interesting trick, considering that she was wearing stilettos.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard this city is magic.\u201d She was tugging on his arms. \u201cI want to see the Quarter. I want to eat beignets at midnight.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to a stop. \u201cIt\u2019s close to midnight now.\u201d But New Orleans wouldn\u2019t be sleeping. The jazz music would be drifting in the air, and the place would be alive with people filling the streets.</p><p>That smile was still on her face. The one that made him want to think she wasn\u2019t a thief. That she was just a woman he desired.</p><p>But I know better.</p><p>He also knew how to get her to lower her guard.</p><p>\u201cCan we get beignets?\u201d Jasmine asked him quickly. \u201cAt that place along the riverfront? I\u2019ve heard people talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Her smiled beamed even more.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak again until they were in his car and his driver-slash-security detail-was leading them through the city.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Drake finally mused as he carefully watched her, \u201cmost women get this excited over diamonds, not beignets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not most women.\u201d And she was back to having her nose pressed to the nearest window. She stared out at the city as if it were the most amazing sight that she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He kept his eyes on her.</p><p>His driver, Matthew, dropped them off near the riverfront.</p><p>\u201cI hear jazz!\u201d Jasmine exclaimed excitedly.</p><p>That was because a man was playing a saxophone less than ten feet away.</p><p>Jasmine hurried through the crowd and stopped near the man. Then she just listened, apparently spellbound, as he played.</p><p>Drake kept watching her.</p><p>She was a puzzle he couldn\u2019t quite figure out. What was real with her? The enthusiasm and happiness she was showing now? Or the tricks she\u2019d shown back at the Arrow? The lock picking. The seduction.</p><p>He put money down for the musician and led Jasmine toward her beignets. When she bit into one, powdered sugar slid over her upper lip.</p><p>His gaze locked on that lip.</p><p>Jasmine moaned. \u201cIncredible.\u201d She devoured the beignet, licking her lips, savoring the sugar.</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d Drake muttered.</p><p>Her gaze slid to his. \u201cYou should...have a taste.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her and licked away the soft powder near her upper lip.</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cDrake...\u201d</p><p>He pulled back. Stared at her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t like it when she thanked him. He didn\u2019t want her gratitude, not for buying her a simple beignet. He wanted...her.</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the distance. Her head turned at the sound, and she stared out at the river.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he told her, aware that his voice sounded gruff. \u201cA storm\u2019s coming.\u201d He could smell it in the air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never minded a storm.\u201d</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>They stood there, staring at the water, as the raindrops began to fall.</p><p>Then, because he couldn\u2019t help himself, because he wanted her and he was going to take exactly what he wanted, Drake turned Jasmine in his arms. He kissed her. Tasted the sweetness on her lips. Tasted the rain.</p><p>Tasted desire.</p><p>Her hands wound around his neck as she leaned into him. She was kissing him eagerly, seeming to hold nothing back.</p><p>Good. Because from that moment forward, there would be no stopping or holding back.</p><p>Not for either of them.</p><p>He had a house in the French Quarter, one away from the wildness of Bourbon Street, and he took her there. His driver was close, and he picked them up quickly. Within minutes, they were heading down the lane that would take Drake to his house.</p><p>Then Jasmine is mine.</p><p>Jasmine...Now that they were in the car, She was back to staring out the window. And he was watching her. Drake...liked watching her.</p><p>Her hair was wet around her shoulders. Her clothes clung tightly to her body.</p><p>He wanted her naked.</p><p>He\u2019d have her that way.</p><p>When they reached his house, he hurried from the car.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Jasmine whispered as she stared up at the house. Illuminated by faint porch lights, the Victorian stood strong in the surrounding darkness. \u201cGorgeous.\u201d</p><p>He caught her fingers with his. The rain was still falling, but Jasmine didn\u2019t seem to care. She was laughing as they hurried inside.</p><p>For a moment, he almost wanted to laugh, too.</p><p>He took her upstairs. Pulled her against him. The wet clothes let him feel every inch of her body. Tight nipples, pebbled hard.</p><p>From the cold?</p><p>From need?</p><p>He stared into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes flickered. \u201cYou could try making love to me.\u201d</p><p>His jaw locked. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about love.\u201d Emotions didn\u2019t enter into the equation for him.</p><p>Sadness swept over her face for an instant. He wondered if she\u2019d pull back. If she\u2019d try to play him.</p><p>Instead, her hand slid over the stubble that lined his jaw. \u201cMaybe one day, you\u2019ll change your mind. Maybe one day, you\u2019ll love someone.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand. Held it in a too tight grip. \u201cI want to fuck you. Now.\u201d He couldn\u2019t be more clear.</p><p>Her wet hair slid over her shoulders. \u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d The sadness was gone, and he wasn\u2019t sure if it had ever really been there. He just knew he had the woman he wanted in his arms, and Drake wasn\u2019t going to wait any longer.</p><p>He stripped her. Peeled those wet clothes from her body even as she kicked away her heels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her bra was a lacy temptation. Her breasts full and round, and when he tossed the bra away and those breasts spilled into his hands...Perfect.</p><p>He threw aside her pants. Nearly shredded her panties. This time wasn\u2019t about softness and seduction. This was about need. Want. Desire that was running unchecked through him.</p><p>Too long.</p><p>He needed to fuck. Hard and fast. More, he needed to fuck her.</p><p>Her mouth called to him, those plump lips teasing him. He took her lips and thrust his tongue deep even as he backed her up to the bed.</p><p>\u201cYour clothes\u2014\u201d Jasmine gasped against his mouth.</p><p>Then he tumbled her onto the bed. He didn\u2019t give a shit about the bed getting wet from his clothing.</p><p>He needed to touch her.</p><p>His hands learned her first. He started with her breasts. Plucking the nipples. Loving the way they went so tight at his touch. He stroked her, cupped her.</p><p>She arched into him. Her breath came in little gasps that made his cock grow even harder.</p><p>Want in her.</p><p>His hand swept over the curve of her stomach. But when his fingers skimmed along the edge of her bandage, Drake froze.</p><p>What the hell am I doing? She\u2019s hurt! He tried to pull back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think of stopping,\u201d Jasmine said, her voice a sensual demand. \u201cI need you, Drake. I. Need. You.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in his body ached for her. \u201cI\u2019m too rough. You\u2019re hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain...is the last thing I feel right now. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>And he knew he couldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll use care.\u201d Somehow, he would. His hands slid down her body. Down...down...right to the heat between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cDrake!\u201d</p><p>He explored her. Slowly at first, caressing the sensitive flesh, but when her hips arched against him, his touch became more demanding as he thrust two fingers into her.</p><p>She was hot and tight and he knew she\u2019d feel fantastic around him.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you!\u201d She was struggling with his wet clothes. \u201cGet these off!\u201d</p><p>He pulled away from her, just long enough to toss his clothes across the room and grab for a condom. He rolled it on, hissing out a breath because he wanted to be balls-deep in her now.</p> <p>She was splayed out for him on the bed. Her nipples were pink, tempting. So very temping.</p><p>He licked her nipple. She jerked at the contact. He licked her again. Sucked that flesh. Scored her lightly, sensually, with the edge of his teeth.</p><p>His hand was between her legs and he felt the rush of arousal as she grew slick for him.</p><p>He kissed his way down her stomach. Her legs parted even more for him. He blew lightly over her clit. She tried to reach for him, saying that she wanted to touch him again, but he caught her wrists and held them tightly with one hand.</p><p>Then he put his mouth on her.</p><p>She came that way, with his mouth against her, his tongue in her, the first time. Crying out, Jasmine arched against him and he loved it.</p><p>Her body was shaking, quivering, and it was all for him.</p><p>Drake rose up quickly and drove deep into her, as deep as he could go\u2014even as the climax still shook her.</p><p>Balls deep.</p><p>Her eyes were wide and dark with pleasure. Her cheeks flushed. She was beautiful and she was\u2014</p><p>Begging for more.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jasmine gasped, her voice husky and desperate. \u201cDrake, please!\u201d</p><p>He withdrew. Thrust deeper. He still had her wrists in his grasp and he lifted them up, pinning them above her head. He wanted the control, but he\u2019d sure see to it that she had her share of pleasure.</p><p>Enough pleasure to make her scream.</p><p>He plunged into her again, his rhythm giving them both just what they needed. Wanted. The wooden posters of his bed thudded into the wall. There was no restraint, no slow build up.</p><p>His cock sank into her, again and again.</p><p>Her legs lifted and locked around his hips as she tried to meet his thrusts.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>He needed more.</p><p>He withdrew from her.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d</p><p>In a flash, he\u2019d rolled her over, positioning her on her knees. He wanted in her even deeper.</p><p>\u201cHold the headboard,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Her hands curled over the wood.</p><p>\u201cHold tight,\u201d he whispered into her ear as his body wrapped around hers. She shivered against him. \u201cIs this...okay...are you hurting?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hurt those stitches\u2014</p><p>\u201cOnly pleasure,\u201d Jasmine whispered back.</p><p>He put his mouth on the curve of her neck. His hand slid under her, fondling her breasts, then moving down, down, and finding the tight center of her need.</p><p>He stroked her clit even as he thrust into her.</p><p>Jasmine cried out. Her hands flew off the headboard.</p><p>\u201cHold tight!\u201d Drake ordered her.</p><p>Her hands slapped back down and he drove into her with a thrust that had them both gasping. He thrust and stroked her, playing with her clit, forcing her closer to another release, one that he knew would be hard and brutal, because the orgasm pounding down on him was going to be that way. It was going to\u2014</p><p>Consume.</p><p>She screamed his name as he erupted. The spasms of his release had him pounding deep into her. Pleasure made him blind and nearly mad for a moment as he held tightly to her. His whole body ached as the release seemed to go on and on, surging through Drake.</p><p>Her breaths were rushed and desperate.</p><p>And he was holding her too hard.</p><p>Awareness slowly came back to Drake.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s knuckles were white as they curled around the headboard. Her body was quivering.</p><p>The scent of sex and vanilla and woman hung in the air.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>He kissed her shoulder.</p><p>Her head turned then, just a bit, and her eyes met his. There was pleasure on her face. No denying that, but Jasmine also looked...lost?</p><p>Had he hurt her? \u201cJasmine?\u201d Her stitches\u2014</p><p>\u201cI...wasn\u2019t prepared for you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what that meant. He\u2019d taken care of the protection. He always did. No way would he go bareback with a woman he\u2019d just picked up.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s not just any woman.</p><p>She blinked and her expression changed. Now she just looked...happy. Sated.</p><p>His.</p><p>\u201cThat was incredible.\u201d Her voice was still soft and husky, and he was already getting hard inside of her. Again.</p><p>Round two, coming up.</p><p>But first...</p><p>He pulled out of her. Settled her down against the covers. Feasted for a moment with his eyes. He\u2019d give her a few minutes to rest, then he\u2019d get more screams from her.</p><p>Sex with Jasmine had been fantastic. Far better than\u2014</p><p>His phone was ringing. Hell, where was his phone? He\u2019d thrown it aside earlier when he shed his clothes. He\u2019d been so intent on getting in Jasmine that he hadn\u2019t exactly been paying much attention to the thing.</p><p>Ah...there...</p><p>He followed the sound and swiped up his phone\u2014it had been under his trousers. \u201cThis had better be important,\u201d he snapped. Cause you\u2019re taking me away from paradise.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s important, all right, boss. Some jerkoff just tried to get access to your vault,\u201d Chad told him, voice flat and hard. \u201cThe guy stole a guard\u2019s suit and walked right up here.\u201d</p><p>His body tensed. \u201cWhere is the joker now?\u201d Drake turned his back on Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cHe knocked out two of the guards.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cAnd he...hell, it looks like he just left. Must\u2019ve realized that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to break through the vault\u2019s security system.\u201d</p><p>No, that didn\u2019t fit. The guy knocked out the guards, then left\u2014with nothing?</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice. Worried.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. She\u2019d sat up in his bed. Her body was naked. Flushed from the releases he\u2019d given her.</p><p>Beautiful, distracting Jasmine.</p><p>His jaw clenched as he put puzzle pieces together. \u201cThe devices last night were on timers...\u201d</p><p>At his words, Jasmine\u2019s gaze seemed to double in size. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she demanded as she rose from the bed. Her eyes were wide.</p><p>\u201cThose were just smoke bombs...\u201d But now Chad\u2019s voice was hard with an edge of worry.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s happening!\u201d Jasmine grabbed for his arm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond to her, but he told his security chief, \u201cMaybe those were just smoke last night, but maybe they aren\u2019t tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her hand tightened on him. \u201cWas someone at the Arrow?\u201d</p><p>As if she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Such a lying, beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Her nails dug into him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He eased the phone from his mouth. \u201cSomeone tried to get to the Arrow\u2019s vault. Attacked the men there but left without taking anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the word was a stark whisper from her as horror flashed across her face. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t taken anything yet. You have to get your men out of there! Close the casino!\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cYou know what he\u2019s doing.\u201d A set up. She\u2019s still playing me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pissed. If he went in...or if he sent someone else inside...anyone in that casino could be in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will he do, Jasmine?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know...I just...I don\u2019t want anyone hurt.\u201d</p><p>Liar. He\u2019d warned her about telling lies.</p><p>\u201cPlease, be safe.\u201d She was begging again, but not because of passion. \u201cGet the people out of there!\u201d</p><p>He brought the phone back to his lips. \u201cGet a sweep going\u2014now. Close the whole place down.\u201d Because even without Jasmine\u2019s words, his gut was clenching with an instinct that couldn\u2019t be denied.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Chad told him instantly.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s breath whispered out as Drake ended the call. She backed away from him. Still naked. Still staring up at him with secrets in her eyes.</p><p>But he was figuring out those secrets. And maybe I really did just get fucked. \u201cYou\u2019re the distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep me busy, while what...he goes after my money?\u201d She\u2019d been the one to tell him that he had to head down to New Orleans. A ruse, to get him away from the Arrow so her boss could attack.</p><p>He grabbed her, yanking her up on her toes. He\u2019d been lost in her, driven to the edge by his lust, when some of her cronies had been trying to rob him. \u201cWhat\u2019s he got planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rage erupted inside of him. \u201cDammit, I have friends in that casino. Innocent people in the club. Don\u2019t you try to cover\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her chin slipped up a notch. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about another attack on the Arrow! I thought he was trying to come after your property down here, not up there in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me.\u201d He\u2019d warned her before. There were no more warnings.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople could die, Jasmine. Stop screwing around and tell me what you know! You wanted my security guards to do a sweep. You knew that something could be happening.\u201d</p><p>She was silent.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered as she seemed to go limp in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m a dead woman now.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cLike you, Maxwell Case was ex-military.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell Case. She\u2019d just confirmed the SOB\u2019s identity. And she was still talking.</p><p>\u201cDemolitions were his specialty,\u201d her voice was muted. \u201cHe liked to\u2014liked to make things explode. That\u2019s what he told me.\u201d When her lashes lifted, her eyes shone with tears. \u201cWhen I was in his office, I...accessed his computer. Found blueprints for the Arrow. Information on the vault. That\u2019s how I knew where to put my smoke bombs. I used the plans I found on his computer. The placement was so obvious...I...it was just smoke for me, but I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be for him.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her away and called his head of security. \u201cChad?\u201d The man answered right away. \u201cGet the bomb squad in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse your connections. Get them there now, and make sure everyone else is out.\u201d</p><p>Because he would not have anyone dying on his watch.</p><p>Maxwell, you bastard...now I\u2019ll be coming after you.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you where to search,\u201d Jasmine whispered. \u201cI can tell you everything I saw on his computer...\u201d</p><p>The Arrow should\u2019ve blown. A controlled explosion that would\u2019ve given him access to all the cash in that casino.</p><p>Not that Maxwell Case needed cash.</p><p>He wanted to make a fucking point.</p><p>But the bomb squad came. The place didn\u2019t blow. They found all of his devices. In record time.</p><p>As if they knew just where to look...as if they knew exactly what he\u2019d planned.</p><p>Jasmine.</p><p>That little bitch. She had always seen and understood far more than most people realized. It was that deceptively delicate appearance. When you looked that fragile, people expected you to be weak.</p><p>Jasmine was the smartest woman he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>She was also a dead woman.</p><p>You told him, Jasmine.</p><p>She\u2019d figured out his game. Figured out how much Maxwell liked the fire. Ah, now that was a shame. He\u2019d had such grand plans for Jasmine.</p><p>But she\u2019d gone and wrecked everything.</p><p>He slid into the back of the limo that waited for him. One that had been parked blocks away from the Arrow.</p><p>\u201cHome, sir?\u201d his driver asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Because there would be no fireworks that night. He pulled out his phone. Pressed the number for the hunter who was proving to be nothing but useless. \u201cHardin, where the hell is she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence. Then, voice breaking a bit, the hunter confessed, \u201cShe flew away with him...to New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell nearly smashed the phone. Jasmine wasn\u2019t supposed to leave town. She should\u2019ve returned to him.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m boarding a flight now,\u201d Hardin stammered out. \u201cI\u2019ll be right on her tail.\u201d</p> <p>So will I.</p><p>Jasmine...beautiful bitch. She\u2019d switched allegiances. Told Archer about the bombs. Even when she shouldn\u2019t have known about them.</p><p>And now...now she\u2019d suffer.</p><p>He had a special way of paying back those who betrayed him.</p><p>Jasmine, baby, you\u2019re going to burn.</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cThey found three explosives.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s eyes squeezed closed at this news. She was out on Drake\u2019s balcony, clad now in jeans and a t-shirt. The rain had stopped, but she knew the storm was far from over.</p><p>\u201cThey were all right in the exact spots you said.\u201d His hand closed around her shoulder as he turned her to face him.</p><p>She forced herself to hold his furious stare.</p><p>\u201cYou knew what he was doing.\u201d</p> <p>The rage on his face terrified her. \u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew every spot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no one was hurt?\u201d</p><p>Grimly, he shook his head and she was finally able to draw in a deep breath. \u201cThank God.\u201d She\u2019d been terrified that someone would get hurt before the bombs could be deactivated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working for a sadistic asshole who plants bombs.\u201d His hold was almost painful. \u201cSo you\u2019ve done this before...just stood by while innocent people suffered. While they were hurt, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The scream broke from her because it was too much. \u201cI haven\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d So he really thought that of her, huh? Not surprising. Most people had been sure she was just trash all her life. Just like dear old mom. \u201cHe gave me the specs to get in to the casino. I told you, he had the blueprints.\u201d Blueprints that she\u2019d discovered when she did a bit of snooping on his computer. \u201cI knew about his demolitions past, okay? And I just put two and two together when you told me that someone was back at your casino. I wanted to make sure everyone was safe.\u201d</p><p>He had no clue what she\u2019d just done. Maxwell would discover that his devices had been found. He\u2019d also soon connect the dots and realize that she was the person who\u2019d seen the blueprints. She\u2019d been the one in his office. He would know that. She\u2019d had access to his computer, and getting past his computer\u2019s security system had been all too easy for her.</p><p>When he realized what she\u2019d done, Maxwell would come after her.</p> <p>I\u2019m a dead woman. None of her connections would be able to save her this time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like he rose to power easily in Vegas.\u201d She\u2019d read the newspaper stories. Had done her own research. \u201cHe told me once that he had to fight his way to the top of the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working with him.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI took one job for him. I was supposed to get that business intel on your computer. Nothing more. I swear, I swear, I would never do anything to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou crawled into bed with the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at that. The memory of being in Drake\u2019s bed was too strong. I can still feel him on my skin. In me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to destroy him,\u201d Drake told her flatly. \u201cNo one comes after me like this. No one.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her away. As if he didn\u2019t want to touch her anymore. Then he turned his back on her. Left her out there on that balcony.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d She took a quick step forward.</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn at her call.</p><p>Jasmine hurried after him. \u201cDrake, please, it\u2019s not what you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. Didn\u2019t talk to her. Didn\u2019t even stop in the den. He left the big, cavernous house. Left her standing there, with her arms wrapped around her stomach.</p><p>He said he\u2019d protect me.</p><p>But he was leaving her. He\u2019d fucked her, just like he\u2019d said he would.</p><p>More like fucked me over.</p><p>Jasmine felt as if she were about to shatter into a million pieces.</p><p>Maxwell planted bombs in the casino. People could\u2019ve died. He wouldn\u2019t be done, not yet. His attack hadn\u2019t worked, so he\u2019d make a new plan. That was how he operated. Why he was so very dangerous.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop, not until his enemies were eliminated.</p><p>She hurried toward the phone in the den, her whole body shaking. Picking up the phone on the nearby table\u2014Jasmine\u2019s phone was some place back in Vegas\u2014she called him blindly.</p><p>Maxwell answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Jasmine whispered.</p><p>\u201cJasmine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBombs, Max? Dear God, there were people in there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found my plans...naughty girl.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d found blueprints. She hadn\u2019t realized just how important they were, not until that moment in Drake\u2019s bedroom. A robbery was one thing. A bombing was another. \u201cI\u2019m going to the cops.\u201d She\u2019d tell them everything she knew about Max.</p><p>\u201cThe cops won\u2019t save you.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose on her arms.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I deal with betrayal, Jazz.\u201d Jazz...a nickname that had followed her for so long that it had become her codename in the business.</p><p>You wanted information retrieved from a rival...call Jazz.</p><p>You needed a computer hacked...call Jazz.</p><p>You need a life destroyed...</p><p>A sob rose in her throat. \u201cI\u2019m telling them everything. You\u2019re done. You should just...you should get on a plane and get the hell out of the country. Run, while you still can.\u201d</p><p>His low laughter slipped over the line. \u201cMy, but you must be upset...because you didn\u2019t even try to block this number when you called me. Such an amateur mistake. But then, I already knew you were with him in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>The sob choked her. No, she hadn\u2019t tried to block the call. What would have been the point? When she\u2019d been on Maxwell\u2019s computer, she\u2019d seen the file he had on Drake...a file that had contained the addresses and telephone numbers for all of Drake\u2019s homes. This place in the Quarter, the estate in Vegas, the\u2014</p><p>\u201cI know where you are, Jazz, and I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d</p><p>No. No! \u201cStay away from me. Stay away from Drake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you in the Big Easy, love. I\u2019ll find you, and then I\u2019ll finish my business with Drake.\u201d</p><p>He hated Drake. She didn\u2019t even know why. Surely this wasn\u2019t just about business?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you just how beautiful I can make the flames,\u201d Maxwell promised her. \u201cThey\u2019ll be nearly as beautiful as you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s coming to kill me.</p><p>\u201cStay away from Drake,\u201d she repeated as she swiped at the stupid tears on her cheeks. \u201cAnd you need\u2014you need to run. You think he was the only one that I hacked? I was in your office, too, Max. I\u2019ve got your files. I\u2019ve got your business. I\u2019ve got your life.\u201d</p><p>Silence, then... \u201cYou\u2019re playing out of your league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be in this nightmare at all. You forced my hand.\u201d Now...turnabout, asshole. \u201cStay away from him.\u201d</p><p>He hung up on her.</p><p>Her gaze flew around the house.</p><p>Then Jasmine did the only thing she could...she ran. It was a good thing that she\u2019d had plenty of practice at running.</p><p>I ran away for the first time when I was fifteen. I wasn\u2019t going to let her use me...wasn\u2019t going to let those men touch me.</p><p>I ran then.</p><p>And she would keep running, for as long as it took. She\u2019d run until she was safe.</p><p>Drake stared down at the crowd in his casino, the Masquerade. The New Orleans place was his crown jewel. Right on the riverfront, perfect for the tourists. Perfect for those looking to live on the edge.</p><p>The floor was mostly empty below him. Dawn had come, and in a few hours, the place would begin to fill.</p><p>Coins would fall into the slot machines. The tables would be surrounded. Roulette, Black Jack, Craps...</p><p>They\u2019d come for the thrill. The thrill drew them back again and again.</p><p>Like moths to the flame...they\u2019d all get burned sooner or later.</p><p>\u201cWe all do,\u201d he muttered as he turned away from them.</p><p>He\u2019d been burned. Jasmine. She was so tangled up with Maxwell. A lying, deceiving, murderous\u2014</p><p>\u201cMr. Archer? There\u2019s a...a federal agent here to see you.\u201d</p><p>He turned at his assistant\u2019s hesitant voice. Janet stood in the doorway, her hair pulled back in its usual elegant twist. Her hands hovered nervously in the air. \u201cHe said it was urgent.\u201d</p><p>Great. Just what he didn\u2019t need then. Trouble with some government jerk. \u201cTell him I\u2019m not available\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d buy that BS,\u201d a male replied as he shouldered in after Janet. The man\u2019s sharp gaze flickered assessing over Drake. \u201cEspecially since I saw you saunter up here five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Janet had actually brought the guy to his office?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the badge,\u201d the fellow said with a hard grin. \u201cAnd the gun...they tend to get action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Janet whispered.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d Drake rolled back his shoulders. \u201cJust shut the door on your way out.\u201d He\u2019d have this guy hitting the street in moments. Not like it was the first time an agent had paid him a visit. Sometimes, the visits were about his past. About the missions he\u2019d done. And sometimes, they were even about Uncle Sam needing him to help again.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t really leave the business. Not for good. Some ties were never broken.</p><p>The door softly closed behind Janet.</p><p>Drake took his seat and motioned for the agent. \u201cDidn\u2019t catch your name\u2014\u201d</p><p>The guy flashed his ID. \u201cSpecial Agent Victor Monroe.\u201d</p><p>The name meant nothing. \u201cAnd what can I do for you this incredibly early morning, Agent?\u201d Drake didn\u2019t bother keeping the impatience from his voice.</p><p>The agent eased into the chair across from him.</p><p>\u201cI was informed of the...scare you had at your Vegas casino recently.\u201d</p><p>Drake let his brows climb. That had been very recently. \u201cYour intel is fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree bombs,\u201d the guy reminded him. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of news that has to pass quickly.\u201d</p><p>Drake waited for the agent to continue.</p><p>Victor cleared his throat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice those bombs were found rather easily, as if you had a map leading straight to them...\u201d</p><p>Drake kept staring.</p><p>Victor leaned forward. \u201cTell me where she is.\u201d</p><p>The hell, no. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re alone in here, so cut the bull. I need to find Jazz.\u201d</p><p>Jazz? The agent\u2019s tone had far too much familiarity for Drake. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap. She left Vegas with you. My intel put her on your plane, and the way you found those bombs, so damn fast, I know she told you about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis little visit is over.\u201d Drake rose and glared at the guy. Get the hell out of here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her in,\u201d Victor said as he stood. The guy was almost as tall as Drake. Victor\u2019s hair was a dark brown, and his eyes, a light blue, were hard with intensity. \u201cSo save me some time and tell me where she is. If she\u2019s here at the casino\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind criminals on your own time. Not mine.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s jaw hardened. \u201cAh, so you know what she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her on your own,\u201d he gritted out again. He\u2019d walked away from her. There was no way she was still at his house.</p><p>Hell, he hadn\u2019t even locked the door on his way out. Hadn\u2019t even put a guard on her.</p><p>Because I don\u2019t want her anymore. Because I won\u2019t let another beautiful, lying woman try to destroy me and the people close to me.</p><p>I. Don\u2019t. Want. Her.</p><p>And there was no one there to call him a liar.</p><p>\u201cAh, I don\u2019t think you actually grasp the urgency of the situation.\u201d Victor leaned over Drake\u2019s desk, resting his hands on the old wood. \u201cI need Jazz, and I need her now. She\u2019s to be placed in federal custody immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she said that she wasn\u2019t running from the law,\u201d Drake muttered. \u201cAnother lie.\u201d How unsurprising.</p><p>Victor\u2019s eyelashes flickered. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I understand just fine. Jasmine is a liar and a thief, and she\u2019s not my problem anymore.\u201d The words were hard. They had to be.</p><p>He would not think of the way Jasmine had looked when he\u2019d last seen her on that balcony. The pain that he\u2019d heard in her voice as she called out after him.</p><p>She was playing him.</p><p>Just like\u2014</p><p>No. He slammed the door on that memory.</p><p>The FBI agent pulled out a card. Tossed it on his desk. \u201cIf you should see the liar and thief, call me. I\u2019ll take her off your hands.\u201d But Victor\u2019s whole manner had changed. The guy seemed pissed.</p><p>Join the club, buddy.</p><p>Victor gave him a little salute then he strode from the office. Did he mutter \u201cDick\u201d on his way out? Drake\u2019s eyes narrowed. The door closed with a near slam.</p><p>Drake waited about twenty seconds, then he grabbed his phone. The text he shot to Trace was blunt.</p><p>What the fuck did you find?</p><p>His fingers drummed on his desk. He waited for a text back, but instead, his phone vibrated. He answered immediately. \u201cYou called back, so I know the shit is bad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still working on the details, okay? Your girl\u2019s past is tangled and twisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not,\u201d Drake managed to push out, \u201cmy girl.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cWell, that plays, since I\u2019m getting rumors she\u2019s been claimed by Maxwell Case.\u201d</p> <p>His blood burned, then turned straight to ice in Drake\u2019s veins. \u201cShe\u2019s his lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m picking up, and, man, that guy is trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d Jasmine and Maxwell. Jasmine fucking Maxwell. His hand was a fist on the desk. His temples felt as if they were about to explode.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have proof on that relationship, just rumors. But it\u2019s looking like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sent her to me.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not a whore. Grim pride had cloaked around her as Jasmine spoke those words to him.</p><p>He pushed back his shoulders as he tried to shove her image away.</p><p>\u201cShe was born in Kendall, Texas. Her mother was Shirley Bennett, and no father was listed on her birth certificate. Shirley had over a dozen arrests for prostitution so\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not a whore.</p><p>His fist slammed into the desk. That pain in her voice had been real.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe Shirley didn\u2019t even know who Jasmine\u2019s father was. Seems your gir\u2014uh, Jasmine ran away when she was fifteen, and that\u2019s when things get harder to track.\u201d</p> <p>Fifteen? He straightened. \u201cWhat about before then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, before? She was just a kid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was she like?\u201d Why had he just asked that shit?</p><p>\u201cStraight A\u2019s, actually. I got access to her grades. Schools are always the easiest to hack. She was one of those never-in-trouble types.\u201d</p><p>His thief had been a good girl?</p><p>\u201cShe was taking AP classes in math and science and her teachers had been hoping she\u2019d be able to get a scholarship, but then she...left.\u201d</p><p>Ran away. To something?</p><p>Or ran from something?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep digging but the woman\u2019s life after fifteen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good with computers.\u201d He rubbed his hand against his throbbing temples. \u201cVery good. So good I think she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be able to cover her own trail.\u201d Now Trace was annoyed. \u201cYou should have mentioned that point before.\u201d He rallied quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got my own team of hackers. It\u2019ll take us some time, but we\u2019ll discover her secrets.\u201d</p><p>Drake headed out onto the balcony that overlooked Canal Street. Glancing down below, he saw Victor storming from the Casino. \u201cAn FBI Agent named Victor Monroe just left my office. He was looking for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you give her up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not mine to give. I don\u2019t know where she is.\u201d Her image flashed before him once more. On that balcony, her face had been so pale. She\u2019d almost looked...broken. Appearances can be deceiving. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely working with Maxwell. I won\u2019t let another woman set me up for death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if she\u2019s working for him, then how come she told you all about the bombs?\u201d</p><p>Of course, Trace would already know about them. After the visit from the FBI guy, Drake was wondering who didn\u2019t know. \u201cShe told me about them because Jasmine didn\u2019t want anyone at the casino to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, quite the cold-blooded bitch, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Now Trace\u2019s voice was mocking. \u201cJust like Anna Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Drake bit out. \u201cDon\u2019t say her name to me.\u201d Because he was so sick of remembering. Anna Jean\u2019s lies. Anna Jean\u2019s life.</p><p>Her death.</p><p>At his hands.</p><p>\u201cNot every woman is like her,\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was soft.</p><p>\u201cYou mean your woman isn\u2019t like her.\u201d Skye. Trace had been obsessed with Skye for years. But the bastard was lucky\u2014Skye loved him, too. Enough to risk her life for him.</p><p>Silence hummed on the line, then Trace said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>Drake had to laugh at that even as he kept staring at the street below. \u201cReally? You mean someone else drove the knife into her? Because I sure as hell remember her blood being on my hands.\u201d The agent had disappeared. \u201cCall me when you learn more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait man, look, don\u2019t do anything stupid, okay?\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cYou take too many risks. You\u2019ve been walking on the edge for a while, and I don\u2019t want you falling over.\u201d</p><p>Too late. He\u2019d gone over the edge long ago.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Jasmine can help you,\u201d Trace added. \u201cIf she\u2019s valuable to Maxwell and the guy is gunning for you, then maybe you should team up with her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Valuable. The wheels began to spin in his head. \u201cMaybe I can use her.\u201d The idea had whispered through his mind once before.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was a bark. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I said work with her. But wait until I can find out more, okay? Leave this to me and you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting on the edge.\u201d Drake ended the call. Maybe he had been too hasty when he walked away from her. If Maxwell was screwing Jasmine, wouldn\u2019t the guy plan to come after her? And to think, Jasmine had tried to act afraid of the fellow.</p><p>I\u2019m dead...</p><p>The fear had sounded so real to him. She was one fine actress. Maybe even better than Anna Jean had been.</p><p>She\u2019d asked Drake to protect her from Maxwell. She\u2019d given him her body. Told him enough to keep his casino safe. Yes, he could use her. He could learn more.</p><p>And he would make absolutely sure that he never gave the woman the chance to betray him again.</p><p>Jasmine hadn\u2019t expected the sheer number of people who packed Bourbon Street at nightfall. They drifted in and out of the bars, some hung over the edge of the balconies, and some made out in doorways. Drinks were flowing heavily. Laughter filled the air, and everywhere Jasmine turned, bodies seemed to brush against her.</p><p>Getting lost in the crowd here would be easy. It would be\u2014</p><p>Her gaze fell on a brightly lit doorway. A woman stood there, barely dressed. Only the woman looked young. So very young. She was motioning toward some frat boys, inviting them in for a dance.</p><p>A private dance.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s gaze slid to the left. Another brightly lit doorway. Another woman beckoning for a dance.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the drinks that were flowing on Bourbon Street.</p><p>Jasmine stared at those women, and her own past stared back at her.</p><p>Mama\u2019s tired tonight, and he...he likes you, baby. Why don\u2019t you help me out? Just do a little dance for him. Come on...he\u2019ll pay you.</p><p>Jasmine turned away from those women and she began to shove her way through the crowd. It had been the perfect place to hide earlier, but now, now this place was suffocating her. Too many bodies. Too many hands brushing against her.</p><p>Too many memories that she could never forget.</p><p>\u201cHey, where\u2019s the rush?\u201d A man was in front of her. Blond hair, just like Drake\u2019s, big with stretching shoulders. Only...he wasn\u2019t Drake.</p><p>Drake was gone. No protection. No hope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a date,\u201d she muttered as she tried to step around him.</p><p>But he stepped with her. \u201cI can be your date.\u201d He had an overflowing drink in his hand, and under the streetlights, his eyes gleamed. \u201cI can be anything you want me to be.\u201d</p><p>I want you to be out of my way. She bit those words back and gave him a weak smile. \u201cNot gonna happen tonight, handsome. I\u2019m taken.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and eased aside, moving off in search of new prey.</p><p>Jasmine exhaled heavily and took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cTaken?\u201d</p><p>She stilled. That voice was low and deep, and she knew it could only belong to one man. Because that voice\u2014that man\u2014had been the one to break through the careful wall that she\u2019d put around herself.</p><p>He\u2019d hurt her. When no one else had, not in so very long.</p><p>The crowd seemed to part around him. Drake wasn\u2019t wearing his expensive suit and coat. He wore jeans. A battered jacket. He looked big and tough and dangerous. Sexy, damn it.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t realize you were taken. Didn\u2019t realize you belonged to someone.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to be anger hardening his voice and eyes.</p><p>Good. She had plenty of her own anger.</p><p>You made me feel like a whore. No, she would not say those words to him. But when he\u2019d left her there at that house, her body still humming with pleasure even as fear swamped her, and he hadn\u2019t looked back...Drake had changed everything for her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, Drake. And you never will.\u201d This time, she was the one who turned on her heel and walked away. See how it feels, jerk.</p><p>\u201cJasmine.\u201d</p><p>He said her name like it was a demand. No, a command. Like she was just supposed to stop because he was there and actually speaking to her again.</p><p>Screw. You. Jasmine lifted her hand, waving one fun finger back at him, then she picked up her pace. So what if she\u2019d just left this particular corner not two minutes ago? She could retreat this way if she wanted.</p><p>Her gaze slid over to the right and she noticed that the women weren\u2019t in those doorways anymore. Wait, new women were there.</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t call her name again. She didn\u2019t look back to see if he was still standing there, a big, unbreakable statue, or if he was following her.</p><p>When she hit the next intersection, Jasmine turned and snaked down the other street. A much quieter street. Then she ducked into an alley. Sure, she was almost running now, but she\u2019d left the bustle of Bourbon behind her. Actually, by just heading over a few blocks, she\u2019d seemed to leave everything behind.</p><p>Silence surrounded her.</p><p>Shadows loomed.</p><p>And...</p><p>\u201cJasmine.\u201d</p><p>That voice hadn\u2019t come from behind her. A man stepped from the shadows. \u201cWe always seem to meet in alleys,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was just not her night.</p><p>That voice didn\u2019t belong to Drake. It belonged to another man who she\u2019d hoped to never see again.</p><p>Wayne Hardin. So-called bounty hunter.</p><p>Hired thug.</p><p>\u201cYou followed me? All the way to New Orleans?\u201d Jasmine had thought that she had a little more time on her own. She slanted a quick glance around the area. She didn\u2019t see anyone else. Thankfully, there was no sign of Maxwell.</p><p>There was also no sign of Drake. She figured he was still back on Bourbon Street. Maybe he hadn\u2019t even been looking for her out there. Maybe he\u2019d been looking to party. He\u2019d been dressed casually, and he hadn\u2019t exactly fallen at her feet and begged for forgiveness...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t stop until I bring in my bounty.\u201d</p><p>Her breath felt cold in her lungs. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for another knife wound.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands toward her. \u201cGot my orders. You\u2019re to be brought in, with not so much as a scratch on you.\u201d</p><p>Now that was just a mistake. He shouldn\u2019t have told her that. Because she planned to do more than just scratch him.</p><p>\u201cThe boss wants you,\u201d Wayne added.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t always have what we want.\u201d She reached into her bag. A cute little bag that she\u2019d picked up in town at a boutique next to a Voodoo shop.</p><p>She\u2019d also picked up something else. Not at the Voodoo shop, but from a very helpful man she\u2019d met.</p><p>Jasmine drew out her gun. \u201cHere\u2019s how this will play out. You\u2019re going to turn around and walk away. You\u2019re going to tell Maxwell that you never saw me. And, in return, I won\u2019t shoot you. I\u2019ll be super generous and call us even.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna shoot me. You don\u2019t have the guts.\u201d</p><p>Idiot. This wasn\u2019t the time to insult her. \u201cOf course, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hack computers. Snoop in files...\u201d He was closing in on her. \u201cYou don\u2019t get blood on your hands.\u201d</p><p>She kept a tight grip on the weapon. \u201cTurn around and walk away.\u201d He couldn\u2019t scratch her. She could shoot him. The wound in her side seemed to throb. It would be both payback and self-defense.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he gonna do, when Maxwell gets you back?\u201d Wayne asked her as he kept closing in. \u201cI don\u2019t get to hurt you, but I\u2019m betting he does.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t planning to find out. \u201cI\u2019m going to count to five, and if you aren\u2019t out of here by the time I get to five...I will shoot you.\u201d</p><p>It was too dark for her to see his face.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>He was still coming toward her.</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine heard a faint rustle of sound. Close by. But she wasn\u2019t about to look away from the threat before her.</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d she snapped. Did he think she was bluffing? Jasmine aimed for his shoulder. Come on, man. Back off.</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d Her hands were sweating. Her heart racing. He wasn\u2019t going to stop. She\u2019d have to shoot.</p><p>Jasmine squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cFi\u2014\u201d</p><p>A thud had her eyes flying right back open. She saw that Wayne was on the ground and another shadow loomed over him. Wayne surged upright and attacked that shadow.</p><p>Great. Fabulous. Those two could just fight it out. She didn\u2019t know if that was a mugger or another one of Maxwell\u2019s henchmen, and she wasn\u2019t sticking around to find out.</p><p>Jasmine sprinted on down that alley.</p><p>\u201cJasmine!\u201d The roar of her name came from the mystery shadow. That roar belonged to Drake.</p><p>She spun around. He was already running toward her and he\u2014</p><p>Snatched the gun from her hand. \u201cA gun? Are you serious?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had been. Only... \u201cIt wasn\u2019t loaded,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d He grabbed her arm and started hauling her to who the heck knew where.</p><p>Frantic, Jasmine glanced over her shoulder. \u201cWhat about Wayne? Is he\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlive and running away.\u201d</p><p>She heard the thud of footsteps then. Well, she thought that she heard them. It was hard to tell because of her frantically beating heart and her own rushed footsteps. \u201cGuess after last time, he didn\u2019t want to mess with you again.\u201d</p><p>He shoved the gun into the waistband of his jeans. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was mostly thinking about survival.\u201d She struggled to keep up with his fast pace.</p><p>\u201cA gun? No bullets?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never used a gun before.\u201d Wayne had been so right on that one. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to accidentally shoot myself.\u201d She also hadn\u2019t been prepared to shoot anyone else. Score another point for the bounty hunter. He seemed to know his prey pretty well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d Drake finally stopped the dragging and stalking routine. His hand dropped away from her.</p><p>They were in the darkness, no street lights around, so she couldn\u2019t see his face, but Jasmine was sure she didn\u2019t want to read his expression anyway. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to follow me. Why don\u2019t you just wander right back over to Bourbon Street and forget all about me, okay? I can handle myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d</p><p>Jerk. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it just fine for twenty-eight years,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got a bounty hunter on your tail! Him and an FBI Agent!\u201d</p> <p>Her breath huffed out in surprise. Was he talking about Victor Monroe? \u201cWh-what FBI Agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who is chomping at the bit to get you into custody. The way I see it, I\u2019m the only thing standing between you and two very bad spots.\u201d</p><p>Wayne.</p><p>The FBI.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d She inched away from him.</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you explain things to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left me.\u201d Wow, okay, that was a lot of rage cracking there. She hadn\u2019t meant to say\u2014 \u201cYou said you\u2019d keep me safe, and at the first opportunity, you walked away without a backwards glance. I trusted you!\u201d</p><p>She had not meant to say any of that. Not a word. How had all of that just erupted out of her mouth?</p> <p>Jasmine snapped her lips closed.</p><p>Drake just stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d Jasmine ordered as she started to brush by him.</p><p>His fingers caught her wrist. \u201cOr what? You\u2019ll count to five and pretend to shoot me?\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d heard all that? He\u2019d been in the shadows, silent and watchful, while she\u2019d been terrified? Jasmine tried to yank her wrist from him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny! It\u2019s not a game. It\u2019s my life\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled her flush against him. \u201cI know it\u2019s no game. The people in that casino that your lover tried to bomb\u2014they matter to me.\u201d</p><p>Her lover? \u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my lover, okay? I don\u2019t know what you think you know or what you\u2019ve heard, but he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Like I\u2019m supposed to believe your lies. You screwed me. You screwed him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Her voice was flat and cold.</p><p>And...Drake stepped away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you stand there and judge me. Don\u2019t ever say things like that to me again, do you understand?\u201d That rage was back, and she didn\u2019t care that she was on a street corner in the Big Easy. She didn\u2019t care that a bounty hunter and an FBI agent could both be hunting her.</p><p>Her pride was too brittle. Her pain too strong.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be with you. You gave me pleasure, and I-I thought I gave you the same thing.\u201d His hands lifted as if he\u2019d touch her again. She couldn\u2019t let him do that. Jasmine jumped away from Drake. \u201cThen you turned your back on me as if I were nothing. You wouldn\u2019t even talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasmine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sex life is my own. I don\u2019t judge you. Don\u2019t question you. And you have no right to throw accusations at me.\u201d She turned away from him, her shoulders hunching. \u201cAnd you have no right,\u201d now her voice was hoarse, \u201cto make me feel like I\u2019m a whore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>She tried to draw in a shuddering breath but she couldn\u2019t because he had his hands on her. He\u2019d spun her around to face him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a whore, and I\u2019m sorry...\u201d His words roughened. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I made you feel that way. You touched me, got to me too deep, and I struck out at you.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her and pulled Jasmine against his chest. She could feel the frantic rhythm of his heartbeat beneath her ear. \u201cYou were too close, and I was an idiot for trying to push you away.\u201d</p><p>Stupid hope started to grow in her chest. No one...no one had ever said anything like that to her before. You were too close. He spoke as if she mattered to him, and he sounded so sincere.</p><p>Believe him. That was the voice of the desperate girl she\u2019d been, so long ago. The one who\u2019d imagined that people could be good. That life wasn\u2019t always about the darkness she saw all around her every single day.</p><p>She\u2019d imagined that men could love. It wasn\u2019t always just about buying pleasure for a night.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come back with me.\u201d</p><p>Such beautiful, tempting words. But... \u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasmine, come back with me. Please.\u201dAh, that strangled word was lovely, but he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake. I-I called Maxwell from your house. He would\u2019ve had your address already,\u201d she said, rushing out those words but they didn\u2019t exactly alleviate her guilt. \u201cBut already he knew that I was there, with you.\u201d He would\u2019ve already known the exact location of that house. \u201cHe said he was coming after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him come. I want to face the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Drake was tough, sure, and he\u2019d done his time in the military, but the guy wasn\u2019t on Maxwell\u2019s twisted level\u2014Maxwell had no conscience. He would hurt anyone who got in his way. \u201cHe sent Wayne after me, and Maxwell won\u2019t be far behind.\u201d She should pull out of his arms. She didn\u2019t. \u201cI have to go so that Maxwell will follow me.\u201d</p><p>He eased away. Just enough to stare down at her in the darkness. \u201cYou think that if you leave, he won\u2019t come after me? That he\u2019ll focus just on you?\u201d</p><p>No, she thought he\u2019d still go after Drake, but she had a plan.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve kept that bounty hunter,\u201d Drake said, the words low and hard. \u201cMade him talk.\u201d</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>Drake shook his head. \u201cWait. What the hell am I doing? I know better. We can\u2019t just stay out here.\u201d And he was back to pulling her down the street. Or rather, he pulled her back to Canal Street and she was sure grateful to see the bright lights and cars again. Drake opened the door of a Porsche for her, one that had been parked near the edge of the street.</p><p>Another Porsche?</p><p>Before she could question the man\u2019s choice of cars, he was driving away with her.</p><p>And she just let him do it.</p><p>The city passed in a blur and she pounded her head against the seat rest.</p><p>She felt his eyes sweep over her. \u201cWant to tell me what that\u2019s about?\u201d</p><p>That? Her head-pounding routine? \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be trusting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>That point should be obvious. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll hurt me again.\u201d</p><p>They stopped at a red light. Jasmine looked toward Drake, and she saw his fingers tighten around the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cYou get to me,\u201d she confessed. That was the whole reason she was in the car with him right then and not running like mad down the streets of New Orleans. \u201cYou make me feel...feel in ways I haven\u2019t before.\u201d</p><p>His head turned. He held her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou were looking for me.\u201d It hadn\u2019t just been a walk on the wild side of Bourbon Street.</p><p>Drake nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d So much depended on what he had to say. Her fingers curved around the handle of the door. She could jump out. Flee fast right then and get on the trolley.</p><p>\u201cBecause I need you.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s breath left her in a rush.</p><p>A car horn sounded behind them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take me back to your house in the Quarter. He\u2019ll just have eyes there.\u201d Maxwell would have eyes everywhere.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, princess,\u201d Drake said as he drove them forward. \u201cFrom here on out, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d Wayne said into his phone as he hurried down the New Orleans\u2019 street. \u201cBut Archer is still sticking to her like glue\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to pull her away from him?\u201d</p><p>Wayne glanced to the left. To the right. The street looked deserted. \u201cThe bastard is tough. I\u2019m just biding my time until I can attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re being a coward. And your services\u2014they\u2019re rather disappointing.\u201d</p><p>Lights flashed on then. Bright and blinding. Lights from a car that shouldn\u2019t have been so close.</p><p>If I\u2019m watching Jasmine...who does he have on me? That thought rushed through his mind once more. Too late, this time.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Wayne whispered.</p><p>\u201cDisappointing and no longer needed. And...by the way...\u201d</p><p>The car was accelerating toward him. Wayne tried to run.</p><p>He had to make it across the street. Maybe he could break down the door of that old voodoo shop and\u2014</p><p>The car didn\u2019t hit him.</p><p>Bullets did.</p><p>And then Wayne hit the pavement.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>When she walked through the casino, she could hear the slot machines, playing like music. No, playing over the music that filled the Masquerade. She spun around, her gaze caught by the glitter and glamour all around her. The casino was decorated in Mardi Gras style, with purple, gold, and green colors featured prominently. Large masks hung on the walls, masks that seemed to watch the casino-goers with glee.</p><p>The place was gorgeous. Phenomenal.</p><p>Then Jasmine looked up\u2014up at the chandeliers that shone like diamonds above her. Amazing.</p><p>Drake\u2019s arm wrapped around her waist. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>She thought about the home she\u2019d had as a kid. The old trailer on the rough patch of land that no one else wanted. \u201cIt\u2019s...a little excessive.\u201d</p><p>He laughed lightly. \u201cIt was the trees in the lobby, right?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even know how those trees\u2014real trees\u2014were alive out in the lobby.</p><p>\u201cWhen you come from nothing,\u201d Drake said as he guided her toward a private elevator. \u201cSometimes you want everything.\u201d He swiped a keycard over the security control panel, and the elevator\u2019s doors slid open.</p><p>The mirrored walls of the elevator tossed Jasmine\u2019s reflection right back at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Drake asked her.</p><p>The elevator was rising. He was close to her. So very close. Drake seemed to fill that small space.</p><p>She had decided to be as honest with him as she could be. Because Drake mattered and, most shocking of all, he seemed to be saying that she mattered to him, too.</p><p>I need you.</p><p>\u201cI want to belong.\u201d To some place. To somebody. She wanted a home. A real one. When the holidays came around, she wanted to bake cookies and stare up at a Christmas tree and be held in the arms of a man who loved her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be alone forever.</p><p>\u201cYou can belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Her knees did a little jiggle. Had the elevator stopped rising? The doors hadn\u2019t opened but it felt as if they weren\u2019t moving any longer.</p><p>He came toward her and put his hands on either side of her, pressing his palms flat against the mirror behind her and caging Jasmine against his body. \u201cDo you want to belong to me?\u201d</p><p>Her head was spinning. She\u2019d thought that he\u2019d just walked away from her. But he\u2019d searched for her. Protected her, again, and now he was offering her...</p><p>Hope.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you.\u201d The attraction she felt for him was unlike anything she\u2019d experienced before. When he touched her, Jasmine\u2019s heart raced. When he kissed her, she went molten. And when he was in her, she exploded.</p><p>\u201cThen be with me.\u201d His head lowered. His lips brushed against hers.</p><p>The kiss was tender. Open-mouthed. Hot. And she was molten\u2014again. Jasmine knew her panties were getting wet. She wanted to shove off his clothes. To have sex with him right there. Then.</p><p>No restrictions. No fears. She wanted the pleasure he could give here once more.</p><p>Without the shame.</p><p>Her hand pushed against his chest.</p><p>Drake\u2019s head lifted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t walk away again.\u201d She couldn\u2019t handle that. Not from him.</p><p>Drake nodded. His gaze held hers. \u201cAnd don\u2019t run from me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes searched his. There was something there, in his stare. An emotion that she couldn\u2019t quite define.</p><p>\u201cBecause if you ran, then I\u2019d be like Maxwell. Chasing you through the streets.\u201d His laugh held a rough edge. \u201cOr I guess I already am like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her denial was swift. \u201cYou could never be like him.\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed near his jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe here,\u201d Drake told her. \u201cSecurity has been doubled. Maxwell and his men won\u2019t get to you here.\u201d He backed away. Used that keycard again and the doors opened. \u201cI have a room here that we can use for the night. Private quarters that I keep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sleeping wasn\u2019t exactly high on her priority list.</p><p>She followed him from the elevator.</p><p>But he stilled in that small hallway. \u201cI\u2019m going to destroy him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t like what I do. But it\u2019s going to happen. Then you\u2019ll never have to worry about running from anyone again.\u201d</p><p>His words caused fear to rush through her, but in the next moment, he had her in his arms. He was carrying her\u2014carrying her!\u2014into his private quarters. Into the bedroom attached there. He stripped her slowly. Using so much care, when, before, he\u2019d been frantic in his need.</p><p>His hands slid over her body. His caresses seemed to cherish her. She had to blink away tears because she knew what he was doing.</p><p>I felt like a whore.</p> <p>\u201cI want to see your pleasure, princess.\u201d</p><p>And now he was treating her like someone precious.</p><p>He stroked her and caressed her until Jasmine was about to go out of her head. He\u2019d been demanding before, and he still was\u2014but only demanding her pleasure.</p><p>He caught her nipples in his hands. Thumbed the peaks, had her gasping. Fire rushed to her sex as he kissed and stroked his way down her body. He seemed to be even more careful on the flesh around her bandage, but Jasmine didn\u2019t even feel an ache from a wound. She was too focused on him.</p><p>His mouth pushed over her core. His tongue licked her clit, and when she arched off the bed, he locked his hands around her hips and took even more of her.</p><p>She climaxed with a fury so hard that the room went dark. Her heart was a drumbeat in her ears. Her breaths panted out. The pleasure twisted her up, shook her. It was amazing. He was amazing.</p> <p>Then he...he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d He left her there on the bed, still shuddering and quaking. His hand smoothed over her, once, so carefully, then he retreated.</p><p>She watched, heartbeat still not back to its normal rhythm, as he stopped near the window.</p><p>Drake gazed out at the city below. She could practically feel the intensity of his desire filling that room. But he\u2019d walked away. \u201cDrake, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the pleasure to just be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I want.\u201d She rose from the bed. Naked.</p><p>He turned toward her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me anything,\u201d he seemed to push out the words. \u201cThis time was just for you. I can be more than a selfish bastard.\u201d</p><p>She lowered onto her knees before him. Did he know that she\u2019d never done this for another man? No, he couldn\u2019t know. But she\u2019d never really wanted to, until now.</p> <p>\u201cAnd this is just for you.\u201d Her hands fumbled a bit as she reached for the snap of his jeans, then she pulled down the zipper with a hiss of sound that was far too loud in that quiet room.</p><p>His cock sprang toward her. No underwear for her tough guy. Just a full, long cock. One that she had to stroke as she explored with her hands.</p><p>Her knees pressed into the lush carpet as she leaned toward him. Her breath blew lightly over that heavy length and his cock swelled even more.</p><p>\u201cJasmine...be careful...\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap, maybe it was obvious this was her first time. \u201cI\u2019m new at this,\u201d she confessed as she glanced up at him, \u201cso tell me when I do something wrong.\u201d</p><p>The darkness of his pupils swallowed the green of his eyes. \u201cNew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my first.\u201d She felt like she could tell him anything in that moment. \u201cSo if I do it wrong\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. No damn way.\u201d</p><p>His hands bit into her shoulders.</p><p>She pressed a kiss to the head of his shaft. Then she opened her mouth and took him inside.</p><p>\u201cWanted you to...be careful...\u201d His words were so low and rough. \u201cBecause you\u2019re making me want you...too much...\u201d</p><p>She liked his taste. Loved the tang. Wanted more. So she tried to take more of him as she licked and sucked.</p><p>His hands moved to curve around her nape. He tilted her head and she took more of him.</p><p>He was\u2014</p><p>\u201cJasmine!\u201d</p><p>He had her on her feet. Two steps and he had her on the bed. Her legs fell apart as she hit the mattress, and he was right there. He\u2019d put on a condom in an instant and now he had her in his sights. Still standing, at the side of the bed. He pulled her toward him. Her hips were at the edge of the mattress and he thrust into her, deep and hard, filling every inch of her.</p><p>\u201cWarned you,\u201d Drake bit out. \u201cWant you...too much.\u201d</p><p>And there it was. The wild, frantic mating that she\u2019d secretly wanted. The rush that wasn\u2019t controlled. The need that wasn\u2019t safe.</p><p>In and out. He drove into her again and again, and Jasmine loved it. Her nails scraped over his shoulders as she fought to get closer to him. To hold him as tightly as she could and take everything that he had to give.</p><p>She arched against him, her head tipping back against the bed. His mouth pressed to her throat. The sting of his teeth electrified her.</p><p>When she came, Jasmine felt Drake erupt inside of her. Biting her lip, Jasmine tried to hold back a scream. She didn\u2019t want\u2014</p><p>\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Drake demanded. \u201cGive me everything.\u201d</p><p>So she cried out her pleasure.</p><p>And he growled her name.</p><p>He was watching her sleep.</p><p>Drake stared down at Jasmine as she lay curled in his bed. His arm was under her head. Hell, he was her pillow. And he...didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>She looked innocent. Sexy.</p><p>Right.</p><p>And that was wrong.</p><p>No woman was supposed to look right in his bed. He had a rule\u2014his lovers didn\u2019t stay the night.</p><p>So why was he pulling her closer and inhaling that vanilla scent that clung to her?</p><p>She\u2019d been so hesitant when she knelt before him and told him that it had been her first time. He hadn\u2019t wondered if the words were a lie. Her eyes had flickered with nervousness and desire, and she\u2019d touched him almost reverently.</p><p>She\u2019d also nearly made him fall to his knees when that sexy mouth had closed around his aroused flesh.</p><p>But the desire was sated. The passion had cooled.</p><p>Or, at least, that was what Drake was trying to tell himself. The twisted truth was that he\u2019d fuck her again. And again. He wanted to take her endlessly. Sex with her had been even better the second time.</p><p>He loved to see her eyes go blind with pleasure. Loved her taste.</p><p>She snuggled closer to him.</p><p>His hand smoothed over her shoulder.</p><p>His phone vibrated then. He\u2019d moved it to the small nightstand, and he reached out, being careful not to disturb her as he read the text.</p><p>Got info you need.</p><p>The text was from Trace.</p><p>Drake glanced at Jasmine\u2019s sleeping face.</p><p>The phone vibrated again. His gaze slid over the screen.</p><p>Be careful. There\u2019s more going on than you know.</p><p>Right. Because, of course, Trace would\u2019ve found out that Jasmine was trying to screw him over.</p><p>He almost texted back...I don\u2019t want to know. Because he just wanted to stay in that bed with her, and act as if the rest of the world didn\u2019t matter. He wanted Jasmine to simply be the woman that she appeared to be in his arms.</p><p>No secrets. No lies.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the way his reality worked.</p><p>Carefully, he rose from the bed. Jasmine had said that she\u2019d called Maxwell from the phone at his home in the Quarter, so getting that number hadn\u2019t exactly been hard.</p><p>Instead of responding to Trace\u2019s text, Drake called Maxwell Case. The call was already overdue.</p><p>The phone rang once. Twice. Then...</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>Drake smiled. \u201cI\u2019m the man planning to destroy you.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine stirred a bit on the bed, moving restlessly.</p><p>\u201cArcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have started a war with me.\u201d Because if there was one thing that Drake knew how to do, it was fight a war.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who started this. You think I don\u2019t know what you did? To her?\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s gaze narrowed on Jasmine. She was still sleeping.</p><p>\u201cIf she didn\u2019t come back, she told me to look for you. She thought she could count on you.\u201d</p><p>A cold fist squeezed his guts. \u201cThis is personal,\u201d he said. Not about business. Not about casinos.</p><p>\u201cShe trusted you, and you killed her.\u201d</p><p>A chill encased Drake\u2019s skin as those words sank in. Drake realized that his past was coming back to bite him in the ass.</p><p>And Drake couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Jasmine. Did she know? Did she realize what this nightmare was truly all about?</p><p>\u201cWhat did she matter to you?\u201d Drake asked. He didn\u2019t make any confession.</p><p>\u201cShe was mine, far longer than she was yours. My Anna Jean...\u201d</p><p>Dammit. The man had just confirmed Drake\u2019s suspicion.</p><p>You killed her...Anna Jean...</p><p>This wasn\u2019t about casinos. Money. Power.</p><p>It was about a woman. Betrayal. Vengeance.</p><p>His past\u2014and a reckoning.</p><p>Jasmine had mentioned that Maxwell had been in the military. He should have paid more attention to those words.</p><p>Maxwell had been enlisted and so had Anna Jean. Beautiful, lying Anna Jean.</p><p>Beautiful, dead Anna Jean.</p><p>\u201cWe were going to take down your friends,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cAnna Jean and I had a plan, but then you killed her.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s hand fluttered against the covers, as if she were seeking him in her sleep.</p><p>\u201cNow I will take everything away from you,\u201d Maxwell promised him. \u201cAnd in the end, you\u2019ll beg to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t beg for anything.\u201d Never had. Never would. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve made a mistake. The same mistake she made. I won\u2019t be played. And anyone who comes after me...well, you\u2019re going to be finding a swift trip to hell waiting on you.\u201d</p><p>Laughter was Maxwell\u2019s answer.</p><p>But then the laughter stilled. \u201cWhat will you do...\u201d Maxwell asked him. \u201cWhen another woman dies in your arms?\u201d</p><p>That cold fist squeezed him tighter.</p><p>\u201cJasmine shouldn\u2019t have turned to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t just turn to me. She gave herself to me. Came in my arms. Screamed for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll punish her, but, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be there. You\u2019ll watch it all.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s lashes fluttered open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dead man,\u201d Drake said flatly.</p><p>Jasmine gasped as she heard his words. She shot upright in bed, clutching the covers to her.</p><p>That mocking laughter came again.</p><p>The call ended with a fast click.</p><p>With wide, unreadable eyes, Jasmine stared up at him. \u201cM-Maxwell? That was him on the line, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way to New Orleans. He may already be here.\u201d She scrambled from the bed. Dragged the covers with her. \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill him.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine flinched. \u201cNo, go to the cops. Talk to them.\u201d</p><p>What? That was the last thing he\u2019d expected her to say. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option.\u201d Not with Anna Jean\u2019s death being tangled in this mess.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what he\u2019s capable of doing\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand sank into her hair and he tipped her head back. \u201cBut you do, and you\u2019re going to tell me everything you know about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be free of him, don\u2019t you? I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>But Jasmine\u2019s body trembled. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to kill him! That isn\u2019t who you are! That isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now it was his turn to laugh. \u201cAh, princess, and here I thought you\u2019d done your \u2018research\u2019 on me.\u201d With a mocking smile on his lips, he said, \u201cI\u2019m very good at killing. You should have discovered that by now.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him.</p><p>\u201cMaxwell won\u2019t hurt you again because we are going to take him down. You\u2019re going to tell me his weaknesses. Every single thing that you know about him. And I will use that information to break him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hates you,\u201d Jasmine whispered. \u201cSo much...why? I could never figure out why.\u201d</p><p>Why not tell her? Drake shrugged. The move was careless, his past wasn\u2019t. \u201cBecause it seems we were both dumb enough to fall for the same woman.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes doubled in size. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe fell for her, and then I killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the situation with the bounty hunter been handled as I asked?\u201d</p><p>Maxwell Case stared out at the glittering New Orleans skyline.</p><p>\u201cYeah, boss, he\u2019s been left just as you ordered.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been enraged when he found out just what Wayne had done to Jasmine. Good thing that doctor in Vegas had been so chatty...</p><p>With the right leverage, anyone would talk.</p><p>Anyone would break.</p><p>\u201cPressure has to be applied,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cArcher has such a perfect cover now. The legitimate businessman. We\u2019re blowing that cover to hell. The world will see him for who he is, and he\u2019ll pay for his crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about...what about Jasmine?\u201d</p><p>He turned at the question. His guard, Saxon, had been with him for a while. Saxon could always be counted on to get the job done\u2014no matter what that job might be. The man was a loyal employee.</p><p>And he had wonderful, deadly skills that Maxwell so enjoyed using on his enemies.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not...you\u2019re not really going to kill Jazz are you?\u201d Hesitation slowed Saxon\u2019s words. It was the only time Maxwell had ever heard hesitation in the man\u2019s voice.</p><p>Saxon had been the one to first bring the lovely Jasmine to Maxwell\u2019s attention. Saxon and Jasmine had worked together before. Smaller jobs. Little heists. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were friends, of a sort.</p><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Jazz, the Arrow would be nothing more than a pile of rubble in Vegas.\u201d Anna Jean would\u2019ve liked that. She would\u2019ve laughed as the flames hit the sky. \u201cShe turned on me. She must have hacked my computer, and she told Archer everything she knew.\u201d</p><p>Saxon was sweating. \u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>Maxwell waved his hand in the air. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll handle Jazz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to suffer?\u201d</p><p>It was such a shame. Saxon seemed almost concerned for Jazz. But then, Jasmine had a talent for getting to people. For slipping right past their guards before they even realized it.</p><p>Maybe it was those eyes of hers. So deep and dark. Or it could\u2019ve been her dimples. The woman had a beautiful smile.</p><p>He\u2019d caught himself watching her smile once or twice. Waiting for those dimples to flash. Perhaps in another time...another place...</p> <p>He shook his head. He only had this time. \u201cJasmine isn\u2019t who you think she is.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d recently uncovered more intel on her.</p><p>Saxon backed up a step.</p><p>\u201cSo the hell, yes,\u201d Maxwell narrowed his eyes on the guard. \u201cI will make her suffer.\u201d He would make her beg, bleed, and burn. \u201cAnd if you have a problem with that, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no problem,\u201d Saxon managed.</p><p>Good. Because if it had been a problem, then Saxon would\u2019ve been dead.</p> <p>In his organization, people either followed Maxwell\u2019s orders completely\u2014or those people were eliminated.</p><p>She watched the sun rise over the city. Sleep hadn\u2019t exactly been an option for Jasmine, not after Drake\u2019s big reveal during the hours of darkness.</p><p>And not with his endless questions.</p><p>Where is his money\u2014all of it, Jasmine. Off-shore accounts, properties...</p><p>I want his business associates. Every name that you know.</p><p>Why did he pick you? Why you?</p><p>He\u2019d seemed enraged when he asked that question.</p><p>Her answer hadn\u2019t exactly thrilled him. Because I was convenient.</p> <p>She\u2019d worked with one of Maxwell\u2019s bodyguards before. Saxon had been the one to tell Maxwell about her particular skill set.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out there.\u201d Drake\u2019s arm brushed against hers as he came to stand with her on the balcony.</p><p>A dull headache pounded behind her eyes. \u201cYes, he is.\u201d Waiting. Planning to strike. How would he attack first?</p><p>He\u2019ll come after me.</p><p>Jasmine figured that Maxwell would save his big game for last.</p><p>\u201cI answered all of your questions.\u201d She\u2019d given Drake as much information as she\u2014safely\u2014could. \u201cNow, I need you to answer mine.\u201d Squaring her shoulders, she turned to face him. \u201cWho was the woman?\u201d</p><p>He was staring at the rising sun. She knew just how that sunrise looked\u2014like blood flashing across the sky. \u201cAnna Jean. Beautiful Anna Jean.\u201d</p><p>The name meant nothing to her. That would be changing as soon as she got near a computer. \u201cDid the beautiful Anna Jean have a last name?\u201d</p><p>His gaze slanted toward her. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>It did. Everything in this vendetta mattered.</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet her?\u201d Jasmine pressed.</p><p>\u201cWe worked...covert operations together. After I got out of the military.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cShe was my friend\u2019s girl.\u201d</p><p>Hold up, wait, that didn\u2019t make\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut I had sex with her. One drunken night.\u201d He ran a hand over his face. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what a good friend I was to Tucker.\u201d</p><p>She backed up a step. Her hips hit the balcony\u2019s railing. \u201cDid you...did you love her?\u201d Jasmine held her breath as she waited for his answer.</p><p>He kept staring at the sun. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t really an answer.</p><p>His head turned. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t stop me from killing her.\u201d</p><p>Those words were supposed to terrify her. Okay, they did terrify her. And after dropping that big bombshell, the guy just turned around and started to head toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d So she\u2019d yelled. That yell had stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>She ran around and faced him. Jasmine jabbed her index finger into his chest. \u201cI deserve more than that. I talked until I was hoarse for you.\u201d That would be why her voice sounded so husky. Not because she was scared and sad and close to breaking on the inside. \u201cSo don\u2019t just spout a line about killing her. Tell me what happened. Everything that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Seriously? He made her want to yell, again. \u201cBecause I want to know! I want to see past this cold mask you\u2019re giving me! You didn\u2019t kill her in cold blood. You couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to be more.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cYou need to accept that I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Her heart shook her chest. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe betrayed me. I killed her.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed him and she shook him. Okay, she tried to shake him, but the guy was an unmovable object of stone. \u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. Then his gaze lowered to her clutching hands. A furrow appeared between his eyes. \u201cWhy are you drawn to the danger?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him go.</p><p>\u201cI tell you that I killed the last woman who told me that she loved me, and you...you hold on to me as tightly as you can.\u201d He looked back up at her. \u201cSomething is wrong there, princess.\u201d</p><p>Something has been wrong with me for a long time. \u201cThere\u2019s more to the story,\u201d she said stubbornly even though his words had hurt. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to scare me, but you don\u2019t have to do that. Don\u2019t you get it? I was scared of you before we even met.\u201d</p><p>His head cocked to the right as he seemed to study her. \u201cYet you came to my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared every single day of my life.\u201d If he lived her life, he would be, too. \u201cFear can\u2019t stop me.\u201d If it could, she\u2019d be hiding in a closet some place, with her eyes squeezed tightly shut against the darkness. \u201cNow drop the bullshit, and tell me what really happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sure I\u2019m not a monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to slug him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>At first, she didn\u2019t think he would. That glittering gaze of his seemed to weigh her and judge her. How many times had she been judged before and found lacking? Too many. She tried to stiffen her shoulders and straighten her spine. If he closed her out, then fine, she\u2019d walk away. She wasn\u2019t going to just hang around for nothing.</p><p>\u201cThe first time she died, we were in a wasteland of snow and ice. On a mission gone bad, bad because she\u2019d betrayed my team. She\u2019d set us all up to die so that she could make away with a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe...first time?\u201d Just how many times could one person die?</p><p>His gaze stared into the past, and, judging by his expression, she knew it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight. \u201cI was taken on that mission. Held. Tortured because they wanted more intel on my team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy buddies and I formed our own covert reconnaissance group after our tours were over.\u201d</p><p>His buddies...Trace Weston and Noah York.</p><p>\u201cTrace and Noah came for me. They got me out\u2014them and Tucker.\u201d His voice roughened on the last name. \u201cAnna Jean was supposed to be Tucker\u2019s girl. Of course, he didn\u2019t know that I\u2019d taken her behind his back. One time.\u201d A muscle flexed in his jaw. \u201cI was drunk and I woke up afterwards, hating what I\u2019d done. But Anna Jean...she was the kind of woman who could get beneath your skin.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hands away from him.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted me to be with her. Only I wasn\u2019t going to betray Tucker like that again...hell, maybe that was why she was so eager to sell us all out. I pissed her off, and she got her payback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scars on your back...\u201d The scars that she\u2019d felt in the darkness. Felt but hadn\u2019t seen. Her hands had stroked more scars, too. On his stomach. His chest. So much pain. So much hell.</p><p>\u201cThose scars are mementos from my captivity. They remind me of the price for betrayal.\u201d He exhaled on a rough sigh. \u201cNoah and Trace got me out of there, but before we could make it to safety, we came under enemy fire. Enemies were all around and Anna Jean...she used that moment to come at me. I turned and saw her gun, and I did the only thing I could...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cI stabbed her. She fell back into the snow, and Tucker\u2014he went crazy. He shot me. Cause I deserved it.\u201d He raked a hand over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t remember much after that. Noah and Trace got me out, but...they had to put Tucker down because he wouldn\u2019t stop. He was too crazed over Anna Jean. Even knowing that she\u2019d sent us all to die, he still loved her\u2014and he...he died with her that day.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose onto her arms. \u201cSo you stabbed Anna Jean. It...it was self-defense\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean was an unusual woman.\u201d</p><p>Did he even realize how he sounded when he spoke of her?</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, deadly. She could fly any plane or chopper, and she could bat her eyes and make men fall at her feet.\u201d</p><p>Men like you?</p><p>\u201cSomehow, she even managed to make it out of that pile of snow and death in Russia.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cShe survived and came looking for her vengeance. Only she didn\u2019t realize that I\u2019d been the man who put that knife in her chest.\u201d His lips curled in a humorless smile. \u201cFunny thing about those life or death moments...when you\u2019re bleeding out in the snow, your mind will play tricks on you. She blamed Trace for what happened. She thought he\u2019d attacked her and killed Tucker.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine wet her lips. Her muscles were aching because she held herself so still.</p><p>That mocking smile slipped away. \u201cShe went after Trace\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Skye. Anna Jean was going to kill her. His whole life, Trace has only loved one person on this earth, and no matter what I had to do, I wasn\u2019t going to let Anna Jean take Skye away from him.\u201d</p><p>Her lips were bone dry. She licked them and managed, \u201cYou talk about him...as if he\u2019s a brother to you.\u201d The emotion in his voice revealed so much about his relationship with Trace and Noah.</p><p>\u201cBrothers in battle,\u201d he muttered. His shoulders rolled back. \u201cAnna Jean wanted some payback. She nearly gutted me with a knife, then she went after Skye. I was Skye\u2019s protection, and I\u2019d promised Trace I would keep her safe. That I would do anything necessary to protect Skye.\u201d</p><p>She nearly gutted me.</p><p>\u201cI could barely move, and she was attacking Skye right in front of me. There were only seconds left. Seconds. And I had to make a choice...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I stabbed Anna Jean that time, I didn\u2019t miss her heart.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s body swayed a bit.</p><p>\u201cI killed her, and I didn\u2019t hesitate.\u201d</p><p>She blinked away the moisture that wanted to fill her eyes.</p><p>He turned away from her, giving her the broad expanse of his back. \u201cStill think I\u2019m some kind of hero? Because I\u2019m betting heroes don\u2019t go around killing women like that. Heroes don\u2019t do half the shit I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>In that instant, she could only stare speechlessly at him. Jasmine just didn\u2019t know what to say. Because he was right. Heroes wouldn\u2019t do half the shit he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Drake murmured.</p><p>A loud peal of\u2014a doorbell?\u2014reached her ears and Jasmine jumped at the sound. Drake just slowly sauntered off the balcony as he headed back inside. He walked toward the apartment\u2019s front door. Jasmine ran to keep up with him, hurrying through his quarters.</p><p>The pealing cry was soon followed by a fierce pounding on the door. Drake glanced through the peephole at the entrance, then swung the door open.</p><p>Swung it open...</p><p>As if he didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>As if he hadn\u2019t just confessed the darkest secret of his past to her.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s not his darkest secret. Maybe there are more secrets.</p><p>Jasmine wasn\u2019t sure she could handle more right then.</p><p>\u201cJanet,\u201d Drake said softly to the woman in the well-cut suit who stood there, wringing her hands and looking terrified, \u201cwhy are there cops behind you?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine backed up a step.</p><p>\u201cBecause a body was found on your property this morning,\u201d another woman said as she pushed into the suite. A woman with light blonde hair and a cold, gray gaze. \u201cI\u2019m Detective Nancy Taggert, and I\u2019ve got a few questions for you, Mr. Archer.\u201d</p><p>Not so much as a ripple of surprise crossed his face as he looked from Nancy Taggert to the two uniformed officers who still shadowed the woman he\u2019d called Janet.</p><p>\u201cA body?\u201d Drake repeated. \u201cAt my home?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine was pretty sure her blood had turned to ice.</p><p>\u201cUm...yes.\u201d Detective Taggert was watching him like a hawk. \u201cSeems a bounty hunter named Wayne Hardin was shot on your property. A neighbor called to report hearing shots fired, and then we found Hardin spread-eagle on your walk.\u201d</p><p>No, no.</p><p>\u201cWere you acquainted with Mr. Hardin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur paths may have crossed.\u201d Wow. Talk about having no emotion in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt appeared as if Mr. Hardin had been the victim of a recent...physical altercation. His nose was broken. Bruising clear on his face, and well, I can\u2019t help but notice...you\u2019ve got some bruising, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u201cThat bruising is right along your knuckles,\u201d the detective murmured. \u201cAs if...as if you\u2019d recently given someone a beating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI box,\u201d Drake said flatly. \u201cSometimes I go bare-knuckled. So, yeah, I bruise, and I don\u2019t even notice it.\u201d</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t going to end well, and Jasmine couldn\u2019t let Drake be pulled into Hardin\u2019s murder investigation. \u201cDrake didn\u2019t shoot Hardin.\u201d Jasmine stopped backing away and forced herself to approach the cops. There was no way she was going to let him get railroaded for this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Jasmine,\u201d Drake said, and there was a bite in his words.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Did he think she was just going to stand there and let him get interrogated? Or worse\u2014hauled away to jail?</p><p>Detective Taggert\u2019s gray gaze focused on Jasmine. \u201cAnd you are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the woman that Hardin was after. It\u2019s me that you should be questioning, not Drake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJasmine.\u201d Drake\u2019s voice was downright lethal then.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have anything to do with Hardin\u2019s death. Drake was with me all night long. I swear that he was.\u201d</p><p>Taggert\u2019s eyes were cold and flat. \u201cWhy was Hardin after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>Drake stepped in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t say another word.\u201d</p><p>Detective Taggert marched to Jasmine\u2019s side. \u201cYou just confessed to having a bounty hunter on your trail. That\u2019s making me think you might be a wanted fugitive, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Not wanted at all.\u201d She glanced at the detective. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t tell you more here.\u201d</p><p>Taggert\u2019s face hardened. \u201cI think we need to take a little trip down to the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Jasmine agreed. \u201cWe do, but Drake doesn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t involved at all in what happened.\u201d</p><p>There was enough fire in Drake\u2019s eyes to singe Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cI think we should all go downtown,\u201d Taggert said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Drake caught Jasmine\u2019s wrist and pulled her away from the detective. \u201cYou want us downtown, you get an arrest warrant. But that won\u2019t be happening and we both know it.\u201d He flashed the cop the tiger\u2019s grin that always made Jasmine feel nervous. \u201cSo you need to leave now, and any further communication can be conducted through my attorney.\u201d</p><p>Taggert\u2019s own gaze flashed. \u201cYou listen to me. You can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Jasmine said, cutting through the cop\u2019s words. Because she knew her time had run out. If Hardin was dead, then she\u2019d be next on Maxwell\u2019s hit list.</p> <p>Surprise rippled over Drake\u2019s face. \u201cThe hell you are.\u201d His hand tightened around her wrist as he leaned in close to her. \u201cDo you know what she\u2019ll do to you down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuestion me? Toss me in a cell?\u201d Jasmine shrugged. \u201cA girl can\u2019t run forever.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Ah, this was the crazy part. \u201cBelieve it or not, I\u2019m trying to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Judging by the floored expression on his face, that possibility had obviously not occurred to him. Jasmine leaned up on her toes and pressed a quick kiss to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to protect you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cConsider it payback.\u201d</p><p>Then she stepped away from him. She\u2019d known that she was living on borrowed time, but that time was gone now. Hardin is dead. A cold chill had wrapped around her spine. She didn\u2019t want to wind up like him.</p><p>Her gaze connected with the detective\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ll be needing to put a call in to the FBI. Ask for Agent Victor Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine nodded. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t be answering any more questions. Not until Victor arrives.\u201d</p><p>She sent Drake one last smile. Thank you. For a little while, she\u2019d felt so good with him. Safe.</p><p>But safety was a lie.</p><p>And her death...it had been a certainty from the very beginning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you,\u201d she told Drake.</p><p>She meant the words. She wouldn\u2019t miss much about the con that was her current life but...she would never forget him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything back to her. Not surprising, really. No lover had ever really missed her when she left.</p><p>Story of my life.</p><p>She turned and walked away.</p><p>What. The. Hell?</p><p>Drake stood rooted to the spot, unable to believe what had just happened. Jasmine had given herself up, sacrificed herself for\u2014him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d Detective Taggert promised as she pointed at him. \u201cAnd maybe even with that warrant.\u201d</p><p>He growled out some kind of response as the cops left. Like the threat of a warrant scared him.</p><p>Janet hovered nearby. When the coast was clear, she whispered, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Get Jasmine back.</p><p>But Jasmine was gone. Heading off with the cops.</p><p>He rushed out onto the balcony. He stood there, waiting, furious, and in a few moments, Jasmine was led out of the Masquerade. The cops loaded her into the back of a squad car. The wind caught her hair, tossing it lightly around her face.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to see the city. Now she was going where\u2014jail?</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d Janet queried.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Drake said as he watched the door slam and seal Jasmine in the car. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>Like he was really just going to sit back while Jasmine vanished from his life.</p><p>Hell, no. He\u2019d get her back, and he knew just who he\u2019d use to help him. He spun away from the balcony and pulled out his wallet. The card he needed was inside.</p><p>Federal custody, my ass.</p><p>He\u2019d be the one watching over Jasmine.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t handcuffed her. Hadn\u2019t barraged her with questions. They\u2019d just locked her in an interrogation room. Then the cops had appeared to forget about her.</p><p>Her chair was hard and cold and after about two hours, Jasmine\u2019s ass was definitely aching, so she marched around the tiny room. She tried to peer into what she was sure was a two-way mirror. She leaned in nice and close, cupping her hands around her eyes\u2014</p><p>The door to the interrogation room opened with a click behind her.</p><p>\u201cWell, well...aren\u2019t you a hard woman to find.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around.</p><p>FBI Special Agent Victor Monroe stared back at her. Tall, handsome, all law-abiding and solid-looking.</p><p>That was Victor.</p><p>His square jaw locked as he crossed the room to her side. His dark brown hair was swept away from his high forehead. \u201cI hear you\u2019ve been causing trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rather good at that.\u201d Her best talent.</p><p>He leaned in toward her. His blue eyes swept over her face.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to get you out of here?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ah, but it was good to have some friends in the right places.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the special agent,\u201d she murmured back, keeping her voice low. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Then she smiled because it was nice to finally be with someone who trusted her.</p><p>Even if he shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Too bad Victor had never seemed to learn that lesson.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Jasmine was being led out of the police station in handcuffs. Drake staggered to a stop at the sight of her. He\u2019d been trying to call the FBI Agent all morning, but that jerk Victor hadn\u2019t answered, and now Drake saw exactly why the agent had been dodging him.</p><p>Victor was the one pulling Jasmine toward a dark SUV. Victor had one hand securely on Jasmine\u2019s shoulder. As he walked, Victor\u2019s jacket parted, and Drake glimpsed the gun holster beneath the man\u2019s arm.</p><p>Detective Taggert stood a few feet back, up at the top of the steps, and she was frowning as she watched Victor and Jasmine.</p><p>She was just letting the guy take Jasmine away?</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Drake called out.</p><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t think we should interfere here...\u201d His lawyer muttered nervously from his position beside Drake.</p><p>\u201cScrew what you think right now.\u201d Drake rushed toward Jasmine. Her head had lifted at his call. Why did she look so shocked to see him? Had she really thought that he\u2019d just let her walk away?</p><p>Before he could reach out to her, Victor stepped in his path, totally blocking Jasmine\u2019s body. \u201cYou need to back away, Archer,\u201d Victor told him curtly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get involved in federal business.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t he? \u201cWhy are you taking her?\u201d Drake demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s involved in some active investigations that we\u2019re working,\u201d Victor responded smoothly. \u201cNow, get out of our way.\u201d</p><p>Drake put himself in their path even more. \u201cI need to talk with Jasmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe liar and the thief?\u201d Victor tossed back. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to waste your time with her.\u201d He eased to the side a bit, glancing back at Jasmine. \u201cI mean, that is what you said, right? That she was \u2018a liar and a thief,\u2019 and she wasn\u2019t your problem any longer.\u201d</p><p>Pain flashed on Jasmine\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Drake snapped.</p><p>\u201cSure about that? Because I think those words were exactly what you meant.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s gaze jerked away from Drake. As if she couldn\u2019t stand to look at him in that moment.</p><p>What the hell? Why do I feel like shit right now?</p><p>Because Jasmine turned herself in to the cops...because she was trying to protect me.</p><p>She could\u2019ve stayed silent at the Masquerade. Could\u2019ve let him be dragged off. Then Jasmine would\u2019ve had her opportunity to run.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t.</p><p>The woman had sacrificed herself for him, even after he\u2019d told her about his past. He didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d done it, and not understanding was driving him crazy.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Victor told him as he put one hand on Drake\u2019s chest and pushed. \u201cShe\u2019s not your problem anymore. She\u2019s mine from here on out.\u201d</p><p>There was something in the guy\u2019s voice. A deeper note that set off alarms in Drake\u2019s mind.</p><p>Possessiveness.</p><p>Drake glared down at the hand pressed to his shirt-front. \u201cMove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d Victor wanted to know. \u201cYou\u2019ll assault a federal officer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Footsteps rushed toward them. Drake\u2019s lawyer huffed closer. \u201cSir, sir, I\u2019d really advise against that!\u201d</p><p>Screw Thomas Morley\u2019s advice. Drake had pulled the guy down there to help Jasmine, not so the man could get in his way.</p><p>\u201cI have to go, Drake,\u201d Jasmine said, her voice soft. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>No, no, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He needed to know more about what was happening. He needed...her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Drake asked Victor. No, the question should have been...\u201cWhat has she done?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d told Jasmine his crimes. Didn\u2019t that mean he deserved to know hers?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better off not knowing,\u201d Victor said. \u201cIgnorance is damn bliss, right?\u201d Then he leaned in close to Drake. \u201cJust pretend you screwed an angel and not a devil in disguise.\u201d</p><p>Fury erupted in Drake. He pulled back his fist and drove it right at the agent\u2019s smug face.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d The frantic voice of Thomas Morley shouted.</p><p>Victor didn\u2019t even take a swing back at Drake. \u201cPoor impulse control.\u201d He motioned to Detective Taggert. She was already running down the stairs. \u201cYou and your men should take him inside. Get him to calm down.\u201d</p><p>Drake lunged for the guy again.</p><p>But Jasmine was there. She stepped in front of Victor.</p><p>Drake froze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a liar and a thief,\u201d she whispered and her eyes had never seemed so dark. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not worth what you\u2019re about to bring down on yourself.\u201d</p><p>His jaw hardened even more. \u201cI think you are worth it.\u201d That was the problem. She\u2019d inched beneath his skin. Gotten to him when she shouldn\u2019t have ever been able to pierce his armor.</p><p>Her dark eyes widened. \u201cDrake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pressing charges,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Morley muttered.</p><p>He seriously needed a new lawyer. One with some balls.</p><p>\u201cBut I want this man held until he cools off...\u201d Victor pulled Jasmine away when uniforms surrounded Drake.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over!\u201d Drake called out to her.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Victor opened the passenger side of the SUV. Jasmine slipped inside, still wearing the cuffs. When the door shut, she glanced back at Drake through the window.</p><p>Her hand lifted and touched the glass. Then Victor drove her away.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go work on that calming down...\u201d Detective Taggert said.</p><p>Screw calming down.</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t take his eyes off that SUV.</p><p>When his phone rang, Maxwell knew it was the call he\u2019d been expecting. The cops had been tipped off, the stage had been set...and Drake Archer should be getting a little taste of hell.</p><p>\u201cWere the reporters there when Archer was hauled to jail?\u201d he asked as he put the phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cNo reporters,\u201d Saxon told him flatly. \u201cAnd he wasn\u2019t the one the cops brought in. They pulled in Jazz.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell shot up. He\u2019d been lounging in bed with a slumberous blonde. Sex always took the edge off for him. The blonde mumbled something and tried to reach for him, so he kicked her ass right out of bed. \u201cJazz?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnly she\u2019s not with the cops now. She just left with an asshole I think you know...Special Agent Victor Monroe.\u201d</p><p>His temples were about to burst. \u201cMonroe has been trying to nail me for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s got Jazz. And now I\u2019m wondering...is he going to get her to turn on you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t have the chance,\u201d Maxwell vowed. And it was also time that he eliminated Monroe. That bastard had been a thorn in his side for far too long. \u201cFollow them, and wait for orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Saxon had been friends with Jazz, but there was no hesitation in his voice now. Maxwell knew the man realized that Jazz couldn\u2019t be given the chance to turn on them.</p><p>Death was her only option.</p><p>\u201cSo how much longer do I have to wear the cuffs?\u201d Jasmine asked Victor as they rolled through the city. The traffic seemed to pass her in a blur. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. Being led out in handcuffs was a nice touch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d Victor said, voice a bit amused as he kept his eyes on the road. He was taking them away from the busier streets. The traffic around them began to thin. \u201cMade us look all official.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the handcuffs around her wrists. \u201cThey\u2019re a little tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they aren\u2019t supposed to be fashion bracelets.\u201d He braked at a red light and reached for her wrist. A quick turn of his key, and the handcuffs popped off. His fingers slid over her wrists, massaging quickly right before the light changed to green.</p><p>The SUV shot forward. This time, they were the only car on the road. Victor knew how to find all the forgotten streets in a city\u2014that was his talent.</p><p>We have to vanish, and he\u2019s making that happen.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your jaw?\u201d she asked him quietly.</p> <p>\u201cThrobbing like a bitch,\u201d was his immediate reply. \u201cArcher has a killer punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe boxes,\u201d she heard herself whisper. Her lips quirked at that. \u201cOr at least, he said he did.\u201d Would Drake be surprised to know just how much she knew about boxing? Maybe she\u2019d tell him. Maybe\u2014</p><p>He\u2019ll never know. Jasmine swallowed and tried to push the lump in her throat far, far down.</p><p>\u201cJasmine?\u201d</p><p>She straightened in her seat. \u201cTh-thanks for not having him arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be able to use him later. Figured it was to my advantage to have the guy owing me.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Victor did like to use people. Use or be used...that was his motto. Always had been. \u201cI\u2019d...prefer that you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid to her when he braked at another deserted light. The buildings around them were all old, boarded up. A street that had been forgotten after the hurricane.</p> <p>\u201cLet him have his life,\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cJust leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>Victor laughed at that. \u201cAh, Jazz, don\u2019t go soft for him. He told me you were little better than trash and that he wanted you out of his life.\u201d He accelerated once more.</p><p>Her chest burned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he said about me. I want you to leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little late for you to be making demands, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m the one here with all of the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gunfire erupted.</p><p>The SUV\u2019s front windshield shattered. Jasmine screamed. Victor swore and jerked the wheel to the left, and as the vehicle lurched, a hail of gunfire slammed into Jasmine\u2019s side of the SUV.</p><p>\u201cGet down!\u201d Victor yelled.</p><p>She was already in the floorboard. \u201cGet us out of here!\u201d Jasmine yelled right back at him.</p><p>The SUV\u2019s engine revved and\u2014</p><p>Then the vehicle lurched once more. Harder this time.</p><p>\u201cTires,\u201d he snarled. \u201cThey shot at\u2014\u201d</p><p>The SUV twisted, turned, and Jasmine clamped her lips shut to hold back her screams as they flew toward a tall, metal lamp post.</p><p>Then more gunfire erupted...</p><p>Drake\u2019s foot shoved down the gas pedal as he raced through the back streets of New Orleans. Jasmine and that FBI Agent didn\u2019t have much of a lead time on him. He sure as hell hadn\u2019t planned to stay at the station with Taggert and calm down.</p><p>Jasmine had looked so hurt. Victor was a prick, and Drake wanted to do more than just drive his fist into the guy\u2019s face.</p><p>Jasmine had been cuffed. Helpless. He\u2019d just wanted to take her away. To protect her.</p><p>He turned another corner, his gaze scanning the empty streets. They were gone. Dammit. Finding them now was going to be nearly impossible.</p><p>Rat-a-tat.</p><p>When he heard the sound of gunfire, Drake didn\u2019t slow down. He sped up even more as his heart thundered in his chest. He cleared the next set of red lights, and then his heart nearly stopped.</p><p>The FBI Agent\u2019s SUV was on its side. Glass littered the narrow street, and two armed men\u2014wearing black ski masks\u2014were pulling someone from the wreckage.</p><p>Jasmine.</p><p>She was fighting them. Kicking, twisting her body, but they were dragging her toward a gray van that waited just a few feet away.</p><p>He slammed on his brakes. Grabbed for his own weapon\u2014good thing he\u2019d brought it from the Masquerade\u2014and rushed out of his car. \u201cLet her go!\u201d</p><p>One of the men turned at his shout. The guy lifted his weapon and took aim at Drake.</p><p>The other masked asshole heaved Jasmine back against him and nearly succeeded in tossing her into the van.</p><p>\u201cDrake!\u201d Her scream chilled him.</p><p>Drake dove to the ground, and the bullet missed him. But in the next instant he was firing, and Drake found his target. The jerk who\u2019d shot at him grunted and staggered back.</p><p>Then Drake was moving again. Staying low and going in fast, he raced right toward Jasmine. Her hands had locked around the side of the van and she was kicking out at her captor.</p><p>The guy was so busy keeping her in check that he didn\u2019t turn to face Drake, not until it was too late. Then Drake hit him hard and fast, and the guy\u2019s head slammed into the side of the van.</p><p>\u201cDrake,\u201d now her voice was a stunned whisper.</p><p>He grabbed her and pulled her into his arms. She was shaking and there were scratches on her hands, but she seemed okay.</p><p>He locked his hand with hers and rushed back to his car. He pushed her into the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cVictor!\u201d She grabbed for Drake, holding on tightly. \u201cYou have to make sure he\u2019s okay. He-he wasn\u2019t moving when they took me.\u201d</p><p>She was worried about the FBI agent?</p><p>Giving a grim nod, he spun back around. The two jerks who\u2019d tried to take Jasmine were retreating into their van. They thought they\u2019d just get away? Oh, the hell, no.</p><p>He took a lunging step toward them, his weapon up.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d</p><p>That cry was coming from the wreckage. The agent?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck, and I smell gasoline\u2014help me!\u201d Yeah, that was definitely the agent.</p><p>And he was right. Drake could smell the acrid odor filling the air. Shit, shit.</p><p>He took aim at that van. Fired. Once, twice. The van careened when the bullets crashed into the back, but it kept going.</p><p>Drake rushed to the wrecked SUV. He heard the clatter of footsteps behind him. He spun\u2014 \u201cI put you in the car!\u201d So she\u2019d be safe.</p><p>\u201cAnd I got myself right out!\u201d Jasmine tossed at him. She tried to shove by him.</p><p>He pushed her right back. \u201cThere\u2019s gasoline leaking out. You need to stay back.\u201d He quickly shoved his weapon in to the back waistband of his jeans.</p><p>Fear flashed across her face. \u201cWe have to get Victor out of there!\u201d</p><p>In the distance, he heard the wail of a siren.</p><p>This street was deserted, but someone must have heard the shots and called the cops. The question was...would the cops get there in time?</p><p>Jasmine broke free of his hand and the woman ran right to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m here, Victor!\u201d</p><p>Part of the driver\u2019s side window had shattered. Victor pushed his hand through the hole there and his fingers curled around Jasmine\u2019s. \u201cDammit, baby, I was afraid they were going to take you, and there wasn\u2019t anything I could do.\u201d</p><p>Drake stiffened. That didn\u2019t sound like an FBI agent talking to his charge.</p><p>Jasmine isn\u2019t wearing handcuffs.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d Victor snarled. \u201cThere\u2019s gasoline pouring on the ground, and I can...I can smell smoke...\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s gaze shot to the rear of the SUV. The rear...and the front. Tendrils of smoke were escaping from both areas. The SUV had been littered by bullets and some of those bullets had hit with a very, very dangerous impact.</p><p>The driver\u2019s side door had slammed into a lamp post, and it was a dented heap.</p><p>\u201cMy left leg is pinned,\u201d Victor said, voice gruff. \u201cArcher, I need you to break out the rest of the driver\u2019s side windshield and see if you can help me get free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor...\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice was low. And scared.</p><p>Drake grabbed a chunk of metal that had fallen down\u2014part of the SUV\u2019s front bumper?\u2014and headed toward the driver\u2019s side. Jasmine stepped back when Drake slammed the metal into the glass. The rest of the windshield shattered easily as it rained down on Victor.</p><p>The smoke grew thicker. The wail of the siren seemed to be coming closer. But it wasn\u2019t close enough.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Drake thought he saw the flicker of flames. He ignored that flicker and crawled half-way into the car. The air bag was in his way, so Drake used the knife he normally kept in a sheath at his ankle, and he cut right through it.</p><p>\u201cHold on, Victor,\u201d Jasmine whispered.</p><p>The agent\u2019s leg was caught all right, the dash had thrust in around him, and the steering wheel sagged, keeping the guy trapped.</p><p>\u201cJasmine,\u201d Victor\u2019s voice was low and calm. The guy had blood dripping down his face, and Drake was pretty sure the man\u2019s leg was broken, but the agent didn\u2019t sound as if he were in any pain. \u201cI want you to wait for me in Archer\u2019s car, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you,\u201d she said right back. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s gut clenched. \u201cHold still,\u201d he ordered Victor. \u201cDon\u2019t make me cut you more than I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Victor barked. \u201cWait, hold the hell up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vehicle is about to blow, and we both know it.\u201d Drake was half-in, half-out of the car. He drove his fist into the remnants of the dash, determined to push it back, then he sliced out with his knife, trying to make the material weaker. \u201cHold. The fuck. Still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet her out of here!\u201d Victor yelled. \u201cI can see the flames!\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s hands had locked around Drake\u2019s hips. She was helping to hold him while he fought to free Victor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Victor snapped at him. \u201cLeave me. Get her out or we\u2019ll all burn!\u201d</p><p>Jasmine was yanking on him. \u201cDrake, Drake, you need to run! I\u2019ll get him! You have to go\u2014I don\u2019t want you hurt. Go!\u201d</p><p>She thought he\u2019d just leave them both there?</p><p>He dropped the knife onto the floorboard\u2014well, what was left of it, then he drove his fist into that dash again and again and again\u2014</p><p>\u201cDrake!\u201d Jasmine yanked him back with a surprising force, and they tumbled onto the sidewalk.</p><p>Flames were racing over the front of the SUV. When they merged with that gasoline...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free,\u201d Victor gasped out.</p><p>Jasmine let go of Drake. He reached for the other man and hauled the guy through the driver\u2019s side window. But when Victor\u2019s feet touched the cement, the guy\u2019s right leg crumbled. Definitely broken.</p><p>So Drake put the jerk in a fireman\u2019s carry even as he locked one hand around Jasmine\u2019s wrist. They ran forward, as fast as they could as the flames grew behind them.</p><p>As he looked ahead, Drake saw the flashing lights of police cars rushing down the street.</p><p>The cops would be there in moments.</p><p>A boom sounded behind him. The blast knocked Drake off his feet, and he hit the ground.</p><p>\u201cGet...her...out...Get Jazz...\u201d Victor had crashed right along with him. Jasmine was on her knees beside Drake. \u201cBefore the cops...come...get her...\u201d</p><p>The SUV was blazing behind them. The men who\u2019d attacked Jasmine and Victor were long gone, and now the FBI agent wanted him to help a supposedly wanted woman escape?</p><p>Since that had been his plan all along, Drake rose and pulled Jasmine with him.</p><p>\u201cBut you need help,\u201d Jasmine said as she stared down at the injured man. \u201cVictor, your leg\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to you, Jazz. Just...go!\u201d</p><p>She turned with Drake and they ran for his car. In seconds, they were inside the vehicle and racing away from the blaze. The heaving sound of their breaths filled the car. When Drake glanced in his rear-view mirror, he saw smoke and flames and the blue lights of patrol cars.</p><p>He sped up and turned hard to the right. He knew these roads\u2014streets usually not traveled by many because this was the side of town that the tourists avoided.</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t know if the cops were following him or not, but, either way, he wasn\u2019t going to leave a trail for them.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s hands were clenched in her lap. She didn\u2019t speak, and small shivers shook her body every few moments.</p><p>\u201cYou should...you should probably drop me off somewhere,\u201d she finally said, her words hushed.</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cThat corner looks good.\u201d She pointed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Drake snarled out, \u201cdropping you off any place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was taking her back to his casino.

Do you think I would\u2019ve shot a man for a woman I didn\u2019t want?\u201d</p><p>They were hitting the busier streets now. A few more turns, and he was sliding into his private entrance at the Masquerade. He stopped long enough to bark orders to the guards there. Then they were inside the parking garage. He couldn\u2019t get her out of the car and into his private elevator fast enough. When the elevator doors closed behind them and they shot up, heading toward his quarters, he pulled her into his arms.</p> <p>\u201cDrake, look, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Deep and long and desperately. If those SOBs in the van had taken her, he never would have seen her again. He knew that fact with utter certainty.</p><p>His hands sank into her hair as he tilted her head back. Drake felt as if he were starving, as if he\u2019d spent his whole life on the edge of hunger\u2014and she was...everything that he needed.</p><p>I\u2019m as bad as Trace and Noah.</p><p>No, he was worse. Because he knew that Jasmine was no angel. And he didn\u2019t care.</p> <p>He turned their bodies, pushing her back against the mirrored wall of the elevator. His aroused cock thrust against her. He was rock hard for her, and he needed to be in her.</p><p>He tore his mouth from hers. Pressed hot kisses to her neck.</p><p>Adrenaline heated his blood. Fear. Fury. A deadly combination.</p><p>Won\u2019t let her go. No one will take her from me.</p><p>Jasmine wasn\u2019t standing docilely in his arms. She arched against him, and her moans and gasps just drove him on.</p><p>His hands slid down her body. He caught the snap of her jeans. Yanked those jeans open. Shoved them down her legs. The material got tangled in her shoes, but Jasmine kicked herself free.</p> <p>\u201cDrake...\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. Kissed her, even as he grabbed the lace of her panties and tore them away.</p><p>There was no finesse this time. No seduction. He needed in her.</p><p>He needed control. Needed the certainty of knowing that she was his. She was safe.</p><p>He lifted her up against the mirror. \u201cWrap your legs around me.\u201d</p><p>She did. Drake thrust into her. Deep and long, and the desperate fear finally eased.</p><p>But the arousal didn\u2019t. The consuming lust just grew as he withdrew and plunged into her. Again and again. He held her hips tightly, moving her to match his rhythm, forcing her to take all that he had.</p><p>She cried out his name, and he felt the clench of her delicate inner muscles around him as she climaxed.</p> <p>His thrusts grew faster then. He wanted to take and take from her. Take until she realized that he was the one she needed.</p><p>The only one.</p><p>Her lips pressed lightly to his throat. She kissed him. A delicate, tender caress in the maelstrom of passion that surrounded him.</p><p>He came then, with a release so strong that his heart seemed to stop for a moment as the pleasure pulsed through every vein in his body. It swept over him, through him, and it was so good. So incredibly good. He never wanted it to end.</p><p>It was as close to paradise as Drake knew he\u2019d ever get.</p><p>And she was climaxing again. He heard the quick catch of Jasmine\u2019s breath and felt her stiffen against him. He kept thrusting, drawing out his own pleasure and forcing more pleasure on her.</p><p>He always wanted to give Jasmine pleasure.</p><p>He wanted to spoil her for any other lovers.</p><p>Just me, princess. Always...me.</p><p>And that last thought scared the hell out of him because he wasn\u2019t supposed to want any woman that way. Wasn\u2019t supposed to care about her other lovers. Wasn\u2019t supposed to care at all.</p><p>But for her...with her...he did.</p><p>Jasmine would have no idea just how dangerous that was.</p><p>Saxon marched into the office that Maxwell had claimed. Maxwell noticed that the guy was moving a bit slower than normal, and...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing someone,\u201d Maxwell pointed out.</p><p>Saxon\u2019s chin jerked up into the air. \u201cWe encountered a problem.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell rose and circled around the desk. The scent of the river drifted through the window. \u201cI don\u2019t care about problems. I care about Jasmine.\u201d</p><p>Or rather, he cared about silencing the bitch.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cIs that blood on your shirt?\u201d Because it sure as shit looked like blood soaking that shirt near the guy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI took a hit,\u201d Saxon muttered. \u201cArcher was there. He shot me, and he got Jazz.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell grabbed the man, and he made sure that he dug his fingers into Saxon\u2019s injured shoulder. \u201cJasmine was with the FBI Agent. You were supposed to take them both out. A simple enough order. It wasn\u2019t time for Archer. Not. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe followed them!\u201d The lines near Saxon\u2019s mouth tightened as pain rippled across his face.</p><p>Maxwell dug his hand in a bit deeper.</p><p>\u201cW-we had the agent controlled. Jazz was almost in the van, then Archer flew up and started shooting. We didn\u2019t have any choice\u2014we had to get the hell out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne man, and you ran from him? I\u2019m very, very disappointed in you.\u201d When he got disappointed, people died.</p><p>\u201cAvery was already back in the van. He was going to leave me,\u201d Saxon snarled at him. \u201cI was bleeding all over the street. I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>Avery. Ah, yes, he was still a fairly new employee, and the man didn\u2019t understand just how much Maxwell hated disappointments. He would. \u201cSend Avery in to me.\u201d He released Saxon. \u201cGet your shoulder stitched up.\u201d</p><p>Saxon backed away, but he didn\u2019t leave. \u201cDrake isn\u2019t about to give that woman up again. You should\u2019ve seen the way he fought to get her.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. So Archer wouldn\u2019t be surrendering Jasmine to the cops again. And if he had a twenty-four seven watch on her, well, that would make things a bit more complicated.</p><p>Not impossible, of course, just complicated.</p><p>\u201cYou both wore ski masks?\u201d His order, but he wanted to make sure it had been followed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Blood dripped from Saxon\u2019s soaked shirt and splattered onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cThen Jasmine has no idea you were the one who went after her.\u201d</p><p>A quick, negative shake of Saxon\u2019s dark head was his reply.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Because if force hadn\u2019t worked, then they\u2019d try another method for getting to Jasmine. They wouldn\u2019t worry about going through Archer\u2019s guards\u2014and the man had certainly upped his security force at his New Orleans casino\u2014they\u2019d just get Jasmine to come right to them.</p><p>A lamb, to the slaughter.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>She\u2019d just had sex in an elevator.</p><p>Jasmine lifted her head from Drake\u2019s chest. He was slowly pulling out of her body, and that glide sent off little aftershocks in her core. Helplessly, she felt herself squeeze him tight, one more time.</p><p>Her breath sighed out at the rush of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI...didn\u2019t mean what I said.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lifted. He was straightening his clothes. She should probably do the same. Especially since her half-naked image was being tossed back to her courtesy of those mirrored walls.</p><p>But...Drake beat her to the punch. He bent and the guy eased her jeans back on her. Carefully. Slowly. He even paused to check her bandage. Like those stitches would have slowed her down.</p><p>Then he tucked her torn panties into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cAh...what you said?\u201d She had to clear her throat because her voice came out way too husky. Jasmine had no idea what he\u2019d said before. She was pretty lost.</p><p>Still kneeling before her, Drake glanced up. His eyes seemed to blaze at her. \u201cI\u2019m not done with you.\u201d</p><p>He should be. \u201cDrake...\u201d</p><p>In one quick, fluid motion, he rose before her.</p><p>She put her hand on his chest. \u201cI am a liar. And I\u2019m a thief.\u201d The words had hurt, but the truth often did.</p><p>His gaze narrowed. That green stare seemed to measure her as it moved slowly over her face, then down to the hand that pressed not just over his chest, but right over his heart. She could feel the strong, steady beat beneath her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he allowed.</p><p>There was no maybe there.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re my thief,\u201d and his voice had hardened. He kissed her then. That mind-numbing kiss of his and she pretty much sank into him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget it,\u201d he muttered against her lips.</p><p>As if she could.</p><p>Then he pulled away. Put in his security code and had the elevator doors opening. He exited the elevator and offered her his hand. Taking it, Jasmine hesitated. \u201cThis is the first place the cops will look for me. You know that, right?\u201d They might as well flash a neon sign.</p><p>He didn\u2019t appear concerned. Not even a little. \u201cThen we\u2019ll just have to make certain they don\u2019t find you here.\u201d He sounded so confident. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be staying long.\u201d</p><p>Uh, she wouldn\u2019t be?</p><p>\u201cGive me a bit to make arrangements. I can have you out of town in an hour. I\u2019ll get us on a private flight and I can make you vanish.\u201d</p><p>So tempting. But... \u201cI can\u2019t leave Victor.\u201d As it was, she\u2019d have to find out which hospital he was in. As soon as it was safe, she\u2019d contact him again and find out what needed to happen next.</p><p>Drake\u2019s jaw locked as they entered his apartment\u2014that was what she thought of that place as, anyway. It sure had all the comforts of home. And had she really just left from that exact spot hours ago? So strange. It had seemed like much more time passed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be coming back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sacrificed yourself for me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him. His shoulders were propped against the door, and his arms were crossed over his chest. Jasmine couldn\u2019t read the expression on his face, no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>And to think, she was usually pretty good at reading people. She pressed her lips together a moment, then said, \u201cMaxwell killed the bounty hunter, we both know that. I was just trying to...to make less trouble for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want trouble.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at that.</p><p>\u201cNo more lies, Jasmine.\u201d</p><p>Ah...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been playing nice with you.\u201d</p><p>He had? Wow. What was he like when he played rough?</p><p>\u201cI warned you about lying, and you are already due some punishments.\u201d</p><p>Kissing hardly counted as punishments.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve got questions for you, and I want the honest truth.\u201d He advanced toward her, a lion stalking his prey. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there are some things I just can\u2019t tell you.\u201d More than her life was at stake.</p><p>Her answer didn\u2019t even slow him down. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you in cuffs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the crash site, you weren\u2019t in handcuffs, but when Victor loaded you into the SUV, he had both of your hands cuffed.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her wrists. \u201cHe took them off.\u201d</p><p>Drake reached for her hands. That was when she realized that she had scratches and cuts on her palms.</p><p>Drake must\u2019ve noticed the damage, too, because he swore and pulled her toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Jasmine tried to tell him when he began to wash the wounds. \u201cI just...some of the bullets hit the windshield, and I put up my hands so that my face wouldn\u2019t get cut by the glass.\u201d</p><p>He stilled then and the air in the bathroom seemed to grow very, very tense. Drake\u2019s head turned, and his eyes met hers. \u201cThe bullets could have torn right through you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cI\u2019m all right. I\u2019m here, with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I hadn\u2019t appeared on that street?\u201d The words were hard, but the fingers moving against her skin\u2014cleaning her once more so carefully and bandaging her wounds\u2014they were gentle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Drake was incredibly powerful, but even he couldn\u2019t stop death.</p><p>\u201cI-I think my hands are okay. The scratches were light.\u201d She\u2019d had so much worse. Good thing she had such a high pain tolerance.</p><p>He eased away from her. His broad shoulders seemed to fill the doorway. \u201cI keep forgetting how fragile you are.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine laughed at that. \u201cActually, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up.</p><p>\u201cEven when we were in the elevator, and I was so wild I wanted to scratch my way down your back, you held me still...you moved me, made sure that I didn\u2019t pull any stitches.\u201d His hands had been so secure on her. Controlling her movements. Giving her so much pleasure. \u201cYou don\u2019t forget anything.\u201d She was certain of that.</p><p>His lips twisted in a humorless smile. \u201cPrincess, that wasn\u2019t about your stitches. I\u2019m a selfish bastard, and I just wanted to screw you deep and hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d she barely breathed the charge but Jasmine knew it was the truth.</p><p>For a moment, he looked lost, then he blinked, and that image was gone.</p><p>\u201cYou play so tough, but I can see through you. You didn\u2019t hurt me in the elevator. You didn\u2019t hurt me any time that we\u2019ve been together. Because at heart, you aren\u2019t a killer. You aren\u2019t the bad guy.\u201d That was what made him different from Maxwell.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA protector.\u201d That was why he\u2019d fought so hard for her on the street. Why, when the SUV exploded behind them, he\u2019d tried to shield both her and Victor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drake wasn\u2019t a deadly threat. He was a hero, the man just didn\u2019t realize it.</p><p>She did.</p><p>Drake\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cTell that to the dead I\u2019ve left in my wake.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze didn\u2019t drop. \u201cYou won\u2019t scare me. No matter what you say or what you do, because I know the real you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been with me for a few days. How can you possibly know anything but what\u2019s on the surface?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve known me for less than forty-eight hours, and you shot a man for me today.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. \u201cWhat would you say,\u201d Drake asked her, softly, \u201cif I told you that I would have killed for you? If I hadn\u2019t been able to get that jerk to free you...if he\u2019d tossed you in that van...\u201d</p><p>She gave a sharp, negative shake of her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to kill for me. I don\u2019t want anyone to do that.\u201d She edged closer to him. \u201cI want to get the hell I\u2019ve brought out of your life, and I just want you\u2014I want you to be happy.\u201d</p> <p>He gazed down at her. \u201cThis war isn\u2019t on you. Maxwell and I were set to battle long before you came into the Arrow.\u201d</p><p>Because of Anna Jean. The mysterious Anna Jean. A lover Drake had confessed to killing.</p><p>Goosebumps rose onto her arms.</p><p>She knew how Maxwell thought. He was old school, an eye-for-an-eye type.</p><p>There is no escape.</p><p>A low, pealing ring filled the air then. The same peal that had sounded right before the cops arrived on their last terrible visit. Drake turned at the sound, heading back into the main living area. Jasmine followed, grabbing for his arm. \u201cDrake, no, it\u2019s probably the cops!\u201d And without Victor close-by, she did not want to deal with them again.</p> <p>\u201cCops wouldn\u2019t have gotten past my security\u2014only a very select few could get to me now.\u201d</p><p>Great. Wonderful. Not. He was almost at the door. Jasmine jumped in front of him. \u201cDrake, I get that you seem confident about whoever might be on the other side\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am confident, because I told them to get their asses down here.\u201d</p><p>Wait, what?</p><p>He slipped around her. Took an instant to glance through the peephole\u2014at least he checked that much\u2014then Drake was opening the door.</p><p>\u201cYou made better time than I thought,\u201d he said as he offered his hand to the first man in the doorway.</p><p>Jasmine inched back. Her guts were twisting into knots and she was so hoping that she was wrong about the identity of the men in Drake\u2019s doorway.</p><p>She took another step back and realized she didn\u2019t have on her shoes. They were still in Drake\u2019s private elevator. She lifted a hand to her lips. They felt swollen\u2014from Drake\u2019s mouth. She touched her hair\u2014oh, hell, yes, it no doubt looked as wild as it felt to her touch.</p> <p>\u201cWell, well...\u201d A deep voice said, and Jasmine dropped her hand as she realized that the three men were now inside the apartment\u2014and all gazing at her. \u201cYou must be Jasmine Bennett.\u201d The man speaking was tall, with midnight black hair and startlingly bright blue eyes. He wore a suit cut perfectly to his broad shoulders, and the guy seemed to ooze both money...and danger.</p><p>Trace Weston. She recognized him instantly.</p><p>And if Trace was there...</p><p>Her gaze slid past Trace and Drake, and her stare locked on the third man. A man who wore jeans and a jacket, but still came off with a heavy air of power and affluence. His eyes were green, a shade that seemed less...cold...than Drake\u2019s. His face was magazine perfect, his cheeks high, his nose slanting. He was about an inch shorter than Drake, but he was built along powerful, deadly lines.</p><p>She stared into his eyes, and realized she\u2019d seen those eyes before.</p><p>\u201cJasmine?\u201d Drake stepped forward, cutting off her direct line of sight with the man she knew to be Noah York.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening. This can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Drake reached for her he hands. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>Noah shouldn\u2019t be standing there. Not Noah.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her hands?\u201d Noah asked as he inched closer. His voice flowed over her. No accent. No hint of Texas.</p><p>Because he hadn\u2019t been to Texas. Not in so very long.</p><p>\u201cSome assholes shot at her SUV, and the windshield shattered around her.\u201d Drake said this so matter-of-factly. \u201cJasmine, shit, I knew I should\u2019ve used more care\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, used care when, exactly?\u201d Trace asked, his eyes gleaming as his stare raked from Jasmine\u2019s mouth to her hair, then back down to Drake\u2014and Drake\u2019s gentle hold on Jasmine\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cI think I should sit down,\u201d Jasmine managed. She had to figure something out, fast.</p><p>Drake pulled out a chair and got her settled. Then he stayed there, right beside her, frowning worriedly down at her.</p><p>He was worried? This was bad.</p><p>Because now all three of the men were crowding around her. Her gaze kept wanting to slide to Noah. He looked different in person. More approachable. Not that she would\u2019ve ever approached him.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.</p><p>She yanked her gaze off Noah, only to find herself caught by Drake\u2019s hard stare. He\u2019d realized that she was staring at Noah. Staring too long at him.</p><p>\u201cIt happens,\u201d Trace suddenly said. \u201cWomen look at him and get a little crazy. I knew we should\u2019ve broken his nose a few more times, Drake.\u201d</p><p>Drake grunted. \u201cYeah, seems like a good idea right now.\u201d</p><p>She felt heat race to her cheeks. \u201cWh-why are you here?\u201d Jasmine turned her focus to Trace when she asked that question. Because of all the three men, he would be the one most likely to wreck her plans.</p><p>Trace was Weston Securities, and if he wanted to uncover secrets about her past...</p><p>Understanding hit and her focus shifted to Drake. \u201cYou had him investigate me.\u201d She said it like the accusation it was.</p><p>Trace coughed into his hand. \u201cYou did try to rob him, correct?\u201d</p><p>Her flush was just getting worse. So Trace and Noah thought that she was a thief\u2014I am\u2014and they also knew she\u2019d just had sex with Drake. The floor could just open up and swallow her at any time\u2014that would be awesome.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that you two don\u2019t know about,\u201d Drake said to his buddies. \u201cThe past still isn\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine focused on breathing, nice and easily. Unfortunately, her breaths came out sounding all ragged and desperate.</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean\u2019s lover is trying to destroy me,\u201d Drake said. \u201cSeeing as how you were both involved in what when down a few months ago, I figured you deserved to know what was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer lover?\u201d Noah\u2019s brows climbed. \u201cI thought that was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d Drake was still staring at Jasmine. \u201cI think you might know him. It\u2019s a jackass named Maxwell Case.\u201d</p><p>Noah whistled.</p><p>\u201cHe wants Jasmine,\u201d Drake said. \u201cAnd I need you both to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing his men were the ones shooting up her SUV?\u201d Trace threw out.</p><p>Drake nodded.</p><p>Jasmine straightened in her chair.</p><p>\u201cYou guys can\u2019t go after Maxwell.\u201d That comment had all their eyes turning back to her. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said, wondering if perhaps the men were a bit crazy. Or a lot crazy. \u201cYou all need to get out of town and let-let the FBI handle things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean your buddy Victor Monroe?\u201d Drake\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cBecause you told him what was happening, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Victor knew plenty. \u201cHe\u2019s with the FBI. I figured he was my safest bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t look safe to me,\u201d Drake said, hands tight at his sides. \u201cWhen he was trapped in that SUV and you were being hauled into that van.\u201d</p><p>She shot up from the chair. \u201cWe were ambushed!\u201d That hadn\u2019t been Victor\u2019s fault.</p><p>\u201cAnd he should have done a better job of keeping you safe, ambush or no ambush!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, excuse me...\u201d Noah murmured.</p><p>\u201cVictor is a great FBI agent,\u201d Jasmine defended fiercely. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most decent men I know and he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother lover?\u201d</p><p>She had not seen that one coming. Jasmine\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cNo handcuffs,\u201d Drake pointed out. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think he calls most of his suspects \u2018baby\u2019 but I could be wrong.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a conversation that she wanted to have in front of Trace and Noah, and those two were avidly watching.</p><p>Why am I trying to pretend? She was sure that Trace had already briefed Noah on all the information he\u2019d discovered about her.</p><p>Daughter of a prostitute.</p><p>Did Trace know that? Yes, yes, of course he does...</p><p>Teenage runaway.</p><p>Hacker.</p><p>She drew herself up to her full height. But her toes curled in the carpet. \u201cJust to be clear, I haven\u2019t slept with Victor or with Maxwell.\u201d She pointed at Trace. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care what your intel says. Intel can be wrong. It\u2019s wrong this time.\u201d Her glare swept back to Drake. \u201cYou\u2019re my lover. The only one I\u2019ve had in a very long time, and you know what? That shit should be private! I shouldn\u2019t be having to explain and justify myself to you and your buddies!\u201d Chest heaving, she turned on her heel. \u201cNow I\u2019m tired. I was shot at, nearly abducted, and then, well, you know what went down in that elevator. I\u2019m going to bed, and I don\u2019t want anyone so much as knocking on that door for the next two hours.\u201d Jasmine didn\u2019t glance back over her shoulder as she gave that order.</p><p>Her knees didn\u2019t knock as she made her way to the bedroom. She slammed the door behind her. A nice touch, at least, Jasmine thought so.</p><p>When the door closed, yes, her knees definitely trembled then. And her gaze flew around the room.</p><p>I have to get out of here.</p><p>Because she had to stop Drake and his buddies before they all wound up dead.</p><p>Jasmine inched toward the air vent in the corner. No way could she fit in there. That just left the doors that lead out onto the balcony...</p><p>The balcony. Being as quiet as possible, Jasmine opened the French doors that led outside. She tip-toed onto the balcony. They were about ten stories up. She could see the flash of cars below her. So very far below her.</p><p>Not like she had a choice, though. Jasmine squared her shoulders and inched closer to the edge of that balcony.</p><p>\u201cSo...out of curiosity...what did go down in the elevator?\u201d Trace asked, him voice mild.</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up,\u201d Drake fired at him. His gaze was on the closed bedroom door. There had been something about Jasmine\u2019s expression when she stormed away...</p><p>Noah strode closer to him. \u201cGive the woman a few minutes to rest. She looked exhausted.\u201d He cocked a brow. \u201cAnd since when are you the kind of guy who wants to keep twenty-four seven tabs on a woman, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince he met a woman who tried to rob him blind.\u201d Trace dropped onto Drake\u2019s couch. \u201cAnd trust me, with a woman like her, you\u2019re gonna need to keep watching, carefully.\u201d</p><p>Drake narrowed his eyes on his friend. \u201cA woman like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy, smart, and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s hand slapped down on Drake\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAh, that makes her just your type, right? Women with an edge are always more interesting.\u201d</p><p>Drake growled at him.</p><p>Noah sobered. \u201cThough I am a bit confused. If some jerks were hauling her into a van, how\u2019d you get her away from them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shot one of them.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Trace exchanged a long look.</p><p>What? \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let them kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut obviously they wanted her alive,\u201d Trace pointed out, \u201cor else they would\u2019ve killed her on sight.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, Drake saw red. The red of Jasmine\u2019s blood. \u201cHe wanted to take her away so he could torture her. So he could hurt her because she was helping me. Everything that he wants to do to Jasmine, every pain, is because of me.\u201d Then, softer, \u201cAnd Anna Jean. He wants to pay me back, and he\u2019s going to use Jasmine to do it.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s fingers drummed on the couch as Drake paced the room. \u201cShe\u2019s no innocent. Her file\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew the file! She took nothing. She helped me.\u201d His gaze swung back to the closed bedroom door. \u201cAnd I will help her. I\u2019m not going to let Maxwell get anywhere near her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be where I come in,\u201d Noah said with a slight nod. \u201cAm I still supposed to be the woman\u2019s ride out of town?\u201d</p><p>Drake knew the cops would be monitoring his movements, so he\u2019d decided that it would be best for Jasmine to slip away with Noah. \u201cYes. You fly her to New York. I\u2019ll be there as soon as things are cleared up down here.\u201d</p><p>Noah tilted his head toward Drake. \u201cYou mean as soon as you eliminate the threat posed by Maxwell Case.\u201d</p><p>Drake stared back at him. He thought that was obvious.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill a man in cold blood,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that bullshit.\u201d Drake stopped pacing. \u201cFor your precious Skye, just what would you do, Trace? What have you done?\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s mouth tightened.</p><p>\u201cTrace loves Skye,\u201d Noah said, voice soft, thoughtful. \u201cAre you saying that you have...feelings for this woman? Do you love her?\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cLove has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>Wind whipped against Jasmine\u2019s body as she stood on the balcony. Her hands gripped the edges of the railing. It was high. It was terrifyingly high. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But you\u2019re not going down. You just have to go across.</p><p>She\u2019d found her escape path.</p><p>A thin ledge connected two balconies. The balcony in Drake\u2019s apartment, and a balcony that waited about ten feet away. If she got to that other balcony, she could slip away and vanish into the casino.</p> <p>If she got to that other balcony.</p><p>Lightning crackled across the sky, illuminating her deadly walk. Thunder rumbled.</p><p>And raindrops hit her.</p><p>She really had shit for luck.</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot,\u201d Noah said as he flashed Drake a hard smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t love. Love is for fools like\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou.\u201d Because he\u2019d seen exactly how crazy Noah had become when he fell for Claire. Crazy and desperate. Obsessed.</p><p>Drake had no intention of becoming obsessed with anyone. \u201cJust take Jasmine back to New York with you, okay? When Trace and I are done eliminating Case\u2019s threat, you can stop playing guard.\u201d</p><p>From outside, Drake heard the hard rumble of thunder.</p><p>\u201cYou guarded Claire for me...\u201d Noah sighed. \u201cSo I guess I can return the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe warned, Jasmine is nothing like your Claire.\u201d Noah\u2019s wife Claire was sweet and charming, and when Drake had looked into her eyes once, he\u2019d seen all the pain of her past. Claire had nearly been broken by the nightmare that had been her life.</p><p>Jasmine\u2014Jasmine wasn\u2019t broken in any way. She was wild, a firestorm, strong and ready to meet any challenge head on.</p> <p>\u201cHell.\u201d He rushed for his closed bedroom door as realization dawned. \u201cThat woman isn\u2019t tired at all.\u201d</p><p>He threw open the bedroom door. The room was empty.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t even possible.</p><p>\u201cJasmine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doors to the balcony are open,\u201d Trace said as he ran in behind Drake.</p><p>The doors were open\u2014and rain poured in from those open doors.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s storming,\u201d Noah said, sounding lost. \u201cWhy would the woman go out in a storm?\u201d</p><p>Drake leapt out onto the balcony. Lightning flashed overhead. He looked down\u2014no Jasmine. She wasn\u2019t lying, body twisted, on the pavement below.</p> <p>Thank Christ.</p><p>He heard a faint gasp then, and his gaze shot up and to the left. Jasmine was there, about ten feet away from him, reaching out for the railing on the other side of an incredibly small ledge.</p><p>Drake stopped breathing as he stared at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Noah whispered from behind him.</p><p>Her hand closed around the railing. Drake knew he should be rushing back through his apartment and around to that other balcony, but he couldn\u2019t move, not until he was sure that she was safe.</p><p>Every muscle in his body had turned to stone.</p><p>Slowly, inch by inch, she climbed over the railing and onto that balcony. Her feet were bare, still bare, and when her toes touched down, he finally took a breath.</p><p>\u201cJasmine.\u201d Her name was on that breath.</p><p>And even though his voice had been low, her head whipped up. Her gaze met his.</p><p>Then she turned and ran.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Adrenaline had her whole body quaking. Adrenaline and fear and oh, God, but she never wanted to do anything like that again.</p><p>Desperate times make for desperate women.</p><p>She had to get out of Drake\u2019s sight. Get to Victor. End this nightmare before anyone else was hurt.</p><p>She yanked open the balcony door and found herself inside an office. A long conference table waited to the right. She ran past it and toward what she hoped would be an exit door. She had to find the stairs or an elevator and get\u2014</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Trace Weston lunged out of the darkness of that room. He stood between Jasmine and her precious exit door. And he was a definite immovable object. His head was cocked as he studied her.</p><p>She staggered to a stop.</p><p>\u201cUnlike Drake, I didn\u2019t stay around to see if you\u2019d make it to the other side of that little ledge.\u201d He took a step toward her. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s been investigating you for the last few days, so I know just what you\u2019re capable of doing. What you have done. I knew you\u2019d dance right across that ledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-your wife is the dancer, not me.\u201d Trace was married to an ex-prima ballerina, so that taunt just rolled right out of her mouth. This big, tough, scary guy had hooked up with a woman as delicate as fine china.</p><p>Maybe opposites really did attract.</p><p>She choked back her fear and said, \u201cYou have to get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Her lead time was dwindling fast. Drake would be running in there soon.</p><p>Trace looked genuinely confused. \u201cWhy would I want to do that? I don\u2019t think Drake planned for you to disappear from his life.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to the door behind him. She only had seconds. \u201cI\u2019m going to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a woman to be trusted, but I think you already discovered that.\u201d She inched toward him. \u201cPlease, I need to get out of the Masquerade. I have to go see Victor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI agent?\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who can stop this.\u201d</p><p>His arms crossed over his chest. \u201cYou should have more faith in Drake.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t about faith. It was about what would happen. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt him,\u201d she confessed. \u201cSo you have to get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Her back teeth locked. She hadn\u2019t made it across that scary-as-sin ledge to be blocked by this guy. Footsteps were pounding outside of the door. Drake\u2014rushing after her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you try to run?\u201d Trace asked her. \u201cWe were making plans to fly you up to New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how wonderful,\u201d she muttered. \u201cPlans for my life. Thanks, but I\u2019ve already got plans of my own.\u201d</p><p>And since he wasn\u2019t getting out of her way, Jasmine did the only thing that she could\u2014she made a break for it. A fast, desperate run.</p><p>But Trace caught her before she\u2019d taken more than three steps. His arms locked tightly around her, and he yanked her up against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you, and, unlike Drake, I wasn\u2019t taken in by your innocent eyes.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were innocent? Since when?</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t getting away,\u201d he promised.</p><p>The door burst open. Drake stood there, chest heaving, eyes blazing.</p><p>\u201cNot from any of us.\u201d Trace\u2019s whisper slid into her ear.</p><p>She heaved in his hold. The guy just tightened his grip, so she slammed down her heel. She hit his foot, then his shin, then anything she could find.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Drake yanked her out of Trace\u2019s arms. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking? You could have died out there.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get it. \u201cIf I stay with you, I am dead. We both are. I\u2019m a target, big and red, and Maxwell is coming for me fast and hard. Or did you miss that shoot out on the street? He wants me, and he\u2019ll take out anyone who gets in his way.\u201d Her gaze darted from Trace to Noah. Lingered on Noah. \u201cI can\u2019t have collateral damage. I won\u2019t.\u201d Just looking at Noah hurt.</p><p>He had no clue who she was to him. And, seeing as how Trace had no doubt given the guy an earful about her many sins, it was better that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d she said this flatly. \u201cEven if I have to climb over a dozen balconies, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Noah stalked closer to her. \u201cBalcony climbing isn\u2019t necessary. You are leaving. With me. Our plane will take off within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine shook her head and flinched away from him. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you.\u201d No way could that be an option. Not ever. Noah had to be safe. He had a life. A wife. A family.</p><p>I wanted a family. For so long.</p><p>And she was staring right at the family that was hers.</p><p>Noah frowned at her. \u201cAre you...okay?\u201d</p><p>Dammit, she was almost crying in front of the guy! Jasmine blinked away the water that filled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJasmine...\u201d Now Drake was sounding all worried and his hand was slowly stroking her arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid. I won\u2019t let Maxwell hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Seriously? It wasn\u2019t about her. It was about them! Him. Noah. Even asshole Trace. She straightened her spine. \u201cTell them,\u201d she demanded with a fast glare at Trace. \u201cTell them that they\u2019re wasting their time. That I\u2019m not worth any help they want to give.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s eyes narrowed to near slits as he studied her.</p><p>\u201cTell them!\u201d Jasmine yelled. Her heart was breaking. She couldn\u2019t be this close to Drake...and to Noah.</p><p>Noah doesn\u2019t know me. I\u2019m a stranger to him. A stranger who could rip his life apart.</p><p>She\u2019d never wanted to rip apart Noah\u2019s life. She\u2019d wanted to meet him. Just see him.</p><p>When she\u2019d been a kid, she used to dream about Noah...she\u2019d known he existed, of course. Her mother had told her all about the baby boy she\u2019d given up for adoption.</p><p>She gave him away...but she kept me.</p><p>Jasmine knew Noah was the lucky one.</p><p>Her brother. Standing right there. Staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worth it,\u201d Jasmine repeated again. \u201cI\u2019m a criminal, a thief.\u201d Her lips twisted into a humorless smile. \u201cA liar. If I had the chance, I\u2019d betray every single one of you.\u201d Her gaze came back to Drake. She made herself say, \u201cEvery. Single. One.\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed in Drake\u2019s jaw.</p><p>Jasmine laughed, and the sound was bitter to her own ears. \u201cDidn\u2019t you learn anything from Anna Jean? You don\u2019t want to trust me. You can\u2019t. So get the hell out of my way before I destroy you all.\u201d Such tough words. Such hard words to say.</p><p>Because she didn\u2019t want to run from Drake and Noah.</p><p>Those two men\u2014they were all she\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>A lover who made her forget the hell of her life.</p><p>And a brother...family. Real family. Not the kind that was always drunk or high or...willing to sell you.</p><p>Her lips clamped together and she stormed around Drake. He wasn\u2019t stopping her. Good. He\u2019d gotten the message. She was trouble. She was also going.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be dead before the sun sets.\u201d That was Trace making that grim prediction. \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have what she wanted. That was why Jasmine planned to leave Drake behind.</p><p>Her hand touched the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201d Drake\u2019s voice stopped her cold.</p><p>But that was what she wanted, right? No trust. No attachment.</p><p>\u201cMaxwell wants you. He wants you very badly.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door.</p><p>Saw the guards in the hallway. Four of them. Hell.</p><p>Drake\u2019s hand closed over her shoulder. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to let that bastard have anything that he wants.\u201d He turned her to face him. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you,\u201d he said once more, like he was driving a nail into her coffin.</p><p>Her chin lifted.</p><p>\u201cBut I am going to use you, princess. You\u2019re going to be the bait that brings down that bastard. Then we\u2019ll both be free. You can vanish from my life, and I\u2019ll stay the hell out of yours.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the way Jasmine stared at Noah.</p><p>Drake frowned as he watched Jasmine send yet another furtive glance toward his friend. Why did she keep gazing at the guy with that lost expression in her eyes?</p><p>Yeah, okay, fine, Noah was a ladies\u2019 man. Or he had been, until the guy had settled down with his Claire. Now Noah was full-on obsessed with his lovely new wife, and the guy wasn\u2019t playing the field.</p><p>Jasmine needed to stop watching Noah.</p><p>Fucking now.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s jealousy.\u201d</p><p>He turned at Trace\u2019s voice. They were in a small, private airport outside of the city. Noah\u2019s plane was supposed to be taking off soon.</p><p>Taking off with Jasmine.</p><p>She\u2019s bait, all right. But she doesn\u2019t have to actually be here when the trap is sprung. He wanted her safely away because he...well, he just wanted her safe.</p><p>\u201cThe way you\u2019re glaring at Noah, it\u2019s a dead giveaway.\u201d Trace sighed softly. \u201cYou really sure you want your woman flying off with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust Noah.\u201d He did.</p><p>\u201cAh, right. But not her? What if she tries her hand at seducing him? I mean, the woman can\u2019t seem to keep her eyes off the guy.\u201d</p><p>He was growling. Drake tried to stop. He wasn\u2019t an animal, no matter what he might be feeling at that moment. \u201cNoah doesn\u2019t see any woman but Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Is that how it works?\u201d</p><p>Drake shifted a bit because he\u2019d just noticed that Noah was staring at Jasmine with a guarded, assessing gaze.</p><p>As soon as Jasmine caught the other man\u2019s stare, she immediately stiffened and glanced away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was another target for her,\u201d Trace mused. \u201cI mean, the way she\u2019s acting, the woman knows him. Or she knows something about him.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. \u201cThe photograph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>He marched away from Trace and headed for Jasmine. Noah stood near her, and his friend nodded as he approached. \u201cAbout fifteen minutes until take-off,\u201d Noah said. \u201cOnce we\u2019re safe in New York, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t glance his way. \u201cYou never told me why the photograph mattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat photograph?\u201d She immediately asked as her chin notched up.</p><p>Back to that old game, were they?</p><p>He caught her sexy little chin between his thumb and forefinger. \u201cIt\u2019s a dead giveaway,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Her eyes widened. So dark and deep.

Not like this.</p><p>Noah coughed a bit. \u201cOkay, I think I\u2019ll wait on the plane...\u201d He started to back away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Drake ordered because he was trying to figure this thing out.</p><p>Jasmine had paled. The sun was up, and he could easily see the sudden pallor of her skin and the flash of fear in her eyes. \u201cThat was Noah\u2019s wedding picture.\u201d</p> <p>Now Noah was crowding in closer. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>The pilot advanced toward them. \u201cWe should board the plane now.\u201d He shifted a bit nervously, from one foot to the other. \u201cThe pre-flight checks are all clear. We\u2019ve got the okay to take-off.\u201d</p><p>Two mechanics were over in the corner, packing up gear.</p><p>Jasmine tried to head toward the plane. Drake moved with her, blocking her path.</p><p>\u201cWhat is with you?\u201d Jasmine demanded. \u201cYou want me to go, you want me to stay. Make up your mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know why you took one look at Noah\u2019s wedding picture, and you decided not to hack my computer. I want to know why one look at that picture changed everything for you.\u201d And it had. She\u2019d betrayed Maxwell and set this deadly chain of events into motion.</p> <p>But she didn\u2019t betray him for me.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s gaze slanted toward Noah.</p><p>She did it for him.</p><p>\u201cI saw you on the security footage.\u201d There had been such longing on her face. Longing for Noah? Rage pumped through his blood.</p><p>Jasmine wet her lips with a quick, nervous swipe of her tongue. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s stare lasered onto Noah. \u201cHave you met Jasmine before?\u201d</p><p>Surprise flashed on Noah\u2019s face. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Trace had closed in next to Noah.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Drake pressed. \u201cThink about it.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s stare swept over Jasmine. A very tense Jasmine. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d forget a woman like her,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Drake unclenched his back teeth.</p><p>\u201cBut...but I swear,\u201d Noah continued, voice roughening, \u201cthere\u2019s something familiar about you, Jasmine. I look at you, and I...\u201d</p><p>Jasmine pushed through the men and headed for the plane. \u201cWe need to get this show on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know him?\u201d Drake demanded.</p><p>She kept marching toward the plane.</p><p>Drake shot a glare at Trace. \u201cAre they connected? Did you see anything in her past that is tied to Noah?\u201d Why had she changed everything for him? Yeah, that jealousy was back and twisting hard in Drake\u2019s gut.</p><p>Trace shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a connection, but so much of her life is shrouded. The woman is good at covering her tracks. Hell, if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think...\u201d But then Trace broke off. \u201cI\u2019ve seen government agents who have less security in their lives than she does. She wanted years of her life hidden, and she made them vanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say...\u201d Jasmine\u2019s words drifted back to them. \u201cI\u2019m amazing.\u201d But her voice was flat. \u201cNow, the plane\u2019s ready. The plane that you insisted I board.\u201d</p><p>The pilot hurried by her and rushed up the steps that led to the plane.</p><p>The mechanics were still lingering in the corner. Watching.</p><p>Waiting?</p><p>Jasmine climbed two of the steps.</p><p>Drake turned away from her and focused on those mechanics. One had a faint smile on his face as he watched Jasmine board the plane. The guy was still smiling as he turned away...and started heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Drake shouted at him.</p><p>The guy jerked and glanced back.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk with you,\u201d Drake barked as he hurried toward the man, his instincts on high alert. \u201cTo both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Drake...\u201d Noah began.</p><p>The mechanics were grabbing their gear and they weren\u2019t slowing down for a little chat. They were trying to haul ass out of there.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Drake yelled again. His phone started ringing, vibrating like mad in his coat pocket. He ignored the phone and focused on the men. The two guys were full out running now and the plane\u2019s engine was growling behind him. That didn\u2019t make any sense. Mechanics wouldn\u2019t run\u2014</p><p>They\u2019re not mechanics.</p><p>He spun back around. \u201cJasmine, get away from the plane!\u201d</p><p>She was on the stairs. Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cGet away from it!\u201d</p><p>Trace was now running after the fleeing mechanics but Drake ran right toward the plane. Toward Jasmine.</p><p>He saw understanding on her face. But she didn\u2019t leave the plane. That insane woman turned toward the plane\u2019s entrance and began yelling for the pilot. She disappeared inside.</p><p>No! \u201cJasmine! Get the hell out!\u201d His legs burned as he raced toward her.</p><p>All he could think was...a bomb. They planted a bomb, and I\u2019m about to lose her. Maxwell likes his bombs...I\u2019m going to lose her. \u201cJasmine!\u201d</p><p>His phone was ringing again. Drake ignored the thing because he was rushing to her.</p><p>She was back on the steps now\u2014and hauling the pilot with her.</p><p>Drake rushed up the stairs toward her. He grabbed her hand and pulled her against him. Then they ran down the last few steps as fast as they could.</p><p>They\u2019d just cleared the tiny airstrip when the plane exploded.</p><p>\u201cBoom,\u201d Maxwell whispered when he saw the smoke fill the sky. Ah, but it paid to have eyes and ears everywhere.</p><p>Noah York and Trace Weston were on Maxwell\u2019s hit list. He\u2019d planned to take them all out...because they\u2019d all played a part in Anna Jean\u2019s death.</p><p>But they\u2019d been targets for later. Less important. Drake had been his main goal.</p><p>Then Drake had made the mistake of calling in his friends.</p><p>\u201cIt was time for them to die.\u201d Maxwell rolled his shoulders. He\u2019d made the little bomb. All his men had needed to do was plant it.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured. Saxon stood a few feet away. \u201cHead toward the scene for me,\u201d Maxwell ordered. \u201cSee who survived...and who didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Face expressionless, Saxon nodded. The guard turned and climbed onto his motorcycle.</p><p>Maxwell admired the blaze for a moment longer, then he headed toward his car and driver.</p><p>It sure was a beautiful morning.</p><p>A plane, my love...ah, Anna Jean, isn\u2019t that fitting? She\u2019d been such a wonderful pilot. He definitely thought she would have appreciated the send-off he\u2019d just given to Noah York and Trace Weston. After all, two passengers had been scheduled to depart. A little cash to the right hand had given him that information.</p><p>And a little more cash had been paid to end those two lives...</p><p>His phone was ringing again.</p><p>Drake stared at the blaze, aware of Jasmine\u2019s hand clutching his arm.</p><p>She\u2019d nearly died.</p><p>Jasmine blinked. \u201cI, um\u2014\u201d</p><p>His arms wrapped around her and he hauled her as close as he could get her. She was warm and soft against him. Alive.</p><p>\u201cSending you away isn\u2019t an option,\u201d he snapped. The smoke had turned the sky black.</p><p>His phone stopped ringing.</p><p>Jasmine looked up at him. \u201cNoah was going to be on that plane.\u201d Her words trembled.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t look away from her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at risk now, too, because of me.\u201d A tear slid down her cheek. \u201cI never wanted him in danger.\u201d</p><p>Him? Still on Noah? \u201cWhat the hell is the connection?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His phone rang once more.</p><p>Swearing, he pulled away from her\u2014just a few inches\u2014and yanked out that phone. He didn\u2019t recognize the number on the screen.</p><p>Sirens were screaming once more. Story of his life these days. Where he went, police cars followed. \u201cWe need to get out of here,\u201d Drake said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll handle things,\u201d Trace told him, giving a hard nod. He stood just a few feet away. \u201cYou get her out of here.\u201d He motioned toward the two men who were slumped at Noah\u2019s feet. Trace and Noah had made sure those men didn\u2019t flee the scene. The \u201cmechanics\u201d hadn\u2019t gotten away. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this,\u201d Trace said simply.</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t want to leave. He wanted to interrogate those SOBs and force them to lead him back to Maxwell.</p><p>But Jasmine had to be protected. He\u2019d nearly messed things up royally just then. He\u2019d been the one to demand that she get on that plane. If he hadn\u2019t gotten suspicious in those last moments, the plane would have exploded with her inside.</p><p>Then what would I have done?</p><p>Jasmine was staring at Noah. A-fucking-gain. He wanted to slug his friend and drag Jasmine away.</p><p>So he did drag Jasmine away.</p><p>But she called out, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>She was apologizing to Noah?</p><p>\u201cI never wanted this to happen. It wasn\u2019t supposed to touch you.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her into his car. Had that Porsche purring and bursting out of the lot in seconds.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the deal?\u201d Drake demanded between gritted teeth. \u201cWhy him?\u201d</p><p>His phone rang. He yanked it out as a motorcycle passed them. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her on the plane!\u201d</p><p>His hold tightened on the phone.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear me? This is Agent Victor Monroe. I\u2019ve got intel that York\u2019s private plane is going to be targeted. Do not let Jasmine get on that flight\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s gaze slanted to his rear-view mirror. \u201cToo late,\u201d he muttered as he stared at that smoke-filled sky. \u201cThe plane\u2019s burning.\u201d</p><p>There was a swift inhalation of air. \u201cBut you have Jasmine. You have Jasmine!\u201d</p><p>His stare drifted to her. She sat stiffly next to him. \u201cI\u2019ve got her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood...good...if you want her to stay alive, you\u2019ll listen very, very carefully because I am the only one who can help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause you did such a stellar job last time,\u201d Drake snapped at him. \u201cThe way you had her safe in the city\u2014oh, wait, she was being taken by those jerks in the van\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Laurence Street. Five-oh-eight. Get her there, understand? I\u2019ll meet you, and this will end.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead. Asshole agent. He shoved his phone aside. Jasmine didn\u2019t ask any questions, she just sat there in silence, and that silence was driving him crazy.</p><p>Why Noah? \u201cHe\u2019s got a wife.\u201d Yeah, so Noah was the one who laughed easily. Who didn\u2019t scare small children. Who\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not...interested in him that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cried for him.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw Jasmine\u2019s fingers twist in her lap.</p><p>\u201cTell me why he matters. Why he changed everything for you.\u201d And maybe he\u2019d stop wanting to punch his best friend.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe me.\u201d Her words were so soft that he had to strain to hear them. \u201cI keep seeing the plane...if he\u2019d been on it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew Noah! You were the one nearly blown to hell!\u201d And he couldn\u2019t get that image out of his mind. Jasmine should have been safe. This wasn\u2019t the way the plan was supposed to work. Not at all.</p><p>Drake had underestimated his enemy. Maxwell\u2019s reach was greater than he\u2019d realized. Were you watching Noah and Trace? Hell, if Maxwell was looking for payback because of Anna Jean, then, dammit, yes, Maxwell would be keeping eyes on them, too. There was no telling how long the bastard had been putting them all in his crosshairs.</p><p>Rage churned within Drake. Rage and...fear. I almost lost Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cThe pilot nearly died, too.\u201d Her voice was even softer than before.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d Drake snarled back. \u201cBecause you risked your life to go back in after him! You should\u2019ve gotten out, you should\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not who I am.\u201d</p><p>He spun the car off the main road. They hit dirt and gravel and flew forward toward the swamp. It was a path most wouldn\u2019t have known. It was a path he took every time he needed to escape.</p><p>He kept driving, kept going until he was sure they were out of sight and that all the fire trucks and cops wouldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>Good thing he knew the area so well. Once upon a time, he\u2019d spent summers on all these back roads when he stayed with his grandfather. They\u2019d hunted. Fished. Stared at sunsets and snakes.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave him to die. I-I couldn\u2019t let anyone just...die.\u201d</p><p>He braked the car. Dust shot into the air around them.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not so sure this is the best place for your Porsche...\u201d</p><p>He jumped out of the car.</p><p>She followed him, much, much more slowly. \u201cIs that a cabin?\u201d She was staring at the dense vegetation around them. The swamp had nearly swallowed the cabin. \u201cWe should get out of here. This is someone\u2019s property\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cabin is mine.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes squinted as she looked at the cabin once more. \u201cYou drive a Porsche, you have luxury homes in Vegas and New Orleans and you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up dirt poor in Mississippi until I was ten. Then my dad cut out on me, and my mother and I moved in with my grandfather.\u201d He pointed to the cabin behind him. \u201cI spent the best years of my life in this place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her expression softened.</p><p>\u201cOther than Noah and Trace, no one else knows about this cabin. We\u2019ll be safe here until I can make contact with Trace again.\u201d He knew that Noah and Trace would be able to handle the cops. Trace had connections all over the place. \u201cLet\u2019s get inside.\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward his now dirt-covered Porsche. \u201cYou surprise me.\u201d</p> <p>He paused on the first wooden step. Sure, the cabin might not be much to look at, but he felt at home there. Always had. He came out there at least four or five times a year, when the city was about to choke the life out of him, and he remembered who he\u2019d been a lifetime ago.</p><p>A boy who fished on the dock. A boy who jumped into the water and laughed at the freedom. A boy who looked up at stars and dreamed.</p><p>Not just a man with too many nightmares.</p><p>\u201cI...didn\u2019t see this for you,\u201d Jasmine said as her hand waved toward the cabin. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you should\u2019ve checked more into my past, and not just my present.\u201d</p> <p>She gave a jerky little nod at that as she came closer to him. \u201cMy past is so screwed up. I have a rule that I try not to poke too far into anyone else\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand in his. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t want them knowing about yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d So soft.</p><p>\u201cI want to know everything.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but her dimples didn\u2019t flash. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what Trace is for? So he can give you a file on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell me.\u201d</p> <p>He waited a beat.</p><p>\u201cYou will tell me.\u201d</p><p>One way...or another.</p><p>Saxon braked his motorcycle a good distance from the old cabin. The Porsche waited, covered in dirt and dust, about fifteen feet from the place. Drake\u2019s car. He\u2019d recognized it on sight.</p><p>So he\u2019d followed them. Carefully.</p><p>His eyes slid over the cabin. Drake and Jazz were in there.</p><p>This was the perfect opportunity. Just what his boss had been waiting for.</p><p>Now, if he could just get the go-ahead to act.</p> <p>Saxon pulled out his phone. \u201cGuess who I\u2019ve got in my sights...\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to reveal all my secrets to you?\u201d Jasmine asked as she rubbed her arms. There was no reason for her chill, but she still felt it. \u201cIs that the way this works?\u201d</p><p>He was seated at a small, wooden table. His legs were stretched in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI tell you mine,\u201d she heard herself say, \u201cand I\u2019ll want to know yours.\u201d She thought those words might scare him. She should have known better.</p><p>His head inclined and her heartbeat raced.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d Jasmine blurted because she was a coward at heart. Had he realized it? Sure, maybe she could walk on a three inch ledge to a balcony ten feet away, but sharing anything personal?</p><p>Terrifying.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath. \u201cThe woman...Anna Jean...did you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Such a flat response.</p><p>\u201cI wanted her, I cared for her, but...I never loved her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve loved any woman.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cHave you slept with them?\u201d Drake demanded.</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor Monroe. The too familiar agent.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd Maxwell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was an assignment, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed and she realized that she\u2019d slipped up. Jasmine hurried toward him. \u201cWhy casinos? You were in the military, and going into the casino business seems like a serious one-eighty to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s a gamble.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou realize that when you spend your days and nights dodging bullets. When you cheat death over and over again, you realize you\u2019ve hit a lucky streak.\u201d</p><p>Hell, his whole life was a gamble. Now it made sense to her.</p><p>\u201cThen your luck runs out.\u201d</p><p>She stopped near his side and stared down at him. \u201cIs that what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>A faint smile tilted the corners of his mouth. \u201cMy turn now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, right.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you run away at fifteen?\u201d</p><p>Talk about getting right to her darkest, most carefully guarded secret. \u201cI don\u2019t like this game anymore.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand. Held it in his. \u201cIt was never a game.\u201d</p><p>His touch scorched her.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at their entwined hands. She didn\u2019t want to look in his eyes when she revealed her shame. \u201cMy mother...I realized what she was when I was nine years old. Before that, I just...I thought she had a lot of boyfriends. That was what she called them, you see. Her boyfriends.\u201d</p><p>Mommy\u2019s going out with her boyfriend tonight. You just stay inside and keep the lights turned off. I\u2019ll be back soon.</p><p>\u201cShe liked drugs and she liked to drink and she needed money...so she got it the only way she could.\u201d Had her mother been different once? Maybe before Jasmine had been born? Long ago, she must have been different.</p><p>Drake\u2019s hold tightened on her.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was fifteen, she tried to give me to one of her boyfriends.\u201d</p><p>His hold became painful.</p><p>\u201cShe said she was tired and that he liked me, and it would just make things easier if I...if I...\u201d No, Jasmine would not say it. \u201cI left, and I never looked back.\u201d Her breath whispered out. \u201cMaybe ease that grip a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He immediately lightened his hold. Then he brought her hand up to his lips. Kissed her wrist. Her palm.</p><p>Jasmine could only stare at him. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t how you were supposed to react.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the daughter of a drugged out prostitute. She overdosed a week after I left her. She died and they found her naked and alone in that trailer park.\u201d She shoved back the pain. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to react this way. You\u2019re not supposed to just sit there and stare up at me and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hand again. \u201cThe first time we talked, I realized how strong you were. I thought you might just be the strongest woman I\u2019d ever met.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She wasn\u2019t strong. She was weak. A\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou should see what I see,\u201d he told her, tilting back his head. \u201cWhen I look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA liar and a thief.\u201d She already knew what he saw.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pulled her down, and Jasmine sprawled over his lap. \u201cI see a beautiful, smart, strong woman who needs to believe in herself. Life\u2019s been hard, damn brutal to you, but you\u2019ve survived.\u201d</p><p>He was making her heart hurt. \u201cLike life hasn\u2019t been brutal to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have our scars.\u201d His thumb moved lightly along the inner column of her wrist. Jasmine knew he had to feel her racing pulse.</p><p>Yes, they did have their scars. \u201cWhen I was a little girl, I wanted another life. Any other life but the one I had. I would dream of starting some place new. A new name. A new past.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cA new future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re still running? Because you want that new life?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered. \u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t matter how long or hard you run, there\u2019s no escaping the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it? You can\u2019t even bury that shit sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze jerked back up to his. \u201cIs that what you want to do? Bury your past? Forget about Anna Jean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer blood will always be on my hands.\u201d His voice roughened. \u201cI hate what I did. I hate that I got drunk and screwed my friend\u2019s girl. Tucker and I...we were close and that destroyed him. Tucker mattered to me. Tucker, Noah, and Trace\u2014they were my family after my mother and grandfather died. And I wound up hurting them all because I couldn\u2019t keep my pants zipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was the only woman who ever got close to me. She looked at me and lied, and I didn\u2019t even realize it.\u201d He paused. Studied her with a hard gaze. \u201cI know when you lie, but the problem is...I don\u2019t seem to care.\u201d</p><p>She needed to pull away. Instead, she leaned in closer.</p><p>Their lips were almost touching.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you stare at Noah York and look as if you\u2019re losing your whole world?\u201d</p><p>His question sank into her, nearly piercing her heart. Too late, she did try to pull away, but there was no place to go.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t betray my friends. Not ever again,\u201d he vowed. \u201cThere\u2019s something there, between you and Noah. He doesn\u2019t remember you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should he? We never met.\u201d He was the lucky one.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he to you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to answer him.</p><p>\u201cJasmine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise not to tell.\u201d Her whisper. Like a child\u2019s voice.</p><p>Surprise rippled across his face.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to know, so promise me. Promise that you won\u2019t tell. When all of this is over...\u201d And it would be, one day. One day soon. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s my brother.\u201d Such a quiet confession. One that made Drake\u2019s muscles tense beneath her. \u201cI know he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother...she had a little boy before me. She gave him up at birth. She was just sixteen then.\u201d The words tumbled out in a rush now. \u201cShe gave him up, gave him to a family who couldn\u2019t have kids of their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe regretted giving him away. She told me that, she\u2019d scream that at me when she drank. So when she got pregnant again, she...she kept me.\u201d And I\u2019d wished, so many times, that she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Just as Jasmine had wished, so many times, that her brother would come back for her.</p><p>A girl, dreaming of a rescue that never came.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think Noah is your brother?\u201d No emotion was in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause she had one photo of the family who took him. I found it when I was six and...when I was fifteen, it was the only thing I took with me when I left her.\u201d Because she\u2019d thought\u2014stupidly then\u2014that she\u2019d find her brother. That he\u2019d take her in.</p><p>And she had found him. But Noah York had been fighting in battles overseas then, and she...she\u2019d found her own wars.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>She stared into the warmth of his eyes. \u201cTracking him wasn\u2019t hard. I had a photograph of his parents. Of him. And when I got access to the right computer equipment...photo imaging software, hospital databases...it all fell into place for me.\u201d Her lips tightened. \u201cHe even has her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, Jasmine found herself off his lap and back on her feet. And Drake had paced across the room, putting a good ten feet between them.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. Jasmine\u2019s hands were curled around her stomach and his\u2014his were fisted at his sides. \u201cHis sister?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s fucking sister?\u201d Then he squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d Then softer, \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d Nervously, she edged toward him. The floor creaked beneath her feet.</p><p>He threw up a hand, halting her. \u201cDo not touch me right now.\u201d</p><p>She was so lost.</p><p>\u201cWhen you touch me, I want to strip you. I want to take you. I want to make you scream my name.\u201d</p><p>Oh, well, in that case...Jasmine took another step.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his sister!\u201d He backed away from her. \u201cAll Noah has ever wanted was to find out about his real family. He used to talk about them for hours out in the field...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was better off not knowing.\u201d No... \u201cHe is better off not knowing.\u201d Noah had a wife, a home. He didn\u2019t need the mess of the past.</p><p>He stared at her with both rage and pain in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re what he\u2019s wanted. You were right in front of him, and he didn\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t good. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I have to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Then she leapt across the room and grabbed tightly to his arms. \u201cYou really want to tell him that his mom was a drugged out prostitute? That she couldn\u2019t remember his father\u2019s name? That his sister...\u201d The breath she expelled burned her lungs. \u201cTrace will tell you that I have a criminal history. I\u2019ve been hacking for years. I\u2019ve got enemies...so many. You don\u2019t want to put this at his doorstep. You don\u2019t want to put me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah can handle enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to know. Please, Drake. There\u2019s no point in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll want you in his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t be a part of his life.\u201d That ripped her up. She\u2019d realize that truth, though, long ago. \u201cSo let it go.\u201d Her hands slid up his chest. Curled around his shoulders.</p><p>He was so stiff in her embrace. \u201cI fucked you.\u201d</p><p>Did the man have some moral opposition to \u201cmaking love\u201d? Because she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s sister.\u201d His eyes closed. \u201cKnew you were trouble. From the first glance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were, too.\u201d And she hadn\u2019t cared. She rose onto her toes. Pressed her lips to his.</p><p>He immediately jerked away.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were open. Blazing. \u201cI won\u2019t betray a friend again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t betraying anyone.\u201d But he was hurting her when he pulled away.</p><p>He yanked out his phone. Turned his back on her.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d</p> <p>He took a few more steps away. That phone was to his ear and he said, \u201cTrace, what\u2019s the status? Do you have things contained?\u201d</p><p>A faint growling sound reached Jasmine\u2019s ears. She crept toward the window on the right.</p><p>Still talking into his phone, Drake said, \u201cYeah, well, we have another problem.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders tightened as she peered out the window. She couldn\u2019t see anyone outside, and that growling had stopped.</p><p>\u201cHow fast do you think we could get a DNA test?\u201d</p> <p>No. Jasmine whirled around.</p><p>\u201cRight. A DNA test. Comparing Jasmine and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She flew across the room and yanked that phone out of his hand. She hung up on Trace. \u201cWhat are you doing? You can\u2019t tell them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re really his sister, then Noah deserves to know.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do this. \u201cNo, Drake. No.\u201d</p><p>His phone was ringing again. He tried to reach for it. She put it behind her back.</p> <p>One blond brow rose. \u201cSeriously, Jasmine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, seriously, Drake.\u201d She hurried away from him. \u201cThis is my life we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah is filthy rich.\u201d Drake said those words bluntly. \u201cIf you\u2019re his sister, he\u2019s going to want to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when I was fifteen and stealing food to survive\u2014\u201d</p><p>He flinched.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. \u201cI would have appreciated his money. I don\u2019t now. I don\u2019t want him knowing.\u201d Jasmine wanted to toss that phone. To shatter it. \u201cTrace isn\u2019t going to forget this.\u201d Now he\u2019d start probing. \u201cDammit, why did you have to say anything? Why\u2014\u201d</p><p>That growling was back. Only this time, she wasn\u2019t the only one who heard the sound. Drake\u2019s head jerked toward the window. In two fast steps, he was there, peering outside, then swearing when he saw the lights that hit the cabin.</p><p>\u201cMotorcycles,\u201d Jasmine whispered. She counted at least three. And was that an SUV rushing in behind them?</p> <p>It was.</p><p>She answered the ringing phone. \u201cTrace, I think you need to get your ass over to Drake\u2019s old cabin...cause we\u2019ve got company.\u201d</p><p>Drake had already whirled away from the window. He marched to a closet and started pulling out\u2014weapons?</p><p>A gun. A knife.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of company?\u201d Trace barked in her ear.</p><p>\u201cThe kind that isn\u2019t friendly.\u201d She was backing away from the window. How had they been found?</p><p>Drake was back. He grabbed the phone from her. \u201cMy grandfather\u2019s place. Get here as fast as you can...because this party isn\u2019t going to wait.\u201d He shoved the phone into his pocket as his eyes glittered down at Jasmine. \u201cDo you know how to shoot a gun?\u201d</p><p>She did. That didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d want to. Or had he missed that whole no-bullets-in-the-gun scene before with her?</p><p>He put the gun in her hands. She realized he had a second handgun tucked in the waistband of his jeans. \u201cAim and fire, princess.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cH-how did they find us?\u201d</p><p>The growls died away.</p><p>Drake put a finger to his lips, then he killed all the lights in the cabin.</p><p>Then...</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to run, Archer! This is the end for you.\u201d</p><p>That voice...she knew it. Saxon. Her heartbeat quickened. Jasmine opened her mouth to call out a fierce reply, but Drake\u2019s hand clamped over her lips.</p><p>\u201cWe know Jazz is in there,\u201d Saxon shouted. \u201cSo you both need to come out, now.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s hand fell away. He took up a position near the window. Drew his weapon.</p><p>Jasmine didn\u2019t want him to get caught in the middle of a firefight. And if Saxon were out there...</p><p>I can\u2019t let this happen.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just fucking,\u201d she heard herself say because she knew the end was near for her.</p><p>Drake fired. The bullet blasted into the night. \u201cStay the hell back!\u201d he roared.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just fucking,\u201d she said again, her voice louder even as her body trembled.</p><p>Drake\u2019s head jerked toward her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might have just been for you, but it was more for me.\u201d Tell him. \u201cI thought I was making love with you.\u201d</p><p>Gunfire hit the side of the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in love, Drake, but I think...I really think I came close with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasmine...\u201d Her name was a growl. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna talk about this later. When bastards aren\u2019t shooting at us.\u201d</p><p>But she knew there wasn\u2019t going to be a later. \u201cI recognize that guy\u2019s voice. It\u2019s Saxon\u2014he\u2019s...he\u2019s good at his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m good at mine.\u201d He fired again, and she heard a man cry out.</p><p>The gun was heavy in her grasp.</p><p>\u201cBurn them out!\u201d That bellow reached her ears and sent ice through her veins.</p><p>\u201cOh, the hell, no, they aren\u2019t,\u201d Drake snarled right back. Then he was firing, again and again.</p><p>Jasmine peeked through the window. Saw the men getting hit by Drake\u2019s bullets\u2014saw the guns being aimed back at her and Drake.</p><p>And she saw the flash of flame. What in the hell were they doing?</p><p>Then some of those flames started flying toward the cabin. Something crashed through the window. Exploded.</p><p>Molotov cocktail. Flames licked against the floor. Talk about coming dangerously prepared!</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jasmine ran toward the flames and tried to stomp them out.</p><p>Drake tackled her and sent her flying back away from the fire. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d he demanded. \u201cDammit, princess, you have to be careful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your cabin,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYour grandfather\u2019s cabin...\u201d</p><p>And another Molotov cocktail splintered inside.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re worth more to me,\u201d Drake said, voice fierce, as he rose with her. His gaze locked on a door to the right. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d</p><p>But Saxon and his men would just be waiting outside.</p><p>\u201cStay close,\u201d Drake told her. \u201cI won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d</p><p>And she didn\u2019t plan to let anyone hurt him.</p><p>Drake rushed toward that door. She followed as closely as she could, still holding tightly to that gun he\u2019d given her. A few more feet, then they were bursting through the cabin\u2019s rear door. The light was bright and hard and men were waiting for them. Drake shoved her to the side just as a bullet blasted right where her head had had been five seconds before.</p><p>Then Drake was firing. Firing and hauling her toward the swamp. Drake hit with deadly accuracy. She\u2019d never seen anything like him. Men cried out and fell in his wake, and Drake was easily getting them toward the thick safety of the swamp that waited.</p><p>Then he ran out of bullets. She saw a man rising, smiling, as he aimed at Drake.</p><p>She fired.</p><p>She also screamed.</p><p>And she hit her target. As the man fell back, Jasmine and Drake rushed into the swamp. She didn\u2019t know where they were going. Didn\u2019t care if they were headed straight into snake central. They were getting away from Maxwell\u2019s goons when she\u2019d been so sure that it was over for her and\u2014</p><p>\u201cHello, Jazz.\u201d</p><p>A hand grabbed her. A strong, callused hand. Saxon yanked her against his body and took her gun in an instant.</p><p>At the man\u2019s voice, Drake spun back around. His eyes locked on Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d she told him, desperate. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. He smiled, a smile that chilled, and took a step toward her.</p><p>Jasmine felt a gun press against her temple. \u201cI don\u2019t have orders to kill Jazz here,\u201d Saxon said. \u201cBut if you take another step, I will.\u201d</p><p>Drake stopped advancing.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Jasmine shouted at Drake. \u201cGet out of here!\u201d Why wasn\u2019t he hauling ass?</p><p>\u201cKill her, and you\u2019ll be dead five seconds later,\u201d Drake promised Saxon.</p><p>She could hear the thunder of footsteps. The men who could still move were giving chase\u2014hunting them in the swamp.</p><p>Saxon has just been one step ahead of the others. He usually was. He\u2019d known they would flee out of the back door. He\u2019d been ready.</p><p>She knew exactly how deadly Saxon could be. Once upon a time, he\u2019d been her only friend. She knew him so well...</p><p>Well enough to know how this would end.</p><p>The sunlight flickered through the top of the trees and fell on Drake, turning his hair a shade brighter.</p><p>\u201cAnother time,\u201d Jasmine whispered as she stared into Drake\u2019s eyes, \u201canother place, and things could have been so different.\u201d She wished they had been different.</p><p>\u201cMove the gun away from her head,\u201d Drake snarled. His body was so tight with fury. She knew he was about to advance and attack Saxon.</p><p>And Saxon\u2019s team wasn\u2019t far behind.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands up, hero,\u201d Saxon ordered right back. \u201cAnd get on your knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him go, Saxon,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust take me, and let Drake go.\u201d</p><p>Saxon laughed.</p><p>\u201cNot happening.\u201d Drake\u2019s voice was lethal.</p><p>\u201cMaxwell can\u2019t get him,\u201d she told Saxon. \u201cHe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Then she spun in his hold. The gun was still at her head. She stared into her friend\u2019s eyes. He won\u2019t pull the trigger. \u201cI want Drake safe,\u201d she whispered to him. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m begging you...\u201d</p><p>But the others were there then. Surrounding them. And Jasmine found herself being forced to walk back toward the SUV. Two SUVs were there. A few scattered motorcycles.</p><p>Maxwell had sent a full force after them. And now...</p><p>Drake was pushed toward the second SUV.</p><p>Saxon hauled Jasmine toward the first one.</p><p>\u201cYou so much as bruise her,\u201d Drake shouted, \u201cand I\u2019ll make you pay.\u201d</p><p>Saxon tilted his head as he studied Drake. \u201cAm I supposed to be scared?\u201d</p><p>A gun was at Drake\u2019s back. Another pointed at his head. He smiled. Smiled. \u201cNo, you\u2019re supposed to know that I\u2019m stating a fact.\u201d</p><p>Saxon lifted Jasmine up and tossed her into the SUV. When another guy tried to climb inside, Saxon barked, \u201cWatch the jerk. I\u2019ve got her.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed. She was in the passenger seat of that SUV. Saxon was in the driver\u2019s seat. He had his gun on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the fiery hell am I supposed to do now?\u201d he whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cSaxon...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a plan, Jazz. A plan. Now it\u2019s all screwed.\u201d</p><p>Because of her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way out. Not for you. Not for me.\u201d His gaze slid toward Drake. \u201cAnd not for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Would begging even work?</p><p>Saxon cranked the vehicle. \u201cMaxwell\u2019s waiting on you, and sweetheart, what he\u2019s got planned won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d</p><p>They were idiots. Fucking idiots. They didn\u2019t cuff Drake\u2019s hands. Didn\u2019t tie him. Didn\u2019t restrain him at all.</p><p>They loaded him into the backseat of that SUV. Idiot Number One sat beside him, with a gun shoved into Drake\u2019s side. Idiot Number Two climbed into the front seat and cranked the engine.</p><p>\u201cYou got him?\u201d Number Two called back.</p><p>The gun dug deeper into his side. \u201cHell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>The SUV shot forward, sending mud flying in its wake.</p><p>The others were behind them. Still at the scene. Collecting the wounded. Watching the cabin burn.</p><p>Assholes. You\u2019ll pay for that fire.</p><p>Jasmine was in the SUV in front of him. He didn\u2019t want to be away from her. Drake needed to make sure she was safe.</p><p>\u201cHope that piece of ass was worth all the trouble...\u201d Idiot Number One muttered. \u201cCause you\u2019re gonna be in a world of hurt soon...\u201d</p><p>Drake waited until they\u2019d put some distance between the SUVs and the cabin. Was Trace on his way? Had to be. And since there was only one old dirt road that led to his cabin, his buddy might even be waiting for them up ahead.</p><p>\u201cAlways thought Jazz would make for a good screw,\u201d Idiot Number One told him.</p><p>Slowly, very slowly, Drake turned his head to stare at the man. \u201cShe was more than good.\u201d</p><p>The guy\u2019s mouth dropped open, then he gave a surprised laugh. \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d The gun slipped away from Drake\u2019s side, just a few inches. \u201cWith that red hair, I knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake slammed his head into the man\u2019s face. Then he rammed his elbow into the jerk\u2019s throat. The gun discharged, but Drake had already heaved up, and the bullet blazed past him, shattering the window. The man in the front seat was yelling, trying to turn and grab his own weapon.</p><p>Not going to happen. Drake surged toward the front seat even as the SUV started to careen toward the trees.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell...?\u201d</p><p>The sound of a crash had Jasmine jerking around in her seat. The second SUV had just plowed into a tree. \u201cDrake!\u201d</p><p>Saxon slammed on the brakes. His head snapped back as he glanced at the wreckage behind them.</p><p>And as they watched, Drake emerged from the vehicle. Only Drake.</p><p>He was armed.</p><p>\u201cInteresting new boyfriend you have,\u201d Saxon murmured. He started to lift his own weapon.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s fingers clamped around his wrist. \u201cNo, not him.\u201d</p><p>Saxon\u2019s gaze held hers.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt ends now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJazz...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot him.\u201d She was pleading again.</p><p>\u201cGive me Jasmine!\u201d Drake yelled.</p> <p>Saxon\u2019s foot slammed down onto the gas pedal and they lurched forward.</p><p>She glanced back once more at Drake. He was running after them. Bleeding from a cut high on his cheek. This would be her last sight of him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told Saxon.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me.\u201d His voice was hard. \u201cBecause you\u2019re going to die.\u201d</p><p>Drake ran after the SUV. \u201cGive her back to me!\u201d</p> <p>The SUV was flying fast, and Jasmine was vanishing. \u201cNo!\u201d Drake roared.</p><p>The SUV didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Neither did he. He ran back to the wrecked SUV. Shoved the two limp bastards out of the vehicle, got that piece of shit working, then gave chase.</p><p>There was no way that he\u2019d just let Jasmine go back to Maxwell. He knew what the man would do to her. Jasmine would suffer. She\u2019d hurt. Jasmine should never hurt.</p><p>He drove as fast as the beat-up SUV could travel, but it just wasn\u2019t fast enough. When he hit the main road, there was no sign of Jasmine.</p><p>Drake glanced to the left. To the right.</p> <p>He turned right. Tried to floor the SUV, but that was then the thing died on him. \u201cSonofabitch!\u201d Smoke billowed from under the hood. Drake got out. Started running.</p><p>He was still running when Trace and Noah found him. Only they weren\u2019t alone. Detective Taggert was with them.</p><p>Their vehicle pulled to a stop right in front of Drake. He stood there, chest heaving, the gun still in his hands.</p><p>Trace was the one who approached him first. \u201cDrake...want to tell us what the hell is happening?\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s gaze slid to Noah. Her brother. \u201cThey took her.\u201d The words were like knives in his own chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...so sorry...they took her.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Taggert advanced. \u201cI need you to lower that gun.\u201d</p><p>And he needed Jasmine. \u201cI\u2019ll get her back,\u201d he promised Noah, frantic. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ll get her back.\u201d His gaze shifted to the long, twisting expanse of road. I\u2019ll get her back.</p><p>He\u2019d destroy anyone who tried to stop him.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Her arms were tied to the chair behind her. The rope was rough and thick, and it had made her wrists bleed. Jasmine could smell the river, and when she strained really hard, she could even hear the faintest sound of music. Jazz music.</p><p>\u201cI expected more from you,\u201d Maxwell said as he walked around her, moving in a slow circle. The guy reminded her of a tiger, closing in on his prey.</p><p>\u201cSorry to disappoint,\u201d Jasmine managed. But she wasn\u2019t sorry. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cIt was a simple job. Get close to Archer. Use him. Help me to wreck him.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t looked Maxwell in the eyes. \u201cYou-you shouldn\u2019t have set those bombs at the Arrow. Innocent people could\u2019ve died\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lunged toward her. Maxwell grabbed the arms of the chair and put his face right in front of hers. \u201cDo you think I give a shit about those people?\u201d</p><p>She had to meet his white-hot gaze then. Jasmine shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think you care about anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou screwed that up for me. The Arrow should\u2019ve burned\u2014the place was meant to blow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you.\u201d Jasmine wouldn\u2019t let him see her fear.</p><p>He smirked at her. \u201cBecause of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many others have you attacked?\u201d Jasmine wanted to know, even though she feared the answer. \u201cWith your bombs...with fire?\u201d</p><p>Laughter was his answer. \u201cOh, Jazz, I don\u2019t always need those tactics. Destroying a man\u2019s life is easy these days. A matter of business.\u201d His right hand lifted and picked up a lock of her hair. \u201cI use tools. Tools like you. I hack into accounts. I learn secrets. I use them.\u201d</p><p>She hated his touch. Her gaze slid away from him. Saxon was in the room with them, and he watched impassively from his position near the door. There was no expression on his face. Not even pity.</p><p>And pity had been there before, when he\u2019d tied her up.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you betray me?\u201d Maxwell asked her. \u201cI was paying you well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to life than money,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He stopped stroking her hair. Instead, he yanked it, twisting it in his hold as he jerked her head back. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. \u201cWhy did you want to go after Drake? Because of some dead ex-lover\u2014\u201d</p><p>The blow took her by surprise. The pain was fast and hot, just as fast as his punch had been.</p><p>Not a slap. A punch.</p><p>Fury bubbled inside of her because she could taste blood in her mouth. Jasmine lifted her head up. She saw that Saxon had lunged away from the wall.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHe told you about Anna Jean,\u201d Maxwell said, his voice as sharp as a knife. \u201cDid Drake confess to you? Did he tell you how he killed her?\u201d</p><p>She had to be so careful what she revealed. \u201cHe told me that she\u2019d betrayed his unit and that she came after Trace Weston\u2019s wife\u2014that Anna Jean was crazy and had to be stopped\u2014\u201d</p><p>His fist came at her again and Jasmine tensed.</p><p>But the blow didn\u2019t land. Saxon had caught Maxwell\u2019s fist before it could make contact with her again.</p><p>\u201cWe need to be out there!\u201d Drake snarled as he paced the small confines of the interrogation room at the NOPD. \u201cThis is bullshit.\u201d He stopped to glare at Trace and Noah. \u201cIf it were Claire or Skye, you two bastards would be ripping apart the town.\u201d Instead, they were standing in his way.</p><p>And they were in the police station of all places.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have told Taggert anything.\u201d Drake wanted to punch and destroy. Maxwell could be hurting Jasmine right then. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knew everything.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice was quiet. His expression appeared worried as he stared at Drake. \u201cMan, you have to get your control back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you had yours when Claire was in danger?\u201d He couldn\u2019t look at Noah, not too long, because the guilt knifed through him every time he peered into Noah\u2019s eyes. His sister. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how important Jasmine is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Trace told him as he put a hand on Drake\u2019s shoulder. The guy almost lost that hand, friend or no. \u201cWe get that she matters to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014\u201d She does. And when had that happened? When had she gotten beneath his skin?</p><p>\u201cTaggert had intel she shouldn\u2019t have possessed,\u201d Trace continued in his annoyingly calm voice. \u201cThe detective contained the scene at the airport.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to jump on the Taggert bandwagon. \u201cShe\u2019s a cop. She\u2019s just going to slow me down\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opened. Taggert stood there. Only Taggert wasn\u2019t alone. FBI Agent Victor Monroe was right behind her. Taggert advanced into the room. Using crutches, Victor followed her. The door shut behind them, sealing their group inside.</p><p>\u201cI briefed Detective Taggert on the Maxwell Case situation,\u201d Victor said. The guy looked like shit. His face was bruised and scratched and a cast covered most of his right leg. \u201cShe\u2019s working under my authority now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Noah wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cFBI Special Agent Victor Monroe.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t look impressed. He never did.</p><p>\u201cNoah York.\u201d Victor nodded toward him. \u201cTrace Weston...Weston, I\u2019ve certainly admired your work.\u201d</p><p>Trace lifted his brows.</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d Drake\u2019s fury erupted. \u201cHow about you all just stand here and shoot the breeze all day while Jasmine dies.\u201d Drake stormed toward Victor. \u201cMaxwell has her. She betrayed him. Just how long do you think he\u2019ll let her keep living now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, long enough...\u201d</p><p>When Drake lunged for the FBI Agent, Trace leapt forward. Trace\u2019s arms locked around Drake before he could do more damage to that FBI prick.</p><p>Amusement flashed over Victor\u2019s battered face. \u201cRelax, Archer.\u201d</p><p>Screw that. \u201cCops should be out searching for her!\u201d He fired a glare at Taggert. \u201cI should be searching for her!\u201d Instead, he\u2019d been dragged in for questioning. \u201cMake those bozos you took into custody talk.\u201d Back at the cabin, a few had been left\u2014conscious enough\u2014to talk. The police had swarmed on them before they\u2019d all had a chance to clear the scene.</p><p>Victor shook his head. \u201cThose men won\u2019t turn on Maxwell Case. They\u2019re too afraid of him and of what he\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Drake could make them talk.</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t need them,\u201d Victor said as he leaned forward on his crutches. \u201cI already know exactly where Jasmine is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re just standing here?\u201d Drake gritted through clenched teeth. \u201cWhat. The. Hell? Do you want her to die?\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s face hardened. \u201cI have a man on the inside. He\u2019ll make certain that Jasmine survives.\u201d</p><p>As surprise hit him, Drake\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cAn inside man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...the FBI has been working to take down Maxwell Case for a very long time.\u201d He glared at Drake. \u201cAnd you almost screwed up that takedown.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s breath came out in hard, heaving gulps as she stared up at Saxon and Max.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Saxon?\u201d Maxwell demanded, voice silky with menace.</p><p>\u201cYou keep hitting her, boss, and you\u2019ll just get your DNA all over Jasmine. If the cops find it, they\u2019ll tie her death to you.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a body to find, so DNA evidence doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><p>Saxon dropped his hold. \u201cMy mistake.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell crossed his hands over his chest. \u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>Saxon stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou never like it when the women get hurt, do you, Saxon?\u201d Maxwell pushed. \u201cNoticed that about you. A weakness, for a man who should have none.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell\u2019s attention was shifting too much to Saxon. In another moment or two, Jasmine knew that Maxwell would be totally turning on the guard. And if he turned on Saxon...Saxon would die.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she loved you,\u201d Jasmine blurted.</p><p>There. Those words had Maxwell\u2019s furious stare swinging back to her.</p><p>\u201cYour Anna Jean. The woman who caused this whole hell.\u201d She licked her lips and tasted blood once more. \u201cI don\u2019t think she loved you or Drake...or anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know a thing about her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jasmine laughed and proceeded to BS her way straight ahead. \u201cI\u2019m a hacker, remember? As soon as I found out about Anna Jean, I dug up every piece of intel on her that I could.\u201d If she\u2019d actually had access to a computer, Jasmine would have done exactly that job. Since she hadn\u2019t... \u201cYou two were working together for years, weren\u2019t you? Drake and the others\u2014they thought she was on their side, but she was always betraying them.\u201d</p><p>He gave a sly nod. \u201cI met Anna Jean right after my enlistment. She was the most beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. Fantastic. \u201cWas her psychotic nature part of the appeal?\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cShe had an edge.\u201d</p><p>Right. An edge of insanity. \u201cLike to like,\u201d Jasmine mumbled.</p><p>Maxwell frowned at her. Well, at least he wasn\u2019t punching her. For the moment. \u201cWhen she started turning on Drake and his team, you were the one helping her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt paid to play both sides,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cI didn\u2019t join the military for the glory.\u201d</p><p>No, she suspected he\u2019d done it because he wanted power. Violence.</p><p>\u201cThe paydays were big, and it should have lasted forever.\u201d His jaw hardened. \u201cThen they ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Anna Jean did, when she tried to kill Drake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left her for dead! He and York and Weston\u2014they left her bleeding out in the snow. Hell, even I thought she was dead. All that time. Until she walked into my place in Vegas.\u201d His eyes flickered as he seemed to remember. \u201cShe looked different, but when I touched her, I saw right beneath the mask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d She wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cShe told me what they\u2019d done to her, and I gave her everything she needed. I knew she wanted to go after Trace and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped, but she wasn\u2019t about to let that go. \u201cYou were all for taking him down, right? Bet you thought a slice of that Weston fortune would be coming your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was backing the right player in that game.\u201d</p><p>Anna Jean.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAnd more than just a slice should have been coming to me. I should have gotten it all.\u201d</p><p>Her hands twisted against the ropes. Saxon could\u2019ve given her a little wiggle room. \u201cInstead, Anna Jean died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I got nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should\u2019ve cut your losses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He caught her chin between his fingers as he glared into her eyes. \u201cAnna Jean made me the man I am.\u201d</p><p>Um, that was a good thing?</p><p>\u201cShe gave me the money I needed. She set up the contacts. I owed her.\u201d He gave a grim nod. \u201cAnd I pay my debts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven to the dead? Because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re so concerned with collecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved her,\u201d he said flatly and...she believed him. Anna Jean might have been jerking this guy around just like she did all the others in her life, but Maxwell had cared for her\u2014in his twisted, warped way. \u201cAnd those who took her...they will suffer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right. \u201cIs that why you bombed Noah York\u2019s plane?\u201d</p><p>His lips curled. \u201cSeemed an easy enough way to get rid of him and Weston.\u201d</p><p>He was confessing all to her. Because he planned to kill me. She tried to clear her throat. \u201cS-sorry I got in the middle of your war. I didn\u2019t realize what was at stake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow you do.\u201d</p><p>Love for a woman long dead.</p><p>When Drake grabbed Victor, the crutches hit the floor with a hard clatter. \u201cYou know where she is? And we\u2019re just standing here with our thumbs up our asses?\u201d</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t try to pull him away this time. Taggert did. She put her hand on Drake\u2019s arm, sighed, and said, \u201cDo you think we don\u2019t have a rescue plan?\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s eyelids flickered slightly.</p> <p>\u201cIf you do, then we need to get moving.\u201d Drake\u2019s hands had fisted in the guy\u2019s shirt. \u201cNow.\u201d Or did the jerk like knowing that Jasmine was in pain?</p><p>I don\u2019t. It\u2019s tearing me apart.</p><p>\u201cMy team will handle her rescue,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI\u2019ve got agents in position now.\u201d</p><p>Taggert tapped Drake\u2019s arm. He still didn\u2019t release the FBI agent.</p><p>\u201cTell those agents to act!\u201d Drake nearly roared.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d the agent snapped back. \u201cAs soon as we have Maxwell Case\u2019s confession on record. My man has a wire on in there\u2014this is the chance we\u2019ve been waiting for. We can nail him for so many crimes\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Drake slammed the guy into the nearest wall. \u201cHe\u2019s kidnapped Jasmine! Nail him on that shit! And stop playing with her life!\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s breath heaved out. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who cares about Jazz.\u201d His voice was low, pitched to only reach Drake\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cJasmine,\u201d he forced out. \u201cHer name is Jasmine, and you\u2019re going to tell me where she is. Right now. I\u2019m not waiting on your team. I\u2019m not waiting on a confession. I\u2019m going to get her out of there.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded at the door. Seconds later, a woman poked her head inside. Her blonde hair was pulled away from her face, and her eyes glinted behind the frames of her glasses. \u201cWe got him, sir. The confession was recorded.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s body sagged. \u201cWarehouse district,\u201d Victor murmured to Drake. \u201cBuilding thirteen-oh-four. Niles Street.\u201d</p><p>Drake lunged for the door.</p><p>\u201cBy the time you get there,\u201d Victor called after him. \u201cIt will all be over! My team has this!\u201d</p><p>She should have kept her mouth shut then, but Jasmine pushed. \u201cAre you sure Anna Jean wasn\u2019t going to betray you, too? What if she was just going to use your resources, then vanish with Weston\u2019s money? I bet she even had a back-up lover around. Some fall guy waiting in the wings...seems like her style\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t punch her then. His hand just dropped to her throat and he squeezed, cutting off the words and her airway. \u201cI don\u2019t want you speaking of her again. Compared to Anna Jean, you\u2019re nothing.\u201d</p><p>Story of my life.</p><p>\u201cBoss...are you going to use Jazz against Archer?\u201d Saxon\u2019s voice came quietly from behind Maxwell. \u201cBecause he sure went crazy when I got away with her.\u201d</p><p>His hold tightened even more. Red spots began to dance before Jasmine\u2019s eyes. Her temples were throbbing, the blood surging as he squeezed and squeezed.</p><p>Drake, I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>He eased his hold. She gulped in air, but those red spots didn\u2019t vanish.</p><p>\u201cDoes Archer care about you?\u201d Maxwell asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The one word sounded like a frog\u2019s croak, but she wasn\u2019t about to let this man use her against Drake.</p><p>\u201cWill he come for you, try to save you?\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He swore. \u201cThen what good are you to me?\u201d</p><p>She stared into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>The cars were going too fucking slowly. \u201cFaster, Noah! Dammit, I should\u2019ve driven!\u201d</p><p>The police were behind them. Rushing with their lights blazing. They were driving desperately to that warehouse district.</p><p>To Jasmine.</p><p>Victor had told them that his team on site would be moving in, but Drake intended to be there, too. He had to see Jasmine with his own eyes. Had to hold her and make sure she was safe.</p><p>If Maxwell had hurt her...</p><p>\u201cGo faster!\u201d Drake snarled again.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Trace said from his position in the back.</p><p>Screw easy. \u201cI have to get to her.\u201d He could feel Trace\u2019s eyes on him. Drake turned his head to meet Trace\u2019s stare. \u201cIf she\u2019s dead, so is Case.\u201d</p><p>Noah whistled. \u201cMan, calm down. The FBI is already there. Your woman is safe.\u201d</p><p>Your woman. He knew that was exactly what Jasmine was. Had he really thought he might be able to give her up?</p><p>Noah\u2019s sister. Shit. They\u2019d find a way to work all of that out. Maybe he\u2019d let Noah take some swings at him. But Drake wasn\u2019t walking away from her. The fear in his gut told him that he couldn\u2019t walk away.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d Drake whispered.</p><p>Yeah, he should have driven...but the way his hands were shaking, he was afraid he would\u2019ve wrecked the car and never gotten to Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cDrake won\u2019t care what happens to me,\u201d Jasmine said softly. Her throat ached. Her jaw ached. And she couldn\u2019t hear the jazz music any longer. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean? No, you\u2019re not. Not even close. You\u2019re a whore from a trailer park. A woman with a few useful talents.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a psychotic dick who gets off on blowing things up and killing people. So in comparison, I think I\u2019m the one with more talent.\u201d</p><p>He backed up a step. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just call me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Holy crap, she had. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me, so what does it matter? I see you for exactly what you are. You\u2019re a monster, Maxwell. A monster hiding in the clothes of a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Drake?\u201d Spittle flew from his mouth. \u201cWhat is he?\u201d</p><p>It broke her heart but she said, \u201cI thought Drake was my hero.\u201d She\u2019d wanted him to be. \u201cBut...but I guess that wasn\u2019t in the cards. He didn\u2019t care about me. I was a woman he took to his bed. By the time my body is found, he probably won\u2019t even remember my name.\u201d Keep talking. Don\u2019t let Maxwell think he can use you against Drake. Because she wasn\u2019t about to let Drake try to trade his life for hers.</p><p>Maxwell\u2019s furious expression told her that he believed every word she said. Good. She twisted her hands once more against the ropes. If she could have broken free from those ropes, perhaps she would\u2019ve had a fighting chance.</p><p>But maybe she\u2019d never had that.</p><p>\u201cUh, boss...\u201d</p><p>Her head turned at Saxon\u2019s measured voice. He stood near the lone window.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some action out there.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell waved that away. \u201cDrunks. The homeless on the streets. It\u2019s after midnight and they always\u2014\u201d</p><p>Saxon stiffened. \u201cThey\u2019re armed! I count five\u2014six? I can see them moving across the street!\u201d He spun toward his boss. \u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No, that\u2019s not possible!\u201d Maxwell stormed toward the window. He stared outside. \u201cFuck, no!\u201d</p><p>And then Jasmine started to laugh.</p><p>Maxwell whirled to face her.</p><p>\u201cI guess my talents are pretty useful.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and stalked toward her.</p><p>\u201cBoss...\u201d Saxon began.</p><p>Jasmine raised her voice, drowning out Saxon as she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no slowing them down. There\u2019s no escape.\u201d Her heart raced. \u201cThe Feds are coming for you, and you\u2019re going away for a long time. You\u2019re not going to burn anything. You\u2019re not going to break anyone. And you\u2019re not going to get your precious payback for Anna Jean.\u201d</p><p>He was still shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Jasmine whispered, and she stopped struggling against her bonds. She wanted to remember this moment. To savor it, as she\u2019d savored few things.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even search me when they brought me in. Just tied me up...and talked your mouth off.\u201d</p><p>He lunged toward her. Grabbed her shirt. The buttons popped and flew as he ripped that shirt open.</p><p>His gaze dropped to her breasts. To the black bra and the small, black wire there.</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d Jasmine whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Rage exploded in his eyes. She thought he\u2019d hurt her then. Attack hard and fast. But he jumped back. \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t how it ends for me!\u201d He pointed to Saxon even as he rushed for the door.</p><p>Trying to protect yourself? That\u2019s the way it\u2014</p><p>\u201cShoot her!\u201d Maxwell bellowed. \u201cRight in the heart. Kill her and then get your ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>After giving that order, Maxwell paused at the threshold of the room. He wants to watch me die. He won\u2019t run, not until I\u2019m dead.</p><p>She heaved against the ropes. \u201cSaxon, Saxon, don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>He had out his gun. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jazz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>He fired.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stay out here,\u201d Victor told Drake as the FBI agents swarmed the warehouse. \u201cCivilians aren\u2019t clear to hit a crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Trace and Noah were at Drake\u2019s side. They were all watching silently, waiting, as the teams entered the building.</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know she\u2019s still alive?\u201d Drake demanded. \u201cWho\u2019s monitoring the surveillance feed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best agents are listening to every word. Relax. We\u2019ve got this shit covered.\u201d</p><p>The blonde from the police station rushed up to them. \u201cSir, we lost the feed.\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>A gunshot blasted. Drake\u2019s blood froze. He didn\u2019t even realize he\u2019d started running toward that warehouse, not until three agents grabbed him. \u201cShe\u2019s in there!\u201d Drake snarled at them. They must\u2019ve heard the gunfire. \u201cHe\u2019s hurting her!\u201d</p><p>Not Jasmine. She\u2019d been hurt enough...</p><p>Scars on perfect skin. Wounds that she never should\u2019ve had.</p><p>\u201cLet me get to her!\u201d But they were hauling him back. \u201cNoah, Trace, help me!\u201d</p><p>And even though it would probably get their asses arrested, his friends swarmed. They knocked those FBI agents on their asses.</p><p>Victor tried to block Drake\u2019s path. Like a guy on crutches was going to stop him. \u201cI\u2019m getting her,\u201d Drake promised.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous! A civilian can\u2019t go into that scene. My agents......they\u2019ll get her,\u201d Victor said. Did the guy even hear the doubt in his voice? Because Drake did.</p><p>Drake shoved the man aside.</p><p>Victor shouted his name. Drake didn\u2019t stop. He didn\u2019t have a weapon, the Feds had made sure of that, but he didn\u2019t care. He wasn\u2019t sitting on the sidelines.</p><p>Noah and Trace were running with him. The fools that tried to get in their way got thrown to the side\u2014badges or no badges.</p><p>Then Drake saw the other FBI agents running out of that building. They were hauling ass. What?</p><p>\u201cBomb!\u201d One yelled. \u201cClear the area. Clear\u2014\u201d</p><p>The explosion sent Drake flying off his feet. He hurtled through the air and slammed down inches away from a light post.</p><p>Heat lanced over his skin, and, for a moment, he lay there, stunned.</p><p>Then his eyes took in the inferno before him. The warehouse wasn\u2019t just smoking. It was blazing. Fire shot from the windows even as part of the right wall collapsed.</p><p>He staggered to his feet. He could feel blood sliding down the side of his face\u2014he vaguely remembered slamming into the pavement.</p><p>\u201cPull back!\u201d Victor shouted. \u201cPull back!\u201d</p><p>Another explosion had fire streaking into the sky.</p><p>\u201cJasmine?\u201d Drake said her name, once, barely recognizing the lost sound of his own voice. Then as he ran toward the fire, he roared her name.</p><p>The flames were raging so hot and high. Burning brightly. Destroying everything.</p><p>Destroying...her?</p><p>Not Jasmine. Not her. Not...her!</p><p>\u201cStop, man! Stop!\u201d Noah was there, fighting to pull Drake away from the fire, but he just wanted to get closer.</p><p>\u201cI have to get her out!\u201d</p><p>Another window exploded. Glass hit the pavement. Flames crackled.</p><p>Noah tightened his hold on Drake. Drake swung at him, connecting with a hard punch, but Noah didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>And then Trace was there. They were holding him too tightly, hauling him away from the flames.</p><p>\u201cI have to get her out!\u201d The fire was stinging his eyes. Burning his throat.</p><p>Ripping a hole in his chest.</p><p>Trace\u2019s grip was like iron around him. \u201cShe is out, buddy. She\u2019s...she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>No. The fuck, no. \u201cJasmine!\u201d He fought them both. He\u2019d get free. Get through the fire. Get her out of that building.</p><p>\u201cClear the road!\u201d Victor was barking orders.</p><p>And Trace and Noah weren\u2019t letting Drake go.</p><p>\u201cI have to get to her...\u201d He punched at them, drove his fist hard and fast, not caring that they were his friends. That he was hurting them. \u201cShe could still be alive!\u201d</p><p>Noah shook him. Slammed his own fist into Drake\u2019s face. \u201cThe building is a total loss! There\u2019s no way she\u2019s still alive in there\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was going to give up? On her? \u201cShe\u2019s your sister!\u201d Drake shouted at him. \u201cWe can\u2019t let her burn!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah\u2019s face went slack with shock. Drake pulled from his hold. \u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d he whispered and then he ran into that building. He\u2019d just cleared what was left of the entrance when the ceiling collapsed.</p><p>\u201cMr. Archer?\u201d</p><p>Drake cracked open one eye. \u201cJas...mine...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Archer, you\u2019re all right. We got you out.\u201d</p><p>He cracked open the other eye. Saw an EMT staring down at him, shining a light right at his face. Drake swatted the light away.</p><p>\u201cSir, sir, I\u2019m going to have to insist that you stay calm and remain still. I think you\u2019ve got a concussion\u2014\u201d</p><p>He remembered the rush of fire. Something heavy hitting him. And\u2014</p><p>Drake grabbed the EMT and twisted the man\u2019s shirt in his fist. \u201cDid she get out, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSh-she?\u201d The man\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed.</p><p>\u201cJasmine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I...you were the only one recovered.\u201d</p><p>No. Drake shoved him away. He was in the back of an ambulance. How the hell had that happened? The last thing he remembered was the fire.</p><p>\u201cSir, you have to stay\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake jumped out of the ambulance. He would\u2019ve fallen right on his face then, if Trace hadn\u2019t appeared and grabbed his arms.</p> <p>\u201cDragged you out of a fire once already,\u201d Trace groused. \u201cDon\u2019t make me do it again.\u201d He put himself in front of Drake\u2014and Drake could see the flames still reaching for the sky behind his friend.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in there,\u201d Drake said, voice rough.</p><p>\u201cThe firefighters said the flames were too hot. No one in that building has survived.\u201d Brutal words, but said softly, sadly.</p><p>Drake shook his head. \u201cShe was...she was alive. She was with me just hours ago.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never loved anyone, Drake, but I think...I really think I came close with you.</p><p>Trace\u2019s eyes were grim. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Drake tilted his head back. Stared at the flames. They\u2019d consumed the building.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you aren\u2019t dead, too. Those boards that hit you were on fire.\u201d</p> <p>Drake realized that a big, thick bandage covered his arm. He lifted his hand. Another covered the side of his head.</p><p>\u201cI dragged you out. Noah and I...we pulled you out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are always saving my ass.\u201d He couldn\u2019t pull his gaze off the fire. \u201cBut maybe this time, you should\u2019ve just left me in there.\u201d</p><p>His chest didn\u2019t burn. It didn\u2019t ache. He just felt numb. Drake could barely even feel his heart beating. He looked at that fire, and he just saw Jasmine.</p><p>Curling her finger at me in the club...inviting me down to her.</p><p>Laughing in New Orleans...licking away powdered sugar as she savored her beignet.</p><p>Crying out my name in an elevator...holding me so tightly...so tightly that I never wanted to leave her.</p><p>\u201cWas she...\u201d The gruff voice came from Drake\u2019s right. It was Noah\u2019s voice. \u201cWas she really my sister?\u201d</p><p>Please, Drake. I don\u2019t want him to know. There\u2019s no point in it. Drake didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cWas she?\u201d Noah pressed.</p><p>Drake stayed silent.</p><p>Noah grabbed him. \u201cDid my sister just burn alive in that place? Did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah...\u201d Trace hauled him back.</p><p>\u201cI wanted my family.\u201d Noah\u2019s words shot out fast and hard, like bullets. \u201cI always wanted to know\u2014and you knew. You knew she was mine and you didn\u2019t say a word...\u201d</p><p>The firefighters were closing in now. Because the flames were finally dying down? Cops were all over the scene. FBI agents.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t yours,\u201d Drake heard himself say. That numbness was spreading. Consuming him. \u201cShe was mine.\u201d</p><p>And she was gone.</p><p>Something deep inside of Drake splintered then.</p><p>I could have loved you, too, Jasmine. Fuck...I did love you.</p><p>I did.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in this exercise,\u201d Victor said as he marched into the small office in the New Orleans Police Department. An office that Trace had commandeered with the guy\u2019s army of contacts.</p><p>Drake stood near the room\u2019s lone window. Noah and Trace were already seated, but he couldn\u2019t sit. His body was too tight with tension. With fury.</p><p>Grief clawed at him every time he closed his eyes. So for the last three days\u2014and it had been three long, wrenching days since he\u2019d lost Jasmine\u2014Drake hadn\u2019t slept.</p><p>He knew he\u2019d have new nightmares when he slept. Anna Jean wouldn\u2019t haunt him any longer. Jasmine would.</p><p>She would always haunt him.</p><p>\u201cI get that you\u2019ve done a few favors for the FBI,\u201d Victor said as he shoved a laptop case onto the table. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see why a civilian should get access to classified\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew the civilian crap. Play the tapes,\u201d Drake snapped.</p><p>Victor opened his laptop. Booted it up. \u201cThis is material that will be used in an ongoing investigation. This could compromise my case\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake stalked toward him. \u201cYou mean because Maxwell wasn\u2019t in that building when it blew to hell?\u201d</p><p>Victor jerked back a bit.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Drake snapped at him. \u201cWe can get our own intel. Word is that the coroner recovered the remains of two people in that warehouse. A man and a woman...and according to leaks in your office...\u201d Leaks that Trace had exploited with his Weston Securities contacts, \u201cYou think the dead man was one of Maxwell\u2019s men, a guy named Saxon. Not Maxwell.\u201d Just an underling.</p><p>Victor\u2019s gaze slid to the closed door, then back to Drake. \u201cYes,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe do believe that Maxwell Case escaped from that blaze. He set the bomb\u2014the fire as a distraction so that we\u2019d be thrown off...but we know he got away, and we\u2019ve launched a search for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy might not even be in the country anymore,\u201d Noah muttered. Like Drake, Noah had been...different since the fire. Quieter. Harder.</p><p>\u201cHis assets are frozen. Thanks to our...inside man...we were able to learn about all of his off-shore accounts. Maxwell Case is running on his own. He\u2019s desperate, he\u2019s broke, and we will take him into custody. It\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d Victor seemed so confident.</p><p>Jerk. This confident prick had been the one who was so sure Jasmine would be all right. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault,\u201d Drake accused.</p><p>Victor blinked.</p><p>\u201cYou left her in there too long.\u201d He wanted to punish the bastard. He would punish him. \u201cYou knew where he was holding her. You should have gotten her out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Trace. Trying to be the voice of reason as he carefully positioned himself between Drake and the FBI Agent. Trace just didn\u2019t get it. There was no \u201ceasy\u201d for Drake anymore. There was just darkness. A void. A fire had taken Jasmine\u2014heat and an inferno, and now, all he felt was...cold.</p><p>Victor leaned forward and tapped a code into his laptop.</p><p>Drake\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay,\u201d Drake told him.</p><p>Victor glanced up, his eyes narrowed. \u201cYou think you can threaten me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m promising you. You\u2019re going to lose everything that matters.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s laugh was bitter. \u201cNow you sound like Maxwell Case. Maybe there\u2019s not so much difference between you guys\u2014\u201d</p><p>Even Trace couldn\u2019t slow Drake down when he lunged for the bastard. \u201cI\u2019m nothing like him!\u201d He slammed Victor into the nearest wall. The guy\u2019s crutches fell to the floor.</p><p>The agent didn\u2019t fight back. He just stared at Drake. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hunt Case,\u201d Drake managed to force out from between his clenched teeth. \u201cThe FBI is done with him. The guy\u2019s a dead man walking.\u201d Even before he\u2019d gotten confirmation from Victor, Trace\u2019s intel had told them that the SOB had escaped. Trace and Drake were already hunting the man. When they found him, there would be nothing left for the FBI.</p><p>But Victor\u2019s jaw hardened. \u201cMy man inside gathered enough information to put Case away for life. Case is going down, and it\u2019s going to be handled the right way.\u201d</p><p>The idiot didn\u2019t get it. \u201cThere is no right way. He killed my Jasmine. He\u2019s going to suffer.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s brows rose. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t yours. She was just a woman you picked up for a night\u2014I\u2019m sure you pick up plenty of women and forget them the next day.\u201d</p><p>Drake leaned in close to him. \u201cShe\u2019s not the others. Do you understand? There is no forgetting her.\u201d There was no moving on for him. She was inside of him, where his heart should have been.</p><p>Drake had known the risks. He\u2019d seen what love could do to a man. Trace and Noah had both fallen hard. Gotten in too deep. There was a danger in loving too much. When you loved too much, you had too much to lose.</p><p>I lost everything.</p><p>\u201cLet him play the recording, Drake.\u201d Noah\u2019s flat voice. \u201cI want to hear what went down.\u201d</p><p>Because they\u2019d finally gotten access to the last moments of Jasmine\u2019s life. The FBI\u2019s \u201cinside man\u201d had been wired, and they\u2019d applied every bit of pressure they could to get this access.</p><p>Drake stepped away from Victor. Trace handed the guy his crutches. Then Victor shuffled toward the table. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in this,\u201d he said again, but he tapped on the keyboard once more.</p><p>And...</p><p>\u201cI expected more from you.\u201d Drake tensed when he heard that mocking voice.</p><p>\u201cMaxwell Case,\u201d Victor said. \u201cAsshole extraordinaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to disappoint.\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice\u2014and that voice hit Drake like a punch to the gut.</p><p>Noah inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201cIt was a simple job.\u201d Maxwell was speaking again. \u201cGet close to Archer. Use him. Help me to wreck him.\u201d</p><p>He was wrecked without her. She didn\u2019t use me. She never did. Jasmine\u2019s voice trembled when she replied, \u201cYou-you shouldn\u2019t have set those bombs at the Arrow. Innocent people could\u2019ve died\u2014\u201d</p><p>Maxwell\u2019s voice cut through her words. \u201cDo you think I give a shit about those people?\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence, then, \u201cI don\u2019t think you care about anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou screwed that up for me. The Arrow should\u2019ve burned\u2014the place was meant to blow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you.\u201d Jasmine sounded both terrified and furious. He hated her fear and as for the fury...it was just driving up Drake\u2019s own rage. I should have saved her. But he hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d burned.</p><p>\u201cBecause of me.\u201d Maxwell was gloating.</p><p>\u201cHow many others have you attacked?\u201d Jasmine asked him. \u201cWith your bombs...with fire?\u201d</p><p>Trace shifted then, moving closer to the computer. \u201cWhat the hell? It sounds like she\u2019s interrogating him.\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes, it did.</p><p>Maxwell laughed. \u201cOh, Jazz, I don\u2019t always need those tactics. Destroying a man\u2019s life is easy these days. A matter of business. I use tools. Tools like you. I hack into accounts. I learn secrets. I use them.\u201d</p><p>Victor paused the recording. \u201cAs you see, he was incriminating himself. My man did his job perfectly and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasmine is dead.\u201d Drake\u2019s heart was pounding. Her voice hurt him. \u201cHe fucked up his job.\u201d I fucked up.</p><p>Victor\u2019s eyes glinted. \u201cYou feel guilty, I get that. Jasmine...she was different. Maybe it was her eyes or those damn dimples. Whatever it was, she had a way of getting beneath your skin.\u201d</p><p>Drake caught Trace studying the agent with a thoughtful expression. \u201cDid she get beneath your skin?\u201d Trace asked him.</p><p>Victor\u2019s head tilted as he continued to study Drake. \u201cThis whole bit is about you getting closure, isn\u2019t it? Here. Listen to this, okay? Jasmine didn\u2019t blame you, not for anything.\u201d He typed again and Maxwell\u2019s voice filled the small room once more.</p><p>\u201cDoes Archer care about you?\u201d</p><p>Drake stopped breathing when he heard that question. Then Jasmine replied and his whole body shuddered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Had she truly believed that? It\u2019s not just fucking to me. Her words. They should have been his. They should have been his. \u201cWill he come for you, try to save you?\u201d</p><p>No hesitation as she replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell cursed and demanded, \u201cThen what good are you to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Drake shook his head, helplessly. No, no, no!</p><p>\u201cAs you just heard, Jasmine didn\u2019t expect you to rush in, guns blazing, and save her. There\u2019s no need for you to feel guilty at all.\u201d Victor leaned forward to close the laptop.</p><p>Drake caught his hand. \u201cWho was the inside man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the room, but he\u2019s not speaking. That means he\u2019s one of Case\u2019s flunkies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe speaks...but you aren\u2019t going to hear him. Revealing his identity would just compromise other cases that the man worked for us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this guy,\u201d Trace broke in, \u201che made a habit of working undercover for the FBI? For you?\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s chin shot up. \u201cI think we\u2019re done now.\u201d</p><p>Hell, no, they weren\u2019t. \u201cPlay the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear it all.\u201d</p><p>But Victor shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no point.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why?\u201d Anger cracked in Victor\u2019s voice. \u201cDo you want to hear her when she begs them not to shoot her? When Maxwell ordered her to be shot in the heart\u2014and she was? Look, the fire didn\u2019t kill her. She was\u2014she was dead when we heard the first shot.\u201d</p><p>Noah staggered a bit and crashed into the table. The laptop fell, hitting the floor hard. Victor dove down to retrieve it, but Trace beat him. He lifted the device. Handed it back to the agent.</p> <p>Drake couldn\u2019t move. He remembered the sound of the gunshot that had blasted moments before the warehouse went up in flames.</p><p>\u201cThis is the end,\u201d Victor said. He gave a firm nod. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, and you have to just...just move on. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be easy to replace.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to rip the guy apart. \u201cNo, she won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Victor juggled his laptop and the crutches. \u201cYes, well...I think we\u2019re done here. I certainly hope our paths never cross again.\u201d Then, without another word, he turned and exited the room.</p><p>The men didn\u2019t speak until he was gone.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the FBI\u2019s lead agents?\u201d Noah demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t like that bastard! \u2018Easy to replace...\u2019 We\u2019re talking about a woman\u2019s life!\u201d\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was thoughtful, \u201cthere\u2019s more to a man than meets the eye.\u201d</p><p>Screw all that. Drake marched closer to Trace. \u201cDid you get it?\u201d</p><p>Trace opened his right hand. \u201cCopied all the files...good job distracting him, though I was worried you were about to slug Victor...crutches or no.\u201d</p><p>Drake grunted. \u201cI was about to slug him...crutches or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Noah said, shoving back his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t want any cops breathing down our necks. Not with what\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s coming...their attack. They weren\u2019t going to let Case get away. It was personal for Drake. Personal for Noah. As for Trace...</p><p>Hell, maybe he was just in it for fun.</p><p>No, he\u2019s in this fight because we\u2019re friends. Brothers. Not of blood, but from a bond that went deeper than that.</p><p>When they left the station, they passed Victor. The guy threw a glare Drake\u2019s way right before Victor headed into Detective Taggert\u2019s little office.</p><p>Drake knew he wore a glare of his own. Your time will come, too.</p><p>Because he wasn\u2019t done with that agent.</p><p>\u201cAre you...are you sure you want to hear this?\u201d Trace asked softly when they were back in Drake\u2019s apartment above his casino. \u201cMaybe I should just review things. I mean, if the shooting is on here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Victor. Just play the damn thing.\u201d Drake downed his second glass of whiskey. Noah was already on his third.</p> <p>Trace tapped a few keys on the computer.</p><p>\u201cThis is the last sixty seconds of the recording. We should go back and hear it all to see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay it.\u201d</p><p>Trace exhaled and hit another key.</p><p>\u201cThe Feds are coming for you, and you\u2019re going away for a long time.\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice. Only she didn\u2019t sound scared. She sounded...satisfied. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to burn anything. You\u2019re not going to break anyone. And you\u2019re not going to get your precious payback for Anna Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ghost,\u201d Noah said, voice rough, \u201cstill trying to drag us all into her hell.\u201d</p><p>Not anymore, she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice had dropped to a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d That snarl was Maxwell\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even search me when they brought me in. Just tied me up...and talked your mouth off.\u201d</p><p>Drake stiffened as he started to realize what was happening.</p><p>There was a gasp, the sound of something tearing\u2014what the hell?\u2014then...</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d Jasmine said.</p><p>Drake couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Trace\u2019s lips curved the faintest bit. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned. I thought it might be her...inside man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Rage thundered in Maxwell\u2019s voice. \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t how it ends for me! Shoot her...Right in the heart. Kill her and then get your ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>Drake took a step toward the computer. \u201cWho is he giving that order to?\u201d</p><p>In the next instant, Drake had his answer as Jasmine said, \u201cSaxon, Saxon, don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Then the man replied, softly, sadly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jazz.\u201d</p><p>The gunshot made Drake jerk.</p><p>\u201cRight to the heart.\u201d Saxon\u2019s voice. Flat. Cold.</p><p>\u201cGood...now let\u2019s get the hell out of here! Come on!\u201d Maxwell\u2019s footsteps thundered away.</p><p>Only...it sounded as if he were the only one to leave.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then... \u201cJazz?\u201d That was Saxon\u2019s whisper.</p><p>Drake\u2019s gaze flew to Trace.</p><p>\u201cJazz, we don\u2019t have much time. You okay?\u201d</p><p>Drake couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine...once you get me out of these ropes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet hell,\u201d Noah whispered. \u201cThe bullet didn\u2019t kill her!\u201d</p><p>The recording stopped.</p><p>\u201cDid the fire kill her?\u201d Noah wanted to know. \u201cShit, it did. They found her remains, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trace shook his head. \u201cThat FBI agent is protecting his informant\u201d</p><p>Drake sucked in a deep breath. \u201cShe\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>Trace held his gaze. \u201cShe could be. There\u2019s only one person who can tell us if Jasmine got out of that fire...\u201d</p><p>FBI Special Agent Victor Monroe.</p><p>Hope burned in Drake, melting through the ice. \u201cLet\u2019s make him talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she is alive, he\u2019s not just going to give up that information.\u201d Trace tapped his fingers against the desk. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew careful,\u201d Drake retorted as his heart thundered I his chest. \u201cI want her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I get a funeral?\u201d Jasmine asked because she was curious about that.</p><p>Saxon grunted. \u201cI don\u2019t think I had one.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she turned to face him. Saxon had been her constant\u2014and only\u2014companion for the last week. He\u2019d hustled her out of New Orleans before she could blink, and now they were holed up in a cabin nestled in the Smoky Mountains.</p><p>The view was phenomenal. Almost like touching heaven.</p><p>And the ache in her heart? It wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>Her hand lifted to her side. Her stitches were gone now. Everything about her past was supposed to be gone. If only it were easy to shove away the memories.</p><p>\u201cHave you been crying again?\u201d Saxon demanded, his voice sharp. He always got pissed when she cried.</p><p>Ah, Saxon. Friend. Protector...Annoyance.</p><p>\u201cBecause that dick isn\u2019t worth your tears. Archer is a player, not someone you can count on.\u201d</p><p>She had been crying. She cried those stupid tears every night when the lights were out.</p><p>A car\u2019s engine rumbled in the distance. She looked out of the window and saw the flash of headlights pushing up the mountain toward them. Finally. \u201cVictor\u2019s coming.\u201d He\u2019d said that he would come for her when it was safe. She and Saxon hadn\u2019t been the only ones to escape that blaze.</p><p>Of course, Maxwell had known how to get out. It had been his fire, after all.</p><p>The headlights came closer. They knew the driver was Victor\u2014and not some lost tourist\u2014because he\u2019d called them moments before. They waited together as his pick-up pulled into the narrow drive.</p><p>Saxon headed out to meet Victor, but Jasmine stayed inside. Goosebumps were on her arms. This was it. Victor would tell her about the new life she was slated to begin.</p><p>The past was over. Gone.</p><p>Forget it...forget him.</p><p>Victor had a cast on when he came inside, but he didn\u2019t let the cast slow him. He moved easily, fluidly, barely using his one crutch. When the door shut behind him and Saxon, Victor glanced her way and a wide smile curled his lips. \u201cHey, Jazz...love that new look.\u201d</p><p>The shorter hair. The blonde hair.</p><p>He opened his arms and she hurried toward him, giving him a hug because Victor wasn\u2019t just her FBI handler.</p><p>He was her friend.</p><p>He and Saxon were the closest things to family that she had.</p><p>She\u2019d met Saxon first, when she was seventeen and so scared. Saxon had been on the streets, too. But he\u2019d made his living fighting\u2014brutal and hard bouts in boxing rings that shouldn\u2019t have existed. No rules...just blood. Victor had been his opponent in one of those fights. They\u2019d both wound up nearly broken, nearly dead in that battle. And Jasmine had been the one to patch them both up.</p><p>No one else had cared when the fight was over. Folks had collected their winnings and left the two broken warriors behind.</p><p>She\u2019d stitched them both up. Taken care of them.</p><p>Over the years, they\u2019d taken care of her, too.</p><p>Victor had gone into law enforcement. That move had stunned the hell out of her. And then Saxon...he\u2019d followed the guy. Only while Victor played the straight and narrow, Saxon had sought the undercover missions. He\u2019d wanted an up-close dose of danger and adrenaline.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten those doses. With interest.</p><p>And...somehow...Jasmine had found herself following them. Working odd jobs for the government. Getting pulled into their web.</p><p>Until she\u2019d been in so deep that there hadn\u2019t been any chance of going back.</p><p>Victor hugged her so tightly that the breath nearly left her body. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some serious explaining to do,\u201d he growled the words against her ear. Victor\u2019s body was rock hard against her.</p><p>He was a big guy. Strong and tough, and she\u2019d once even had a crush on him. Back when she\u2019d been eighteen.</p><p>Now...now all she could think about was Drake.</p><p>Victor eased away from her a bit. \u201cYou had a brother you never told us about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Saxon half-shouted.</p><p>Jasmine shook her head.</p><p>Victor curled his hand under her chin. \u201cAnd before you even get the urge to lie, let me stop you. I heard it from Archer. When that building started blazing, the man went crazy. Told Noah York that they had to get you out...cause you were the guy\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Saxon pulled her away from Victor. \u201cIs that true? You\u2019ve got a brother?\u201d</p><p>This hurt so badly. \u201cJasmine Bennett had a brother. One that her mom put up for adoption. I\u2019m not Jasmine. She\u2019s dead, right? I heard she died in a New Orleans fire.\u201d Her breath rushed out. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth. Elizabeth Farrow.\u201d That was the name on the ID she\u2019d been given by Saxon. New name. New life.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Victor asked her.</p><p>\u201cUh, you mean why didn\u2019t she tell...us?\u201d Saxon threw out. \u201cDammit, Jazz, you\u2019re supposed to share shit like this!\u201d</p><p>They acted as if it were easy. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent the last five years undercover, Saxon. In and out of nightmares. And, you, Victor...you do things that I don\u2019t...I don\u2019t always even want to know about.\u201d The monsters he hunted terrified her.</p><p>\u201cJazz...\u201d Saxon began, his deep voice close to a growl.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d she correctly softly.</p><p>\u201cDrop the BS,\u201d Victor ordered her. Of the two men, Victor was the one usually snapping orders. Saxon was the one who usually went off and did whatever the hell he wanted. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you really tell us? If that guy was your brother, I would\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone everything to put us together.\u201d Fine. She\u2019d say the truth. They knew all her secrets, anyway. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to know about me, all right? He had his own life. He didn\u2019t need me and the tangled mess that I carry.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s gaze held hers. \u201cI like your mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Saxon immediately added.</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d Dammit, she was getting teary again. \u201cThat\u2019s behind me now. Elizabeth is a good girl\u2014\u201d</p><p>Saxon coughed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a programmer. She has no criminal past. She doesn\u2019t have killers chasing her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Victor glanced away. Oh, no.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have killers chasing her,\u201d Jasmine said again.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t found him yet. Maxwell\u2019s gone to ground, and I don\u2019t know how the hell he\u2019s managing to avoid our agents.\u201d</p><p>She backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find him,\u201d he rushed to reassure her. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine nodded even as fear twisted inside of her. She headed back toward the window. Stars were shining overhead. So many stars.</p><p>\u201cBut Maxwell Case isn\u2019t our only problem,\u201d Victor\u2019s voice flowed behind her. \u201cDrake Archer is proving to be difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I didn\u2019t see that one coming,\u201d Saxon muttered.</p><p>Jasmine rubbed her chilled arms and stared out into the night. They were isolated out there. No other cars were on the long, winding road leading to their cabin. They had the perfect vantage point to watch and guard their position.</p><p>\u201cThe guy\u2019s acting obsessed. What the hell did you do to him Jasmine?\u201d</p><p>She bristled at that. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Cause I\u2019ve got my bosses breathing down my neck about you. Archer is demanding to see your remains. Your remains! I don\u2019t think he\u2019s buying your death, and the more he pokes around, the harder this situation is to contain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A light appeared in the distance. Jasmine\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cYou had to go and sleep with him.\u201d Victor was annoyed then. \u201cHim. You couldn\u2019t just find some safe, boring accountant-type\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her not to sleep with anyone,\u201d Saxon had to add his two cents. \u201cI knew trouble like this would come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s her eyes.\u201d Victor was quick to jump on this bandwagon.</p><p>Jasmine narrowed said eyes even more.</p><p>\u201cThey make her look all vulnerable. Like she needs protecting. She pulled Archer in, and the guy is all twisted up because he thinks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d Jasmine told them.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Saxon hurried to her side. \u201cShit.\u201d He pulled her away from the window. \u201cYou were followed,\u201d Saxon accused Victor.</p> <p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Victor denied immediately, sounding affronted. \u201cI covered my ass. Took every possible precaution.\u201d Now he was at the window, too. \u201cThat\u2019s just some lost tourist.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t sound convinced, and he was already reaching for his weapon, the gun he kept holstered under his left arm.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs, Jazz,\u201d Victor said. \u201cLock the door and stay in the bedroom until Saxon or I come up there.\u201d</p><p>Saxon pulled out a gun from the nearby desk. \u201cKeep this with you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth had gone bone dry. \u201cBecause of a lost tourist?\u201d</p><p>Saxon held her stare. \u201cIf someone comes up there and it\u2019s not me or Vic...shoot.\u201d</p> <p>She could hear the growl of a car\u2019s engine. Getting closer and closer. Since when did tourists race up a mountain, in the dark? Jasmine turned and hurried up the stairs.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Jasmine carefully shut the bedroom door behind her. She clicked the lock into place. Killed the lights. Then backed up, moving until\u2014</p><p>She backed into something. Not the soft edge of the bed that she\u2019d expected to hit.</p><p>A person. Big. Warm. Hard.</p><p>Jasmine opened her mouth to scream, but a hand covered her lips, choking back the sound. She twisted and squirmed, determined to bring up her weapon.</p><p>\u201cNow why would you want to use that...\u201d A deep voice rumbled in her ear as the gun was taken from her. \u201cOn me?\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped. Drake.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to move my hand away from your mouth, and you aren\u2019t going to scream.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cBecause if you scream, those two jerks downstairs will run up here, and right now, I just want to deal with you.\u201d The words were angry. Hard.</p><p>She didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Drake was there.</p><p>His hand lifted. She turned in his arms. \u201cDrake, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth crashed down on hers. It was a hard, desperate, almost brutal kiss, and Jasmine loved it. She strained to get closer to him. She\u2019d missed him so much. It had felt as if someone had sliced right into her heart. No, as if someone had taken her heart.</p><p>His tongue thrust into her mouth. She rose onto her toes as she arched against him. One kiss, and the desire had ignited within her like a maelstrom. She couldn\u2019t get close enough. Couldn\u2019t touch him enough. Couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>His mouth tore away from hers. They were surrounded by darkness and the harsh sound of his breathing filled her ears.</p><p>\u201cIf I planned to...punish you for every lie you told me...\u201d That voice was a rasp against her ear. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019ll do...since you let me think you were dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. The plans were in motion long before we met.\u201d Jasmine Bennett had been ordered to go into Maxwell\u2019s organization\u2014she\u2019d been assigned the task of gathering intel on him. Of bringing him down. He\u2019d been her last job. She\u2019d already gotten too close to being caught before. Her \u201cdeath\u201d had been bound to happen, no matter what. \u201cAnd I...I didn\u2019t think it would matter so much to you.\u201d</p><p>His hold tightened on her. \u201cIt mattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-Drake?\u201d</p><p>Footsteps pounded up the stairs. The doorknob rattled. \u201cArcher!\u201d Victor snarled. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there.\u201d</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t move. \u201cIt\u2019s Jasmine\u2019s bedroom.\u201d His voice drawled out. \u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d</p><p>Victor shouted and kicked in the door. With a broken leg, the man seriously kicked in the door. Jasmine whirled around in shock as light flooded the room. \u201cVictor, no! You have to be careful!\u201d She tried to go to him.</p><p>But Drake hauled her back to his side. \u201cWhat have you done to your hair?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d noticed that?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be here!\u201d Victor strode toward them. She didn\u2019t know where his crutch was, and his cast thunked a bit with each angry step that he took. \u201cDo you know how much danger you\u2019re putting her in? You and those two idiots downstairs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of those idiots is her brother.\u201d Drake\u2019s voice snapped with anger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her brother! Me and Sax! We\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve always been there for her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake pushed Jasmine behind him. \u201cYou\u2019re the two that used her. That put her life at risk again and again, and that shit is stopping. She\u2019s not going to be in danger any longer. That won\u2019t happen. She\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Jasmine yelled.</p><p>And, wonder of wonders, they did.</p><p>Both men whirled to face her. Jasmine straightened her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m the one who did it.\u201d</p><p>A frown hardened Drake\u2019s face. His face...how many times had she closed her eyes and seen him in the last week? But he looked different now. The faint lines on his face were deeper, sharper. His eyes blazed with a bright fire and there seemed to be a wildness clinging to him, pulsing just beneath the skin.</p><p>\u201cI made the choices. I wanted to right the wrongs. I did it all. Me, not them.\u201d If Drake wanted someone to direct his fury at, he could stop looking at Victor.</p><p>He needed to look at her.</p><p>\u201cYou have to get out of here, Archer,\u201d she heard Victor snap. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for you to be here. We worked hard to make Jazz vanish. You\u2019re about to destroy everything!\u201d</p><p>But Drake didn\u2019t move. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Victor was adamant. \u201cWe\u2019ve got too much riding on this case. Jasmine is dead, and you need to move the hell on.\u201d</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t look at Victor. His gaze pinned Jasmine in place. \u201cI thought that I\u2019d watched you burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake...\u201d She had to fight to keep her breathing steady. \u201cWhy did you come after me?\u201d She\u2019d never thought that he would. She\u2019d already pictured him with someone else, and Jasmine had hated that other woman.</p><p>His jaw locked.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to do for her. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have left me.\u201d The words were rough, bitten off. \u201cYou let me think you were dead.\u201d A muscle jerked in his clenched jaw. \u201cDo you know what that did to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She was. More sorry than she could ever say. \u201cI didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who told her she couldn\u2019t have contact with you.\u201d Thunk. Thunk. Thunk. Victor caught her hand and pulled her away from Drake. \u201cBecause you\u2019re dangerous, Archer, and I knew you\u2019d make this whole thing blow up around us. You\u2019re pissed? Be pissed at me. I\u2019m the one who made her leave you. I\u2019m the one who did it all.\u201d</p><p>And Drake most definitely was pissed.</p><p>Drake glared at Victor.</p><p>Victor glared back even as he tugged on Jasmine\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get back downstairs before Saxon starts swinging...if he hasn\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine let him pull her away from Drake and back down the stairs. Victor didn\u2019t so much as flinch as he headed down all those steps, even though she knew his leg had to be hurting him. But that was Victor. Pushing through the pain, just like he\u2019d done in their early days.</p><p>Drake followed closely behind her, and her body was so attuned to him that every muscle was taut. He\u2019d come after her. That had to mean something, didn\u2019t it? If she\u2019d just been another lover in the dark to him, then Drake never would have bothered searching for her.</p><p>It has to mean something.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, it could mean everything.</p><p>Drake hated Victor. The smug FBI agent was begging for an ass kicking, and if Jasmine hadn\u2019t been standing between him and that jerk, Drake would be obliging him.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did these guys get here?\u201d The one called Saxon demanded. Big, blond, and with go-to-hell eyes, Drake remembered that fellow all too well.</p><p>So he was another one who\u2019d been in on the FBI\u2019s game all along. \u201cYou could\u2019ve said something,\u201d Drake snarled at him. \u201cInstead of taking her away from my cabin and leaving me running after her in that swamp!\u201d</p><p>Saxon lifted a brow. \u201cWas I supposed to say something before or after you started shooting at me?\u201d</p><p>Drake lunged forward.</p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d Saxon invited. He didn\u2019t back away. He stepped toe-to-toe with Drake. And he was smiling. A hard flash of teeth. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so tough because you and your boys spent some time pulling Black Ops? You\u2019re not the only one who knows how to dish out some hell.\u201d His hands were fisted, and Drake could see the line of scars that ran across Saxon\u2019s knuckles.</p><p>\u201cNo one is trying anything!\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice rose as she shoved her way between them. The light glinted off her hair. Blonde and shorter than before. Still sexy. Hell, the woman would always be sexy to him, but he missed that deep red of her hair. He wanted her back the way she\u2019d been. He wanted her...just the way she was before.</p><p>Her secrets. Her lies. He just wanted her.</p><p>The floor creaked as Noah stepped forward. Noah, who\u2019d been far too quiet on this whole mission. \u201cIs it true?\u201d Noah asked, his eyes locked on Jasmine. \u201cAre you my sister?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted in surprise then her gaze flew right to Drake. He saw pain in her stare. Betrayal? No, hell, no, he hadn\u2019t betrayed her. \u201cI thought you were dead! I wasn\u2019t really thinking of controlling my mouth.\u201d Sonofabitch. He\u2019d only thought of her. Drake made himself take a few steps back. He had to get his control\u2014and hold onto it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand just how much things had changed for him. For them. She would.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d Noah was less than a foot away from Jasmine.</p><p>Her open mouth closed. She shrugged. A careless move, even as her chin lifted a bit into the air. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Trace stood near the fireplace. The unlit fireplace. \u201cA DNA test will answer your question quick enough, Noah.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cYes, it will.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine backed up a bit. When she retreated, Drake noticed that both Victor and Saxon advanced, as if they\u2019d protect her.</p><p>What had Victor snarled at him earlier?</p><p>I\u2019m her brother! Me and Sax! We\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve always been there for her!</p><p>\u201cIs that why you all followed me?\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice was muted. Hurt. \u201cBecause you wanted to test my DNA and see if I was a match for Noah?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cI want to know if you\u2019re my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a family,\u201d Jasmine said softly. \u201cI saw your wedding picture. A beautiful wife who loves you. You don\u2019t...you don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me be the judge of what I need.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice was gruff and his eyes glinted with emotion. \u201cAre you my sister?\u201d</p><p>Almost miserably, Jasmine nodded.</p><p>He crept closer to her. \u201cH-how?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s lips quirked at that. Her dimples flashed, and Drake could tell by the expression on Noah\u2019s face that her smile had just gotten to him.</p><p>The way it got me?</p><p>\u201cThe usual way babies are made.\u201d Her smile slipped away. \u201cOur mother had you first. She was sixteen then, and she gave you up. I-I have a picture of you as a baby. It\u2019s upstairs. In my room. It\u2019s you and the people who adopted you.\u201d Her voice lowered. \u201cThat\u2019s how I found you. That picture.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face whitened. So much emotion blazed in his eyes. \u201cShe kept you?\u201d</p><p>There was an odd note in Noah\u2019s voice. Confusion. Pain. And as much as Drake wanted to rush forward and grab Jasmine, to hold her tight, he knew that Noah needed this time.</p><p>So did Jasmine.</p><p>Even Saxon and Victor had retreated a bit, though they still glowered suspiciously at Drake. And as for Trace...he was at the window, keeping guard. Always on alert.</p><p>\u201cShe kept me,\u201d Jasmine said with a slow nod. \u201cI think maybe...at first...she had plans for us. Dreams. Because she regretted letting you go. She used to cry about that. About you.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face was a tense mask.</p><p>\u201cIt was better...for you not to be there.\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice was so careful, and Drake knew that she wasn\u2019t going to tell Noah the full truth about her mother. She doesn\u2019t want to hurt him. \u201cLife wasn\u2019t easy then. The parents you had\u2014they loved you, and they gave you a good life. You shouldn\u2019t...you shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know,\u201d Noah said softly, cutting through her words.</p><p>Her lashes flickered.</p><p>\u201cWeston Securities,\u201d Noah murmured. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t find out everything I could about you...and her...as soon as Drake told me?\u201d</p><p>Now Saxon and Victor stepped forward once more, their protective instincts obviously aroused. I\u2019m her brother! Me and Sax! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah waved them back, not looking even a bit intimidated. \u201cI wish I\u2019d known about you. I would have come for you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell to the floor. \u201cMaybe you should do that DNA test. Make sure I\u2019m who you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah caught her chin and tipped her head back. \u201cI would have come for you.\u201d</p> <p>A tear slid down Jasmine\u2019s cheek. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to put you at risk.\u201d Her attention shifted to Drake. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to put any of you at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well...\u201d Victor\u2019s voice had roughened. \u201cLooks like they put themselves at risk. And now they\u2019ve got you right back in the crossfire, too.\u201d His furious stare was directed at Drake. \u201cMaxwell Case thought she was dead. Everyone was supposed to think she\u2019d burned in that fire. But now you\u2019re here, and you could\u2019ve tipped off Case!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were careful.\u201d It was Trace who replied. Drake was too busy staring at Jasmine. She\u2019d just hurriedly wiped away the tear on her cheek. He hated to see her cry. \u201cNo one followed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that? Cause I\u2019m not buying that story!\u201d Victor started to pace. \u201cWe need to move her to a new safe house. Get her out of here so we can be sure this place wasn\u2019t compromised.\u201d He nodded toward Saxon. \u201cLet\u2019s get her bag and start moving her out of here.\u201d</p><p>The guy really thought Drake was just going to let her vanish again? \u201cIt\u2019s not happening,\u201d Drake said simply.</p> <p>\u201cDid you just give me an order?\u201d Victor glowered at him. \u201cCause it sounded like you tried to order me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you a fact. Jasmine isn\u2019t going to vanish again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you get to decide her life?\u201d</p><p>Since she became my life. He didn\u2019t tell the jerk that. What he felt for Jasmine...that was between him and her. They needed to be alone for any more revelations.</p><p>\u201cI want to...know you.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice was halting as he spoke to Jasmine. \u201cI found out you were my sister in the same moment I found out you were dead\u2014or, I thought you were dead.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cI want to know you.\u201d</p><p>And Drake just wanted her.</p> <p>So he stared at Jasmine. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to run.\u201d Slowly, he advanced toward her. His hand lifted. Touched the blonde hair. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be someone else. You don\u2019t have to start a new life in a different place. You don\u2019t always have to be looking over your shoulder.\u201d That was exactly what she\u2019d do, as long as Case was out there.</p><p>\u201cSo what is she supposed to do then?\u201d Victor demanded.</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t look away from Jasmine. \u201cStay with me. I can keep you safe. I can protect you. I can stop him.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d he told her again, and the words were as close to a plea as he\u2019d ever come.</p><p>\u201cNo, no way.\u201d Victor thunked closer with his cast. \u201cYou are in way over your head, Archer. You can\u2019t keep her safe. You can just get her dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate me,\u201d Drake said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just know what you are.\u201d Red stained his cheeks. \u201cI mean, big deal, so you once pulled some missions when you were playing soldier.\u201d</p> <p>Playing soldier? Oh, that jerk was pushing him too far.</p><p>\u201cBut now you spend your days drinking in casinos and flirting with women. You are in so far over your head because you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s laughter stopped him.</p><p>Drake let his own lips curl. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t believe everything you read in your FBI files. Jasmine isn\u2019t the only one good at pretending to be someone else.\u201d He let his hand fall away from Jasmine\u2019s hair. \u201cMaxwell is already after me anyway,\u201d Drake told him. \u201cSo I\u2019ll put myself up as bait. I\u2019ll draw him out. I\u2019ll stop him because the FBI sure as shit isn\u2019t having any luck.\u201d</p><p>Victor snarled at him. Yeah, the guy reminded him of an angry wolf.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop him,\u201d Drake said again. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t have to run.\u201d</p><p>But Jasmine shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s not the only enemy I\u2019ve made.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in close to her. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m afraid?\u201d</p><p>She searched his eyes. Shook her head once more.</p><p>\u201cThen stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Tension stretched, filling that room, and...Jasmine nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Victor was furious. \u201cThis is a huge mistake! Jasmine, you can\u2019t trust this guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his current addiction. He wants you, and the guy is used to taking what he wants. But what happens when he gets tired of you? When he gets bored? He\u2019ll toss you aside, and the lions will close in.\u201d</p><p>Tired of Jasmine? \u201cNot going to happen.\u201d He was being patient with the FBI prick, mostly because he knew Jasmine had ties with the guy and since those ties were familial and not sexual, he was giving the man a bit of leeway.</p><p>That leeway was going to end.</p><p>\u201cWe have a helicopter waiting to take us out of the mountains,\u201d Drake told Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cBecause your last escape flight went so well?\u201d Victor\u2019s face had darkened. \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening! Jasmine, you\u2019re going with me and Saxon. We\u2019ll keep you safe. The way we always have. You can count on us. You know it and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Drake.\u201d</p><p>Victor stopped talking.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Vic, and Saxon, you\u2019ll always be my champion, but I...I need more.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cI don\u2019t want to start over again. I don\u2019t want to run anymore. I want to have a real life, and I want to stop pretending.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s face had gone slack with shock.</p><p>But Saxon...he just nodded.</p><p>Her hand curled around Drake\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll get my bag, and I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, yes.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to promise me one thing.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d promise her the whole world. And he\u2019d give it to her.</p><p>I will never feel that agony again\u2014I will never lose her again.</p><p>\u201cPromise me that Maxwell won\u2019t hurt you. That we will stop him.\u201d</p><p>Easy enough. \u201cI promise. Princess, I\u2019ve got resources that you can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d And all of those resources were in play then.</p><p>He\u2019d found her. He\u2019d get Maxwell. End the nightmare.</p><p>Jasmine gave him a smile. Not the one that made her dimples wink, but one that still had his heart aching. Then she looked toward Noah. Tentatively, hopefully, her gaze flickered over him as she backed toward the stairs.</p><p>No one spoke as she turned and climbed those stairs. When she disappeared at the top, Drake wasn\u2019t surprised to see both Saxon and Victor head toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell...\u201d Victor grated, voice low because Drake knew the guy didn\u2019t want Jasmine overhearing this, \u201care you doing? You screwed her, and now you think you can take over her life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took my life.\u201d He faced off against the two men and knew that both Noah and Trace had closed in behind him. They always had his back. \u201cAnd I will protect her with every bit of power that I have. She doesn\u2019t need to be afraid any longer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she has you?\u201d Saxon cut in. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you doing a whole lot of protecting back at that cabin\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake drove his fist into Saxon\u2019s gut. The guy grunted.</p><p>\u201cFor the cabin,\u201d Drake murmured. \u201cBecause it was my grandfather\u2019s, and I loved that place. You should\u2019ve found another way inside.\u201d</p><p>Saxon\u2019s eyes glinted. Not with the rage Drake had expected. Almost with...humor? \u201cI thought you\u2019d hit harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t gotten her out of that warehouse, I would\u2019ve.\u201d</p><p>Saxon nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit!\u201d Victor wasn\u2019t softening at all. \u201cJasmine is under federal protection. You can\u2019t just take her out of here! I won\u2019t let you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour federal protection didn\u2019t stop me from finding her. It won\u2019t stop him.\u201d Flat. True. \u201cYou need more power than the Feds are giving you. Work with me. We\u2019ll take out Case, and then you\u2019ll know that Jasmine is safe.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s face twisted. \u201cI don\u2019t like you, dammit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the asshole who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t good enough for her.\u201d Victor\u2019s words fired out. \u201cYou\u2019re too dangerous and you\u2019re unstable. You lack control, and you live on the edge too much. Jasmine needs someone different. Someone safe.\u201d</p><p>Drake knew he would never be safe. And the edge\u2014that was the only place he knew. He also knew one more thing. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d</p><p>Surprise rippled across Victor\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m dangerous and uncontrolled, just like you said. But maybe that\u2019s what she needs. Maybe she needs someone who isn\u2019t afraid to kill in order to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a federal agent, you can\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would break any law, I would do anything, to keep her safe. No one will hurt her, not ever again, because I\u2019ll be with her.\u201d</p><p>Beside Victor, Saxon gave another grim nod. \u201cThat\u2019s what a man should do. Kick the ass of anyone who threatens his woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasmine isn\u2019t his.\u201d Victor was still furious. \u201cThey just met. She\u2019s something different for him. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is different, and she made me...different, too.\u201d</p><p>Then he heard the faint sound of Jasmine\u2019s footsteps. Coming back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll throw her away when you\u2019re done.\u201d Victor\u2019s eyes blazed. \u201cThrow her to the lions at the door.\u201d</p><p>Drake shook his head. \u201cNo one will take her from me.\u201d He paused a beat. \u201cNot Case. Not you. You may be her family, but I\u2019m going to be her future.\u201d His low words were a vow.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward her voice. Jasmine was at the base of the stairs, a small, black bag clutched in her left hand. Her right hand was curled around a piece of paper. No, not paper. As she moved toward Noah, Drake saw that Jasmine was actually holding a photograph.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like this. Our...our mother is the one holding you.\u201d Her lips hitched up in a half-smile. \u201cAnd the people behind her\u2014well, you know them, right? The thing I liked most about that picture...you can already see the love in their eyes.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s hand trembled when he took the photo.</p><p>Jasmine gave him another of her dazzling smiles. Noah just stared at her, lost.</p><p>I know the feeling, buddy.</p><p>Then Jasmine hugged Noah. A quick, fast hug. She tried to pull back, but Noah\u2019s arms locked around her and he held her tightly. He whispered something to her, but Drake couldn\u2019t catch the words. When Jasmine pulled back, her eyes glinted.</p><p>She eased toward Drake. \u201cWh-what\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>She had tears in her eyes. But Jasmine quickly blinked them away.</p><p>He frowned at Noah. \u201cThe plan is that Noah and Trace will stay here, keeping guard and making sure we aren\u2019t followed. You and I are heading for the helicopter. We\u2019re getting out of here, now.\u201d Because his intel told him that this place had been compromised.</p><p>That\u2019s how I found it. The location had already been compromised. I was just lucky enough to beat the bastard here.</p><p>Victor shook his head. \u201cJasmine, you don\u2019t have to leave with him. We can protect you.\u201d</p><p>The guy needed to let it go. Drake glowered.</p><p>\u201cI do have to go. Because when I left without him before, it ripped my heart out.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s gaze flew toward her.</p><p>She was staring at him. \u201cI want to see what can happen.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been in love, Drake, but I think...I really think I came close with you.</p><p>He took the bag from her. Twined the fingers of his left hand with hers. He didn\u2019t head for the front door. His motorcycle was back behind the cabin. Hidden in the trees.</p><p>Noah crossed his path. \u201cKeep her safe.\u201d</p><p>Always.</p><p>Then Noah leaned toward him. \u201cI love you like a brother, man, but if you do anything to hurt her, ever, I will bury you.\u201d</p><p>Drake nodded. Fair enough. It looked as if Saxon and Victor weren\u2019t the only angry big brothers he\u2019d be facing.</p><p>But for Jasmine, he was realizing that he\u2019d face anyone. Anytime.</p><p>He slipped from the cabin with Jasmine at his side.</p><p>Saxon crossed his arms over his chest and studied Trace Weston and Noah York. \u201cSo what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow...we spring our trap.\u201d</p><p>Victor was wobbling on his cast. The guy liked to pace when he was angry, and Saxon knew that cast was seriously cramping his buddy\u2019s style.</p><p>\u201cAnd if that trap backfires?\u201d Victor wanted to know. \u201cWhat if Drake winds up getting Jasmine killed?\u201d Victor stopped wobbling and pointed at Noah. \u201cIf she\u2019s really your sister, you should be scared as all hell. Drake Archer doesn\u2019t have the kind of history you can trust. He\u2019s a playboy and an adrenaline junkie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves her,\u201d Noah said simply.</p><p>Saxon nodded. He\u2019d already figured that out for himself.</p><p>Victor\u2019s mouth hung open. \u201cWhat? There\u2019s no way. He doesn\u2019t love anyone or anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw him when that warehouse exploded.\u201d Trace Weston\u2019s voice was low. \u201cYou already know how he feels, but you don\u2019t want to admit it because you don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victor swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNow we have plans to put in place. Because according to our intel, Maxwell is already on his way here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t tell Jasmine because if she\u2019d known...Drake didn\u2019t think she\u2019d leave the two of you behind.\u201d</p><p>Drake had been right. Saxon rocked forward onto the balls of his feet. \u201cThat intel of yours had better not be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d Trace seemed certain. \u201cWe found your location because it had already been leaked. We just managed to beat Maxwell here, but he is coming. And we have to be ready for him.\u201d</p><p>Saxon had been waiting for his chance at the guy. Ever since the sonofabitch had punched Jasmine. Right in front of me. He hadn\u2019t seen the blow coming. And it had wrecked him.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, Jazz.</p> <p>\u201cWe wait,\u201d Trace said, \u201cand when he gets close enough, the bastard is ours.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The motorcycle roared to a stop in what looked like the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Jasmine tightened her hold on Drake even as he braked the bike. What were they doing? She didn\u2019t see a helicopter there.</p><p>He rose, and she followed him, ditching the helmet that he\u2019d given to her. \u201cDrake? Drake, why are we stopping here?\u201d The stars\u2014looked like a million of them\u2014glinted down on her.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t go anymore...I need you too much.\u201d</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be as much as she needed him.</p><p>\u201cJasmine...we have to talk. There were things I couldn\u2019t say with those two guards of yours listening to our every word.\u201d</p><p>Her guards\u2014Victor and Saxon? She turned away from him and nervously rubbed her arms. She felt chilled out there.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her back against his chest. \u201cDo you know what it was like for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d No, she didn\u2019t. Jasmine didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>His mouth pressed to her neck, scorching her with his kiss.</p><p>She trembled. They were surrounded by the woods. He\u2019d pulled off the narrow road, and they were far away from prying eyes.</p><p>It\u2019s just us.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I saw the fire...when I saw that place explode, do you know what it was like for me?\u201d</p><p>Helplessly, Jasmine shook her head.</p><p>He kissed her neck again.</p><p>\u201cI was ready to burn with you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart slammed into her chest. She never wanted Drake to suffer because of her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on you.\u201d He seemed to surround all of her. Jasmine could feel the heat of his arousal pressing against her. Only fair considering that she\u2019d just nearly melted with the light caress of his lips against her throat. \u201cI knew better than to trust a beautiful face.\u201d</p><p>Because of Anna Jean. Would that woman\u2019s ghost never stop haunting her?</p><p>\u201cYou risked your life for me.\u201d</p><p>He nipped her with his teeth then. A gentle punishment that had her aching even more.</p><p>\u201cYou stared at danger. You fucking made me laugh, and you caught me. You slipped beneath my guard when I should have been watching...\u201d</p><p>One hand rose and slid up her side, resting just beneath her breast. In that wilderness, they seemed totally isolated. Just her. Just Drake. Just the faint howl of the wind through the trees.</p><p>His hand curled around her breast. Her nipple was already tight and hard with arousal, and she gasped at the electric contact.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d His mouth was on the spot where her shoulder and neck met, that curve that she\u2019d never realized was so incredibly sensitive.</p><p>He kissed her there even as his hand fondled her breast. The wind seemed to kick up around her, and her long skirt blew back against her legs.</p><p>\u201cI-I had to lie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve your punishments.\u201d</p><p>Both of his hands were on her now. Strong, rough hands. Her hips squirmed, pushing back against him.</p><p>\u201cI knew you lied...and I didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Once more, she felt the nip of his teeth. Jasmine was pretty sure her panties were soaked. I missed him so much.</p><p>One of his hands slid down her stomach. He caught her billowing skirt and slid under it. She pushed up onto her toes and tried to widen her legs a bit more.</p><p>\u201cI heard the recording they made of you. You told Case that I wouldn\u2019t come after you. That I didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>His fingers brushed over her panties. Her eyes closed as a moan built in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to lie to him, but those words didn\u2019t sound like a lie.\u201d</p><p>Helplessly, Jasmine shook her head.</p><p>His fingers pulled the panties to the side, and then he was touching her. Stroking her with his slightly callused fingers\u2014sliding two fingers into her.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t lying to him. You thought you didn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><p>Faster, harder, he worked her sex with one hand while his other stroked her breast. Jasmine\u2019s whole body was bow tight. A release was coming. Just seconds away\u2014</p><p>He spun her around. \u201cYou thought wrong, princess.\u201d He jerked open his jeans. His cock sprang out. Before she could suck in a deep breath, he\u2019d lifted her up\u2014she loved that man\u2019s strength\u2014and he was inside of her. Surging deep and hard, filling her so much that she ached, and the ache felt good. \u201cYou.\u201d Thrust. \u201cWere.\u201d Hard thrust. \u201cWrong.\u201d</p><p>His hands were steel bands around her waist as he lifted her into each thrust. Strong and hard and wild. She couldn\u2019t slow down his rhythm. She didn\u2019t want to. Jasmine just held onto him, squeezing him with her sex, and when the pleasure burst through her, she kissed him as she tried to give him back some of that blazing euphoria.</p><p>The pleasure lashed her whole body. Inside. Out. Pulsed through her with a sensual energy that ignited her.</p><p>Her hands sank into his hair. She kept kissing him, deep, sensually, and with all the passion that she had.</p><p>She felt him come inside of her. Long, hot jets that just made her tremble all the more.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ease his hold on her. She didn\u2019t let him go. They were still in the night. She wished that they could just stay there, alone, and forget the rest of the world. Forget the danger and the fear.</p><p>But his hands were slowly sliding down her body. He eased her back to her feet. Her knees shook and he held her when she trembled.</p><p>He pressed a faint kiss to her forehead. It was...tender. Jasmine had to swallow the lump in her throat. \u201cWhere is that helicopter going to take us?\u201d Jasmine whispered.</p><p>\u201cAny place you want to go.\u201d</p><p>She just wanted to be with him.</p><p>He straightened her clothes, again with movements that were strangely tender. She\u2019d thought he was furious with her, but he didn\u2019t act like a man enraged as he settled her back on the motorcycle. He handed her the helmet. Hesitated. \u201cGo back to red.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him and tried to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cI miss the red hair.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled. \u201cAnd here I thought blondes had more fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful any way, and I\u2019ll take you...\u201d His voice roughened. \u201cAny way I can get you.\u201d</p><p>That was how she\u2019d take him, too. Did that make her desperate? Lost? Jasmine didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>His hand curled around her thigh and seemed to scorch her right through that fabric. \u201cYou matter to me.\u201d The words were growled, heavy with arousal. \u201cI would have walked through that fire for you. You matter.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat. \u201cYou matter to me, too,\u201d she said softly. But those weren\u2019t the words she wanted to say. Fear held them back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know when it happened, but I do know this...when that warehouse caught on fire, I knew my life was over, if you weren\u2019t in it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to cry. Not again. She\u2019d done plenty of that in the last week so she quickly blinked away the water that wanted to fill her eyes.</p><p>\u201cStay with me. Now...and for the days that are coming. See what we can be for each other.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t he realize what she\u2019d done? She\u2019d already made that choice. When she\u2019d left Victor and the safety of the FBI, she\u2019d been choosing the life she might have with him. The life she wanted. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere without you.\u201d Because she\u2019d finally found the home that she\u2019d sought for so long.</p><p>And that home\u2014it was wherever Drake was.</p><p>He gave a grim nod, then climbed onto the bike. The motorcycle\u2019s engine snarled to life once more, and soon they were whipping through the night. Her arms curled around him as the darkness passed in a blur, and she held him so tightly.</p><p>I love you. Those were the words she\u2019d wanted to give him. Too fast. Too soon. That didn\u2019t matter to her. Drake was in her heart, and when the moment was right, she would tell him.</p><p>Fear wouldn\u2019t hold her back forever.</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t stop again, not until they reached a small strip of pavement in the darkness. A landing pad. The lights on the helicopter were shining and the blades were already whirling. Drake had told the pilot to start up as soon as he saw them coming.</p><p>He tossed aside his helmet and reached for Jasmine\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on!\u201d The wind from the helicopter blew against him. The sooner they got on that bird, the better.</p><p>\u201cWait, my bag!\u201d Jasmine bent to retrieve the small bag that he\u2019d stuffed into the motorcycle\u2019s saddlebag.</p><p>The pilot was inside the chopper. The helicopter\u2019s lights were blazing, so Drake couldn\u2019t see inside to the guy, but he knew Quincy Cole would follow orders. He\u2019d made special arrangements to have Quincy come with him to the mountains because the fellow was one of the few Drake trusted completely. The guy was good in a\u2014</p><p>Gunfire rang out. The blast hit Drake in the shoulder and he stumbled back.</p><p>\u201cDrake!\u201d Jasmine grabbed for him.</p><p>Another shot rang out. Only this time, that shot hit her. It slammed into Jasmine even as Drake tried to twist his body and protect her.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t fast enough.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Drake roared as he pulled her tightly against him. He could feel her blood, pulsing from a wound on her stomach. This wasn\u2019t happening. This wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think you\u2019d be a step ahead of me? There was no way I\u2019d let you beat me to Jasmine,\u201d a familiar voice called out. Not Quincy. Not Quincy... \u201cI was just waiting until I could get you both together. It\u2019s fitting for you to go out this way!\u201d</p><p>Drake turned his head. The pilot had come out of the chopper, only it definitely wasn\u2019t Quincy. This man was taller, bigger, and even though the light was behind him and Drake couldn\u2019t see his face, he knew the man.</p><p>\u201cMaxwell.\u201d</p><p>Laughter. \u201cThanks for arranging my getaway ride for me. After I kill you two, it will be nice to fly away. Anna Jean was the one to teach me to fly, you see. That woman loved the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-Drake...?\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice broke on his name.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d I promised to protect her. \u201cIt\u2019s just a graze, princess. You\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, Jasmine,\u201d Maxwell told her, his words gleeful. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding out. That\u2019s a gut shot. One designed to give you maximum pain, because I felt that was what I owed you. If you don\u2019t get medical attention immediately, you\u2019ll die.\u201d That laughter again. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t be rising from the dead this time.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, so carefully, Drake lowered Jasmine to the ground. \u201cI didn\u2019t find you...just to lose you again.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t lose her. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid...of what I do.\u201d Because he was going to do exactly what had to be done.</p><p>Maxwell wasn\u2019t lying. It was a gut shot. And Drake was getting Jasmine that immediate medical attention because she would not be dying on him.</p><p>She nodded, her head barely moving against the ground. Her breath was choking out.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, princess.</p><p>He\u2019d failed her, again, and she was about to see just what he truly was.</p><p>He slipped the knife from his boot. He always had a weapon on him. Did Jasmine realize that? Probably not. Because she didn\u2019t know all his secrets.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay right there!\u201d Maxwell ordered him. He could hear the man\u2019s footsteps coming closer. \u201cI want you to watch while she dies in front of you. I mean, you watched my Anna Jean die, didn\u2019t you? So it\u2019s only fitting that you watch that treacherous bitch Jazz die, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...c-cold...\u201d Jasmine whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll warm you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flickered to him. \u201cYou...already did.\u201d</p><p>Drake swallowed and kept the knife concealed. He just needed a few precious seconds to attack his prey.</p><p>But Jasmine didn\u2019t have seconds.</p><p>The gun shoved into the back of Drake\u2019s head. \u201cWatch her. Stare right at that bitch as she chokes on her blood and you have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake lunged up and twisted around in a flash. He knocked the gun out of the bastard\u2019s hand. Then he drove his knife right into Maxwell Case\u2019s heart. \u201cDon\u2019t ever call her a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Maxwell\u2019s breath heaved out. His hands clamped around Drake\u2019s arms.</p><p>Drake twisted the knife and he smiled. \u201cYou should have stayed the hell away from me...and what was mine.\u201d</p><p>Then he shoved that bastard to the ground. The knife was still in Maxwell\u2019s heart. Exactly where it belonged.</p><p>Drake whirled back to Jasmine. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, princess.\u201d He lifted her. Carried her to the chopper. He strapped her in and used those straps to put as much pressure on the wound as he could. She cried out in pain, and the sound wrenched through him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he jumped forward to grab the controls.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...want to die...\u201d Her weak voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d He flipped the switches. Called out on his radio. He wanted help. He\u2019d get help. \u201cI\u2019m not losing you.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d already thought she left him once. He couldn\u2019t survive that kind of pain again. He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>The helicopter\u2019s blades whirled and the bird lifted into the dark sky.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to have a plan!\u201d Victor stormed into the hospital\u2019s emergency room with his crutch pounding frantically onto the linoleum floor. \u201cYou bastard! This is your fault!\u201d</p><p>He lunged toward Drake, then stopped short when he saw the blood that covered him. \u201cJ-Jasmine\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it.\u201d He met Victor\u2019s gaze head on. \u201cMaxwell shot her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI heard.\u201d Victor\u2019s voice had lowered. Saxon was beside him. Looking just as furious and scared. \u201cWhat happened to your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>The paramedics had insisted on taking out the bullet. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Saxon narrowed his eyes on him. \u201cAnd what happened to that bastard Maxwell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was waiting for us at the helicopter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said she\u2019d be safe with you,\u201d Victor gritted. The man\u2019s face was chalk white. His eyes blazed with emotion. \u201cI trusted you with her life! Look what you did!\u201d He dropped the crutch and attacked.</p><p>Drake let him take his swings. He knew he had them coming. Them and more.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t quite expect Victor to have such a strong punch, though. That first hit damn near broke his jaw.</p><p>He took the second hit.</p><p>The third.</p><p>\u201cFuck man,\u201d Victor snarled. \u201cYou won\u2019t even fight me.\u201d</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t. He looked up at Victor. \u201cJasmine loves you.\u201d He knew that with certainty. He\u2019d heard it in her voice.</p><p>At Drake\u2019s words, Victor\u2019s body shuddered. He whirled away. Nearly fell when his broken leg hit a chair, but then he stumbled away.</p><p>The emergency room doors swung open again. This time, Trace and Noah rushed inside. Noah, Christ, he looked terrible.</p><p>Probably the same way I look.</p> <p>\u201cI was supposed to save her.\u201d He\u2019d promised her that.</p><p>He\u2019d never wanted to break a promise to Jasmine.</p><p>Drake waited for Noah to kick his ass. He deserved his pound of flesh, just like Victor. Instead, Noah just asked, in a voice heavy with pain, \u201cIs she going to live?\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cShe has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Maxwell Case?\u201d Saxon snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhere he fell.\u201d Drake\u2019s jaw locked. \u201cWith my knife in his heart.\u201d</p><p>Victor stood in the corner. Talking fiercely into his phone. Probably checking with his FBI buddies. They\u2019d find Case\u2019s body. Drake hadn\u2019t missed his mark.</p><p>He swallowed and just tasted his own sick fear. \u201cHe was at the launch pad. I thought-I thought we\u2019d beat him to the mountains, but he made it here ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Noah just watched him with an unblinking stare.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard...he killed Quincy.\u201d He\u2019d seen the man\u2019s body near the chopper. \u201cAnd he just waited for me.\u201d He forced himself to keep looking into Noah\u2019s eyes. \u201cI led her straight to him.\u201d He\u2019d been so certain he could keep her safe.</p><p>So wrong.</p><p>\u201cI fucked up.\u201d</p><p>Noah clamped a hand over his shoulder.</p><p>Drake tried to choke down his fear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s hold tightened. \u201cMe, either, man. Me, either.\u201d</p><p>Helpless, lost, Drake could only stand there...and wait.</p><p>Jasmine opened her eyes. \u201cI want...Drake.\u201d</p><p>Machines beeped around her. Her body hurt. And she remembered everything that had happened to her. Well, everything up until the moment she\u2019d passed out in the helicopter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone, baby.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s voice. Her head turned. Victor was beside her bed. Holding her hand. Looking as if he\u2019d been to hell and back.</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Fear whipped through her and the machines around Jasmine began to beep frantically.</p><p>\u201cDammit, look what you did.\u201d Saxon stepped closer to the bed. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead, Jazz. Maxwell didn\u2019t get him.\u201d He gave a low whistle. \u201cYour boyfriend pretty much carved that guy\u2019s heart out. You don\u2019t have to worry about any threats from Maxwell ever again.\u201d</p><p>She pulled in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAs for Drake...Vic here got the guy taken into custody. Some BS about obstructing a federal investigation.\u201d Anger hummed in Saxon\u2019s words. \u201cHe had your man dragged out of here in handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine tried to sit up\u2014and failed. \u201cYou...didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s hold tightened on her hand. \u201cI think I went a little crazy,\u201d his confession was hushed, \u201cwhen I saw you in the OR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went into the operating room?\u201d</p><p>He gave a slow nod. \u201cI thought you were dying on the table. I was so furious\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared,\u201d Saxon tossed out.</p><p>\u201cIt was Drake\u2019s fault.\u201d Victor\u2019s gaze slowly lifted to meet her stare. \u201cHe took you out of the safe house. He\u2019s dangerous. A threat that I couldn\u2019t allow to stand near you anymore.\u201d</p><p>She could only shake her head. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>Saxon rocked forward onto the balls of his feet. \u201cI told you, Vic, you were losing your mind.\u201d A pause. \u201cWhat little you had left of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake saved me!\u201d Her throat hurt. Burned. Had they put a tube down her throat? Oh, jeez, she hated those tubes. And...what about her stomach? The gunshot? She didn\u2019t want to look at the damage to the rest of her body. \u201cLet him...go!\u201d</p><p>Victor rose to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re...going back to him?\u201d</p><p>Always.</p><p>But then Victor gave a hard shake of his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to stop her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe. You had...other cases, Jazz. Other enemies. We have to make sure that all the threats facing you have been eliminated.\u201d</p><p>Once more, she tried to rise in the bed. Moving hurt like a bitch, so she didn\u2019t get very far. Maybe a precious inch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting out of this hospital any time soon,\u201d Victor\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t let you go to him. I can\u2019t put you in the line of fire again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor...\u201d</p><p>Saxon cut his stare toward his friend. \u201cGet her lover out of FBI custody. Do it now, so that Drake can have time to cool down and not want to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jasmine was pretty sure Drake wouldn\u2019t forget an ass kicking.</p><p>And he won\u2019t forget me.</p><p>\u201cHe gave you some free hits,\u201d Saxon continued, voice flat, \u201cbut you know that shit will be over.\u201d</p><p>What free hits? Jasmine shook her head. \u201cI think I love him.\u201d</p><p>Victor stumbled back as his mouth gaped. \u201cHim? Him? No! We talked about this! You were supposed to fall for an accountant, a doctor. Someone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cGet him out of custody,\u201d Jasmine ordered\u2014or tried to order. Talking seemed to be such an effort, and her eyelids wanted to sag closed. Stupid drugs. She hated them. \u201cLet him know...I\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d It was Saxon who gave that promise.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t go to him.\u201d Victor was adamant. \u201cNot until it\u2019s safe.\u201d His voice roughened. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t handle seeing you hurt like this, baby. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to keep her eyes open and on him.</p><p>\u201cWe might not be blood, but you\u2019re my family,\u201d Victor said. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t let anyone ever hurt you again. No matter what rules I have to break...or who I have to destroy.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so fierce. And so like Drake. \u201cYou have...\u201d Her words were slurring because sleep was calling her again. \u201cA lot...in common with him...\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, gruffly, \u201cThat\u2019s what scares me.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t scare her. She knew Victor was a good man. Deep down. Beneath that dangerous exterior. As for Drake...</p><p>I know he\u2019s my man. She\u2019d find her way back to him. Because she wasn\u2019t going to let her chance at happiness slip away. Not now.</p><p>When Jasmine\u2019s eyes sagged closed, Victor didn\u2019t let go of her hand. She looked too pale against those crisp sheets. Too fragile.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to keep her away from him,\u201d Saxon warned.</p><p>Victor glanced up at the only man he considered his friend. His family. For so long, it had been him, Saxon, and Jazz against the world.</p><p>\u201cYou sure as hell won\u2019t be able to keep him away from her,\u201d Saxon added, his eyes watchful.</p><p>\u201cHe got her shot!\u201d</p><p>One brow rose. \u201cHe flew the chopper that got her to this hospital. He stopped her bleeding. He saved her life.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnd he carved out the heart of the asshole who hurt her. In my book, that makes him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Victor\u2019s hold tightened on Jasmine\u2019s hand. \u201cOkay? One of the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s with her, then he is family, whether you like it or not.\u201d His gaze slid toward the closed hospital room door. \u201cSo is that other poor bastard out there. The one who won\u2019t stop pacing the hallway.\u201d</p><p>Noah York.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell us about him?\u201d He\u2019d thought Jasmine was as alone in the world as they had been. He could still remember the first time he\u2019d met her. His hands had been broken. His ribs cracked. He\u2019d been spitting up blood in that rundown boxing ring. No one else had so much as given him a second glance.</p><p>Then her soft hands had been on his shoulders. She\u2019d promised him that everything would be all right.</p><p>He\u2019d thought of her as his angel then. An angel who\u2019d gotten caught in hell with him. \u201cI wanted more for her.\u201d That was why he\u2019d worked so hard to get her out of those undercover operations, but Jasmine had kept pushing herself right back in them.</p><p>\u201cShe likes the danger, just as much as we do.\u201d Now Saxon was looking at Jasmine once more. \u201cWhy do you think she was so drawn to Archer?\u201d</p><p>Victor had to bite back a snarl. \u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like him,\u201d Saxon murmured as a smile tugged at his lips. \u201cYou do have to get his ass out of FBI holding, or else Jazz will rip you a new one when she finally gets out of that hospital bed.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t getting out of that bed anytime soon. He\u2019d read the reports. Felt as if he\u2019d been the one gutted. So much pain. Too much, for her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know Archer isn\u2019t going to just stay there, anyway. You\u2019re lucky he hasn\u2019t called in some of those high-powered contacts of his and had your ass demoted at the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>Victor had wondered about that part himself. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he?\u201d He forced himself to let go of Jazz. She\u2019s going to be okay.</p><p>\u201cYou blamed him for what happened to her.\u201d Saxon shrugged. \u201cIt was obvious the man blamed himself, too.\u201d</p><p>And the guy was just staying locked up? \u201cDoesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>But Saxon had turned away. \u201cIt does...if he loves her.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s spine snapped up at that. \u201cArcher doesn\u2019t love his women.\u201d</p><p>Saxon\u2019s hand was on the door. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has any women any longer. I think he just has...her.\u201d</p><p>Victor shook his head. Saxon hadn\u2019t seen the background reports on Archer. He didn\u2019t know about the man\u2019s past. Archer wasn\u2019t going to get heavily involved with someone. He was just\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecause she loves him, it doesn\u2019t mean we lose her. Blood or no blood, do you think Jasmine would ever turn her back on us?\u201d</p><p>Victor didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cSo you need to go make peace with Archer. Cause if you don\u2019t, the holidays are going to be shit-ass awkward.\u201d Saxon exhaled heavily. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to talk with the brother because if I don\u2019t, that guy is gonna tear down this hospital.\u201d</p><p>Victor glanced back at Jasmine. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t move when the door opened and Victor walked inside the small office. He stared up at the FBI Agent as his gut clenched. \u201cJasmine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s heart raced in his chest.</p><p>\u201cThe doctors expect a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the table, his hands fisted.</p><p>Victor paced toward him. The lower part of his right leg was in a black boot, and there was no sign of his crutch. \u201cWhy the hell are you still here?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s awake. A full recovery. \u201cI\u2019m in custody, where else would I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feed me that BS. You\u2019re letting the FBI hold you. Why? Why haven\u2019t you used one of your high priced lawyers or pulled one of those puppet strings that you and your pal Weston control\u2014why haven\u2019t you gotten out? Why have you been letting the FBI play guard dog around you?\u201d</p><p>Drake inclined his head toward him. \u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>Victor\u2019s hands slammed down on the table. \u201cJasmine? You expect me to believe you stayed prisoner for her?\u201d</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cYou nearly got her killed. You said you\u2019d keep her safe.\u201d Victor\u2019s words rushed out in a furious barrage. \u201cI let you take her, and then...then the next time I saw her, they had her cut open on an operating room table.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drake\u2019s jaw locked.</p><p>\u201cWhen her eyes opened, you were the first thing that she asked about. You.\u201d</p><p>His chest ached.</p> <p>\u201cHow many enemies do you have out there, Archer? Do you even know? How many of them would love to hurt you...by going after Jasmine? By going after the woman you love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many to count.\u201d Did the agent think he hadn\u2019t realized this? He didn\u2019t want Jasmine hurt. That was why he\u2019d stayed with the FBI guards. Why he hadn\u2019t gone back to the hospital, when every cell in his body was screaming for her.</p><p>He never wanted to see her bloody and in pain again.</p><p>\u201cShit. You didn\u2019t deny it.\u201d Victor shoved away from the table. \u201cYou were supposed to deny it!\u201d His hands flew into the air.</p><p>Drake rose to his feet. \u201cI won\u2019t put her at risk again.\u201d He\u2019d been selfish. He could see that now. And though he felt like he was cutting out his own heart, Drake made himself say, \u201cI won\u2019t pull her back into my life.\u201d He couldn\u2019t\u2014because he couldn\u2019t put her at risk ever again.</p> <p>He was more than obsessed. He was lost in her. And if he didn\u2019t stay away, while he could, he knew that Jasmine would never be free of him.</p><p>Victor pointed at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deny it!\u201d</p><p>No, of course not. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault she was hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoving her, you dick,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deny loving her.\u201d</p><p>Why lie?</p><p>Victor swung away. Marched toward a wall. Banged his head against it.</p> <p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cThe holidays are gonna be a bitch,\u201d Victor muttered as his shoulders slumped.</p><p>Weren\u2019t they always? Especially since Drake spent them alone. \u201cYou\u2019re sure she\u2019s going to recover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m sure. Jazz is a fighter, always has been.\u201d He pushed away from the wall. \u201cBut you can\u2019t see her now. The cases she was working, they aren\u2019t closed, and I need her out of the public eye. I need her safe.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to just see her. He wanted to hold her. To never let go.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d be able to protect her,\u201d Drake said slowly. \u201cI was wrong. I won\u2019t be making that mistake again.\u201d</p><p>Victor laughed. \u201cHell, yeah, you will. It just won\u2019t be today.\u201d He waved toward the door. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>Drake blinked. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust like that. Sorry for the inconvenience for the last\u2014um, forty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>Drake paced toward him.</p><p>Victor held up his hands. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t like it if you kicked my ass.\u201d</p><p>Drake was so tempted...but Victor was right. \u201cMake sure she has a good life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA perfect life, got it? No worries, no fears, not ever. You give her everything that she could possibly want because if I find out her life isn\u2019t perfect, I will be back to kick the ever loving hell out of you.\u201d He held Victor\u2019s gaze to make sure that message was received, then he swung on his heel and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cI think she loves you, too.\u201d</p><p>The thunder of Drake\u2019s heartbeat filled his ears. \u201cI\u2019m not a good man to love. She\u2019s better off without me.\u201d For once, once, he\u2019d put someone else first in his life. She deserved more than a damaged guy like him.</p><p>\u201cI think so, too...\u201d Victor\u2019s murmur followed him from the room. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if Jasmine will buy that.\u201d</p><p>Drake glanced back.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we are alike,\u201d Victor added, his expression turning thoughtful.</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cAnd if it were me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to walk away from the woman I wanted more than life. Not without it ripping me apart.\u201d</p><p>Drake glared at him. How the hell do you think I\u2019m feeling right now?</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s see how long this lasts...I\u2019m betting when Jazz is free and clear, you\u2019ll run her down and never let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too. That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you...treat her well, asshole, or you\u2019ll find a knife at your back when you least expect it.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound like a warning from an FBI Agent. Instead of leaving, Drake headed back into the little room. He waited until he was a foot away from Victor. Then he growled, \u201cKeep her safe or that knife will wind up in your throat.\u201d</p><p>Instead of looking intimidated, Victor laughed. \u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>Drake glared at the fool. Then he left and with every step he took, he thought of Jasmine.</p><p>He had a feeling that she would always be in his mind. Always.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Drake wasn\u2019t looking for trouble. He wanted oblivion. He grabbed his glass and downed the whiskey in one gulp. Below him, the crowd at his club was a writhing mass. Too many bodies. Heat. Lust. Laughter.</p><p>Once upon a time, he would have looked down there and found a woman to seduce. He\u2019d have taken the pleasure to push away the numbness that seemed to fill his life.</p><p>Only he wasn\u2019t numb any longer. He ached, he hurt, every minute of the day. Because she was gone.</p><p>He should have been able to move on. He\u2019d done the right thing, the good thing, for once. Shouldn\u2019t that have meant something?</p><p>Two months. Two long, hellish months had passed. He hadn\u2019t touched another woman in that time. Drake didn\u2019t want anyone else. Only her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even know where Jasmine was. Had the FBI given her a new life somewhere else? Was she still a blonde or was she back to that sexy red?</p><p>Did she ever think of him? Because sleeping or awake, she seemed to consume him. Dreams of her were driving him to the brink of sanity. It was getting so bad that he was actually starting to imagine he saw her...</p><p>His gaze raked the crowd and locked on the figure of a slim redhead. Her back was to him, and all he could see was the soft fall of her hair\u2014and the black of her clothing. A form-fitting turtle neck and black pants.</p><p>And fuck-me heels.</p><p>His hands rose and pressed against the glass.</p><p>Can\u2019t be her. Can\u2019t be. I\u2019ve seen other redheads. Thought they were her...see her everywhere...Can\u2019t. Be. Her.</p><p>The woman got a drink from the bar, then, taking her time, she turned in her seat.</p><p>All of the breath left Drake\u2019s lungs.</p><p>She tilted back her head. Lifted her left hand. And crooked her finger up at him.</p><p>Jasmine.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be there. He\u2019d made the sacrifice. He\u2019d let her go once. There was no way that he\u2019d let her go again. She had to know that.</p><p>She smiled up at him. He couldn\u2019t see her dimples, not from that far away.</p><p>How did she know that he was even there? The glass was tinted\u2014just as it had been the first time he saw her in his club\u2014but she still seemed to stare right at him.</p><p>Trouble.</p><p>Everything he wanted.</p><p>Drake whirled away from the viewing window and rushed down to the club. He couldn\u2019t move fast enough. Couldn\u2019t get to her soon enough. And when he burst into the club and the pounding music reached his ears, he couldn\u2019t see her over the mass of bodies. He wanted those people out of his way. He wanted the only one who mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss,\u201d one of his waiters called. \u201cWhat are you doing on the floor?\u201d</p><p>Because he never came down there. Not anymore.</p><p>Not\u2014</p><p>Jasmine.</p><p>She was still at the bar. One high-heeled foot swayed softly to the music.</p><p>He shoved some drunk guys out of his way, ignored their swearing, and closed in on her. At the last moment, she turned toward him. Her eyes widened\u2014deep, dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cHello, Drake.\u201d</p><p>His hands closed around her arms. He yanked her off that barstool and up against him even as his mouth crashed down on hers.</p><p>She tasted just like he remembered. Like every dream he\u2019d ever had. Like everything he wanted but didn\u2019t deserve.</p><p>She was soft and lush against him. Fitting him perfectly. His hands snaked around her, and he held her even tighter. His tongue drove into her mouth and when she moaned and kissed him back just as frantically, he was pretty sure he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be here,\u201d he managed. You\u2019re safe. You\u2019re far away.</p><p>\u201cI am here,\u201d Jasmine whispered as her lips pulled from his. \u201cThis is exactly where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>His breath heaved out of him. The music was pounding so loudly he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d even heard her correctly. He kept her hand in his\u2014won\u2019t let go\u2014and he pulled her from that bar. Took her to his private elevator. When the doors closed, he yanked her against him again.</p><p>Desire churned within him. Too hot and hard to restrain. He should be careful. He should back away from her.</p><p>Yet he just kept pulling her closer.</p><p>The elevator dinged, and he hurried them to his room. His grip on her hand remained unbreakable. The door closed behind her, sealing them inside.</p><p>\u201cDrake\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took her mouth. Needed to. His hands flattened on either side of her head, and he tasted her. Not a dream. She\u2019s real. She\u2019s with me again.</p><p>Her hands were on his chest. Warm and soft.</p><p>He wanted to be naked.</p><p>Wanted everything with her.</p><p>He heard her moan, and it was music to his ears. She wanted him. She\u2019d come back to him.</p><p>Hanging tight to his control\u2014because he knew it would be breaking soon\u2014Drake managed to pull back, but he couldn\u2019t let her go. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t...be here.\u201d He hated the rough, ragged sound of his own voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Her dark eyes stared up at him. \u201cThat means here is the only place I want to be.\u201d</p><p>Christ. She was breaking him. \u201cI tried to do the right thing with you.\u201d His hand slid down her body. Carefully, so very carefully, and he remembered her blood pumping between his fingers. \u201cI wanted to keep you safe before, but I\u2019m the one who took you straight to Maxwell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Drake. You\u2019re the one who saved me.\u201d</p><p>How could she believe that? How could she look up at him with those eyes that seemed to see straight through him? She should see him for what he was\u2014and then run screaming.</p><p>But I can\u2019t let her go now.</p><p>\u201cI walked away once, how am I supposed to do it again?\u201d Victor should have kept her away.</p><p>Jasmine shook her head, sending her red hair brushing over her cheeks. \u201cYou don\u2019t walk away again. Neither do I. My cases are closed, and I\u2019m free.\u201d She licked her lips and arousal knifed through him. \u201cI want to be with you. And I-I hope you still want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly every damn minute.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled into a smile.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to be careful,\u201d Drake warned her. \u201cYou have to know...I can\u2019t have you again and let you go.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the way he worked. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d</p><p>Her hands rose. Curled around his neck. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t have stayed away for so long. I\u2019m not afraid of you, Drake Archer.\u201d</p><p>Why not? He\u2019d nearly cut out a man\u2019s heart in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you. Not of any enemies that you have. What I am afraid of...I\u2019m afraid of being without you. Because that\u2019s not how I want to live. That\u2019s not how I can live. I need you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her words rocked right to his core.</p><p>And sealed her fate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Drake managed to say, the words gravel-rough and final.</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cI tried to be good, but, now princess, it\u2019s too late.\u201d He lifted her up, using so much care, and he sat her on the edge of his desk.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d</p><p>He stripped her. Tossed her clothes away. Kept that stranglehold on his lust.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d Drake said again as his fingers trailed up her bare thigh. \u201cI can\u2019t ever let you go now. You came back...that was your mistake...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a mistake. Not...ah...I missed you...\u201d</p><p>His fingers were between her legs. He was going to use care with her, even if it killed him, but he had to get inside of her. Because then maybe the terrible ache he felt would end.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Or maybe it never would vanish because Drake would never forget the fear he\u2019d felt when he thought that he\u2019d lost her.</p><p>She was already wet for him.</p><p>He was burning alive for her.</p><p>Drake pulled her to the edge of the desk. Her legs rose around him. She smiled.</p><p>He was lost.</p><p>He damn near ripped his clothes away, then Drake pushed into her, locking all of his muscles because he wanted to drive deep and take and take and take.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. Slowly, inch by inch, he filled her. Sweat broke out on his brow as he held to his control. Then he was sheathed fully inside of her. As close to heaven as he\u2019d ever get.</p><p>He pulled back. Thrust again, slowly, so slowly.</p><p>\u201cDrake!\u201d</p><p>She tried to push against him. He curled his fingers around her hips and held her there. He\u2019d give her pleasure. As much as she could handle. And she\u2019d never leave him.</p><p>Never.</p><p>He kept one hand on her hip, and his other slid between their bodies. Her eyes were on his. Her face flushed. Her breath panting.</p><p>Wet. Tight. Hot.</p><p>He strummed her clit. Worked her with slow touches and took her with long thrusts. Her breath panted out even faster. She choked out his name.</p><p>When she came, he felt the contraction of her delicate muscles all along his cock. That silken caress drove him over the edge and his own release pounded through him. He grabbed for the desk in that frantic moment, because he didn\u2019t want to hold her too fiercely. He nearly broke the desk as the climax churned through his body. Hot. Intense. The fucking best release of his life. The pleasure left him shuddering. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But not sated. Not done. He could never be done with her. They were just getting started.</p><p>\u201cDrake, let me stay with you.\u201d</p><p>Let her stay? His head lifted. He could taste her. \u201cI told you, princess, you made a mistake. My life\u2019s not worth living without you. I can\u2019t let you go again.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her once more.</p><p>\u201cAnd even if I have to fight Noah, Saxon and that jerk Victor, I want you at my side. Always.\u201d He\u2019d fight every enemy that he had\u2014anyone who tried to keep him from her.</p><p>Her lips lifted in the smile that had first twisted his heart. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about Noah. He\u2019s the one who told me where you were.\u201d</p><p>Well, well...thanks, buddy.</p><p>\u201cAs for Saxon and Victor, they are my family, but they know you are, too.\u201d</p> <p>He was?</p><p>\u201cNo one will stand between us,\u201d she promised him. \u201cThere will never be anything between us again.\u201d</p><p>His chest wasn\u2019t aching anymore. He didn\u2019t hurt. But... \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d That was his fear.</p><p>\u201cThen love me, Drake. Love me forever and you never will.\u201d</p><p>So easy. \u201cI already do.\u201d He loved her more than life. \u201cAnd I always will.\u201d</p><p>Her dimples flashed then, and her smile was the most beautiful sight he\u2019d ever seen.</p> <p>Trouble.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d found it\u2014and he was so glad that he had. </p> </body></html>"]
