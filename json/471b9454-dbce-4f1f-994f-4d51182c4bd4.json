It\u2019s not as painful as it used to be, but there are still raw memories linked to it that will haunt me forever.</p><p>The sky is cloudy and the gentle breeze kisses my skin. I zip my jacket up as I gaze out at the dark water, lost in my thoughts of that terrible night when I considered jumping.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d Micha asks, the same question he\u2019s been asking for the last few days. His knuckles turn white as he clutches onto the railing of the bridge and peers down at the lake. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot this weekend.\u201d</p><p>I wince at the recollection of my dad\u2019s angry voice when he told me he wished I wasn\u2019t his daughter, when Dean and I had confronted him about his alcoholism. Cruel words were shouted that ripped at my heart. I keep trying to convince myself that it\u2019s the addiction talking, not him, but I don\u2019t entirely believe it. My body and mind are exhausted from the drama, but I\u2019ll push through, just like I did the last time. There is no running away anymore, only dealing with it and eventually moving on.</p><p>Micha doesn\u2019t know the entire story of what happened and I want to save him from the burden. He worries about me all the time and the guilt consumes me. He should be happy, love life, do what he wants to do. He deserves it.</p><p>I frown, hating that when we walk off the bridge, he\u2019ll leave me to return to the road with his band. \u201cI\u2019m a little sad you have to go.\u201d</p><p>He releases the metal railing and his aqua eyes sparkle as he hugs me. I bury my face into his chest and breathe him in, never wanting to let him go.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Ella May.\u201d He kisses the top of my head.</p><p>I shut my eyes and suck back the tears. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He presses his full lips to mine and kisses me passionately, his lip ring digging into my mouth. My skin warms as his hands explore my back and his fingers graze across my ass, begging my body closer to his. I tangle my fingers through his soft hair before securing my arms around the back of his neck. His tongue traces the inside of my mouth and he intensifies the kiss until we have to pull away to catch our breath.</p><p>My chest heaves as I gaze out at the lake one last time and the sun reflects in the water. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. We have the whole twelve-hour drive ahead of us, and I\u2019ll be gone for only a couple weeks before I\u2019m annoying the hell out of you again.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile. \u201cI know and I\u2019m looking forward to being annoyed.\u201d</p> <p>We walk hand in hand back to Lila\u2019s black Mercedes. I let him drive and he flies down the dirt road, leaving a cloud of dust behind us that quickly vanishes.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Two months later</p><p>Ella</p><p>Every night I have the same dream. Micha and I are standing on opposite ends of the bridge. Rain beats down violently from the dark sky and the wind kicks up debris between us.</p><p>Micha extends his hand and I walk toward him, but he slips away from me until he lands up on the railing of the bridge. He teeters in the wind and I want to save him, but my feet won\u2019t budge. A gust of wind slams into him and he falls backward, vanishing into the darkness. I wake up screaming and full of guilt.</p><p>My therapist has a theory that the nightmare signifies my fear of losing Micha, although that doesn\u2019t explain why I won\u2019t save him. When she mentioned it, my heart sped up and my palms began to sweat. I never looked far enough into the future to realize that maybe one day Micha and I may not be together.</p><p>A forever? Does such a thing exist?</p> <p>With as much time as we spend together I wonder where our relationship is going. The last time we saw each other was at Grady\u2019s funeral. It was the second toughest day of my life; the first being my mother\u2019s funeral.</p><p>Micha and I had been out on the cliff that overlooked the lake, with a black jar containing Grady\u2019s ashes. The wind was blowing and all I could think about was how much death owned life. At any moment death could snatch up life and take it away, just like it had done with my mom and Grady.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d Micha had asked, removing the lid from the jar.</p><p>Nodding, I extended my hand toward the jar. \u201cI\u2019m as ready as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>From behind us, the car was running and playing Grady\u2019s favorite song, \u201cSimple Man\u201d by Lynyrd Skynyrd, a song that fit Grady and his lifestyle perfectly.</p><p>He moved the jar toward me and we held onto it together. \u201cWhat\u2019s that thing he used to say all the time?\u201d Micha asked me. \u201cAbout life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t as important to feel great about all the things we do,\u201d I say softly. \u201cBut how we feel toward the end when we look back at everything we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed from my eyes as we tipped the jar sideways and spilled the ashes off the cliff. As we watched them float down to the lake, Micha wrapped his arm around me and took a shot of tequila. He had offered me a sip, but I had declined.</p><p>My insides shook as pain rushed through me, but I quickly repressed it. Though sunlight sparkled down on us, there was a chill in the air as I observed the lake that seemed to hold everything. It was connected to so many deep, painful memories of my past with my mom and myself.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Ella.\u201d Lila waves her hand in front of my face and I flinch. \u201cYou seriously space off more than anyone else I know. Class got out like five minutes ago... What the heck is that drawing of? It\u2019s creepy.\u201d</p><p>Drawn back to the present, my gaze sweeps across the empty desks in the classroom and then falls on the pen in my hand, the tip pressed to a sketch of my face, only my eyes are black and my skin looks like dry, cracked dirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d I stuff the drawing into my bag and grab my books. Sometimes I lose track of time and it\u2019s unsettling, because so did my mother. \u201cIt\u2019s just a doodle I was messing around with during Professor Mackman\u2019s boring lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with you? You\u2019ve been like super spaced out and super grumpy,\u201d Lila asks as we walk out of the classroom and push out the doors, stepping into the sunlight.</p><p>I adjust my bag on my shoulder and pull my sunglasses down over my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>She stops abruptly in the middle of the sidewalk, narrows her blue eyes at me, and puts her hands on her hips. \u201cDon\u2019t shut down on me now. We\u2019ve been doing so well.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, because she\u2019s right. \u201cIt\u2019s just this dream I\u2019ve been having.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Micha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>She elevates her eyebrows. \u201cHow could I not guess? All of your thoughts are about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of my thoughts.\u201d I dwell in my thoughts about my dad, who\u2019s in rehab and how he won\u2019t talk to me.</p><p>We stroll down the sidewalk and she links arms with me. There\u2019s a skip to her walk, and her pink dress and blonde hair blow in the gentle fall breeze. About a year ago, Lila and I looked very similar, but then Micha cracked through my shell and I opted for a happy medium. I\u2019m wearing a black Spill Canvas T-shirt and a pair of jeans, and my long auburn hair hangs loosely around my face.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we have lunch?\u201d she asks as we reach the edge of the parking lot. \u201cBecause our fridge is empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to go shopping.\u201d I scoot over as a group of football players walk by in their scarlet and gray uniforms. \u201cBut we also need a car to go anywhere, since you won\u2019t take the bus anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because of that creeper who licked my arm,\u201d she says, cringing. \u201cIt was disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty gross,\u201d I agree, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s such a jerk,\u201d Lila mutters with a frown. \u201cHe should have at least warned me when he decided to tow my car back home. It makes no sense. He doesn\u2019t want me there, yet he takes my car away because I ran out during the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDads tend to be jerks.\u201d At the end of the sidewalk, I veer to the left. \u201cMine won\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should make a Dads Suck Club,\u201d she suggests sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of people would join.\u201d</p><p>I strain a smile. I don\u2019t blame my dad for his negative feelings toward me. It was my choice to leave that night my mom died and now I have to deal with the consequences\u2014it\u2019s part of moving on.</p><p>I stay under the shade of the trees as we head up the sidewalk toward the side section of the school. \u201cLet\u2019s just eat at the cafeteria. It\u2019s the easiest place to get to.\u201d</p><p>Her nose scrunches. \u201cEasy, in the sense that it\u2019s close. But other than that there is nothing easy about...\u201d She trails off as her eyes stray to the side of the campus and a conniving smile expands across her face \u201cHere\u2019s an idea. You could ask Blake to give us a ride somewhere.\u201d</p><p>I spot Blake walking across the campus yard toward his car. He is in my water base media class and talks to me a lot. Lila insists it\u2019s because he has a thing for me, but I disagree.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to just go up and ask him for a ride.\u201d I tug on her arm. \u201cLet\u2019s just eat in the cafeteria\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Blake!\u201d she hollers, waving her arms in the air, then giggles under her breath.</p><p>Blake\u2019s brown eyes scan the campus and a smile expands across his face as he struts across the lawn toward us.</p><p>\u201cHe knows I have a boyfriend,\u201d I tell Lila. \u201cHe\u2019s just nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys are hardly ever just nice, and I\u2019m using his little crush on you to get us a ride out of here,\u201d Lila whispers. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of being stuck here.\u201d</p><p>My lips part in protest, but Blake reaches us, and I cinch my jaw shut.</p><p>He has a beanie over his dark-brown hair and blue paint spots dot the front of his faded jeans and the bottom of his tan T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up? His thumb is hooked on to the handle of the ratty backpack slung over his shoulder and he looks at me like I\u2019m the one who called him over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019re almost the same height and I can easily look him directly in the eyes. \u201cIt was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a ride.\u201d Lila flutters her eyelashes at him as she coils a lock of her hair around her finger. \u201cTo get some lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take us,\u201d I intervene. \u201cLila just really needs an off-campus fix.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to take you anywhere you need to go,\u201d he offers with a genuine smile. \u201cI\u2019m headed back to my apartment first, though, so if you don\u2019t mind stopping you can just come with me now.\u201d</p><p>From inside my pocket, my phone starts ringing the tune \u201cBehind Blue Eyes\u201d by The Who and my lips curve into a grin.</p><p>Lila rolls her eyes. \u201cOh dear God. I thought you would have been over your giddiness by now. You two have been together for almost three months.\u201d</p><p>I answer the phone, loving the flutters in my stomach that are caused from just hearing the song play. It reminds me of how his hands feel against my skin and how he calls me by my nickname.</p><p>\u201cHello, beautiful,\u201d he says charmingly and the sound of his voice sends a quiver through my body. \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite girl in the world?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, hello to you too.\u201d I amble toward a leafy tree in the center of the lawn. \u201cI\u2019m doing great. Are you having a good day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d He uses his player\u2019s voice on me. \u201cI\u2019ll have an even better day if you\u2019ll tell me what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeans and a ratty T-shirt.\u201d I press back a smile.</p><p>\u201cCome on, pretty girl, it\u2019s been like a month.\u201d He laughs into the phone, a deep noise that makes my insides vibrate. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re wearing underneath it.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, but tolerate him. \u201cA red, lacy thong and matching bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really nice mental picture you painted there,\u201d he growls in a husky voice. \u201cNow I\u2019ll have something to help take care of myself later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust as long as you\u2019re taking care of it yourself,\u201d I say and there\u2019s a drawn-out pause. \u201cMicha, are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019d never do that to you, right?\u201d His tone carries heaviness. \u201cI love you way too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just joking.\u201d Kind of. Lately, it\u2019s been bothering me that he spends so much time with Naomi, especially because a lot of his stories involve her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you always joke about it every time we talk and I worry that deep down you believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I insist, although the thought has crossed my mind. He\u2019s a lead singer in a band. And gorgeous. And charming. \u201cI know you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I have something to tell you.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWe got the gig.\u201d</p><p>My mouth instantly sinks. \u201cThe one in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome... I\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d</p><p>Silence takes over. I want to say something, but the sadness has stolen my voice so I stare across the campus at a couple walking and holding hands, thinking about what it\u2019s like to have that.</p><p>\u201cElla May, tell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d he demands. \u201cAre you worried about my being gone? Because you know you\u2019re the only girl for me. Or is it... is it Grady? How are you doing with that? I never know since you won\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Grady,\u201d I say quickly, wanting to get off that subject. \u201cIt\u2019s just that... it\u2019s so far and I barely get to see you as it is.\u201d I slump back against a tree trunk. \u201cYou\u2019re still coming up here this weekend, right?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a gradual breath. \u201cThe thing is, to make it to New York in time, we have to leave tomorrow morning. And I\u2019d drive over there tonight, just to see you, but we have a performance.\u201d</p><p>My insides wind into knots, but I stay calm on the outside. \u201cHow long are you going to be gone to New York?\u201d</p><p>He takes a second to answer. \u201cAbout a month.\u201d</p><p>My hand trembles with anger or fear... I\u2019m not sure. \u201cSo I haven\u2019t seen you in almost a month and I\u2019m not going to be able to see you for another month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come visit me in New York,\u201d he proposes. \u201cYou could fly out for, like, a week or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have midterms.\u201d My voice is sullen. \u201cAnd my brother\u2019s wedding\u2019s in, like, a month and all my extra money is to pay for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla, come on!\u201d Lila shouts and my eyes dart to her. She motions me to come over, while Blake stands beside her with his hands stuffed into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cBlake\u2019s waiting on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Blake?\u201d Micha wonders curiously.</p><p>\u201cJust a guy from my class,\u201d I explain, leaving the tree and heading toward Blake and Lila. \u201cLook, I got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Lila\u2019s just waiting on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay... I\u2019ll call you after my performance then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d I hang up the phone, realizing I forgot to say good-bye, but the word wouldn\u2019t have left my mouth anyway. It feels like we\u2019re slipping away from each other, and he was the one thing that brought me back out of my dark place. If he leaves me, I\u2019m not sure I can hold onto the light.</p><p>Micha</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I hang up the phone and kick the tire of the band\u2019s SUV, which is in the middle of a parking lot of a shitty-ass motel in the bad side of town where crackheads walk the streets and every building has graffiti. It makes Star Grove look classy.</p><p>The sadness in Ella\u2019s voice worries me. She\u2019s still struggling with her personal demons, Grady\u2019s death, her mom\u2019s death, and won\u2019t completely open up to me about everything. There\u2019s always a thought in the back of my mind that she might vanish again.</p><p>A car backfires as I walk back to the motel room. On the stairway, I weave around a man making out with a woman who\u2019s probably a hooker to get to my door.</p><p>This is what I\u2019m choosing over Ella? Sometimes I wonder why.</p><p>\u201cWow, you look like you\u2019re in a pissy mood,\u201d Naomi remarks from the bed when I slam the door of the motel room. She\u2019s painting her toenails and the room stinks like paint thinner. \u201cDid you have a bad day?\u201d</p><p>Clearing my throat, I empty out the change from the pocket of my jeans and drop my wallet down on the nightstand. \u201cWhat gave it away? The door slam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hilarious.\u201d She sits up and blows on her nails. \u201cWhat did Ella say to you this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d I unzip my duffel bag that\u2019s on a chair between the television and the table. \u201cShe never does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d Naomi likes to put her two cents in on everything and sometimes it gets on my nerves. \u201cThat she doesn\u2019t tell you how she feels.\u201d</p><p>I grab a pair of clean jeans and a black, long-sleeved shirt from the bag. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do when you\u2019re drunk.\u201d She smirks. \u201cIn fact, I can\u2019t get you to shut up when you\u2019re wasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to you about stuff once.\u201d I walk backward toward the bathroom. \u201cAnd I was having a really shitty day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you miss her.\u201d She clips bracelets around her wrists. \u201cHere\u2019s a thought. Why don\u2019t you just bring her on the road with us?\u201d</p><p>I pause in the doorway. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan, Chase and I have been talking and we think maybe you\u2019d be a little bit more...\u201d\u2014she hesitates\u2014\u201cpleasant to be around if she was here.\u201d</p><p>I cock an eyebrow. \u201cAm I that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d She gets up and slips on her shoes. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re the same as when Ella disappeared for eight months, only sometimes it\u2019s worse. You\u2019re always so down and you hardly ever go out with us.\u201d</p><p>I rub my face with my hand, taking in what she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve been acting like a douche bag, but I can\u2019t ask Ella to come with us.\u201d</p><p>Naomi grabs the keycard from the dresser and puts it into the back pocket of her jeans. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s happy,\u201d I say, recalling the many times she chatted to me about her classes and life in an upbeat tone that made me smile. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t ask her to give that up, even though I\u2019d love to have her here.\u201d</p><p>Naomi shrugs and opens the door, letting in the sunlight and warm air that smells like cigarettes. \u201cIt\u2019s your decision. I was just giving you an outsider\u2019s point of view. Do you want to come out with us tonight? Drinks are on Dylan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I think I\u2019ll stay in tonight.\u201d I wave her off and she leaves, closing the door behind her.</p><p>I pile my clothes in the stained bathroom sink and turn on the shower. The pipes squeak as the water sprays out. Raking my hands through my hair, I let out a frustrated sigh. My fingers grip the counter and my head falls forward.</p><p>My mom told me once about how she met my father. He lived in the town over from Star Grove and one day when they were both cruising, they ran into each other. Literally. The front end of my dad\u2019s truck slammed into the back end of my mom\u2019s car. Her car was trashed, but they ended up talking for hours after the tow truck had come and gone and my dad had offered to drive my mom home.</p><p>She said it was instant love, or at least that\u2019s how she interpreted it in her hormonal teenaged brain. She was supposed to be leaving for college at the end of the summer, but she stayed behind and married my dad instead.</p><p>She said she regretted the decision, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because my dad turned out to be a cheating dick, or if she was just sad over the loss of her future.</p><p>I push away from the counter, coming to the conclusion to let it go for now. Ella and I are tough enough to make it through a month. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We already made it through hell and back.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Ella</p> <p>Blake gives us a ride to lunch and then drops us off back at campus about an hour later.

She says bottling things up and letting them eat away at me usually ends in disaster; that suffering in silence is never an option.</p><p>Lila hops out of the back of the car when Blake pulls into an empty parking space. \u201cThanks for the ride, Blake.\u201d She shuts the door and shimmies off toward the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Blake asks me as I unbuckle my seatbelt. \u201cYou seem kind of quiet today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I start to open the door. \u201cI just have a lot on my mind.\u201d</p><p>Pulling the beanie off his head and ruffling his hair, he rotates in his seat to face me. \u201cI\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p> <p>I eye him over warily. \u201cI\u2019m sure you probably don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His eyebrows arch upward. \u201cThe infamous Micha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the one,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s leaving... clear across the country.\u201d</p><p>He wiggles the keys out of the ignition. \u201cAnd you\u2019re upset about this, I take it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, obviously. He\u2019s leaving and he was supposed to drive out here from LA this weekend.\u201d The more I talk about it aloud, the more panic chokes at my chest. \u201cBut now he has to drive out to New York tomorrow. I have no idea why I\u2019m telling you this. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I climb out of the car and close the door.</p><p>He meets me at the front of the car, swings his bag over his shoulder, and pushes the lock button, the headlights blinking. We walk in silence toward the grass area that stretches over the front of the campus. Lila is underneath a tree talking to Parker, a tall guy with thick arms and sandy blond hair. He\u2019s wearing a button-down shirt and a pair of fancy jeans. It\u2019s her type of guy normally, except for Ethan. The two of them occasionally talk on the phone, although they still insist they\u2019re just friends.</p><p>\u201cThanks for taking us to lunch.\u201d I step up onto the curb. \u201cI\u2019m sure Lila\u2019s thankful too. She\u2019s been going crazy being stuck on campus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d He stuffs his hands into his pockets with a pensive look on his face. \u201cSo your boyfriend\u2019s in LA right now?\u201d</p><p>I nod unenthusiastically. \u201cUntil tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He mulls over something, gazing at the parking lot. \u201cYou know that\u2019s only, like, a four-, four-and-a-half-hour drive from here. You could probably make it there later tonight if you left soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I force back a smile, knowing I could make it there in less time than that. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have a car.\u201d I point over my shoulder at his red Ford Mustang. \u201cHence the ride this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>An amused smile tugs at the corners of his lips. \u201cI know, but I have a car that could get you there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d I ask, shocked.</p><p>He shrugs, scuffing his shoes against the sidewalk. \u201cBecause I know how hard it is to be away from the person you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you for real?\u201d I ask, and he nods. \u201cLet me get this straight. You\u2019re going to let me borrow your car and drive it out of the state, so I can see my boyfriend for, like, a night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I was going to take you,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cMy girlfriend lives in Riverside and you could drop me off and pick me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend?\u201d I sputter out a laugh. \u201cOh my God, you have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He tilts his head to the side with a mystified expression. \u201cAm I that repulsive?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head swiftly. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that... Well, Lila thought you had a thing for me and that\u2019s why you talk to me all the time.\u201d</p><p>He tugs his beanie onto his head, pressing his lips together to suppress a laugh. \u201cOh, I see. Your friend\u2019s... interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nice, though,\u201d I tell him, glancing over at Lila, who\u2019s running her fingers up and down Parker\u2019s arm. \u201cI love Lila to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd for the record, I talk to you because you\u2019re an interesting person. You remind me a lot of my friends back home.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m curious what his friends are like back home. \u201cAre you sure you want to take me? Because you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d He tucks the car keys into the back pocket of his jeans. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it just to keep that happy look on your face. You don\u2019t smile very much.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop smiling. \u201cWell, thank you. It means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go grab your stuff and we can meet back here in, like, an hour.\u201d He backs down the sidewalk as I hike across the grass toward Lila.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I call over my shoulder. \u201cAnd thanks again.\u201d</p><p>By the time I reach Lila, she\u2019s writing her phone number on Parker\u2019s hand with a red pen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going on a road trip,\u201d I announce, interrupting the conversation.</p><p>Parker gives me a once-over and then dismisses me with his eyes. \u201cSo I\u2019ll call you later then?\u201d he asks Lila.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d She waves at him and he struts toward the main entrance of the campus, high-fiving another guy standing beneath the canopy in front of the doors.</p><p>\u201cWhere and why are we going on a road trip?\u201d Lila clicks the cap back on the pen and drops it into her bag.</p><p>My stomach flips, thinking about how I\u2019m going to see Micha in just hours. \u201cTo LA. Blake is giving us a ride. And before you say anything, he has a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he does,\u201d Lila says cynically. \u201cAnd he also really loves her and would never do anything to hurt her. Typical guy cop-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat... Are you okay?\u201d I\u2019ve never heard her say anything like this before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she swears, shrugging it off. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s a slow driver and when I ask him what he has under the hood, he has no idea. I try not to give him too much crap about it, but a few sarcastic remarks slip out.</p><p>\u201cAw, you like cars.\u201d He merges the car back into the slower traffic lane.</p><p>From the backseat, Lila snort-laughs. \u201cLikes them. The girl\u2019s insane about them. It\u2019s actually kind of annoying.\u201d She shoots me a grin and I flip her the middle finger.</p><p>\u201cIs it just old cars?\u201d He makes a careful turn down the off-ramp. \u201cOr is it cars in general?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast cars.\u201d Like Micha\u2019s poor Chevelle lying in pieces in his garage back home. May it rest in peace. \u201cOne\u2019s that will kick ass in a race.\u201d</p><p>He cuts me a sideways glance. \u201cNow I\u2019m starting to get concerned about letting you borrow my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t race it.\u201d I cross my heart with my finger. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll be easy on it.\u201d</p><p>He winks at me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I trust you.\u201d</p><p>The way he says it makes me uncomfortable and Lila gives me a knowing look in the rearview mirror.</p><p>We keep quiet for most of the drive. Blake doesn\u2019t have the air on and the black leather seats get hot and stick to the back of my legs. When we pull up to his girlfriend\u2019s house, which is in the suburbs where every house and yard looks similar, I\u2019m sweating.</p><p>His girlfriend runs out of the house and throws her arms around him, nearly knocking him to the ground. She\u2019s petite with red streaks in her hair and a piercing through her nose. She waves at us and then Blake backtracks to the trunk. Maneuvering over the console and into the driver\u2019s seat, I pop the handle and he gets his suitcase out, before shutting it.</p><p>He walks around to the driver\u2019s-side window and waits for me to roll it down.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he reminds me in a serious tone and I nod.</p><p>Flashing me a grin, he heads off to the house as Lila dives over the console and into the front seat.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she says in a low, mocking voice. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be so sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t sound like that.\u201d I pull out onto the street.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes you see too much.\u201d</p><p>I merge out onto the freeway and into the fast lane, but resist the urge to punch the pedal to the floor and get us there in half the time. Lila takes a nap with her head resting against the window and I bask in the peace of being on the road until we brink the edge of town, which glows against the night.</p><p>I nudge Lila\u2019s shoulder to wake her up. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She blinks her weary eyes and sits up in the seat. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Where are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in LA. Or on the outskirts of it anyway,\u201d I say as her eyes sweep the towering buildings and the considerable amount of traffic in front of us. \u201cCan you look up the address on your phone?\u201d</p><p>She cracks her window, letting the warm air blow in. \u201cCan\u2019t you just call him and tell him you\u2019re coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you trying to catch him doing something wrong, like, say, with Naomi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I flip on the blinker and check my mirror. \u201cI trust Micha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t trust her.\u201d A large truck honks its horn and Lila glances out the window. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. From the stories you\u2019ve told me, she seems a little sketchy. In fact, maybe while we\u2019re here, we could have a little talk with her.\u201d She pops her knuckles and I bust up laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, what have you been watching?\u201d Tapping the brakes, I slow down the car to match the traffic.</p><p>\u201cHow to beat the girl who\u2019s hitting on your best friend\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d She grins at me and retrieves the phone out of her purse. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the place?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Slam,\u201d I tell her and she arcs her eyebrows. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what it\u2019s called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s not called The Slam-er?\u201d She laughs cleverly.</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cHa-ha. You\u2019re so funny.\u201d</p> <p>She enters the location into the GPS and frowns at the long line of cars in front of us. \u201cIt says it\u2019s like five miles into town... It\u2019s going to take forever.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrow on the road as the traffic crawls forward. \u201cNo, it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Lila stabs a finger at me, reeling in her seat. \u201cYou promised Blake you wouldn\u2019t race his car.\u201d</p><p>I down shift and the engine purrs to life. \u201cI\u2019m not going to race it. I\u2019m just going to shoot the gaps.\u201d</p><p>She secures her seatbelt over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know what that means, but I swear to God, if we end up driving into the median, I\u2019ll never talk to you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cO ye of little faith.\u201d I rev up the RPMs and swerve over to the next lane, cutting off a red Camry. The driver honks the horn and Lila grips the edge of the leather seat. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve seen you drive this crazy before, right?\u201d</p><p>She glares at me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m okay when I\u2019m the driver and know I have control of the situation.\u201d I flinch at her words and she adds, \u201cIt gives me a sense of safety.\u201d</p><p>I loathe hearing the word \u201ccontrol.\u201d It reminds me of how much my mind craves it. It\u2019s sort of like an addiction, like alcohol or cigarettes.</p><p>I hit the brakes as the front of the car verges on the back end of a lifted truck. There\u2019s a tiny gap over to the next lane and I debate if it\u2019s doable.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Lila warns with fear in her blue eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s too narrow.\u201d</p><p>The guy in the side lane slows down and I redline the RPMs, crank the wheel at the last second, and squeeze us over easily.</p> <p>Lila huffs out a breath as she slumps back in the seat. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t love you so much, I\u2019d totally hate you.\u201d She fusses with her blonde hair and wipes some smeared eyeliner out from underneath her eyes.</p><p>I continue dodging in and out of traffic until we reach the exit. Driving like this makes me feel alive and by the time we reach the club Micha is playing at, adrenaline is coursing through my body.</p><p>\u201cThis place looks sketchy.\u201d Lila crinkles her nose at the warehouse nestled between Larry\u2019s Biker Bar and The Adult Video Store. It\u2019s late, and the stars and moon light up the dry leaves and cigarette butts on the asphalt.</p><p>\u201cYou said that about Star Grove too.\u201d I kick open the door and step outside. \u201cAnd you survived that place.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes as she climbs out of the car. \u201cStar Grove doesn\u2019t look nearly as bad as this place.\u201d</p><p>We head across the parking lot, walking close to each other when a group of guys smoking behind a truck make catcalls.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe Blake let me borrow his car.\u201d I jump over a pothole. \u201cIf I owned a Mustang, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t lend it out to someone I barely knew, especially after I told him I like to race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019s because he likes you.\u201d She elbows me as we turn down the alley that leads to the front entrance of the club. \u201cI have an eye for these things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has a girlfriend, Lila. And it seemed like they really love each other.\u201d I sidestep a Dumpster and emerge onto the busy sidewalk. Cars drive up and down the road and bright graffiti decorates the metal exterior of the neighboring buildings.</p><p>Pausing in front of the entrance, I pull my hair out of the ponytail and it falls to my shoulders. Letting go of Lila\u2019s arm, I quickly tie the lace of my boot, then unfasten two of the top buttons on my plaid shirt and smooth out the wrinkles on my denim skirt.</p><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019ve never seen you this fussy before,\u201d Lila comments as she refastens the ribbon lacing up the front of her maroon shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s very entertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I suddenly feel really nervous,\u201d I admit, tousling my hair with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you love him.\u201d Lila bats her eyelashes and I shove her gently. \u201cRelax. It\u2019s because you haven\u2019t seen him for, like, a month. Honestly, I\u2019m a little afraid to be in the same room as you two. You\u2019ll probably have your clothes off and on the floor in a matter of seconds.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I enter the club where a bouncer with snake tattoos on his muscular arms and a scar on his lip blocks the path to the table area.</p><p>\u201cIDs please.\u201d His tone suggests we don\u2019t have them.</p><p>Lila and I take our fake IDs out of our pockets and hand them to him. He evaluates them carefully and gives them back to us, stepping aside to let us through.</p><p>We walk into an open room filled with tables and chairs. The air is musty, the bar is crammed with people, and the music is loud, but the sound of the singer\u2019s voice is more familiar than the beat of my heart.</p><p>\u201cAw, look at him up there all hot and sexy,\u201d Lila says, but I barely hear her.</p><p>All of my concentration focuses on the stage near the far back wall. Beneath the low lighting, Micha sings one of his own songs, playing the guitar with his head tipped down and his hair hanging in his sparkling aqua eyes. My hands ache to touch him, tangle through his hair, feel the softness of his lips.</p><p>The band plays in the background and it takes my breath away as his lyrics flow over my body.</p><p>The silence in your eyes is more than I can take.</p><p>Look at me for once and see how my heart aches.</p><p>You keep me alive. You keep me breathing.</p><p>All I want, all I need is you.</p><p>The room blends away and it\u2019s just him and me. I hear Lila move away from me, probably heading to the bar to order a drink. It takes Micha only seconds to find me in the middle of the crowded room, like our hearts sense each other. He tries to maintain a straight face as he spills out the lyrics, but a trace of a smile reveals at his lips.</p><p>He finishes out the last set with a final chord, and then quickly turns to Naomi, who\u2019s wearing a tight black dress and knee-high boots. Micha says something to her as he hands her the guitar. She nods, tucking her black hair behind her ear, and he hops off stage, and his long legs stride for me as he shoves through the crowd. He doesn\u2019t slow down until he scoops me up in his arms, not caring that there are a ton of people watching us.</p><p>I fasten my legs around his waist and he kisses me intensely, stealing every ounce of oxygen from my lungs. Our bodies and tongues conform together, and the heat of him sears my skin. His lip ring scores into my bottom lip, but I want more. Begging him closer, I breathe him in, tasting him, wanting to feel him as much as possible before we part again.</p><p>When he leans back, a fire flares deep inside his aqua eyes and my stomach somersaults with excitement.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019ve missed you, pretty girl.\u201d He kisses me again and his hands wander all over my body. Reluctantly, he pulls away, breathless. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but what are you doing here? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing\u2019s wrong. Lila said I needed to come see you before you left.\u201d I trace my fingers along the back of his neck and he shivers from my touch. \u201cShe said that she was sick of my bad attitude and that I needed to get you out of my system, at least for a day or so.\u201d</p><p>He bites at his lip, stifling a smile. \u201cYou know you could never get me out of your system. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I can try,\u201d I tease. \u201cIn fact, I could try a lot.\u201d</p><p>A naughty look dances in his eyes. \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>He moves in for another kiss, deliberately this time, but with equally as much passion as all our kisses. \u201cI have two more songs to play and then you and I can leave.\u201d</p><p>I blink dazedly. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a breathy laugh as he presses up against me. \u201cFirst things first. We\u2019re going to go back to the hotel and take care of some much needed business.\u201d</p><p>I try not to smile, but it\u2019s impossible. \u201cAnd then what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go out and do something fun,\u201d he promises, setting me back on the floor. He kisses my forehead, and then moves back through the crowd to the stage.</p><p>I find Lila at the bar and plop down in a barstool next to her. My gaze locks on Micha on stage as he starts to play a cover of his sad-turned-happy song\u2014our song, as he tells me all the time.</p><p>\u201cOh thank God.\u201d Lila stirs the red fruity drink in her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re happy again.\u201d</p><p>Forcing my lips together, I suffocate my giddiness, but eventually it surfaces. It\u2019s terrifying, feeling this way. I didn\u2019t realize how down I was until now.</p><p>Micha</p><p>It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been excited to be done performing. I can\u2019t wait to get out of the club and take her back to the room. The entire time I\u2019m singing, my eyes are fixed on her. Deep down, I\u2019m singing only to her.</p><p>When I finish, the band clears the stage. I hold up a finger at Ella, letting her know I\u2019ll be a second, and then go into the room where our instruments are.</p><p>\u201cSomeone got a nice surprise,\u201d Naomi comments as she pulls her long, black hair up into a bun and glances at herself in the cracked mirror on the wall. \u201cLooks like you won\u2019t be going out with the band tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll come out with you.\u201d I put my guitar into the case and clip the locks. \u201cBut I\u2019m going back to the hotel room first and you guys might want to steer clear of it for a while.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and Dylan, our drummer, lifts up his hand to give me a high-five. Dylan likes to call himself \u201cThe Ladies Man\u201d and spends a lot of time bragging about his hookups while we\u2019re on the road. It\u2019s annoying as shit and I dismiss his high-five.</p><p>\u201cTake my guitar with you and I\u2019ll text you later.\u201d I hand Naomi the case and walk backward for the door. \u201cOh yeah, and would you mind if Ella\u2019s friend hung out with you guys for a while?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shrugs as she puts on some red lipstick. \u201cI guess... but is it that blonde one?

They\u2019re talking about something and Ella\u2019s got a huge smile on her face.</p><p>Interrupting the conversation, I squeeze between them and press my lips to hers, giving her a deep kiss. When I draw back, her eyes are big and glassy and I love that I\u2019m the one who put the look on her face.</p><p>\u201cOh great, now the clothes are coming off.\u201d Lila crosses her legs and laughs, exchanging a look with Ella.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Dragging a finger across her collarbone, I step up behind Ella and circle my arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Ella rests her head against my chest. \u201cShe\u2019s just making an inside joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of inside.\u201d I take her hand and pull her to her feet. \u201cWe need to go.\u201d</p><p>She hauls me back toward the bar as I try to pull her through the crowd toward the exit. \u201cWhat about Lila? We can\u2019t just leave her here.\u201d</p><p>Lila finishes her drink and slides the empty glass onto the counter. \u201cI can hang out in the car or something.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea. Not in this kind of neighborhood. But Naomi said you can hang out with her and the band.\u201d</p><p>Lila glances at Ella unsurely and when Ella nods, she sighs. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll hang out with her... I guess. But where are they going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to dinner, I think,\u201d I tell her as Naomi exits from backstage and makes her way across the room toward us.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d Naomi asks Lila in a formal tone and gives Ella a tight smile. \u201cHi, Ella, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Ella replies nonchalantly and her jaw spasms.</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward silence that only girls can create.</p><p>\u201cOkay then, I guess we should get going.\u201d Naomi raises her eyebrows and motions for Lila to come with her as she leaves for the back.</p><p>\u201cPlease hurry,\u201d Lila says pressingly and trudges after Naomi toward the back area.</p><p>I tug Ella eagerly toward the front door, shoving people out of my way. When we step outside, I grab her arm, whirl her around, and pick her up.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d I ask as she hitches her legs around my waist and my dick instantly gets hard.</p><p>She loops her arms around the back of my neck and her green eyes sparkle underneath the streetlights. \u201cIt\u2019s parked out back.\u201d</p><p>I stumble blindly down the dark alley as I kiss her fiercely and tangle my fingers in her long, auburn hair that smells sweetly of vanilla. I trip over the curb at the end, but regain my balance without breaking the kiss. My hand cups her ass and the other one explores the soft skin of her thigh.</p> <p>\u201cDid you wear this skirt just for me, so I\u2019d have easy access?\u201d I murmur against her lips as my fingers inch up her leg.</p><p>Laughing against my mouth, she pinches my ass. \u201cYou at least have to get us in the car before you start doing stuff to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right.\u201d I caress her tongue with mine, savoring her, before moving away. \u201cI\u2019m planning on throwing you down on the hood right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>She restrains a smile. \u201cNo way. There are people everywhere.\u201d</p><p>My eyes skim the dark parking lot and a few perverts sitting on a dropped tailgate of a truck are watching us. \u201cFine, point taken... Where\u2019s Lila\u2019s car?\u201d</p><p>A guilty look crosses her face like she\u2019s done something wrong. \u201cI guess I forgot to tell you, but Lila\u2019s dad towed her car away a little while ago, so we had to borrow a car.\u201d</p><p>I glance around again. \u201cWhich one is it?\u201d</p><p>She points over her shoulder at a car parked toward the back. \u201cThe red Mustang right there.\u201d</p><p>I eye her over suspiciously. \u201cWhere did you two find someone who would let you borrow their Mustang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone I know from school.\u201d She shrugs coolly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas this person a guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... yeah... it\u2019s Blake\u2019s, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. In fact, we dropped him off in Riverside at his girlfriend\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>My arms start to loosen around her as I decide whether to put her down on the ground or keep her close. \u201cSo not only did he let you drive his car, but he drove with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha, stop it.\u201d She constricts her legs around my waist, refusing to let me go. \u201cYou\u2019re on the road all the time with Naomi and I let it be. Besides, you\u2019re always telling me to trust you, and you need to do the same.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. She has a point, but I\u2019m still jealous. It is a first for me and I\u2019m not a fan of it.</p><p>Shaking it off, I walk for the car again, resolving to keep hold of her. Gripping onto my shoulder with one hand, she gets the keys from her skirt pocket and unlocks the car. Without putting her down, I maneuver the driver\u2019s-side door open and set her into the seat.</p><p>I rest my hand on the top of the door and stare down at her. \u201cAnd for the record, I do trust you. It\u2019s guys I don\u2019t trust. They think with their dicks.\u201d She sighs and I slam the door, pretending like it\u2019s not annoying as shit that I\u2019m climbing into some other guy\u2019s car.</p><p>She drives the car really slowly to the hotel. When I ask her why she\u2019s driving like an old lady, she blows out a frustrated breath and tells me she promised Blake she\u2019d behave while she drove it. This makes me feel a little better.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s a pussy,\u201d I say, not even trying to hold my smile back.</p><p>She parks the car in front of the trashy two-story motel littered with beer bottles and cigarette butts, and some rough-looking people are hanging out on the stairway and balcony.</p><p>\u201cMicha, what\u2019s your problem? Why is this bugging you so much?\u201d She aims to sound upset, but a hint of laughter escapes in her voice.</p><p>I get out of the car and lower my head back into the cab. \u201cI don\u2019t like that this guy gets to hang out with you and lend you his car when it should be me.\u201d</p><p>When she climbs out, she accidentally drops her keys on the ground. Bending over to pick them up, I get a glimpse of her black, lacy panties. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help myself. \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s very, very hard.\u201d My tone insinuates my dirty thoughts and I slide over the hood of the car. Snagging her by the hips, I yank her against me. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m done talking about Blake for a while,\u201d I say and kiss her.</p><p>Without another word, I slip my hand into hers and lead her up the stairs, past the vending machine and the two women who are yelling at each other on the balcony. By the time I have the door open to the room, I\u2019m already unbuttoning her shirt. My lips seal against hers as I kick the door shut, continuing to unfasten the buttons.</p><p>My knuckles graze across the soft skin of her stomach and I groan, drawing my lips away from her briefly so I can tug her shirt off. I toss it onto the floor and crash my mouth into hers again. Spreading my fingers along her lower back, I request more of her. I can\u2019t get enough.</p><p>Her hand runs down my chest until her fingers find the bottom of my shirt and then she pulls it over my head and chucks it onto the floor. With our tongues entwined, I back us toward the bed.</p><p>She fiddles with the button on my jeans and a groan escapes my throat as we collapse onto the mattress. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve fucking missed this,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>She leans away, with a smile tugging at the corners of her lips. \u201cIs that the only reason you\u2019ve missed me? Because you needed to get laid?\u201d</p><p>I brush strands of her auburn hair out her face. \u201cNo, I miss everything. Your laugh, your smile, the way you pretend to be mad at me when really you think I\u2019m funny.\u201d I kiss her cheek softly. \u201cI miss the way you taste.\u201d I press my lips to her jawline and her neck arches. \u201cThe way you smell.\u201d I suck on her neck, rolling my tongue along her skin as my hand glides up her thigh and to the edge of her panties. \u201cThe way you feel.\u201d I slip my fingers inside her and a moan falters her lips as her body bows up.</p><p>\u201cMicha...\u201d Her eyes get lost as I feel her the way I\u2019ve wanted to for the last month.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I miss that too,\u201d I say and reconnect my lips with hers.</p><p>Ella</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize how much I missed him until now. His fingers continue to feel me as his tongue strokes the inside of my mouth. I breathe out his name, moaning as I lose control of my body and mind, with my fingertips digging into his shoulder blades.</p><p>After I regain myself, I peel off my skirt and lie back on the bed, ready for more. He gets out of his jeans and boxers and reaches for his wallet to get a condom.</p><p>I grasp his hand, halting him, and rub my finger along the infinity tattoo on his arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t need one.\u201d</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow, looking at me like I\u2019m crazy. \u201cYeah, Ella... I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cover his mouth with my hand. \u201cNo. Not because of that. You don\u2019t need one because I\u2019m on the Pill.\u201d</p><p>When I lower my hand from his lips, he doesn\u2019t look happy, which I didn\u2019t expect.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you go on the Pill?\u201d he wonders. \u201cWe barely see each other.\u201d</p><p>I pinch his nipple and he flinches, laughing. \u201cThanks for the accusation, but I think it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory, since the last time we had sex, things got a little too heavy and you almost forgot to put one on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good point.\u201d He conceals his body over mine, thinking about something that seems to entertain him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have that look on your face?\u201d I sketch my fingers up and down his back.</p><p>He sucks his lip ring between his teeth and then a smile breaks through. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something. You have this goofy grin on your face, so just tell me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrust me. You don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I tighten my legs together, so he can\u2019t get any closer.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be?\u201d He grins wickedly, then pins my arms above my head and dips his lips beside my ear. \u201cI was thinking about how nice it was going to feel inside you without a condom on.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head, but let my legs fall open and I collide my lips into his. Keeping my arms trapped, he nips my bottom lip with his teeth as he thrusts inside me and my entire body ignites with ecstasy.</p><p>He shuts his eyes and inhales deeply through his nose. \u201cFuck, Ella...\u201d His eyes open and he rocks in me.</p><p>Sweat beads our skin as our bodies conform together. Cupping the back of his head, I pull his lips against mine, take his lip ring into my mouth, and explore it with the tip of my tongue. My legs squeeze around his hips as he keeps pumping inside me and I let out a blissful moan. My head tips back as I lose it again and Micha begins to slow down until he finally stills.</p><p>We\u2019re panting and heat radiates off our bodies. He brushes my hair away from my damp forehead and looks me in the eyes. It feels like there\u2019s something he wants to say, something meaningful, but instead he just kisses my forehead and grins. \u201cTen more minutes and I\u2019m back in the game.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, we are fully dressed again and driving to the club to catch up with Lila and the band. It\u2019s after midnight, but the town is alive. Cars line the road, people walk up the sidewalks, and lights shine against the night.</p> <p>After Micha begged me for five minutes straight to let him drive, I finally surrendered and handed over the keys, but only after he swore not to drive like a crazy person.</p><p>He throttles the gas anyway and rips the tires against the asphalt as he floors the car onto the main road.</p><p>\u201cYou promised.\u201d I stab a finger at him. \u201cBehave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis thing\u2019s weak,\u201d he says, pleased. \u201cWhat\u2019s it got under the hood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t look. I was too busy trying to get here to see you.\u201d</p><p>He reaches over the console and places his hand on my thigh, bringing warmth between my legs. \u201cCome on. You know you want to let me see how fast it can go. And then afterward, we can pull over and you can take all that excitement out on me in the backseat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are ridiculously horny,\u201d I tell him, smiling. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says simply, halting at a stoplight. The red glow illuminates the cab. \u201cI\u2019m on the fucking road, away from you all the time... it\u2019s becoming a real problem.\u201d</p><p>Panic strangles me as I think of him being far away in New York surrounded by women who would probably happily take care of his problem. I exhale gradually, so he won\u2019t hear the unsteadiness of my breathing.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He strokes my inner thigh with his thumb as the light turns green. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking and you need to relax. I would never do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I smile, but it doesn\u2019t feel real. People never mean to do things that are hurtful, yet sometimes it just happens, through an intense moment, through brief rationalization, or by simply speaking words that only belong inside one\u2019s head.</p><p>Or simply by giving up for a second.</p><p>People hurt each other all the time.</p><p>Micha</p> <p>Ella has a wandering mind by the time we pull up to the club, but so do I. I\u2019m not sure if her surprise visit was a good thing or a bad thing because it\u2019ll make it harder to leave when morning comes around.</p><p>It turns out that only Naomi, Chase, and Lila are at the club. Dylan left with the hostess, but no one really seems to know where to\u2014or they just don\u2019t care.</p><p>There\u2019s some really cheesy music playing in the background and a woman wearing red boots and a cowgirl hat is dancing in front of an old guy, trying to seduce him, but she\u2019s drunk and keeps falling down.</p><p>An instant tension builds at the table once we sit down. Lila targets Ella with a heavy look and mouths bitch while nodding her head at Naomi.</p><p>I raise an eyebrow, glancing between Ella and Lila. While Naomi\u2019s distracted with Chase, Lila leans over the table and shields the side of her face with her hand. \u201cRemind me to tell you a lovely little story later.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard not to roll my eyes at the silliness. \u201cShould we order an appetizer or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already did,\u201d Naomi snaps, shooting me a dirty look. \u201cAnd we ordered drinks, but neither has been brought out yet.\u201d</p><p>I hold my hands up in front of me and lift my eyebrows. \u201cOkay, sorry for asking.\u201d</p><p>She practically snarls at me and I wonder if a catfight broke out between Lila and her. \u201cWell, I\u2019m getting annoyed with the crappy service.\u201d</p><p>I drape my arm around Ella\u2019s shoulder and whisper in her ear, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><p>She jumps, startled, and turns her head toward me. \u201cIt was nothing. I was just dazing off.\u201d</p><p>I track the direction she was looking, to an old couple cuddled up together in a booth. They\u2019re a little bit rough around the edges, like they\u2019ve had one too many road trips across the country on their Harleys.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you staring at the old couple?\u201d I play with her hair.</p><p>She shakes her head promptly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her lip as she nibbles on it nervously, but decide to let whatever she\u2019s been weird about go for now, not wanting to ruin the one night we get together for the next month.</p><p>Ella</p><p>For some reason, I find myself staring at an old couple and picturing what it would be like if Micha and I were still together at that age. The man feeds the woman a bite of his food and she leans over to give him a kiss. It\u2019s fascinating watching them because my parents were never that affectionate with each other.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more my nerves own me. I can\u2019t see Micha and me together, old and sitting at a table, feeding each other\u2014I can\u2019t see anything.</p><p>Micha is concerned about me, like he always is when I\u2019m acting like a weirdo. I focus on the conversation, nodding my head, even though I have no idea what\u2019s going on.</p><p>When we\u2019re leaving, Lila seizes my elbow and rips me away from Micha\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I say, stumbling to keep up with her as she tows me around the corner of the brick restaurant and into the smoking area. It\u2019s dark and the air feels a little damp compared to Vegas\u2019 dry heat.</p><p>\u201cThat Naomi is a bitch.\u201d She waves her finger as she talks.</p><p>My eyebrows furrow as I check to make sure no one is listening to us at the corner of the building. \u201cWhy? What did she do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything to me.\u201d She crosses her arms and her face reddens with anger. \u201cShe said stuff about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you mess with Micha\u2019s head. That you\u2019re no good for him.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops. \u201cShe said that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I overheard her.\u201d He eyes wander to a group of guys standing by the corner observing us. \u201cShe thought I was in the bathroom, but I was coming back and I heard her talking to that Chase dude, who by the way is so hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one with a lot of tattoos and with a Mohawk thing going on?\u201d I ask and she nods. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like your type.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and then quickly shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point. I think Naomi wants Micha, and I don\u2019t trust her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone over this a thousand times.\u201d I hold my breath as a guy with a cigarette walks by and blows smoke in our direction. \u201cI trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d She picks some mascara off her eyelashes. \u201cI think you should ask him to quit the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, I would never do that to him,\u201d I say, appalled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your call,\u201d she replies. \u201cBut I\u2019m saying I smell trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo, Ella May!\u201d Micha hollers from the corner of the building and Lila and my gazes dart to him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Lila. \u201cThanks for worrying about me, but it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and we walk over to Micha, who\u2019s waiting for me with his hand extended. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I stare into his eyes, glimmering with happiness. \u201cNo, everything\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Micha</p><p>Usually, everyone in the band crashes in the same room. Naomi takes one of the beds and the rest of us flip a coin to see who gets the other. Tonight, I get an extra room so Ella and I can have more time together.</p><p>After some charming persuading on my part, I convince Lila to sleep in the same room as the band. She doesn\u2019t seem too thrilled about it though, since Dylan won\u2019t stop bothering her.</p><p>Once we\u2019re alone, Ella flops down on the bed and drapes her arm over her head. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. What time is it?\u201d</p><p>I glance down at the leather-banded watch on my wrist. \u201cAlmost three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She props up on her elbows. \u201cDo you always stay up this late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually.\u201d I unfasten my watch and slip off my boots, prowling toward her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m good for a few more hours at least.\u201d I shuck off my shirt, climb onto the bed, and cover her body with mine. Her fingers trace my stomach muscles and the black cursive font of the tattoo on my ribs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be with you, inside and out,\u201d she reads. \u201cThrough hard times and helpless ones, through love, through doubt.\u201d</p><p>I lean back a little, bring her hand to my mouth, and gently kiss her palm. \u201cYou know I wrote that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Her eyelids flutter as I breathe on the sensitive spot of her wrist. \u201cYou wrote that when you were, like, sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually fifteen.\u201d I release her hand and lie down on top of her, supporting my weight with my arms. \u201cI remember sitting down to write it and the only inspiration I had was your sad eyes\u2014I couldn\u2019t get them out of my head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pouts. \u201cI don\u2019t have sad eyes, do I?\u201d</p><p>I brush my finger along her cheekbone and underneath one of her green eyes. \u201cYou did. All the time. And sometimes you still do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look sad sometimes too,\u201d she tells me with her auburn hair spread out across the pillow below her head. \u201cBut right now you look happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I am happy.\u201d I start singing her the lyrics and it makes her grin broaden.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d I say and kiss her deeply, nipping at her lip and tracing my tongue along the inside of her mouth.</p><p>She wraps her long legs around me and things turn heated. Threading my fingers through her hair, I caress her neck with my tongue until I know she\u2019s going to have a hickey. Her shoulder shudders upward from the touch of my breath and she giggles.</p><p>I put a small gap between us and look her in the eyes. \u201cDoes that tickle?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head with a solemn expression on her face. \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p> <p>I pinch her side playfully and she jerks sideways, attempting to roll out from under me.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d She laughs, struggling for air. \u201cPretty please.\u201d</p><p>I listen to her, because there\u2019s something else I\u2019m dying to do. I begin to undress her, deliberately at first, but then my movements turn desperate and I end up ripping some of the buttons off her shirt.</p><p>Minutes later, our clothes are in a pile on the floor and I\u2019m back inside her. As I stare into her eyes, I consider begging her to come with me on the road, but the moment is fleeting and I realize I just can\u2019t do that to her.</p><p>I wake up in a quiet room with Ella in my arms, and her naked body curled up against me. I wish it was possible to wake up every morning like this, but then someone would have to give up something important.</p><p>\u201cGod, what the fuck am I going to do?\u201d I whisper aloud to myself.</p> <p>Morning is peeking through the curtain and cars buzz down the main road in front of the hotel. I watch Ella sleep for a bit, while I run my fingers along her back, until finally her eyelids peek open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d She blinks the tiredness away.</p><p>I twist a lock of her hair around my finger. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d She starts to sit up, but I tighten my arms around her and hold her to me. \u201cJust stay put for a few more minutes. I like holding you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes examine me, and she rests her head back on my shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You seem upset.\u201d</p><p>I smooth away the worry line between her brows with my thumb. \u201cHave you ever thought about what we\u2019re going to do with our lives? With each other?\u201d</p><p>She bites at her bottom lip. \u201cSometimes I think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where do you see us going?\u201d I ask with caution, not wanting to scare her with what I\u2019m thinking about asking her. I need to test the waters first.</p><p>Her eyes round and her breathing becomes frantic. \u201cAre you breaking up with me?\u201d</p> <p>I snort a laugh. \u201cWhy the fuck would you ever think that?\u201d</p><p>She props up on her elbow and gazes down at me, her hair a curtain around our faces. \u201cBecause you have this look on your face like you\u2019re about to tell me some horrible news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad news.\u201d I guide her body on top of mine. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll be happy about it either.\u201d</p><p>She clutches onto my shoulders as she pushes herself up, so she\u2019s straddling me and I can feel her warmth on my cock. The blanket falls from her shoulders and her breasts are just above my face.</p><p>\u201cPlease hurry up and tell me, then,\u201d she begs. \u201cBecause you\u2019re scaring the shit out of me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d I stop, remembering my mother and my father, and how things turned out for them. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Honestly it wasn\u2019t really that important.\u201d</p><p>Her face falls. \u201cNo, that look on your face isn\u2019t nothing. Since when do you keep things from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not keeping anything from you.\u201d I\u2019m just holding out for a while until I know we\u2019re both on the same page. \u201cNow come here.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and put my mouth over her breast, sucking on her nipple and distracting her. When I move my mouth away, she\u2019s panting and the light reflects in her eyes. Wrapping my hand around the back of her head, I steer her lips toward mine and thrust my cock inside her. She breathes fervently against my lips, and moments later we\u2019ve both forgotten about the conversation.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Ella</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since the LA trip and I feel like shit all the time. Micha\u2019s been really busy and I barely get to talk to him. Plus Lila started dating Preston and she\u2019s never around. My muscles ache just from walking, my head hurts all the time, and every task is tiring.</p><p>I\u2019m waiting outside the therapist\u2019s office, with my bag on my lap, when I get a text from my brother.</p><p>Dean: Call me asap.</p><p>Me: Can\u2019t. In a meeting.</p><p>Dean: Don\u2019t be a brat. CALL ME.</p><p>My therapist walks out of the office and motions me to come in as the phone beeps again. I shut it off and sit down in a chair in front of the desk, decorated with a nameplate, a cup full of pens, and a tall stack of folders.</p><p>Her name is Anna and she\u2019s young, maybe in her late twenties, with blonde hair that\u2019s cropped short around her jawline. Every time I see her, she\u2019s in a pantsuit. Today, it\u2019s a black pinstriped one.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ella.\u201d She takes a seat behind her desk and puts on her square-framed glasses as she takes out my file. \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d I say. \u201cTo say the least.\u201d</p><p>Noting my tone, she looks up at me. \u201cAnd what was interesting about it?\u201d</p><p>I scratch at my back along my infinity tattoo. \u201cI went to visit Micha in LA.\u201d</p><p>She opens a notebook. \u201cAnd how did that go?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cGood, I think.\u201d</p><p>She scratches something down in the paper. \u201cYou seem like you\u2019re unsure.\u201d</p><p>I slouch back in the seat and fold my arms. \u201cIt\u2019s just that... well, every time I go to see him or he comes to see me, it gets harder to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>She sets the pen and notebook down on her desk and removes her glasses. \u201cSaying good-bye is always hard, but sometimes it\u2019s necessary to move on in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to move on from him.\u201d Panic gusts through me like a tornado. \u201cI love Micha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d she explains quickly. \u201cI\u2019m saying that sometimes saying good-bye is the hardest part of life.\u201d</p><p>I hate when she plays mind games. \u201cAre you referring to my mother? Because I told you last time that I was over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla, you\u2019re not over it,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise you wouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>I prop my elbow on the arm of the chair and rest my chin in my hand. \u201cThen what does this good-bye thing have to do with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with you.\u201d She takes a mint out of a tin and puts it in her mouth. \u201cAnd you struggle to say good-bye to things: your guilt over your mother and your father, your pain, your feelings. You have such a hard time letting go of your past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut I\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>She pauses, tapping her fingers on the desk. \u201cTell me this: Where do you see yourself in a year or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... I haven\u2019t really thought about it that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to think about it for a minute, if you can.\u201d</p><p>I raise my chin from my hand and search my brain, but all I can see is Micha and me out on that damn bridge as he falls into the water.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I grip the armrests of the chair as my pulse accelerates. \u201cI really don\u2019t... Holy shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Ella, everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d She opens the desk drawer and takes out another folder. \u201cI think we might want to start considering doing an evaluation for anxiety and depression.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrow at her. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla, I think it\u2019s important that\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shove up from the chair and swing my bag over my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about this.\u201d</p><p>She says something else, but I\u2019m already out the door. I will not discuss having a mental illness. I\u2019m not sick. I\u2019m not.</p><p>Burying the conversation, I turn on my phone and read the text Dean sent me. \u201cDad left rehab Call me now...\u201d What? I punch in his speed-dial number as I walk outside into the sunlight and put the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell did you turn off your phone?\u201d he snaps.</p><p>\u201cI told you. I was in a meeting.\u201d I head across the quad, zigzagging in between people and ducking under a Frisbee flying through the air.</p><p>\u201cWell, you need to get back home,\u201d he orders. \u201cDad bailed and no one can find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Micha\u2019s mom and see if she can find out where he is. If he\u2019s at home.\u201d I start to hang up.</p><p>\u201cI already got ahold of her.\u201d He sounds aggravated. \u201cAnd she\u2019s on a vacation with some guy she\u2019s dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d I didn\u2019t even know his mom was dating someone. \u201cThen what do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drive up there and check on him,\u201d he says like it\u2019s my obligation.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have work and a wedding to plan\u2014a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a life,\u201d I argue, reaching the border of the grass. \u201cAnd we can always call someone else. We can call Denny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call Denny then,\u201d he says, and I hear Caroline\u2019s voice in the background. \u201cLook, I have to go, okay? Call Denny and let me know what\u2019s going on as soon as you do.\u201d He hangs up on me.</p><p>Frustrated, I dial information and get the number for Denny\u2019s bar. By the time I call, I\u2019m trotting up the stairs to Lila\u2019s and my two-bedroom apartment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Someone picks up after four rings. \u201cHello, Hub and Grub, this is Denny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm... yeah, this is Ella. Ella Daniels. I was just wondering if my dad was there or if you\u2019d seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he showed up here this morning.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cI thought he was in rehab.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently he checked himself out.\u201d I take the house keys out of my bag and unlock the door. \u201cHow bad is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you, Ella. He\u2019s pretty bad,\u201d he says bluntly. \u201cHe showed up here this morning and he\u2019s been drinking ever since. Nonstop. I offered him a ride home, but he refused.\u201d</p><p>I close the door and toss the keys on the counter. \u201cCan you keep an eye on him for a little bit until I can figure out what to do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d he says with reluctance. \u201cLook, Ella, I understand your situation, but I got a bar to run and... well, when he gets this way he causes a lot of problems. I don\u2019t mind helping, just as long as it\u2019s not bad for my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get down there as soon as I can,\u201d I promise. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really sorry about this.\u201d</p> <p>He sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know it\u2019s hard for you. I mean, you\u2019re just a kid.\u201d</p><p>I was never a kid. Not really. I was doing the dishes and cleaning the house at six, cooking my own food at eight, and making sure my mom took her medications by the age of ten.</p><p>I say good-bye and hang up, sinking down onto the suede couch. The apartment is small, with white walls and tan carpet and a TV in the corner. There is a narrow dining area between the kitchen and the living room. The place smells like cinnamon and the kitchen sink is overflowing with dishes.</p><p>I press my fingers to the sides of my nose. \u201cShit... Who am I supposed to call?\u201d I let my hand fall to my lap and call Ethan.</p><p>He answers after three rings. \u201cOkay, so this is kind of weird. You never call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a favor to ask you.\u201d I pause, working up the courage. \u201cCan you go pick up my dad from the Hub and Grub and stay with him until I can get there?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s silent for a second. \u201cYeah, I can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, grateful. \u201cI\u2019ll head up as soon as I can. I promise. Twelve hours at the max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill yourself getting up here, Ella. I said it was fine, so come when you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and drop the phone onto the coffee table, wondering where the hell I\u2019m going to find a car. I start to call Micha, but then stop myself. I haven\u2019t talked to him in over a day and the last thing I want to do is call him up and start bawling.</p><p>Besides, there\u2019s nothing he can do about it.</p><p>He\u2019s clear across the country.</p> <p>Micha</p><p>\u201cIf you keep hitting the wrong note,\u201d I warn Naomi, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to take the guitar away.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re sitting on the bed in the studio apartment with our guitars on our laps. There is dirty laundry all over the floor and garbage all over the counters. Dylan and Chase are at the bar trying to get laid. I\u2019m wearing my pajama bottoms without a shirt on and Naomi\u2019s hair is balled up on her head, damp because she just got out of the shower.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a dick,\u201d she jokes, tugging the rubber band out so her damp hair can fall to her shoulders. \u201cThe note I\u2019m playing sounds a lot better than the one you think we should hit.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and strum the strings of my guitar. \u201cThat all depends.\u201d</p><p>She plays a chord and talks over the noise. \u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether you\u2019re playing for a roomful of tone-deaf people.\u201d I smirk ruthlessly.</p><p>She rolls her eyes and sets her guitar down on the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right, but it\u2019s for a reason. About two days ago, I was walking around sightseeing and searching for a building that I\u2019d heard my father worked at. I\u2019d just gotten off the phone with my mom, who not only told me she was going on vacation with some dude half her age but that my father was now living in New York City.</p><p>I just wanted to see where he worked, for no other reason than out of curiosity. As I stood out in front of the building, a man crossed paths with me chasing down a taxi. It was my father and I started to turn away, but he saw me and waved. I wanted to return it by showing him my middle finger, but couldn\u2019t do anything except stand there gaping like a little kid.</p><p>He strolled over to me with an uncomfortable look on his face. He was in a black suit with a trench coat over it and stared at me with eyes exactly like mine. \u201cMicha, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m living here for a little bit.\u201d My tone was sharp. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the lofty building with a metallic exterior. \u201cI just got transferred here for work about two weeks ago. I called your mom and told her about it.\u201d</p><p>I pretended like I didn\u2019t know it already. \u201cWell, you really need to stop calling her. She doesn\u2019t need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me over and his expression turned cold. \u201cSo why are you living here?\u201d</p><p>I fiddled with the chain hooked to my jeans, inching in my shoulders as a mob of people push past me. \u201cMy band and I have a gig at a club for the next month.\u201d</p><p>A condescending look concealed his face. \u201cWhy am I not surprised? I should have known you\u2019d turn out doing something like that.\u201d</p><p>I clench my hand into a fist, fighting not to hit him. \u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He looked around at the people passing by us, like he was worried someone overheard me. \u201cLook, Micha, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I\u2019m going to go.\u201d</p><p>I turned my back on him and walked away. On the way back to the apartment, I realized that my dad was always a douche bag. Even when he was still my father, he would nitpick every little thing I did and tell me I was wrong a lot.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Naomi claps her hands in front of my face and I flinch. \u201cYou\u2019re totally spacing out.\u201d</p><p>I carefully set my guitar down on the floor and lean back against the headboard. \u201cI thought you were going out tonight.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and stretches out on the bed on her stomach, crossing her arms and resting her chin on them. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it. Besides, you\u2019ve seemed a little down lately and I didn\u2019t want to leave you alone to drown in your sorrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drowning in my sorrows.\u201d I take a gulp of my soda. \u201cI\u2019m just confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout stuff.\u201d</p><p>She sits down beside me so we\u2019re both staring at the foot of the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s Ella stuff again, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d I set the soda down on the nightstand and give it a little spin. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to you about her.\u201d</p><p>She rubs her lips together, thinking heavily about something. \u201cWhy not? You have before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I was wasted and I tend to get a little chatty when I\u2019m like that.\u201d I can\u2019t talk to Naomi about what\u2019s going on in my head because I owe it to Ella to tell her first. \u201cI basically talk to anyone when I\u2019m drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you hate talking to me, Micha,\u201d she says. \u201cI know you like to. You\u2019re just too blinded by your own feelings.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m lost. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she is leaning toward me with her eyes closed and her lips out, throwing me off guard as she tries to kiss me. Pieces of her hair fall in front of her face, and for a second, I\u2019m motionless as I think about letting her kiss me\u2014letting her take my mind off shit.</p><p>Then all my feelings for Ella catch up with me and I shift away, practically crawling onto the nightstand to get out of her reach. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snap open and her pupils are large. \u201cCome on, Micha. Don\u2019t try to tell me you haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head slowly. \u201cNope, I haven\u2019t. Not even once.\u201d Her cheeks turn pink and I feel like a douche bag. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, but you know how I feel about Ella, so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d even try it.\u201d</p><p>She slides her legs over the edge of the bed and turns her back to me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like you love her as much anymore. You don\u2019t even talk to her on the phone all the time like you used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m trying to sort through some stuff.\u201d I give her a pat on the back because I can tell she\u2019s about to cry. The whole situation is awkward. \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>She jerks her shoulder upward and shrugs off my hand before running into the bathroom. The door bangs shut and rattles the thin walls.</p><p>I collect my guitar from the floor and flop down on the bed, playing my favorite song. Eight months ago, I would have been all over her invitation, but not anymore. It was more of a turnoff than anything.</p><p>That\u2019s when I realize the thing I\u2019ve been wondering about for the last week.</p><p>Ella is it for me. The way I feel about her is never going to change. I will love her forever, but I need her closer to me, not thousands of miles away.</p><p>How am I supposed to tell her, though, that I\u2019m ready to begin her future, when I know she has no clue what her future is yet?</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Ella</p><p>I\u2019m starting to wonder if this is going to be my life forever, if I\u2019ll always end up back in Star Grove at the house that clutches my childhood.</p><p>The house looks the same: a broken rain gutter, garbage bags piling up on the side of the house, and the Cutlass still balanced on the cinderblocks in front of the garage. The house\u2019s siding is peeling and some of the branches have fallen from the tree beside the window.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s truck is parked in the driveway and he\u2019s sitting on the back steps playing around on his phone. I get out of the rental car that looks like the kind of vehicle clowns stuff themselves into. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan looks up and he arches his eyebrows at the car. \u201cWhat the fuck is that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the cheapest one at the rental place.\u201d I sit down on the steps next to him and stretch out my legs in front of me. \u201cIs he inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he passed out on the couch as soon as I got him home.\u201d He puts his phone away and rolls up the sleeves of his gray Henley, revealing his extensive tattoos.</p> <p>\u201cYou got a new one.\u201d I point to a tattoo of a quote written in Latin.</p><p>Nodding, he touches the lines with his finger. \u201cA couple weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Staring at Micha\u2019s house next door, I ask, \u201cHow bad was he to get out of the bar?\u201d</p><p>He tips his head forward, looking down at the ground, and his black hair falls into his face. \u201cHe was kind of a pain in the ass to get here.

I\u2019m mad that you had to come all the way here to take care of him.\u201d He sounds uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Confusion swarms my brain.</p><p>He fiddles with a frayed area on the knee of his jeans. \u201cI think it\u2019s bullshit when the kids have to act like the parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we talking about me still?\u201d I ask, eyeing him over. \u201cOr is there something else you\u2019d like to share... like something that\u2019s going on with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d He nudges me with his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a story for another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never share your stories,\u201d I remind him.</p> <p>\u201cNeither do you,\u201d he retorts. \u201cExcept for with Micha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d I unintentionally say aloud and he shoots me a funny look. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m going to go check on my dad and then maybe we could go get something to eat. My treat for your having to come deal with this crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that really a treat?\u201d he jokes with a sarcastic smirk. \u201cEating dinner with you?\u201d</p><p>I make a face and walk into the kitchen, and the screen door slams shut behind me. Particles of dust float in the air and I fan my hand in front of my face. \u201cGod, it smells like a dead animal in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because no one ever cleaned up before I left.\u201d My dad appears in the doorway, wearing a baggie green T-shirt and jeans with grease spots on them. His skin has gotten a little color since the last time I saw him and he looks somewhat younger, but his eyes are bloodshot just like they used to be. He\u2019s not wasted, but hungover, which can be equally as explosive.</p><p>\u201cI thought I did clean up.\u201d I glance around at the brown countertops, still stacked with vodka and tequila bottles and the table piled with overdue bills. \u201cDad, why did you leave rehab?\u201d</p><p>He slumps down into a chair at the kitchen table with his shoulders hunched over and his head falls into his hands. \u201cThey tried to get me to talk about your mother.\u201d</p><p>I grow uneasy with the situation. \u201cI\u2019m sure that was hard for you, but running away won\u2019t solve the problem. It\u2019ll only make it worse. Trust me, I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust you.\u201d He raises his head and rubs his scruffy jawline. \u201cTrust you like I trusted you to watch your mother that night.\u201d He repeats the words he said to me when we tried to get him to go to rehab.</p><p>It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been punched in the gut and I press my hand to my stomach, forcing my lungs to work. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen and he quickly gets to his feet, toppling the chair to the ground. \u201cElla, I didn\u2019t mean that. Sometimes I just say things... and I don\u2019t know why I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Just like my therapist told me to do, I breathe through the internal pain as I back for the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get some dinner. Do you want anything?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and his eyes water over. \u201cElla, I really didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d I burst out the back door and suck in a deep breath of fresh air.</p><p>Ethan glances up at me and then stands to his feet. \u201cI was thinking the Drive-Inn and we can take my truck because there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m climbing into that clown car.\u201d</p><p>I could hug him right now, but I don\u2019t. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>We sit in his truck eating French fries and hamburgers with the neon lights flashing into the cab. Ethan is checking out one of the waitresses who is bending over to take the order of the car next to us. It\u2019s been quiet between the two of us.</p><p>\u201cYou heard what he said to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I finally ask, stirring the ranch dressing with a fry.</p><p>He picks a pickle off his hamburger, pulling a face as he tosses it out onto the tray secured to the window. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear much. Besides, it\u2019s not something I haven\u2019t heard before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201d I chew my fry, scanning his eyes for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying parents suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to elaborate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>When it grows quiet again, he puffs out an irritated breath. \u201cYou remember back in, like, second grade how I used to come to school all the time with bruises on me?\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of my soda and put it back in the holder. \u201cWasn\u2019t that the year you broke your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat among other things.\u201d His forehead creases as he spaces off, staring out the windshield. \u201cThat year my dad got addicted to painkillers and he was always pissed off about something... anything. And he liked to take it out on my brothers, me, my mom\u2014basically whoever he could.\u201d</p><p>It clicks what he\u2019s saying. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one does. Not even Micha.\u201d He balls up the wrapper of his burger and tosses it out onto the tray. \u201cSo yeah, I get that parents can be douche bags to their kids, but in our cases, it was\u2014is more because of the addiction than their actual feelings.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what to say other than thanks.</p><p>He tosses an empty cup of fry sauce onto the tray and the heaviness in the cab clears. \u201cYou owe me big time, not only for picking up your father but for sharing. I hate doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d I hand him my garbage and his smile expands across his face.</p><p>To the side of us, a blue Camaro rolls up, revving the engine. Mikey is in the driver\u2019s seat, bumping his head to the music that\u2019s blaring out from the stereo. All the feelings of when he made Micha crash his Chevelle into the tree rush through me.</p><p>\u201cFucking asshole,\u201d Ethan mutters under his breath as he starts up the engine and lets it roar, pumping the gas.</p><p>I roll my eyes at him. \u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019re in a truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got a Hemi in it,\u201d he says in a fake Southern accent. \u201cAnd do you know he goes around bragging about winning that race?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the heck is Grantford Davis in there with Mikey?\u201d I ask with shock, staring at the back window of the Camaro. \u201cI thought they hated each other?\u201d</p><p>Ethan starts to laugh. \u201cGrantford is Mikey\u2019s little bitch now due to a lost race. He basically has to do whatever Mikey says. It was part of the bet.\u201d</p><p>Micha would be thrilled if he knew that. He always blamed Grantford for the night on the bridge, even though I don\u2019t. However, it still makes me smile seeing Grantford in the back with his cowboy hat on and a miserable look on his face.</p><p>I tap my fingers on the console while Mikey yells something foul at us from over his music.</p><p>\u201cYou have a look on your face like you\u2019re about to get us into trouble.\u201d He slurps the rest of his drink and drops it out onto the tray.</p><p>\u201cI feel like starting a little bit of trouble. In fact, I need to.\u201d Eyeing Mikey through the tinted window, I pick up my half-full shake. \u201cDo you remember that time we were driving down Main Street and I threw that shake on the windshield of that parked car because Micha dared me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to relive that?\u201d The yellow lights on the marque illuminate in his brown eyes. \u201cBecause if I remember right, we got into some deep shit for that\u2014Micha and I got our asses kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t for this,\u201d I assure him. \u201cAnd anyway, I\u2019m not going to throw it on his car. I\u2019m going to throw it in his open window and right on his lap.\u201d He stays quiet, rubbing his hand across his jawline and I add, \u201cAre you in or out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m in. I\u2019m always in.\u201d He lowers his hand onto the steering wheel. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking of the best way to ditch him when he tries to chase us down.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at Mikey, hollering at one of the waitress on roller skates. \u201cYou think he will?\u201d</p><p>Ethan grasps the shifter. \u201cMaybe... he\u2019s got his friends with him.\u201d</p><p>I start to roll my window down. \u201cDoes it really matter if he does? I know for a fact you can kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cTrue, but he\u2019s got Danny Farren in the car and that guy\u2019s fucking huge.\u201d</p><p>I withdraw my hand from the window. \u201cDo you not want me to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, do it,\u201d he says as the waitress comes up to collect the tray from the window and Ethan drops down a few dollars for a tip. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to drive until we ditch him... Oh yes, I fucking got it. I\u2019ll ramp the truck over the turnout hill. His Camaro will never be able to get over it unless he wants to bottom out his car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust try not to kill us.\u201d I roll down the window and wave my fingers at Mikey.</p><p>His eyebrows dip together. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here? I thought you ran away or some shit.\u201d</p><p>Gripping the cup in my hand, I stick my head out the window. \u201cI went to school. You know a place where you learn... Oh wait, you probably don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Ethan coughs in his hand. \u201cAnd let\u2019s bail.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou better watch it,\u201d he sneers, running his hand through his black hair. \u201cOr one of these days someone\u2019s gonna shut that mouth of yours permanently.\u201d</p><p>I bat my eyelashes at him and flip him the finger as I chuck the shake straight through the rolled-down window.</p><p>He curses as it lands on his lap and he jumps up, bumping his head onto the ceiling. \u201cYou bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d I command, rolling up the window quickly.</p><p>The tires squeal as Ethan backs out, nearly running over an old lady. Cranking the wheel, he burns rubber out of the parking lot. The sound of Mikey\u2019s Camaro chases after us as we drive fast toward the turnout. I feel like a kid again and wish I could grasp onto the freeness, but once it\u2019s time to go home, it\u2019ll be over.</p><p>Mikey inches up to the bumper of the truck and starts flashing the headlights at us. Ethan accelerates as houses and trees blur by until the turnout comes into view on the side of the road. The turnout used to be an entrance to a road that led back to a spot underage people liked to party at, but when a few people\u2014Micha included\u2014got busted, the town blocked it off with a fence and a dirt hill.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going too fast,\u201d I warn, grabbing the handle above my head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to nosedive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, I got this.\u201d He downshifts. \u201cAnd since when do you worry about shit like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried about your truck.\u201d I prop my foot up on the dash to keep myself in the seat. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t care, then by all means ramp away.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and floors the pedal. The engine flares and the tires squeal as the truck flies straight up the hill. There\u2019s a brief moment where we are airborne and then we hit the ground hard. I\u2019m thrown forward by the impact and bash my head on the dashboard as the car bounces to a stop.</p><p>\u201cAh, I think I just cracked my skull,\u201d Ethan complains, grasping his head.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d I touch the tender spot on my head and rotate in my seat to look behind us. Headlights shine over the side of the hill and a shadow of Mikey appears at the top of it, along with three others.</p><p>\u201cYou better go.\u201d I wave my hand for Ethan to move forward. \u201cHe can walk over the hill.\u201d</p><p>He composes himself and drives down the rocky field, leaving them in the distance. Once we\u2019re on the dirt road and tucked far away into the trees, we both relax.</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d It dawns on me. \u201cWhat are you going to do when he comes after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about taking a vacation from this place.\u201d He makes a sharp veer to the left, directing the truck toward the side road that will take us back to our houses. \u201cGuess now is as good a time as any to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to just up and leave?\u201d I turn sideways in my seat to look at him. \u201cAnd go where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of a solo road trip, like Into the Wild only on wheels, not foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I can actually picture you doing this.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a trace of a smile on his face as he turns the car onto the road. We don\u2019t talk for the rest of the drive, but it\u2019s a nice silence. When he drops me off, I thank him again and tell him he should come with Lila and me to the wedding, since it\u2019s kind of a road trip. He says he\u2019ll think about it.</p><p>I walk inside, leaving the carefree night behind in order to grow up again and face my demons head-on.</p><p>Chapter 5</p> <p>Micha</p><p>Things are awkward between Naomi and me. It\u2019s the next morning and we\u2019re supposed to be practicing at a club, but she\u2019s over flirting with the bartender, who is twice her age and has a really long goatee.</p><p>It\u2019s fairly quiet, since it\u2019s barely past noon. There are a few people eating in the booths and chatting at the bar and one of the waitresses keeps coming up to Dylan, Chase, and me to see if we need anything.</p><p>I\u2019m in the middle of a chord when my phone rings. I set the guitar down by my feet and see Ella\u2019s name on the screen.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I answer in a light tone. \u201cI was just thinking about calling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have read your mind then I guess.\u201d She\u2019s trying to sound happy, but the pitch of her voice is off.</p><p>I turn in the chair so my back is to Dylan and Chase. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You sound upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She breathes into the phone loudly. \u201cMy dad just ran out of rehab and I had to drive up to Star Grove and take him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d My voice echoes through the room so I lower it. \u201cI would have come over and helped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t call you.\u201d Her tone is strained. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to come out. Ethan helped me and it\u2019s all good. I\u2019m taking my dad back to the rehab right now and then I\u2019m heading back to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to fly out there?\u201d I stand up and pick up my guitar, ready to go.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, Micha,\u201d she assures me. \u201cI need to start taking care of myself a little bit more, but I promise I\u2019m not having a meltdown.\u201d</p><p>I should be happy, but I\u2019m not. \u201cWhen are you heading out to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>She pauses and the phone statics. \u201cIn, like, a week, but you don\u2019t need to come. I know you\u2019re busy with stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d I\u2019m getting pissed. \u201cWhy are you blowing me off?\u201d</p><p>She sighs heavily. \u201cI\u2019m not blowing you off. I\u2019m trying to let you live your life without my burdens... Look, I have to go. I just pulled up to the rehab center.\u201d She hangs up before I can say anything else.</p><p>I rake my hands through my hair and then kick the brick wall behind the stage. \u201cGod damn it.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the club looks at me with terror in their eyes and I jump off the platform, storming for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Naomi calls out, turning away from the bartender, ready to head after me. I ignore her and walk outside to the busy street.</p><p>Things aren\u2019t going the way I planned. I haven\u2019t even told Ella how I\u2019m feeling\u2014what I want from her\u2014and she\u2019s already pushing me away. Maybe I need to figure something else out.</p><p>Or maybe it might be time to move on.</p><p>Ella</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to walk you in?\u201d I say to my dad, putting the car into park. We\u2019re out in front of the rehab center, a small tan brick building with a narrow bench area in front of it where people are smoking. The sky is cloudy and leaves fall from the trees onto the hood of the car.</p><p>He shakes his head as he unbuckles his seatbelt. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Ella. And you should probably be getting on the road before it gets too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I check. \u201cBecause like I said back at the house, you can talk to me if you need to.\u201d</p><p>He gazes at the entrance door. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean what I said... I don\u2019t blame you. I know it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d My gaze meets his eyes, which have cleared of alcohol but still carry so much pain and hatred. \u201cI know it\u2019s probably hard for you to remember, but I didn\u2019t used to be like this. Things used to be good, and then your mother started taking a turn for the worse and everything went downhill. It was hard to deal with, and I handled it wrong.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. He\u2019s never talked to me like this before, but he also hasn\u2019t been sober for more than five minutes.</p><p>\u201cDad, do you regret things...\u201d I swallow the lump in my throat. \u201cDo you wish that sometimes you would have just left and had a normal life?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a shaky breath. \u201cHonestly, yes, sometimes I look back and wish I would have run out. I probably would have been a lot happier. I\u2019ll always hate myself for feeling that way, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d He opens the door and climbs out, ducking his head back into the cab. \u201cThanks for bringing me back.\u201d</p><p>He shuts the door and walks up the sidewalk, putting a cigarette into his mouth as he joins the people in the smoking area. A woman with red hair hands him a Zippo and he lights up, taking a drag. I sit in the car for a while and let his words replay in my mind with a heavy feeling weighing on my shoulders. Is this Micha\u2019s and my future? The therapist already wants to check me for depression, which was how my mother started. What if it ends up that I am depressed? What if Micha and I stay together and I start to go downhill? What if I ruin his life?</p><p>By the time I leave the parking space, all I want to do is go home, climb into bed, and shut down my mind.</p><p>\u201cElla, get your butt out of bed,\u201d Lila demands, jerking the blankets off me. \u201cOr I swear to God, I\u2019m going to dump a cup of ice water on you.\u201d</p><p>The sunlight trickling through the window stings my eyes. I curl up in a ball, cradle my knees to my chest, and cover my head with my arms. \u201cLeave me alone and close the curtain. The light is giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>She turns down the song playing on the stereo, \u201cThe Tide\u201d by Spill Canvas, and sits down on the edge of the bed. She\u2019s wearing a white shirt, jeans, and a pair of high-heeled boots. Her hair is curled up and her lips are stained pink, along with her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAre you going out?\u201d I bury my face to the pillow and my voice muffles. \u201cIf you are, can you pick up some milk? I drank it all last night.\u201d</p><p>She tugs on my shoulder, kind of roughly, and forces me to look at her. \u201cYou have to stop this. You\u2019ve been in bed for almost three days... What the heck happened back in Star Grove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI dropped my dad off at rehab and then drove back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your dad say to you?\u201d She says it with accusation.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I roll onto my stomach and smash my face into the pillow. \u201cLook, Lila, you can sit here and dig into this all you want, but there\u2019s nothing there. I just feel like shit and want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>She dithers and then gets up from the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later tonight with some milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I shut my eyes. \u201cAnd can you turn the music back up?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few seconds later, Spill Canvas fills the room again and I drift off to sleep, happy to let my mind enter sleep mode.</p><p>\u201cHow long has she been like this?\u201d Fingers lightly trace up and down my back.</p><p>\u201cSince she came back from dealing with her dad,\u201d Lila says with worry in her tone. \u201cSo, like, four days. She barely gets out bed and she won\u2019t eat anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Micha sounds equally as concerned.</p><p>I rotate onto my side, blinking my exhausted eyes against the sunlight spilling through the window. Micha is sitting on the edge of my bed with his hand on my back and his hair has a little wave to it, which means he\u2019s recently been sleeping.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d I say and they both jump.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d Lila paces the floor with her hands on her hips.

His eyes search mine and my insides quiver. \u201cWhat did your dad say to you?\u201d</p> <p>I sit up and his hand falls off my back to the bed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla May\u201d\u2014he reaches for my face\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t feed me bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeding you bullshit, Micha Scott.\u201d I climb out of the bed and drag my feet toward the bathroom. \u201cDid you ever consider that this is who I am? That maybe you can\u2019t save me because you\u2019d have to save me from my own head?\u201d I lock the door and collapse onto the floor, hugging my knees to my chest as thoughts race through my head.</p><p>I wish he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>I wish he would just let me go.</p><p>I wish I didn\u2019t have to wake up anymore and deal with life, because it hurts. It all hurts.</p> <p>Seconds later, someone knocks on the door. \u201cElla, open the God damn door before I break it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be left alone,\u201d I snap. \u201cI never asked you to come here, Micha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t,\u201d he says softly through the door. \u201cLila called me because she was worried about you. And so am I. You act like you might be going back to that dark place again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I promise.\u201d I feel too drained to deal with anything else, so I crawl over to the shower and turn it on, letting the sound of the running water drown out his voice. It feels like I should be crying, but my eyes are dry.</p><p>I lie on my back on top of the fuzzy purple rug on the floor and stare up at the small crack in the ceiling. I never expected him to come here. I wanted more preparation, but it\u2019s time to face the inevitable.</p><p>I\u2019m letting him go. Cutting the strings. Because I love him that much.</p><p>I made the decision on my way home, as my dad\u2019s words continually haunted me. I want something better for Micha than a dark, murky future.</p><p>Suddenly, the doorknob lock pops up. The door swings open and Micha stands in the doorway with a bent hanger in his hand.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing, pretty girl?\u201d he asks, taking in the sight of me. \u201cOne minute we\u2019re good and suddenly you\u2019re shutting me out again.\u201d</p><p>Closing my eyes, I inhale, and then open them again, breathing out. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, looking like he understands what\u2019s coming. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t, unless it\u2019s about something happy.\u201d He tosses the hanger into the sink and drops to his knees in front of me. \u201cYou can have your mood swings, but I\u2019m not going to let you shut me out. It\u2019ll blow over.\u201d</p><p>I prop myself up on my elbows. \u201cNo, it won\u2019t. It\u2019s part of me.\u201d I muster a shaky breath. \u201cI think we should break up.\u201d</p><p>Quickly shaking his head, he lies on top of me. \u201cStop it. I\u2019m not going to let you do this. Just tell me what\u2019s going on and I\u2019ll try to fix it.\u201d</p><p>My whole body aches. \u201cNothing\u2019s going on. I just don\u2019t want to do this anymore. It\u2019s getting tiring.\u201d</p><p>His eyes blaze with anger and he crashes his lips to mine, suffocating my thoughts momentarily as his tongue slips deep into my mouth. I kiss him back as his thumb runs along each one of my ribs, but when his hand heads down south, I snap back into reality and start to panic. I have to do something\u2014anything\u2014to make him hate me; otherwise he\u2019ll never let me go and he has to let me go.</p><p>Placing a hand on his chest, I gently push him away and look directly into his aqua eyes. \u201cMicha, I cheated on you.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious.\u201d I let my hand fall from his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to tell you for a while, but I didn\u2019t know how to.\u201d</p><p>He leans back. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and tuck my legs under me, plucking at a thread on the rug. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make this any harder than it is. I did it and I\u2019m sorry... I didn\u2019t plan it or anything. I was just drunk and it happened.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s starting to believe me and I feel like the world\u2019s biggest asshole, but one day, when he\u2019s married and has kids and he\u2019s happy, this moment won\u2019t matter to him.</p><p>\u201cWho was it with?\u201d His voice is quiet, but quakes with rage.</p><p>I force down the massive lump in my throat. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>His gaze bores into me. \u201cYeah, it does.\u201d</p><p>My legs tremble as I stand up and turn off the shower. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you so that you can go beat the shit out of him.\u201d I start to walk around him, but he sidesteps me, blocking my path as he puts a hand on each side of the doorway.</p><p>\u201cLook me in the eye and tell me you did it,\u201d he growls. \u201cTell me that you fucking ripped out my heart and stomped on it.\u201d</p><p>My tongue feels like lead, but I manage to keep my voice steady. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Micha. I really am. I\u2019d take it back if I could, but no one can change the past.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from me, he punches a hole in the wall just below the light switch. He storms off and, moments later, the front door slams shut. Silence is all that follows, which is what I want.</p><p>I want him to hate me, just as much as I hate myself.</p><p>That way I can\u2019t bring him down with me.</p><p>Days feel like weeks as I plummet into a deeper hole of darkness and exhaustion. Thoughts of giving up drift through my mind and all I want is to shut my eyes and never see the light of day again.</p><p>The idea starts to seem better and better and I head to the bathroom to do... something. When I pass the mirror, though, I pause in front of it. My eyes are big and bloodshot and my skin is pallid. My thoughts drift back to when Micha made me look in the mirror at myself and he told me he loved me. I gently sketch the infinity tattoo on my back as a cloudy haze lifts from my mind.</p><p>There are people in this world who love me.</p><p>I wonder if my mom thought about this before she took her life.</p><p>I grab my phone, slip on my shoes, and run out of the house. It\u2019s midafternoon and the sun is shining as I sprint across the parking lot toward the school\u2019s main entrance. I haven\u2019t showered in days and still have on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt I\u2019ve been sleeping in. My hair is tangled in a ball behind my head and I have no makeup on, but it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>I burst into the therapist\u2019s office and luckily she\u2019s eating a sandwich instead of talking to a patient.</p><p>She springs up from her chair. \u201cElla, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Breathing profusely, I lower myself into the chair in front of her. \u201cI think I need help.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Micha</p><p>It\u2019s been over a couple of weeks since Ella sliced open my heart. My life\u2019s turned into a shithole, full of booze and meaningless woman, although I can never get anywhere with any of them. Just when things are about to go somewhere, Ella\u2019s sad eyes flash through my mind and I bail out. It\u2019s like I\u2019m back in high school again, searching for something to fill the void in my heart. Only the hole is twice as wide and the person who made it bigger is the only person who can fix it.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in the small apartment the band is renting for a month, writing some really messed-up lyrics that are too painfully insightful for an audience. I\u2019m getting more riled up the further into the song I get when there\u2019s a knock at the door.</p><p>I toss the pen onto the bed and drag my butt over to the door to open it.</p><p>\u201cDude, you look like crap.\u201d Ethan pushes past me and makes a circle around the room. It\u2019s a studio apartment with a bed in the corner and a set of old-school sofas in the center that face a television. \u201cSo this is where you\u2019ve been staying?\u201d</p><p>There are clothes all over the floor and I kick some out of the way as I trudge back to the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s not any worse than where we grew up.\u201d</p><p>He points over his shoulder at the door. \u201cI beg to differ on that one. Do you know some guy just tried to sell me a hooker on my way up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Danny,\u201d I say, picking up the pen. \u201cHe\u2019s always trying to sell something.\u201d</p><p>Ethan turns to me with this wary look on his face. \u201cSo I\u2019m on the road totally enjoying being by myself when I get this call from the lovely Miss Lila saying that you and Ella broke up.\u201d</p><p>I rub the back of my neck tensely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Ethan sits down on the couch and crosses his arms. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to talk about our feelings again?\u201d I toss the notebook and pen aside. \u201cOr do you want to go out and do something fun? How long are you here for? I don\u2019t have to play tonight so we can go out. There\u2019s this really awesome club I\u2019ve been wanting to check out and Dylan assures me there\u2019s a lot of slutty woman there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I love slutty women, I didn\u2019t come here to party.\u201d Shaking his head disappointedly, he continues. \u201cI came to tell you something Lila told me. I would have just called you, but I was down in Virginia and I thought, what the hell, I\u2019d come tell you myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pull on a T-shirt and shove my wallet into my back pocket, ready to leave him and go out by myself. \u201cMake it quick.\u201d</p><p>He rests his arms on the top of the sofa and his boots on the coffee table in front of it. \u201cShe didn\u2019t cheat on you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in the middle of reaching for my keys when I freeze. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Lila called me,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe said that as much as she hates to stab her best friend in the back, she thought it was too important not to tell me what Ella told her, after a lot of shots of tequila. She made the whole thing up. Said she did it because she wants you to be happy and in her eyes you can\u2019t be happy with her. Whatever the fuck that means. I never really understood half of the things she did\u2014or does.\u201d</p><p>My arms fall to my side, unsure whether to be pissed off or relieved. \u201cLet me get this straight. She lied, told me she cheated on me, just so she could break up with me.\u201d</p><p>Ethan surrenders his hands up in front of himself. \u201cDon\u2019t get pissed off at the messenger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pissed off.\u201d I sit down on the edge of the bed and drape my arms on my knees. \u201cI\u2019m confused as hell.\u201d</p><p>Ethan picks up a photo of the band from off the table and examines it. \u201cThat would make two of us.\u201d</p> <p>I flex my hands and pop my neck. \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>Setting the photo down, he deliberates it. \u201cYou feel like taking a road trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the wedding this weekend?\u201d I sink back against the wall and fiddle with my lip ring. \u201cDo you feel like driving my sorry ass to Chicago and back?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI got nothing better to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright then.\u201d I grab my empty bag off the floor and start stuffing it with clothes. \u201cLet\u2019s go on a road trip.\u201d</p><p>Ella</p> <p>Lila and I are getting ready to head out to the wedding. We rented a car for the trip, a midsize one this time, but it still takes forever to hit sixty.</p><p>Before we head out though, I make one last visit with my therapist. Anna felt it was important, considering I just had a nervous breakdown only a week ago.</p><p>My head is clear now, or at least partially, but it makes no sense to me what happened or why I said those terrible things to Micha. It made sense at the time, but it was like I was in a dream and when I woke up, the consequences punched me in the stomach. I considered calling him and apologizing, but I can\u2019t work up enough courage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing better then?\u201d she asks, jotting in a notebook. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any exhaustion or headaches, sensitivity to light?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling okay and the medication seems to be helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad.\u201d She puts her pen back in the black ceramic cup with the other pens. \u201cAnd remember what I said: act out, yell, scream, cry, whatever you need to do to get it out. Repressing it is where a lot of your problems come from.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything at all while you\u2019re on your vacation, call me.\u201d She hands me her card with her phone number on it and I put it in my purse. \u201cAnd I mean that, Ella. Call me, even if it\u2019s just to talk about the chicken you ate.\u201d</p> <p>I get up from the chair. \u201cChicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always have chicken at weddings.\u201d She smiles, but then she grows serious. \u201cRemember, just breathe and take things one step at a time. Don\u2019t rush life. You need to take it easy for a while and focus on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promise her and walk out the door, carrying her words of wisdom with me.</p><p>\u201cI have to say that this is seriously the prettiest wedding I\u2019ve been to.\u201d I take in the black and purple candles on the table and the flower petals scattered on the white table clothes that layer each of the eight tables.</p><p>The wedding is taking place outside, underneath a white canopy in the backyard of Caroline\u2019s parent\u2019s house, who live in a two-story mansion with columns and a wraparound porch. I dreamed of living in one of these houses when I was a little girl, but then I turned six and painfully realized that it wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for tonight?\u201d Lila glances down at the Rolex on her wrist. \u201cI mean the wedding\u2019s tomorrow, but still, I don\u2019t just want to sit around and watch them set everything up. I want to have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re obligated to do anything.\u201d I twist the cap off my soda and take a swig. \u201cI already got fitted for my bridesmaid\u2019s dress, which is so weird.\u201d</p><p>Her face contorts with confusion. \u201cWhy\u2019s that weird?\u201d</p><p>I screw the cap back on the bottle. \u201cBecause Caroline hardly knows me, so I don\u2019t understand why she wants me as one of her bridesmaids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be her sister-in-law, Ella.\u201d Lila scoops up a handful of petals and sprinkles them back onto the tablecloth. \u201cAnd she seems really nice.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at Caroline talking to the wedding planner. Her black hair grew out a little since the last time I saw her and she\u2019s wearing a long black dress with a jean jacket over it. Dean\u2019s at work and I\u2019ve barely seen him since we showed up yesterday morning.</p><p>\u201cWe could go back to the hotel and order room service,\u201d I suggest, returning my attention back to her. \u201cAnd charge everything to the room so Dean has to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>She giggles, winding a strand of her blonde hair around her finger. \u201cAs fun as that sounds\u2014since I\u2019m not really a fan of your brother\u2014I think we should go out and have some fun.\u201d</p><p>I rotate the bottle of soda between the palms of my hands. \u201cLila, I can\u2019t drink while I\u2019m on this medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to drink. We can go out and have some sober fun.\u201d Her eyes suddenly light up and she claps her hands animatedly. \u201cOh, we can go find a really fancy restaurant and charge it to the credit card my dad hasn\u2019t canceled yet.\u201d</p><p>A small smile curves at my lips. \u201cI think we\u2019re both feeling a little scandalous tonight.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, throwing her head back dramatically. \u201cOr maybe we both have family members who are total douche bags.\u201d</p><p>I laugh too and it feels weightless, like breathing in the fresh air. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it. But no sushi. I hate that crap.\u201d</p><p>We hike across the grass toward the paved driveway where the car is parked. It\u2019s chilly in Chicago compared to Vegas and when we get in the car, I crank up the heat. \u201cYou want to look something up on the GPS?\u201d</p><p>She scrolls through her phone. \u201cWe have to go back to the hotel first.\u201d</p><p>I back out of the driveway, maneuvering between the cars blocking the way. \u201cWhy? You look fine.\u201d</p><p>She looks down at her pink skinny jeans and her floral shirt. \u201cI know I do, but I left the credit card on the nightstand last night when we ordered pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then, to the hotel it is.\u201d I drive like a lunatic out onto the main road, skidding the tires in a pile of gravel, and Lila shoots me a dirty look.</p><p>I shrug innocently. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and plays with her phone during the five-minute drive to the hotel. I park out front underneath the canopy and leave the engine running. \u201cDo you want to just run in?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and drops the phone into the middle console. \u201cCome in with me, please. That front desk guy is such a creeper. He kept looking down my shirt the entire time we were checking in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t he, like, really old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to be at least in his forties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d we both say and cringe.</p><p>I roll the car forward into a spot, shut it off, and get out, meeting her around the back of the car. When we reach the sliding-glass doors, Lila catches my arm and stops me before I step foot over the threshold.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so whatever happens, I just want you to know that I did this for your own good,\u201d she says and frees my arm.</p><p>My eyebrows furrow. \u201cLila, what did you do...\u201d</p><p>She struts into the lobby toward two guys standing near the seating area across from the front desk. It takes my mind a second to process that it\u2019s Ethan and Micha.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lila.\u201d I\u2019m not ready for this. What I said to Micha... it\u2019s unforgivable, even if it wasn\u2019t true. I\u2019ll never be able to forget the look on his face, like he was child who just learned that his dog died.</p><p>Like always, his aqua eyes immediately magnetize to mine and I force my legs to move toward them. He has on a really nice pair of jeans and a red plaid shirt. Leather bands cover his wrists and his blond hair is tousled. It makes my hands ache to touch him, draw him, be with him forever.</p><p>When I reach them, Lila gives me a guilty smile and shrugs. I\u2019m sorry, she mouths.</p><p>I slant my chin up to look Micha in the eyes. \u201cHi,\u201d I manage to say stupidly.</p><p>Amusement gleams in his eyes. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other and a wave of intense emotions rolls over me. I love him more than anything.</p><p>God, why does my head have to be broken?</p><p>Ethan clears his throat and offers his hand to Lila. \u201cMaybe we should go check out the pool? It looked pretty big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, that\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d she says like she rehearsed it. She takes his hand and they walk to the elevator area in the corner of the lobby.</p><p>My eyes remain on them until they are out of view, then with difficulty, I redirect my attention to Micha and my heart leaps into my throat. \u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>He laughs at me, surprisingly happy. \u201cAre we going to keep the conversation to one-word sentences?\u201d</p><p>My shoulders unstiffen and my lips loosen to a tiny smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry... about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry.\u201d His intense gaze penetrates me as he sucks his lip ring between his teeth. \u201cStuff happens, right?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s different\u2014happier. What has he been up to for the last couple weeks? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Edging around him, I drop down into a chair in the seating area near the computer station.</p><p>I start with a simple question. \u201cHow are things going with the band?\u201d</p><p>He sits down in the chair across from mine, so we\u2019re facing each other, our knees barely inches away. \u201cThey\u2019re doing well I guess, but don\u2019t know... I think I might try to do some stuff on my own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I thought you were happy with being on the road,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I thought you liked your band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d He inclines forward and relaxes his arms on his knees. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure if I was ever happy with the situation. Dylan\u2019s freaking annoying and Chase barely talks. And Naomi, well she\u2019s getting on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>My thoughts drift to his lip ring and my mouth salivates to taste it. \u201cThen why were you on the road with them for so long?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicks to my lips and hunger flashes in his aqua eyes. \u201cBecause I love to play and they were my ticket in, but I hate being on the road all the time.\u201d</p><p>I tuck my hands underneath my legs to keep from reaching over and running my fingers along his lips. \u201cWhere will you go? Back to Star Grove?\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo way. I have a couple ideas, but I have to run it past a few people first.\u201d</p><p>The way he says \u201cpeople\u201d makes me wonder if they\u2019re important to him. My mind races with the idea that he\u2019s met someone else. It\u2019s been only a couple weeks since I crushed his heart, but Micha is amazing and most girls see that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to let me know where you end up.\u201d I gently bump my knee into his and fake a smile. \u201cI just might come visit you.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a quiet laugh, but his gaze is relentless. \u201cIs there anything you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>He seems so happy and I don\u2019t want to ruin it for him.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really, other than I\u2019m starving.\u201d I get to my feet, tugging down the bottom of my shirt. \u201cLila said she was buying dinner.\u201d</p> <p>He offers me his elbow. \u201cThen to dinner it is.\u201d</p><p>I loop my arm through his and we head toward the door, side by side, just like we used to do when we were friends.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Micha</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever fully understand what goes on in that head of hers. I gave her the perfect opportunity to tell me she never cheated and she totally dodged it. But in her eyes, she probably thinks that I\u2019ll move on.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s time, but how am I supposed to move on from the one person I know I\u2019m supposed to be with?</p><p>\u201cDude, I can\u2019t pronounce a single thing on this menu.\u201d Ethan runs his fingers along the list of appetizers, blinking his eyes. \u201cAre these prices in US dollars? Fuck.\u201d</p><p>A stuck-up-looking couple point their noses up in our direction. The restaurant seems overdone, with the trimming in gold, small chandeliers hanging over the top of each table, and silverware more shiny than the sun. It kind of reminds me of my dad\u2019s house. And I haven\u2019t seen or heard from him since our awkward meeting in New York.</p> <p>Ella shuts her menu and tosses it into the center of the table, looking at Lila with an entertained expression as she bats her long eyelashes. \u201cOh Lila Dila, I think you might have to order for us common folks, who can\u2019t read French.\u201d</p><p>Ethan and I shut our menus and toss them into the middle of the table, agreeing with her.</p><p>Lila sighs and tosses the menu on top of the stack. \u201cDo you guys want to bail and walk to the Applebees I saw on the corner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ethan, Ella, and I all say at the same time.</p><p>We leave the table in a hurry, before the waiter can come back and try to bill us for the rolls and drinks. We cause a scene as we dash out of the stuffy restaurant laughing our asses off. It\u2019s Friday and the sidewalk is as crowded as the traffic on the street. Lights dance across our faces and there\u2019s excitement buzzing in the air.</p><p>Ella raises her hands above her head as she squeezes through a group of guys and my protective instincts kick in. I put my hand on her back, keeping her close as one of the guys tries to check out her ass. I can\u2019t really blame him, since I\u2019m doing the same thing.</p><p>She has a tight pair of jeans on and a black shirt short enough that there is a sliver of space between the top of her jeans and the bottom of her shirt. Her pale skin looks soft and I let my finger run along it gently, as if it\u2019s accidental.</p><p>She peers over her shoulder and the lights reflect in her eyes as she shouts over the noise, \u201cThis reminds me of senior year when we took that road trip to New Orleans!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one where you took your shirt off and flashed everyone.\u201d I wink at her and she swats my arm.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen and you know it,\u201d she says, forcing back a smile.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I yell over the loud music from a band playing in front of a gift shop. \u201cBut that night was much more intense than this!\u201d</p><p>The noise fades out as we walk into the restaurant. There\u2019s a row of people waiting for a table, but it\u2019s still much better than the other place. Lila heads up to the hostess standing at the front to put our names down on the waiting list.</p><p>\u201cThat night was intense, but only because of you.\u201d Ethan smirks maliciously. \u201cIf you could have just kept it in your pants, then we wouldn\u2019t have had to run away from the club.\u201d</p><p>Lila returns and her eyes scan the three of us. \u201cI\u2019m so lost. Who couldn\u2019t keep it in their pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019re lost, trust me.\u201d I pat her arm as Ella and Ethan start to laugh. \u201cThese two are just trying to embarrass me with a drunken mistake of my past.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018But she looked so hot when we were dancing,\u2019 \u201d Ella says mocking me in a deep voice. \u201c \u2018And I swear she looked younger.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Ethan busts up laughing, leaning in toward Ella, who\u2019s laughing just as hard. Ethan told me about their little shake thing with Mikey and it seems like it kind of broke down a barrier between the two of them.</p><p>I shove Ethan and he staggers into a tall blonde with a big rack and his hand ends up touching her boob. Ella whirls toward the wall laughing her ass off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ethan apologizes to the blonde with an amused grin. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s probably around the same age as us, maybe a little older. She narrows her eyes and stomps off toward the seating area with her arms crossed as she sinks down at the end of the bench.</p><p>\u201cThanks for making me look like a perv.\u201d Ethan scowls at me and then glances discretely at Lila.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need my help with that, man.\u201d I notice that Ella is still facing the wall and her shoulders are shaking. \u201cOh pretty girl, are you alive over there?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she turns around with her hand covering her mouth and tears streaming out of her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says between laughs. \u201cI just can\u2019t stop picturing that lady in New Orleans and how you almost did her in the bathroom. And then we had to drag you out of the club as she chased after us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happened?\u201d Lila starts to giggle and her legs almost buckle from under her as she hunches over, clutching at her stomach.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t that old, like maybe thirty-five or forty,\u201d I argue, moving aside as some people walk in through the door and let in a cool breeze. \u201cAnd I was drunk.\u201d</p><p>Ethan pats my shoulder and gives me a sympathetic look. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We all love our cougars.\u201d</p><p>I punch him in the arm and Ella laughs so hard she can barely stand. I decide she needs to be punished too so I fix my gaze on her. She stops laughing and her lips shift to a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scare me, Micha Scott.\u201d She backs toward the corner. \u201cI know you won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I won\u2019t ever hurt you.\u201d I spread my hands out to the side, so she\u2019s got no place to run. \u201cBut I did see a water fountain down the block.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d she pleads with her hands out protectively in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s like fifty degrees outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve it.\u201d I easily pick her up and throw her over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMicha.\u201d She squirms as I push out the doors and onto the sidewalk. We turn heads as I march toward the fountain at the end of the street just in front of a park. When I reach the marble edge of it, I pause, deciding what to do. Jump in and toss her under the spraying water? Or just set her down in it?</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you and water?\u201d She elevates her head and brushes her hair out of her face to look me in the eyes. \u201cWhether it\u2019s sprinklers or showers\u2014you\u2019re always getting me wet.\u201d</p><p>Unable to help myself, I spread my fingers along the back of her thigh and give her ass a squeeze. \u201cAm I making you wet right now?\u201d</p><p>She looks like she\u2019s going to cry, which was not the reaction I was expecting. \u201cHow can you joke around with me? After what I did?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, tug my pants higher up onto my waist, and step into water, which fills up my boots instantly. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s cold.\u201d I wade out to one of the various streams of water that surround two angel statues slanted together with harps in their hands. Water soaks my jeans as I set her down in the middle of it, letting her get drenched.</p><p>She squeals, panting from the cold. \u201cYou are the meanest guy I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>Water rivers from the fountain and down her rock-hard body. It takes me back to the time in the shower when I touched her all over for the first time. God, I fucking miss touching her like that.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true.\u201d I step forward, to the edge of the stream, and take in her wet clothes. \u201cIn fact, I think you know I\u2019m the nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t argue, just moves out from the water, and wrings out her hair. \u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>A weight falls from my shoulders and I open my mouth to tell her we should go somewhere to talk, when someone screams. Our eyes dart to the edge of the fountain where Lila is sitting in the water, her clothes and hair soaked, and Ethan is standing on the marble step, laughing hysterically. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ella busts up laughing as Ethan steps into the pool of water that surrounds the fountain and we end up having a full-on water fight. We stop only when security shows up and we run into the nearby park in our wet clothes. I\u2019m not much of an artist, only with lyrics, but if someone were to snap a picture of us in the fountain, I\u2019m sure they would see a rare moment of perfection.</p><p>Ella</p><p>I haven\u2019t had a night like this since I was fifteen and Micha and I spent the entire day out at the lake on a small raft we \u201cborrowed\u201d from the neighbors. It was one of those days of simplicity, but it meant everything because there was no darkness, only light.</p> <p>We get a lot of glares as we walk through the lobby of the hotel in our sopping clothes, leaving a trail of water along the tile floor. The guys didn\u2019t get their own room and apparently they\u2019re too broke, so Lila and I decide to let them stay, even though it makes me uneasy.</p><p>When we get up to the room, Micha peels off his shirt and chucks himself onto the bed, while Ethan kicks his boots off by the door.</p><p>Ethan rubs his hands together. \u201cWho\u2019s up for a community shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you including Micha in your request too?\u201d I joke maliciously as I shut the bedroom door.</p><p>He scowls at me, pulling a disgusted face. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p> <p>I stick out my tongue as Micha shakes his head disappointedly. \u201cPretty girl, you took it one step too far.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, grabbing some pajamas out of my bag and running into the bathroom. \u201cSince you\u2019re the one who threw me in, you can take the shower last.\u201d</p><p>He starts to run for me and I close the door, laughing. Once I\u2019m alone, I assess the night. I don\u2019t understand. Why is he being so nice to me? Does he... did he figure out I was lying?</p><p>I strip off my clothes and toss them in the corner, then turn on the shower, waiting until it warms up before I step in. I\u2019m washing my hair with the hotel shampoo when the lock on the door clicks.</p><p>I know who it is because he taught me how to pick a lock. \u201cSeriously, Micha, no more for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Lila says and something lands on the counter with a clank. \u201cI just needed to brush my teeth. I think I got fountain water in my mouth.\u201d</p> <p>Soap stings in my eyes. \u201cDid you pick the lock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Micha did it for me.\u201d She turns the water on briefly, but it\u2019s enough to make the temperature change.</p><p>I shiver as I rinse the rest of the shampoo out of my hair. The sink turns off and then it turns quiet. \u201cLila?\u201d I wonder if she left.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever planning on telling him the truth?\u201d Lila finally asks. \u201cThat you didn\u2019t cheat on him, but that you had a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous breakdown\u2014you can say it.\u201d My hands remain in my hair and soap drips down my face. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to tell him.\u201d</p><p>I hear her sit down on top of the toilet. \u201cCan I ask why not?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing hard, I peek out from the curtain. \u201cBecause he seems happy, and if he is, then I don\u2019t want to ruin it for him. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted for him.\u201d</p><p>She sighs heavy-heartedly. \u201cElla, when are you going to realize that you two belong together? Everyone who lays eyes on you can see it and is envious of it because that kind of love isn\u2019t supposed to exist.\u201d</p> <p>I wipe some water from my face. \u201cWhat kind of love are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind of love that owns you.\u201d She gets up, gives a quick look in the mirror, and combs her fingers through her damp hair. \u201cThe kind where you know the other person inside and out. Where you can go through hell and back and still make it out okay.\u201d She leaves me alone with her heavy words echoing in my head.</p><p>I shut off the water and climb out of the shower. After I\u2019m dressed, I exit the bathroom with my hands crossed over my chest, because I forgot to grab a clean bra.</p><p>Micha is leaning against the headboard with his shirt and shoes off, and the remote pointed at the television. His eyes connect with mine and a smile curls at his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you crossing your arms like that, pretty girl,\u201d he says with a mischievous sparkle in his eyes.</p><p>I lie flat on my stomach on the bed next to his. \u201cWhere\u2019re Lila and Ethan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey went to raid the vending machine.\u201d His eyes roam across my body and my skin tingles as my breath catches. \u201cSo it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>I press my lip together to hide the sound of my erratic breathing. \u201cSo it is.\u201d</p><p>He slides his legs off the bed and he studies me momentarily. \u201cI should probably take a shower.\u201d He has a look on his face like he\u2019s enjoying himself. Without saying another word, he gets some clothes out of his bag on the floor and struts off to the bathroom, doing that sexy walk he does when he knows someone is watching him.</p><p>I end up passing out and when I wake up, the room is dark and soundless. The blankets are pulled over me and someone\u2019s warm breath is dusting my cheeks. I was under the impression that I\u2019d be sharing a bed with Lila, but I hope the warm body sleeping very close to me isn\u2019t hers.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d Micha whispers and his breath tickles my cheek.</p><p>I let my eyes adjust to the dark and make out the outline of his face. \u201cKind of.\u201d</p><p>I hear him sucking on his lip ring. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep. I have too much pent-up energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver what?\u201d I utter quietly.</p><p>\u201cOver you,\u201d he says in a low voice. \u201cAnd the fact that you\u2019re sleeping only inches away without a bra on and all I want to do is touch you. It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you want to touch me after what I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I ever not want to touch you?\u201d</p><p>His words confuse me in the strangest way, but I crave his touch, so slowly, I hitch my leg over his hip. His breathing hitches and then the palm of his hand slides up my bare leg, leaving a trail of heat along my skin. He doesn\u2019t say a word as his hand sneaks up the side of my shorts, scoots my panties to the side, and seconds later his fingers are inside me.</p><p>My teeth clamp down on my lip as he starts to feel me thoroughly. It\u2019s like we\u2019re doing something forbidden in the dark room with Ethan and Lila only a few feet away. His mouth fumbles against my lips as his warm tongue urges them apart. He keeps moving his fingers inside me as he nips at my lip and feels my breasts with his free hand, rubbing his thumb along my nipple, driving my body crazy.</p><p>\u201cMicha...\u201d I groan.</p><p>\u201cShh...\u201d he murmurs against my lips.</p><p>He continues to suffocate me with his kisses until he pushes me over the edge. Clutching onto him, my head tips back and I try to breathe through it quietly.</p><p>When I recompose myself, he kisses my forehead and slips his finger out of me. \u201cNow I can sleep,\u201d he whispers, and within minutes, his breathing becomes calm.</p><p>I\u2019m left wide-awake and I have a feeling he did it on purpose.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Micha</p><p>I wake up feeling good. The sun is shining through the window and my mind is calm and relaxed. I know it was a dirty move to get back at her, but it wasn\u2019t like it was a punishment for her either. I just left her wide awake, hot and bothered, a feeling I\u2019m becoming very familiar with.</p><p>I sit up, rub my eyes, and realize Ella and Lila are missing from the room.</p><p>\u201cWell, good morning, princess,\u201d Ethan says from the table. He\u2019s eating a doughnut and has an energy drink in his hand. \u201cDid you have a good night\u2019s rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d I climb out of bed and slip on a black T-shirt.</p><p>He stuffs the rest of the doughnut into his mouth and dusts the crumbs off his hands on the front of his jeans. \u201cThe alarm didn\u2019t go off so they ran out of here about ten minutes ago, freaking out about not having enough time to get their hair done. Or at least that\u2019s what Lila was saying... Ella seemed a little distracted.\u201d</p><p>I eye him over as I search through my bag for my watch. \u201cAre you insinuating something? Because you have this stupid look on your face and it\u2019s getting on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>He sips his drink and pushes up from the chair. \u201cOnly that the next time you two fool around in the dark with other people in the room, you might want to try being a little bit quieter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo me a favor,\u201d I say, \u201cdon\u2019t say anything to Ella. You\u2019re gonna make things weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeirder than you two already made them?\u201d He crushes the can and shoots it into the trashcan in the corner. \u201cBecause those noises from last night are going to haunt my nightmares for a long time.\u201d</p><p>I change the subject, clipping my watch onto my wrist. \u201cWhat the heck are we supposed to wear to a wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell should I know?\u201d He glances down at his long-sleeve black shirt pulled over a gray T-shirt and his dark jeans. \u201cI was going to go like this.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing a black pinstriped shirt and a pair of my nicest jeans, I head off to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cHas she admitted she was lying?\u201d Ethan flips on the television and flops down on one of the beds, crossing his feet.</p><p>I halt in the doorway and glance over my shoulder at him. \u201cNo... As usual, she\u2019s being stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a thought.\u201d He drops the remote on the nightstand. \u201cYou could always tell her you know and save yourself all the drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d I explain. \u201cI don\u2019t like to push her into doing things... because...\u201d I trail off, knowing I can\u2019t tell him about the bridge or how she looked on that bathroom floor when she told me.</p><p>When she\u2019s ready, she\u2019ll tell... at least I hope. But what if she doesn\u2019t? What if I\u2019ve spent my life chasing a ghost?</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019m severely disappointed in the bridesmaid lineup,\u201d Ethan comments, eyeballing the bridesmaids standing just outside the canopy entrance.</p><p>We are sitting in the back row waiting for this little shindig to start while people scurry back and forth through the tent. The front of the area is decorated with purple flowers and the main aisle is lined with black and purple ribbons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019re all married,\u201d I tell him, resting my foot up on my knee. \u201cAnd about ten years older than you.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and leans back into the fold-up chair. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do then? This thing doesn\u2019t start for another hour and I\u2019m getting bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll survive...\u201d My attention drifts to Ella as she walks beneath the canopy and up to Caroline, who\u2019s talking to a short guy in a gray suit, waving her hands animatedly. Ella has on a short, black velvet dress that shows of her long legs and bare shoulders. There\u2019s a red ribbon around the middle and a red flower in her hair.</p> <p>She\u2019s fucking beautiful. That\u2019s all there is to it.</p><p>\u201cDude, wipe the drool off your chin.\u201d Ethan slaps the back of my head.</p><p>I shove him and he pushes me back. Letting out a deep breath, my eyes reconnect to Ella. She says something to Caroline and hands the glass of champagne to her. Caroline downs it and gives the glass back to Ella before rushing away, holding the front of her dress.</p><p>Ella sets the glass on a chair and presses her fingers to the bridge of her nose as her gaze finds me. Her eyes silently plead for me to follow her as she ducks out of the tent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I say, rising to my feet. \u201cAnd try not to get into any trouble while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p> <p>I weave through the aisles and duck outside into the sunshine and cool air. A forest encloses the house and Ella strolls down the grassy hill until she vanishes into the trees crisped with autumn.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d I mutter as I follow her.</p><p>When I step into the forest, she\u2019s leaning against a tree and the thick forest obscures every aspect of the wedding, except for the muffled noise of voices. It\u2019s like we\u2019re in our own private little world.</p><p>I walk slowly toward her. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>Her hands are tucked behind her back and she\u2019s chewing on her bottom lip anxiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t cheat on you. I lied about it.\u201d</p><p>I reduce the gap between us so we\u2019re within reaching distance. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyebrows dip together. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila told Ethan.\u201d I inch closer to her, and my gaze skims down to the cleavage popping out of the dress. \u201cAnd Ethan told me.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slump as she exhales, relieved. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I figure you had some reason why you weren\u2019t telling me.\u201d My fingers itch to touch her, long to run along her body and feel inside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was the only thing I could think of that would make you let me go. You deserve better than what I can give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not.\u201d She shrugs nonchalantly. \u201cBecause eventually you\u2019ll hate me... It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never hate you.\u201d I tuck a strand of her hair behind her ear and let my fingers stroke the side of her neck before I pull away. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even hate you when I thought you cheated. Yeah, I was furious, but I still loved you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat day I said that\u2014those days I couldn\u2019t get out of bed, I was having a nervous breakdown. My therapist put me on some stuff for anxiety and depression.\u201d Her eyes turn watery like she might cry. \u201cMicha, you don\u2019t want this, trust me. I watched my mother\u2019s problems eat away at my dad... I\u2019ll drag you into that dark hole with me. You just need to go. Walk away. Please walk away.\u201d</p><p>With the pad of my thumb, I wipe a tear that escapes her eye. \u201cI hate to say this Ella, but your father is fucking weak. He can\u2019t blame what he does on anyone but himself. And I\u2019m not him and you\u2019re not your mom. Just because their story ended badly doesn\u2019t mean our will.\u201d</p><p>She turns her head away to avoid my gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t want this for you.\u201d</p><p>I hook my finger under her chin and force her to look at me as I brace a hand on the tree beside her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, pretty girl, but you really don\u2019t get to choose what I want, what I do, or who I get to be with. So unless you want me to leave you because you don\u2019t love me anymore, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>When she doesn\u2019t say anything, I crash my lips into hers and she gasps as her fingers knot into my hair. Crushing my body against hers, my hand wanders down her side, along the curve of her breast, each rib, and to the bottom of her dress. I reach up it, grab hold of her panties, and slide them down her legs. When they\u2019re to her knees, she draws back slightly and kicks them off, and then she flips the button of my jeans open. I lift her up and press her against into the tree as I thrust inside her.</p><p>When I reunite my mouth with hers, she bites down on my lip. It drives me crazy as she gently pulls my lip ring into her mouth while running her tongue along it. Holding her by the hip, my other hand travels up her body to the top of her dress, and I yank it down to cup her breast.</p><p>Her eyes glaze over as she her head falls back. \u201cMicha, I do love you but I...\u201d</p><p>I kiss her fervently, drawing away only for a second to say, \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Ella</p><p>I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible for it to feel this good, just because he\u2019s inside me, but it does. God, it does. My intentions weren\u2019t meant to lead to sex when I went out into the forest. I just wanted to tell him the truth away from everyone\u2014he deserved the truth.</p><p>I think Lila was right, though. Micha\u2019s love owns me and I\u2019ll probably always end up giving into him as long as he keeps trying. But I still fear I\u2019ll break him, and that boy is too damn sweet and beautiful to ruin.</p><p>He\u2019s thrusting inside me as he pins my arms above my head and the bark of the tree scrapes my back. But it\u2019s worth the pain as I scream out in bliss and my worries fleetingly vanish.</p><p>His movements begin to slow, and then he pushes deep inside me one last time, before stilling. We pant, fervently clinging onto to each other, our skin damp, our hearts racing.</p><p>\u201cI really love that dress,\u201d he whispers in my ear and the heat of his breath makes me shiver. \u201cYou look beautiful in it.\u201d</p><p>A smile touches my lips and I slant back to look him in the eyes. \u201cYou tell me that too much. It\u2019s making me cocky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m the cocky one.\u201d His smile is almost blinding.</p><p>My face turns serious as I lightly brush my swollen lips to his. \u201cWe still need to talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla!\u201d Lila\u2019s voice echoes through the forest. \u201cCaroline needs you!\u201d</p><p>I jump out of Micha\u2019s arms and adjust my dress back over my breasts as I search the ground. \u201cWhere\u2019s my underwear?\u201d</p><p>Micha laughs as he watches me search through an area of tall grass. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to have to make it through the day without them.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on my hips. \u201cYou want me to stand up in front of a bunch of people, at a wedding, without anything on underneath my dress?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, doing up the button of his jeans. \u201cIt\u2019d be kind of nice. You could have a cool breeze and if you bent over just right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla!\u201d Lila\u2019s voice is getting closer. \u201cWhere the heck are you? I know you came out here! I saw you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha, please, if you know where they are, just tell me.\u201d I peek behind the tree and when I turn around, he has a smile on his face and my black thong is dangling off his finger.</p><p>I snatch them away and slip them back on, smoothing out my dress. Then I hurry back through the trees, pulling bits of leaves and twigs out of my hair with Micha at my heels, chuckling under his breath.</p><p>Lila is waiting at the border of the forest and her eyebrows arc when she sees Micha is with me. \u201cUmm... Caroline needs you to get ready.\u201d Laughter hints her voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I hurry up the hill, leaving the two of them to walk back to the canopy together.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do. I still believe that I\u2019m not good for him, even though he insists the opposite, but I can\u2019t seem to stay away from him.</p><p>Around the corner of the canopy, there is a line of bridesmaids dressed in the same black velvet dresses and the groomsmen wearing matching tuxes. Caroline is at the front next to her father, an older man with salt-and-pepper hair. Her wedding dress is beautiful, not quite white but close, with a black ribbon tied around the center and the bottom flowing out at the waist.</p><p>Caroline\u2019s expression relaxes as she presses her hand against her heart, crushing some of the flowers in her bouquet. \u201cThank God, Ella.\u201d She bunches her dress up and rushes toward me. \u201cWhy do you have leaves in your hair?\u201d</p><p>My hand shoots up to my hair and bits and piece of twigs fall out. \u201cI went for a walk in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry up and get in line.\u201d She gives me a small bouquet and shoos me toward the back of the line. \u201cIt\u2019s about to start.\u201d</p><p>I hurry beside the groomsman, who\u2019s shorter than me with black hair that curls up at his ears. He\u2019s probably my age and I feel his eyes on me, checking me out, but my attention remains ahead at the front of the line. Inside, Dean is standing next to the minister in his tux and his brown hair is styled to the side. He looks happy and I envy him with every ounce of my heart.</p><p>I\u2019ve never thought about marriage like most girls do. When I was younger, I didn\u2019t play dress up and make the boy next door be my groom. I never looked that far forward into the future, because I feared what lay ahead.</p><p>But watching Dean about to get married, I wonder if marriage is in my future. I struggle to breathe as panic strangles me, wanting to see it, but all there is is a black hole with no images.</p><p>The music starts and my thoughts snap back to reality. The line moves forward gradually and the groomsman links arms with me.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Luke, by the way,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>I jolt away from him. \u201cMine\u2019s Ella.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me as we enter into the canopy where purple and black ribbons hang from the ceiling, lights sparkle along the walls, and rows and rows of violets decorate the front area. Everyone is staring and I grow more anxious, but I breathe through it. When we reach the end of the aisle, I happily release Luke\u2019s arm and walk to the back of the row of bridesmaids. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clutching onto the bouquet, I focus on Caroline and Dean, but there is a heightened sense of awareness that Micha is watching me from the back row.</p><p>The minister starts his speech and my mind automatically drifts to my future again. I want to see it desperately. I want to know how my life goes.</p><p>Adrenaline consumes my body and I fidget with the petals on the violet flowers, mentally telling myself to stay calm as Dean and Caroline read their vows. Listening to their words of love and commitment, my body stills. I want this. So much. I want someone to be mine forever\u2014I want Micha.</p> <p>But I need to become a person we can both love; otherwise we\u2019ll never make it.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Micha</p><p>I can\u2019t take my eyes off her the entire ceremony. She\u2019s never been much of a crier in public so it\u2019s startling to watch her try to choke back the tears and all I want to do is comfort her.</p><p>Dean looks really happy, which kind of annoys me. Ella might have dusted what he did under the rug, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. He\u2019s part of what broke her\u2014part of why Ella will never be the same girl.</p> <p>The minister declares, \u201cYou may kiss the bride.\u201d</p><p>Dean and Caroline lean into one another and kiss, and everyone stands up and claps. As they walk down the aisle, people throw rose petals at them from the baskets placed in front of each chair. Lila collects a handful and joins in, throwing petals in the air.</p><p>Ethan rolls his eyes. \u201cI suddenly remembered why I never go to weddings,\u201d he utters under his breath. \u201cThey\u2019re too cheesy for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d I reply, not completely agreeing with him. \u201cBut the cheesiness does have a point.\u201d</p><p>Once Caroline and Dean leave the canopy, the groomsmen and bridesmaids follow in a line. The guy Ella\u2019s been paired up with annoyingly keeps checking her out and he whispers something to her as they walk outside.</p><p>The crowd moves across the yard to the back deck of the house, where another canopy is set up over tables decorated with rose petals and candles. There are lights strung across the ceiling and a massive chocolate fountain against the back wall.</p> <p>Ella waits at the front where a cameraman is getting set up to take pictures. As she waits, her gaze collides with mine. She rolls her eyes, like she thinks this whole thing is silly and I wink at her.</p><p>Ethan, Lila, and I steal a few glasses of champagne and plates of cake and pick a table near the bar, drinking in silence as the music turns on.</p><p>\u201cSo how long are we obligated to stay here, do you think?\u201d Ethan gags on the glass of champagne. \u201cGod, rich people have bad taste in drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lila protests, setting her glass on the table. \u201cI think it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re rich,\u201d Ethan jokes, shoving up the sleeves of his shirt, and then he takes a bite of his cake. \u201cAnd you were brought up to think that expensive stuff tastes good.\u201d</p><p>Lila sticks out her tongue and there\u2019s purple frosting on it. \u201cI think you might be the one with bad taste.\u201d</p><p>Ethan scrunches his eyebrows, like he\u2019s overthinking. \u201cNah, I have excellent taste.\u201d</p><p>Ethan used to give me crap about Ella and my needing to screw and get it over with. I\u2019m considering telling him the same thing about Lila and him.</p> <p>Ella drops the bouquet before slumping into the chair next to me. \u201cGod, weddings are exhausting.\u201d</p><p>I pluck a piece of grass out of her hair and flick it on the ground. \u201cYou want to get out of here? We could go get some dinner or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave yet.\u201d She frowns, rests her head back on the chair, and stares up at the ceiling. \u201cThere are more pictures to come.\u201d</p><p>She straightens up in the chair and steals a bite of my cake, leaving a little bit of purple frosting on her bottom lip. I want to lean over so badly and lick it off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks when she notices me staring.</p><p>I reach toward her and she freezes as my thumb grazes her bottom lip. \u201cWe should dance.\u201d</p><p>She arches her eyebrows. \u201cSince when do either of us dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always dance.\u201d Extending my hand to her, I get to my feet.</p><p>\u201cBut our dancing is a lot different than their dancing.\u201d She points a finger at the area where people are slow dancing. \u201cWe\u2019d probably scar their innocent little minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ella May, dance with me.\u201d Dazzling her with my most alluring smile, I keep my hand out, hoping she\u2019ll take it.</p><p>Sighing, she laces her fingers with mine, and I pull her to her feet. When we reach the center of the dance floor, I twirl her around and collide her into me. A smile tugs at her lips as I put my hands on her hips. Guiding her closer, she hooks her arms around the back of my neck.</p><p>As we dance to the music, I put my lips beside her ear and sing along with the lyrics.</p><p>She leans back to look me in the eyes. \u201cHow do you know the lyrics to \u201cThe Story\u201d? Most guys don\u2019t listen to Brandi Carlile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh... don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d I wink at her and hug her closer. \u201cAnd you used to listen to this song all the time. How could I not know the lyrics?\u201d</p><p>She clutches onto me as I continue to sing. Her head rests on my shoulder and I\u2019m no longer scared of telling her how I feel. I want her to know\u2014need her to understand, because holding it inside is no longer an option.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ella May,\u201d I whisper, kissing her cheek. \u201cAnd one day I want to be doing this exact same thing at our wedding.\u201d</p><p>Ella</p><p>\u201cThe Story\u201d by Brandi Carlile plays through the room, soft lyrics that tell a story that hits straight at my heart. Micha is looking into my eyes deeply and winning my heart more than he already has.</p><p>Then he tells me that he wants to do this exact thing at our wedding and my lungs compress. I want to run away and hide, but I fight to hold onto my sanity.</p><p>\u201cMicha, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He puts a finger over my lips. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, okay? Just think about it for a while. I\u2019m not talking about right this second. I just want you to know how I feel.\u201d</p><p>I lift his finger away. \u201cI have to say this because it\u2019s important that you know how I feel. I can\u2019t do this right now.\u201d His face falls as I continue. \u201cBut someday, yes. I need to get myself together first. I need to be okay with myself before I give you my whole heart.\u201d</p><p>He studies my face. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I think we should be friends until I can figure out how to get myself together again,\u201d I explain. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything to hurt you, and right now I just don\u2019t know if I can do that.\u201d</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow. \u201cYou want us to be friends? Because I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to, and then maybe one day down the road, after I\u2019ve put my shit together, we can be more, but only if you still want to.\u201d I summon a deep breath, my insides hurting as I add, \u201cIf someone better comes along, I don\u2019t want you to hesitate because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else could ever be better than you,\u201d he says, and I start to open my mouth to protest, but he talks over me. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what you need, then I\u2019ll do it. We can be friends... for a while.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not completely committed, but I didn\u2019t expect him to be. He\u2019s the most determined person I know.</p><p>I kiss his cheek and then place my head on his shoulder, breathing in the comforting smell of him as we sway in sync to the music, holding on, yet letting go.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Micha</p><p>It\u2019s been a few days since Ella and I parted from the wedding, but it feels like months. We talk on the phone several times a day, but it\u2019s not the same between us and I miss being with her.</p><p>\u201cMan, I\u2019m so bored,\u201d Ethan complains as he surfs the channels with his boots kicked up on the coffee table. \u201cCan\u2019t we just go do something?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m lying on my bed reading the message over and over again. A text showed up on my phone yesterday from my dad. It said he needed to see me\u2014that he had something he wanted to ask. I\u2019ve been staring at it, deciding if walking down that road with him again is a good idea. We\u2019ve met two times and each one was uncomfortable and painful, but my mind won\u2019t be able to settle until I know what he wants.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... I guess we could go get something to eat.\u201d Sitting up, I swing my legs off the edge of the bed, and text my dad, asking him where he wants to meet up.</p><p>He texts me back quicker than I anticipated, asking me if I can meet him at the bakery up on Ninth Street in about an hour. Wavering, I finally text back that I will.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I can\u2019t go out.\u201d I put on a black hoodie and zip it up. \u201cI have to go meet someone.\u201d</p><p>He targets me with a condemning look. \u201cA girl someone?\u201d</p><p>I scoop up the house keys from off the top of the dresser. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just someone I used to know.\u201d</p><p>His face twists with confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s not Naomi, is it? Because I\u2019d like to advise that you stay away from that\u2014she\u2019s crazy. She basically tried to rape me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I like my women and everything, but she\u2019s a little too much. She went from the bartender to some dude handing out flyers on the street to me. Besides, she has a thing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I put my wallet into the back pocket of my jeans. \u201cYou weren\u2019t the only one she hit on last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d His eyes widen. \u201cAnd I thought I was bad.\u201d</p><p>I stuff my phone into the pocket of my hoodie. \u201cCan you do me a favor? Can you tell Dylan or Chase when\u2014if\u2014they show up, that I might not make it to practice?\u201d</p><p>He rummages through the very slim selection of food in the fridge. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll show up? I mean, you haven\u2019t seen anyone but Naomi since you got back and neither of them showed up to practice yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I open the front door and notice it\u2019s raining. \u201cBut just in case they show, will you tell them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugs as he selects a carton of juice out of the fridge. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll tell them... but doesn\u2019t it seem like your band\u2019s falling apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I mutter and shut the door. Pulling my hood over my head, I trot down stairs and out into the rain, splashing through puddles as I march toward the street.</p><p>Ever since the little incident with Naomi, things in the band have gotten rocky. It started with her not wanting to be around me, and then Dylan and Chase lost interest when they discovered they could make a lot of money bartending at this club exclusively for women.</p> <p>Right now, though, I\u2019m more concerned about what I\u2019m about to walk into with my father.</p><p>When I arrive at the bakery and see my dad sitting at a table, I almost pussy out. I tap my hand anxiously on my leg, staring at him through the window as rain drips down on me. He\u2019s reading the paper and drinking a cup of coffee. Dressed in a gray suit and a red tie with a briefcase next to his feet, he looks like a lawyer. Suddenly, I realize I have no idea what he does or who he is. He\u2019s nothing more than a stranger, like the people passing by me on the sidewalk.</p><p>I man up and walk into the bakery. It smells like vanilla and kind of reminds me of Ella. Two of the eight tables are occupied and the cashier girl behind the display, filled with cupcakes and cookies, undresses me with her eyes.</p><p>My dad looks up from his coffee and his aqua eyes widen. \u201cOh, Micha, you showed up.\u201d</p><p>I slide out a chair and sit down across from him. \u201cOf course I showed up. When I say I\u2019m going to be somewhere, I always show up. That\u2019s the kind of person I am and you\u2019d know that if you knew me.\u201d</p> <p>He clears his throat multiple times while smoothing out invisible wrinkles on his tie. \u201cLook, Micha, I\u2019m really sorry for what I\u2019ve done. For being a shitty father and for just not being there.\u201d</p><p>My forehead creases as I cross my arms and slump back in the chair. \u201cI don\u2019t get why you\u2019re saying that, because the last two times I saw you, you made it pretty clear that you didn\u2019t really care about me and you wanted nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>Tearing some packets open, he adds sugar to his coffee with unsteady hands. \u201cThings change... some stuff happened, and... well, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him expressionlessly. \u201cIs that why you said you were sorry to me? Because you want something from me?\u201d</p><p>He discards the empty packets onto the table. \u201cDo you want me to get you something? Do you want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to continue on with what you want,\u201d I say coldly. \u201cBecause I\u2019m really fucking curious where this conversation is going.\u201d</p> <p>He stirs the coffee and wipes the spoon on the lip of the cup. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure how to start this conversation...\u201d He drops the spoon onto the table. \u201cI was recently diagnosed with aplastic anemia... Do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a doctor?\u201d I shake my head, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll skip the boring medical terms and get straight to the point. It\u2019s a rare disease and I\u2019ve got a severe case of it.\u201d He stares down at the cracks in the table, with his eyebrows knit, and wrinkles form around his eyes. \u201cI need a blood and marrow transplant and the best thing for that is to get a relative to be the donor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you dying?\u201d I eye him over. \u201cYou look healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not dying.\u201d His voice is as cold as ice. \u201cBut I\u2019m not healthy either, and this could help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your other kids? Why can\u2019t you ask them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that to them. They\u2019re too young and... I don\u2019t even want them to know I\u2019m sick.\u201d</p><p>I hover over the table, putting my palms flat on the table, burning with anger, and the chair legs grind loudly against the floor. \u201cSo let me guess this straight. You want me to do it, even though you haven\u2019t talk to me in years? You bailed on me when I was a child and I still don\u2019t even know why you didn\u2019t at least stay in touch with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMicha, I said I was sorry.\u201d He reaches across the table like he\u2019s going to pat my hand, but retreats, which is a good thing because I probably would have punched him. \u201cAnd this is bigger than that\u2014I\u2019m sick.\u201d</p><p>I shove away from the table. \u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it.\u201d</p><p>He picks up his briefcase and stands up too. \u201cCan you at least go get checked to see if you\u2019ll make a good donor? These things take time.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes I wish I could be a douche bag and walk away. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll go get checked, but it\u2019s not for you. It\u2019s so I don\u2019t have to feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>Ella</p><p>It\u2019s been almost two weeks since the wedding and I talk to Micha every day on the phone. The conversations are light, except for the occasional dirty comment from him, but that was always normal, even when we were friends before.</p><p>I miss him like crazy and think about him an unhealthy amount of hours during the day. He consumes my thoughts, my body, my dreams\u2014he\u2019s what drives me to be better.</p><p>It\u2019s midday, the sun is glistening from the blue sky, and the air smells like fresh-cut grass and autumn. I\u2019m walking across the quiet campus yard toward my therapist\u2019s office with the phone up to my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou did not do that,\u201d I say to Micha with a smile on my face. \u201cYou are such a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he argues with humor in his voice. \u201cI threw down my guitar and told them I was out\u2014that I didn\u2019t want any more drama.\u201d</p><p>I swing the main entrance door open and step inside the vacant hallway. \u201cSo you quit the band\u2014you\u2019re just done, after months on the road with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt actually happens more than you think,\u201d he replies and I hear Ethan\u2019s voice in the background. \u201cAnd I quit like a week ago, but I didn\u2019t want to tell you until now.\u201d</p><p>My mouth sinks into a frown as I lower myself into a chair outside the therapist\u2019s office. \u201cWhy? I wouldn\u2019t have talked you out of it. As long as you\u2019re happy, you can do whatever you want. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy. Very, very happy,\u201d he promises me enthusiastically. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the reason I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay... what\u2019s the reason?\u201d I hear Ethan\u2019s voice again. \u201cAnd why is Ethan there. Isn\u2019t he supposed be on his big, adventurous trip, mountain-man style or whatever the hell he calls it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Mountain Man Journey!\u201d Ethan shouts. \u201cGet the wording right, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I on speakerphone?\u201d I ask. \u201cMicha, if I am, take me off of it. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. You\u2019ll take this better if you\u2019re on speakerphone.\u201d He blows out a breath. \u201cThis way you\u2019ll contain your anger a little bit better, because you know Ethan will be listening and use everything you say against you.\u201d</p><p>I glance from left to right, noting no one\u2019s around in the office. \u201cWhat\u2019s the news?\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat, like he\u2019s preparing to make a big speech. \u201cAfter the whole band breakup went down, I decided I needed a change. And so did Ethan, since he realized he wasn\u2019t as much of a mountain man as he thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the real reason,\u201d Ethan objects. \u201cI just felt sorry for your dumb ass because your band broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Micha talks over him. \u201cWe both decided that it was time for a change and so I started looking around for a permanent thing that wouldn\u2019t require a lot of traveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to do that kind of stuff.\u201d I drop my bag on the floor and hunch back in the chair. \u201cI thought you wanted to be part of a band and be on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m better by myself,\u201d he tells me. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll keep my eyes open for a new band, but the one I was with was turning into a lost cause. And for now, I\u2019ve found a place to play. Plus I got a side job. The pay is shit, but it works for now and it\u2019s better than going back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your side job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for this male escort service. I figured it be great. I get to dazzle women all day\u2014which we both know I\u2019m awesome at\u2014and I\u2019ll get paid to do it.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, but play along. \u201cWow, that sounds like a job you\u2019ll be really good at and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a lot of fun. The more I think about it, it\u2019s like your dream job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, right?\u201d he says cleverly. \u201cAlthough, I have heard stories about some fetishes guys run into and it sounds like things can get a little awkward, but I\u2019ll do what I gotta do to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork.\u201d I shift in my seat, tucking my legs under the chair as the secretary walks by with a stack of papers in her hands. \u201cWhat are you really doing? Better yet, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan and I got a part-time job in construction, but it\u2019s just an in-between thing.\u201d He pauses and there\u2019s a loud bang. \u201cAt night I\u2019ll be playing at The Hook Up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. There\u2019s one of those in Vegas,\u201d I say over the sound of the paper shredder. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a national thing, though.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates. \u201cIt\u2019s not a national thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in Vegas?\u201d My voice comes out high-pitched and the secretary glares at me through her thick glasses as she feeds papers through the shredder. Turning in the seat, I lower my voice and put my finger to my ear to hear better. \u201cYou and Ethan moved to Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re in Vegas right now as we speak, setting up our stuff in this teeny tiny apartment,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cBut it works and I\u2019m happy with it.\u201d</p><p>Unsure how to respond I stay quiet, drumming my fingers anxiously on my knee. The front desks phone rings and the secretary answers it.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking, pretty girl,\u201d he urges and there\u2019s a beep as he switches it off speakerphone. \u201cEthan can\u2019t hear you anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking... I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking...\u201d I drift off as the therapist\u2019s door swings open and she sticks her head out.</p><p>\u201cElla, I\u2019m ready for you.\u201d Widening the doorway, she motions me in.</p><p>\u201cI have to call you back,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m headed into the therapist\u2019s office right now.\u201d I hang up before he can say anything, collect my bag from off the floor, and take a seat in front of the desk.</p> <p>Anna sits down in her chair, selects a pen from the cup, and takes her notebook out of the desk drawer. Today, her pantsuit is this bland shade of brown and her hair is pinned back. She puts on her glasses and reads over last visit\u2019s notes.</p><p>\u201cThat was Micha on the phone,\u201d I explain before she can ask, because she\u2019s going to. \u201cAnd I just found out he moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d She drops the pen and notebook down on the desk, and scoots her chair forward. \u201cBy the way you sound, you\u2019re not happy about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I am.\u201d I mull over my feelings. \u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s nice to have him close in case I need him, but I\u2019m trying not to need him, so it could be bad that he\u2019s close. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes a lot of sense.\u201d She fans the pages of the notebook. \u201cHow long did you say you\u2019ve known Micha?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince forever. I mean, I can remember being four years old and being fascinated with how he sat out in the garage with his dad and worked on cars. Although, I was always too afraid to go over there and talk to him\u2014he actually talked to me first.\u201d A laugh tickles in my throat. \u201cActually, he bribed me to climb over the fence first, with a juice box and a toy car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you too afraid to talk to him?\u201d she probes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess maybe I always felt like I was living in some alternate world that no one understood, not even him.\u201d I shrug, picking at my fingernails. \u201cI still feel that way sometimes, like maybe I see things differently than most people.\u201d</p><p>She thrums her French-manicured nails on the desk. \u201cI think you worry too much about how you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s kind of a given,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve know this for a while, but what I still don\u2019t understand is how to stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t think you understand the original cause,\u201d she states. \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me, Ella, your childhood was full of worry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t worry all the time,\u201d I protest. \u201cThere were relaxing... moments and I lived my life the way I needed to in order to survive. If I didn\u2019t worry, then no one would have paid the bills, made sure everyone ate, or had clean clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not quite what I mean, but that is part of it.\u201d She removes a photo from the folder and lays it flat on the desk in front of me. \u201cWhat do you see when you look at this?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a stock photo of a man, a woman, and little girl, all with the same blue eyes and platinum blond hair. \u201cUmm... that you like to take the inserts from picture frames and keep them in your office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla, it\u2019s not good to make jokes to hide your feelings,\u201d she insists. \u201cJust tell me what you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see a family, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they look happy?\u201d</p><p>I study the smiles on their faces. \u201cThey seem as happy as anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She edges it toward me and taps it with her finger. \u201cDescribe the picture to me.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a strange request, but I do it anyway. \u201cWell, the man\u2019s got his arm wrapped around the woman\u2019s shoulder and he looks like he loves her, although his smile\u2019s a little bit too shiny, if you ask me. The woman\u2019s carrying the little girl and they both look happy too. Although, I don\u2019t get why they\u2019re so damn happy. They\u2019re just getting their damn picture taken.\u201d</p><p>She accidentally creases the corners of the photo when she puts it into her folder. \u201cDid your mother or father ever hug you like that? Or do you remember being that happy when you were a kid?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like she\u2019s asked me a pre-calculus question and my mind muddles at the complexity. \u201cNo, but that stuff\u2019s not real. It\u2019s fake, for show purposes to make people feel good when they look at the picture frame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ella, it\u2019s real. Happiness does exist,\u201d she answers sadly. \u201cNow, things aren\u2019t always that way, but families should have their happy moments and children should get hugged and feel loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did\u2014do\u2014feel loved.\u201d I massage the sides of my temples, feeling as though a concrete block has been dropped onto my chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been hugged... a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few times in the last twenty years?\u201d she asks, stressing her point. \u201cBecause that doesn\u2019t seem like a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hugged plenty of times,\u201d I say, offended. \u201cMicha hugs me all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, we go back to Micha. Let\u2019s exclude him from this conversation for a minute and focus on your family.\u201d She scribbles a few notes down in the notebook. \u201cDid your parents ever hug you? Laugh with you? Take family trips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to the zoo once when I was six, but my mom was bipolar and couldn\u2019t do a lot with us. And my dad... well, he loved his Jack Daniels.\u201d I pause as anger simmers at the tip of my tongue. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get at anything,\u201d she responds kindly, clicking the cap back onto the pen. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to let you see your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it\u2019s crazy\u2014that I\u2019m crazy? Because I already knew that, without the recap of my shitty life.\u201d My hands tremble and my palms sweat at harsh memories that make up my life. I begin to hyperventilate and my vision spots.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d she instructs, waving her hand in front of her chest in a cleansing gesture and I obey. \u201cNow, you\u2019re not crazy, Ella. You\u2019ve just had a rough life.\u201d</p><p>My brain pounds inside my skull. \u201cThen what does this have to do with anxiety or depression or whatever it is you think\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that sometimes you don\u2019t think you deserve to have a good life\u2014that you\u2019re not a good person. That you don\u2019t deserve to be loved.\u201d She shuts a folder, stacks it with a small pile, and overlaps her hands on top of the desk. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why you push people away and what\u2019s causing a lot of the depression and anxiety.\u201d</p><p>I flop my head back against the wall. \u201cI\u2019m this way because my mom died and it was my fault. I\u2019m this way because I know my head\u2019s screwed up and I don\u2019t want to drag anyone down with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those things you said aren\u2019t true,\u201d she says and I lift my head back up. \u201cAnd our goal here is to get you to believe that.\u201d</p><p>We talk a little bit more about lighter stuff, like how my classes are going and what my plans are for Christmas. When my time\u2019s up I go back to the apartment.</p><p>Lila\u2019s not home from class yet and it\u2019s quiet. I grab a Dr. Pepper from the fridge and take the phone out of my pocket, staring at the picture on the screensaver of Micha, Lila, Ethan, and me at the wedding.</p><p>\u201cI look happy there,\u201d I say determinedly and then I dial Micha\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cYou called back,\u201d he answers after two rings. \u201cEthan owes me twenty bucks.\u201d</p><p>I chew on my thumbnail. \u201cHe bet I wasn\u2019t going to call you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bet you\u2019d blow me off.\u201d He lets out his fake evil laugh. \u201cThat the Stepford Wife Ella had returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, no Stepford Wife Ella here.\u201d I tap the top of my soda and flip the tab open. \u201cOnly a confused one.\u201d</p><p>He stops laughing. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d I sigh exhaustedly and swallow a sip of the soda.</p><p>He gives a lengthened pause. \u201cElla, friends can talk to each other about stuff they\u2019re going through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I set the soda on the counter and plop down into a barstool. \u201cBut I just spent the last hour talking to my therapist about it and I\u2019d rather take a break from my own head, if that makes any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense.\u201d He hesitates momentarily, like he\u2019s deciding if he dares say something. \u201cYou should come over and see our new place. It\u2019s just a bunch of boxes right now, but we could go out to dinner or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d I start.</p><p>He cuts me off hastily. \u201cYou can bring Lila too.\u201d</p><p>I swear the boy has too much insight into my head. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll see if Lila\u2019s up for it when she gets back from class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blow me off, Ella May.\u201d He pretends to be stern. \u201cI mean it. I know where you live and I will hunt you down and punish you in the dirtiest ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blowing you off. Jeez, relax, you weirdo,\u201d I tease him back. \u201cI\u2019m sure Lila will want to, but I have to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d His voice portrays confidence. \u201cOh, you know what we should do?\u201d</p><p>I spin the can of soda around on the counter, wary to answer. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have a naked party.\u201d Hilarity laces his voice. \u201cAnd you can only come in the house if you take off all your clothes. It\u2019ll be like the entry fee. Give me your pants and shirt and you\u2019re allowed to come.\u201d</p><p>I frown, even though it sounds interesting. \u201cNo naked parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I had to try,\u201d he remarks in a tempting tone. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I change into a pair of red corduroy shorts and a black tank top with a heart in the middle. I pull my hair up in a ponytail and put on some eyeliner and lip gloss, then wait on the couch for Lila to show up.</p><p>She walks in, waving at Parker, who is backing away from the door. \u201cSee you later, maybe.\u201d She shuts the door and sighs, leaning back against it. \u201cGod, he\u2019s getting on my nerves. He won\u2019t give it up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe you should stop giving it up to him then.\u201d I hide my smile with the soda can.</p><p>\u201cHey, I have needs too.\u201d She ambles to the kitchen and searches the fridge shelves for a snack. \u201cNot everyone can be committed to that no-sex thing like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to fix myself before I make my life more complicated,\u201d I say, picking the tab off the can. \u201cAnd so that when... if Micha and I end up together, I can be a person that he won\u2019t resent.\u201d</p> <p>She grabs an apple and a bottle of water and joins me on the couch, tucking her skirt underneath her legs as she sits down. \u201cYou know it\u2019s never going to work, right? There\u2019s no way you two are going to be able to keep your hands off each other for more than, like, a week. Actually I\u2019m betting five days. Ethan went with seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made bets on it?\u201d I gape at her. \u201cWait a minute, did you know they were moving here?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and bites into the apple. \u201cEthan might have mentioned it a time or two on the phone.\u201d</p><p>I tip my head back and suck out the last drop of the soda. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to go over to their new place, if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d</p><p>She removes the cap of the bottle of water. \u201cSure. I don\u2019t have plans, but how are we going to get there? Because I\u2019m still on my bus strike.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can either call Ethan to come get us\u201d\u2014I frown\u2014\u201cor borrow a car. I prefer borrowing so I can leave when I\u2019m ready to. If Ethan comes and gets us, they\u2019ll hold us hostage, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound that bad.\u201d A piece of apple falls out of her mouth and lands on her lap. \u201cBut if you want to borrow a car, then we can. You can ask Blake.\u201d</p><p>Remembering how annoyed Micha got over the Mustang, I hesitate.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably not a good idea, huh?\u201d She retrieves her phone from the pocket of her jeans. \u201cWho else could we call?\u201d</p><p>Smashing the middle of the can, I put it on the coffee table. \u201cParker?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and one of her curls slips out from underneath the headband in her hair. \u201cNo way, then it\u2019ll be even harder to get him to go away. Besides, he\u2019s a weirdo about letting people drive his car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I have no idea.\u201d After a few minutes of consideration, I unlock the screen of my phone and send Blake a text.</p><p>Me: Hey, I have a huge favor to ask you.</p><p>Blake: What\u2019s up?</p><p>Me: I need to borrow your car for a few hours.</p><p>Blake: Sure, but you\u2019ll have to drop me off at work and pick me up.</p><p>Me: That works for me.</p><p>Blake: I\u2019ll be out of class in a few minutes. You wanna meet up in the parking lot?</p><p>Me: Yeah, be there in 5.</p> <p>Tucking my phone into my back pocket, I collect my purse off the back of the chair. \u201cI got us a car, but we have to go down to the parking lot right now.\u201d</p><p>Her phone rings and she silences it without looking at the screen. \u201cWho did you call?\u201d</p><p>I slip my sandals on and check my bag to make sure the house keys are in it. \u201cBlake.\u201d</p><p>She springs up and tosses the apple core into the garbage next to the sofa. \u201cYou know Micha\u2019s going to be pissed at you for showing up in Blake\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be mad,\u201d I point out, opening the door, and sunlight filters in. \u201cJust a little annoyed and you\u2019re the one who suggested it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I did, but then I realized it\u2019s probably not a good idea.\u201d She sighs as we head down the staircase. \u201cYou have a tendency to see things so distorted sometimes. He\u2019s going to be pissed, because you told him you needed to be friends for a while, and then you show up in some other guy\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>I sidestep a tree and then dodge swiftly to my right as a guy playing football comes running in my direction to make a catch. \u201cYou drive and we can say that you borrowed it, and then it\u2019ll be all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll good?\u201d She takes a pack of gum out of her pocket and pops a piece into her mouth. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll see how good it is with all that sexual tension you two are going to have.\u201d</p><p>She offers me a piece and I take one, knowing she\u2019s right.</p><p>Micha</p><p>\u201cIt smells like a locker room in here.\u201d Ethan wrinkles his nose as he opens the fridge. \u201cOh God, there\u2019s leftover spaghetti in here.\u201d He picks up a Tupperware bowl filled with red crap and examines it closely. \u201cNope, I\u2019m not sure what this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow it out, man.\u201d I pick up a heavy box marked \u201cdishes\u201d and carry it into the small kitchen that\u2019s in desperate need of a paint job. There are chips in the green countertops and one of the walls has been spackled in multiple places. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s moving.\u201d</p><p>He tosses me the bowl, dry heaving at the horrible smell coming from it. \u201cYour turn. I took the last run of garbage out.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and head downstairs with the bowl out in front of me. The apartment complex is in a noisy area, especially by the playground. Children are on swings, running around, laughing, yelling, crying. It reminds me of everything Ella, Ethan, and I never had.</p><p>When I reach the Dumpster, a red Mustang flies into the apartment complex parking lot. It pulls up beside Ethan\u2019s truck underneath the carport and I stroll over, a little annoyed when Ella climbs out of it.</p><p>By the look on her face, she knows she\u2019s in trouble. She gives me a tentative wave. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>My gaze skims across the shiny hood of the car. \u201cSo the Mustang makes a grand return into our lives.\u201d</p><p>She gathers some of her auburn hair behind her ear. \u201cLila borrowed it.\u201d</p><p>I press her with an unrelenting look. \u201cI can tell when you\u2019re lying.\u201d When I advance to the passenger side, Lila hops out of the car. \u201cYou could have had Ethan or me pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I could have.\u201d Ella lollygags toward the curb. \u201cBut I wanted to be able to go home when I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go inside,\u201d Lila interrupts, glancing up at the two-story apartment. \u201cWhich one is it?\u201d</p><p>Without taking my eyes off Ella, I point my finger to the second floor. \u201cTop floor, first door on the right.\u201d</p><p>She nods and hurries up the stairs, which creak with the clicks of her high heels.</p><p>\u201cThe car really doesn\u2019t mean anything, Micha.\u201d Ella scuffs her sandals across the asphalt, avoiding eye contact with me. \u201cAnd I mean that. It was just a car to borrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that it might not mean anything to you, but it probably does to Blake,\u201d I assure her, stuffing my hands into my pockets to resist the temptation to run my hands all over her body and try to take claim of her again. \u201cGuys don\u2019t lend cars like this to a girl they have no interest in.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and peeks up at me through her eyelashes. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have come over. It\u2019s too weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird only if you make it weird.\u201d I start for the staircase and she follows me. \u201cStop worrying so much, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d she mutters with a frown forming at her lips.</p><p>When we reach the bottom of the stairs, I move to the side and signal for her to go ahead. \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a tentative smile and trots up the stairs, trailing her hand along the railing. Smiling to myself, I walk behind her with my eyes focused on her backside. She has these little red pair of shorts on that are tight enough that a small sliver of her ass peeks out. I\u2019ve missed that ass a lot.</p><p>At the top of the stairway, she glances over her shoulder and catches me eyeballing her. She puts her hands behind her and whirls her back toward the wall. \u201cDid you have me walk up first to check out my butt? I thought we were going to be friends.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, not giving a shit that she caught me. \u201cI used to check out your ass all the time before when we were just friends. You just never noticed.\u201d</p><p>She combs her fingers through her auburn hair. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make this hard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I admit to her honestly and her face falls. Quickly, so she can\u2019t stop me, I sweep some of her hair out of her eyes and lightly kiss her cheek, winking at her when I step back. \u201cRelax, though. I won\u2019t rip your clothes off until you ask me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re relentless.\u201d She restrains a grin. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to help me if you keep touching me and looking at me like that. I want to get better for you, but I have to take it easy with complex situations until I learn how to deal with them. Think of it as like when an alcoholic is recovering and they\u2019re told not to get into a relationship until they can handle stuff rationally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your therapist say that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I shove open the door and hold up a couple of my fingers. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be on my best behavior. Scout\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>She bends my fingers back playfully as she rolls her eyes and then steps into the house. She observes the old leather sofa Ethan stole from his mom\u2019s house, the television on a crate, and the table in the dining room, which is between the kitchen and the living room.</p><p>\u201cThis is so a guy\u2019s apartment.\u201d She sniffs the air and then flinches, fanning her hand in front of her face. \u201cIt even smells like a guy.\u201d</p><p>I pinch her ass and she lets out a squeal. \u201cIt smells manly.\u201d I strut off to the kitchen before she can get mad at me for my little stunt.</p><p>She starts chatting with Lila and Ethan while I peel the tape off the dishes box on the kitchen table and take out a stack of plates. From the counter, my phone rings. It\u2019s the hospital from New York where I took the blood test.</p><p>Reluctantly, I answer it. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d a woman with a squeaky voice says. \u201cIs this Micha Scott?\u201d</p><p>I slant my back against the counter and stare at the wall. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Amy, from the NYU Medical Center,\u201d she says. \u201cI called to tell you that your test results confirmed you\u2019re a candidate for the transplant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, thanks for letting me know.\u201d I hang up on her, clutching the phone in my hand. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Ethan pops his head into the kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go get something to eat. You down... Are you okay? You look weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I chuck my phone onto the table and the back pops off. \u201cAnd yeah, dinner sounds good to me.\u201d</p> <p>He nods his head at the front door where Ella and Lila are waiting. \u201cLet\u2019s roll then.\u201d</p><p>Once he walks out, I sneak quite a few large swigs of vodka from a bottle I dig out of one of the boxes, then stuff a couple of mini bottles into my pocket. The hospital calling is a painful reminder that my father only came to me when he needed something from me. But that\u2019s not the real problem. I\u2019ve accepted that he won\u2019t ever see me as anything more than a person he used to know. What\u2019s getting me riled up is that deep down, I don\u2019t want to do it for him. I want to make him suffer and that feeling is eating away at me.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to feel like that, but I can\u2019t turn off the resentment.</p><p>Ethan steps back into the kitchen with an irritated expression on his face. \u201cWhat are you doing? Let\u2019s go. I\u2019m freaking hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming. Jeez, keep your panties on.\u201d I storm for the door. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not driving in that damn Mustang.\u201d</p> <p>Ella</p><p>Micha\u2019s pissed off about the Mustang and makes a big dramatic speech about how he\u2019s not riding in it. No way in hell. Uh-huh. The more the night goes on, it becomes clear that his anger is from something deeper, and the car is just a cover-up.</p><p>When Ethan turns into the parking lot, I decide that karma hates me, because it\u2019s the restaurant we dropped Blake off at earlier\u2014the one he works at.</p><p>I scoot forward in the backseat of the truck and fold my arms on top of the console. \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Micha glances at the restaurant\u2019s neon signs and flashy decorations hanging from the sloped trimming of the roof. His eyes are bloodshot and he\u2019s pronouncing his words slowly, which usually means he\u2019s either tired or drunk. \u201cIt looks good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the food\u2019s really gross,\u201d Lila chimes in, unlocking her seatbelt. \u201cThere\u2019s a place in the middle of town that has really good ribs. It\u2019ll only take us, like, fifteen minutes to get there.\u201d</p> <p>Micha shakes his head dramatically and I swear he\u2019s being a pain in the butt on purpose. \u201cNah, I really think this place looks good.\u201d</p><p>Lila and I trade a worried look as Micha and Ethan hop out of the car and slam the doors, leaving us alone in the dark cab.</p><p>\u201cThis is not good,\u201d I mumble, eyeing Micha as he walks around to the back of the truck. He tips his head back and takes a swig from a bottle. \u201cEspecially since he\u2019s in such a bad mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s drunk,\u201d Lila whispers as I crack the door open. \u201cI thought I smelled booze on his breath.\u201d</p><p>I exhale loudly. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure he is, which means we\u2019re probably walking into a drama pit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure Blake\u2019s working still?\u201d Lila slides over in the seat so she can climb out on my side.</p><p>I nod. \u201cWe have to pick him up, remember?\u201d</p><p>The four of us walk across the parking lot toward the entryway. It\u2019s dark enough that the stars are speckling the sky, and in the distance, the strip\u2019s lights glimmer in florescent colors. There\u2019s a sway to Micha\u2019s walk and he trips over his own feet when he jumps up to touch the top of the doorway, rolling his ankle when he lands.</p> <p>\u201cYep, we\u2019re definitely walking into a drama pit,\u201d I utter under my breath as Ethan swings the door open.</p><p>Inside the restaurant the lights are dim and the air is musty. It\u2019s crowded and noisy, but there are a few vacant booths. Little lanterns hang above each table and soft country music flows from the speakers.</p><p>Blake is serving shots from behind the bar to a group of rowdy-looking guys. I clear my throat and make eye contact with Lila, nodding my head discretely in Blake\u2019s direction. She tracks my gaze and her expression drops.</p><p>\u201cHold on, I got an idea.\u201d She waltzes up to the hostess, a brunette in a white shirt and black slacks. Lila sneaks her a tip from over the counter and then she comes back with a cheery smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all taken care of,\u201d she says in a quiet voice. \u201cAnd yes, I know I\u2019m the bestest friend ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I ask, but she just keeps smiling.</p><p>When the hostess leads us to our table, I realize Lila bribed her to take us to a corner booth that is secluded away and out of sight of the bar. I want to hug her, but it would be weird, so I sit down and Lila slides in beside me.</p><p>Ethan pauses at the end of the other side of the booth. \u201cNo way, I\u2019m not buddying it up with Micha. Lila can sit on my side.\u201d</p><p>Lila glances at me. \u201cIs that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>My nerves jumble and it shows in the unsteadiness of my voice. \u201cI think I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit where I sit.\u201d Micha\u2019s eyes stray to the end of the aisle. \u201cIn fact, I think I\u2019m going to go hang out at the bar.\u201d</p><p>Lila jumps up and scurries to the other side to sit with Ethan, inserting strands of her hair underneath the headband. Micha falls into the booth beside me and drapes an arm behind me. He has a short-sleeved gray shirt on and his warm skin grazes the back of my neck. His face looks flushed and his breath reeks of vodka.</p><p>Shielding my face with the menu, I lean toward him and whisper, \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>He blinks his eyes at me innocently. \u201cWhy would you ever think that?\u201d</p><p>I state the obvious. \u201cBecause you smell like vodka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw back a few shot before we headed out and a few in the parking lot.\u201d He places the palm of his hand on top of my thigh. \u201cRelax, I just want to have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why you did it.\u201d I lower the menu back onto the table. \u201cYou only drink randomly when you\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and withdraws his hand from my leg. \u201cHow do you know? Maybe I changed while I was on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so douche bag Micha\u2019s going to come out,\u201d I hiss through my teeth. \u201cThere\u2019s another reason I know you\u2019re upset. He makes his grand appearance only when you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>With his eyes on me, he flips open his menu. \u201cI\u2019m upset because my dick hasn\u2019t gotten any attention for a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>Ethan snorts a laugh and Lila\u2019s blue eyes widen. I drop my head onto the table, sigh, and stay that way until the waiter comes to take our orders. Raising my head from the table, I discover Blake standing at the end of our table.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a nice pair of jeans, a button-down black shirt, and wisps of his dark hair are sticking up a little on the sides. \u201cElla, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting something to eat.\u201d I keep my tone light, hoping we can skip the introductions.</p><p>He has a pen poised against a notebook. \u201cWhat? You just couldn\u2019t wait to pick me up tonight?\u201d he jokes. \u201cYou had to come see me early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, damn it.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to say it aloud, but it slips out, and I quickly slap a hand over my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Micha asks, glaring at Blake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Blake,\u201d he replies, adjusting his weight uneasily. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Micha.\u201d A malicious look masks his face. \u201cAnd by that look on your face, I think you know Ella and I are dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha, I think\u2014\u201d I start.</p><p>\u201cElla, just leave it alone,\u201d Ethan interrupts, shooting me a warning look as he nudges my shin with his foot from under the table. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not even worth it to try.\u201d</p><p>I zip my lips together and focus on the menu. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have a chicken sandwich. What about everyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you,\u201d Micha says and my cheeks heat as his hand inches up my thigh.</p><p>I conceal my hand over his and stop it from going any farther, then look at Ethan for help. \u201cWhat should we do with him?\u201d</p><p>Micha buries his face in my hair. \u201cAnything you want, baby.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shrugs and tosses his menu into the center of the table. \u201cYou know as well as I do that he\u2019s only going to get more intense before he passes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll come back in a minute,\u201d Blake says and hurries down the aisle back toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cSmart move on his part.\u201d Micha sticks his hand into his pocket and reveals a mini bottle of vodka stashed inside it.</p><p>I snatch it from his hand and his glazed eyes snap cold. \u201cGive me that back, pretty girl, or else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else what?\u201d I chuck the bottle to Ethan and he catches it. \u201cYou\u2019re going to say really mean things? I\u2019d rather you use me as your punching bag than someone else.\u201d</p><p>Micha narrows his eyes at me and I wait for what\u2019s coming, but Ethan stands up before he can say anything else.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take him home.\u201d Ethan steps back and lets Lila out of the booth. \u201cBefore he does something stupid.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve seen Micha like this a couple times and there\u2019s always an underlining reason, but getting to the bottom of it can be tricky. Even for his best friend.</p><p>It\u2019s dark and no one has the porch lights on in this section of the complex. I can barely see anything as Ethan fights to get Micha up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cJust quit dragging your feet,\u201d Ethan snaps as they trip to the side and Micha bangs into the railing and the whole stairway vibrates.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d just get out of my way.\u201d Micha shoves Ethan to the side and attempts to take a step on his own, but misses. \u201cThen I\u2019d be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Lila asks from a few steps below, uncomfortable with the situation.</p><p>Sighing, I intervene, positioning myself in between Micha and Ethan. \u201cPut your arm around me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Micha gladly swings his arm around my shoulder and leans on me. I struggle to get him up the stairs and his weight nearly sinks me to the floor. Ethan dashes up in front of us to unlock the door, flipping the porch light on.</p><p>Micha buries his face into my hair and his teeth nick the top of my ear. \u201cYou smell so fucking good. I swear to God, I want to eat you up.\u201d</p><p>I contain the laughter tickling at the back of my throat. \u201cWhat you need to do is sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan holds the door open and Micha and I stumble over the threshold, nearly falling to the floor. We regain our balance, and as soon as the door\u2019s shut, Micha wrestles his shirt off and chucks it onto the floor.</p><p>Even though he\u2019s drunk and we\u2019re not supposed to be on that path, my gaze moves across his lean muscles, his smooth skin, and the tattoo tracing his rib cage, and something coils deep inside me.</p><p>He slips off his boots and belt and I\u2019m worried his pants are coming off next. Lila promptly faces the corner, pretending to be engrossed in the blank screen of the television. Micha keeps his pants on, though, and staggers into the kitchen, reaching for the half-empty bottle of vodka on the counter.</p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t.\u201d I rush into the kitchen, steal the bottle away from him, and screw the cap back on. \u201cNo more drinks for you, unless it\u2019s water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever the hell I want, Ella May,\u201d he says sharply as he moves back and his head bumps against the counter. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do. Whatever you want. Push me away.\u201d</p> <p>I hold out my hands for him to take. \u201cCome with me and we\u2019ll get you into bed.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me forcefully. \u201cAre you coming too?\u201d</p><p>I nod, keeping our gazes connected. \u201cBut only to get you there, and then I have to go home.\u201d</p><p>He places his hands in mine, gripping them tightly, and I walk backward, guiding him down the hall. His bloodshot eyes are fastened on me and it\u2019s hard to keep my heart steady.</p><p>I tell myself repeatedly that the friendship line between us needs to stay and that he\u2019s drunk anyway. When I get him into his room, he collapses onto the bed, yanking me down with him intentionally. He vice-grips his legs around mine and hugs his arms around my chest, pinning me close to him as he burrows his face into my neck and he nips at my skin before stilling.</p><p>I squirm my arms and wiggle my legs, but he only constricts his grip. Panic rushes inside me the longer he keeps me trapped and I loathe my messed-up head.</p> <p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he breathes, nuzzling closer. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d I call out quietly, working to keep my voice composed. \u201cCan you come in here?\u201d</p><p>Moments later, Ethan appears in the doorway and braces his hands on the door frame. The sleeves of his black hoodie are rolled up, showing the colorful tattoos on his arms. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d He grins, entertained at the sight of us.</p><p>I jerk my shoulder upward. \u201cCan you help me get him to let me go?\u201d</p><p>Rubbing his scruffy jawline, he considers my request. \u201cI think it\u2019s better if you stay there. That way if he wakes up still drunk you\u2019ll have to deal with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d I hiss, but he walks away, laughing to himself.</p><p>I call out for Lila a few times, but she never responds, and I wonder if Ethan told her she could go home. After a lot of squirming, I manage to get one arm free. I rub my tired eyes, watching Micha and listening to him breathe in and out. I run my fingers through his hair and then trace a finger down his temple to his lips. God, he\u2019s beautiful.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d I whisper, returning my hand to my side.</p> <p>He breathes softly, his breath caressing my cheek. I surrender the idea of getting away and kiss his forehead before snuggling up to him with a small smile. Next time I visit my therapist, I can tell her I was hugged for ten hours straight.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Micha</p><p>I open my eyes to Ella sleeping soundly in my arms, with one of my hands on her hip and the other just below her breast. I\u2019d be extremely happy, but my head is pounding, my stomach burns, and I have no idea what the hell happened last night\u2014what I did or said.</p><p>Carefully, so not to wake her up, I climb out of bed and go into the bathroom. The room spins and my brain feels like it\u2019s going to explode inside my skull.</p><p>After I puke my guts out, I brush my teeth and return to the room. Ella\u2019s awake, sitting up in the bed and leaning against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d A tiny bit of amusement glistens in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou think my pain is funny?\u201d I crawl onto the bed and lie down on my stomach with the taste of vomit burning at the back of my throat. \u201cWhat the hell happened last night?\u201d</p><p>Her fingertips travel up and down my bare back in circular motions. \u201cWell, it started with you drinking half a bottle of vodka and it ended with you trapping me in your bed.\u201d</p><p>I raise my head up and cock an eyebrow at her. \u201cDid we...\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and lowers her body down so she\u2019s lying on her side next to me. \u201cYou just wouldn\u2019t let me go. You\u2019re kind of evil when you get that drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say mean things to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you tried to start a few fights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, frowning. \u201cFor whatever I did.\u201d</p><p>Her big green eyes blink at me. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be sorry. I want you to tell me what\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s up,\u201d I lie, looking away. \u201cI just went a little overboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, this isn\u2019t fair.\u201d She tugs on my arm and I look at her. \u201cYou make me tell you everything and when I won\u2019t, you chase me down, pin me down, or tease me until I give in to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always try that,\u201d I tell her in a low, husky voice. \u201cIt might be interesting to see how it goes. In fact, I dare you to try.\u201d</p><p>Her body goes rigid. \u201cMicha, just talk to me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head stubbornly. \u201cI told you to try to make me first and then maybe I will.\u201d</p><p>She bites down on her bottom lip, contemplating, and then pushes on my shoulder, forcing me to roll onto my back. I could easily win this battle, but that\u2019s not the point. She sits up and swings a leg over me. Her messy auburn hair curtains our faces and her eyeliner is smeared, but she\u2019s still gorgeous.</p><p>She works to keep a straight face. \u201cNow tell me why you were so upset last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good,\u201d I say. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep it to myself.\u201d</p><p>Her hands come down on my shoulders roughly and she tightens her legs around my waist, accidentally rubbing against me and making my cock go hard. \u201cPlease just tell me.\u201d She bats her eyelashes and it\u2019s ridiculously adorable.</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d I sneak my hands onto her hips and knead my fingers into her skin. \u201cBut for the record, I never bat my eyelashes at you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles proudly. \u201cI know. That was my secret trick. You were always a sucker for it.\u201d</p><p>My hands move around and grope her backside. \u201cAre you telling me you played me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject,\u201d she says, allowing me to leave my hands where they are. \u201cTell me what got you so upset last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father has some kind of weird disease.\u201d I let out a breath, feeling the heaviness crumble. \u201cAnd he needs me for some blood marrow transplant thing.\u201d</p><p>Her face drains to a ghostly white. \u201cIs he... is he going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not life threatening or anything, but I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you what?\u201d she urges me to continue, massaging my shoulders with her thumbs.</p><p>I look away from her and stare at the crack in the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it for him. I want him to suffer and I feel like shit because of it. I mean, am I that big of a dick that I\u2019d let him be sick, just because I\u2019m pissed off?\u201d</p><p>She relaxes her weight on me as her lips twitch to turn upward. \u201cThat\u2019s way you\u2019re upset? Because you feel guilty for being angry with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it sound like you think that\u2019s funny?\u201d My gaze settles back on her. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d She struggles to maintain a stoic face. \u201cIt\u2019s just that... you\u2019re adorable. You\u2019re upset because you feel bad for thinking badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever call me adorable.\u201d I squeeze her ass and her body tenses closer to me, making me even harder. \u201cNo guy ever wants to be called that.\u201d</p><p>Laughter flees her lips as she unintentionally wiggles against my hard-on. \u201cI don\u2019t care. You are. You are so adorable, Micha Scott. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another guy in the whole world who\u2019s as sweet as you.\u201d</p><p>I give her a cold, hard stare. \u201cYou want to see how nice I am?\u201d With one rapid movement, I flip us over, so her warm body is underneath me. My stomach burns, but I choke the nauseated feeling down. \u201cIf you keep calling me adorable, I\u2019m going to flip you over and show you how manly I really am.\u201d Her lips part in shock and her cheeks turn pink. I place my hand on her cheek and let my thumb drag below her eye. \u201cNow that\u2019s adorable.\u201d</p><p>Her body quivers beneath me, but her voice is composed. \u201cSo what are you going to do? About your dad?\u201d</p><p>I lean back, but still keep her hips trapped between my legs. \u201cI always knew what I was going to do. I was just having an inner conflict with the crappy thoughts filling up my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to help him.\u201d</p><p>Her chest heaves up and down as her vast eyes gaze up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard just being friends with you.\u201d</p><p>Her bluntness stuns me and I consider ripping her clothes off and making love to her right now. \u201cWhat do you want me to do with that statement because I have thousands of ideas.\u201d</p><p>She offers me a tight smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do anything yet. I just wanted you to know that that\u2019s how I feel\u2014that you make me feel that way. I\u2019m supposed to be working on sharing my feelings.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gently kiss her cheek and then move off her, but not before rubbing up against her once. She gasps at the feel of me and I grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a better person than you think you are, Ella May.\u201d I point to my mouth. \u201cSee, you got me smiling.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes as she climbs off the bed and straightens out her shirt. \u201cAll I have to do is take my clothes off and you would smile.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her, picturing her sweaty and naked and underneath me.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that.\u201d Her breathing is erratic. \u201cYou\u2019re making it hard to breathe.\u201d</p><p>With my eyes still on her, I pick up my phone off the top of one of the many boxes stacked around my tiny bedroom. \u201cYou want to take a trip to New York?\u201d</p><p>She arches her eyebrows. \u201cAs friends?\u201d</p><p>I nod, dialing my father\u2019s number. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I want for now,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019ll go with you, because I love you.\u201d</p><p>Ella</p><p>It dawns on me the morning after Micha got wasted that he might have a problem. He\u2019s doing what my dad did and using alcohol to deal with his issues. Even though it might be difficult to confront him about it, it seems like I should.</p><p>I bring it up to my therapist during my last visit before my trip to New York, but she disagrees.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea at the moment, Ella,\u201d she says loudly over the rain beating against the window. The sidewalks outside are flooded, the sky is a dark gray, and the wind is howling. \u201cYou\u2019re still dealing with your own problems and bringing that kind of stuff up to people can bring out some ugly emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha\u2019s not like that,\u201d I disagree, raising the volume of my voices over the boom of thunder. \u201cHe would never intentionally hurt me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConfronting problems can be hard for anyone.\u201d She puts her glasses on and reads through yesterday\u2019s notes. \u201cHow have you been doing with stuff lately? Has it been good?\u201d</p><p>I tell the truth, even though my initial reaction is to sugarcoat it. \u201cI\u2019ve been fine except for after I got off the phone with Dean, but things are always crappy when I talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he call you for?\u201d she wonders.</p><p>A huge lump swells in my chest as I say softly, \u201cBecause today is my mom\u2019s birthday.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look at me with sympathy, which is why I like her. \u201cWas he rude to you during this conversation?\u201d</p><p>I struggle to breath. \u201cA little, but that\u2019s because he still blames me for our mom\u2019s death, I think.\u201d</p><p>Her pencil is poised above her paper, ready to take notes. \u201cDo you ever talk to him about how you feel when he hurts you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>Her hand moves quickly across the paper as she writes something down. \u201cWhat did you do after you got off the phone with Dean and you were upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t upset,\u201d I correct her. \u201cJust sad, so I went back to my room and curled up in a ball for a little while. I pulled myself out of it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d She takes off her glasses and there are red lines where the frames pressed against her nose. \u201cWhat time are you leaving for New York?\u201d</p><p>Tipping my head back, I glance at the clock on the wall above my head. \u201cIn, like, four or five hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d she inquires. \u201cYou\u2019ll be alone on the trip with Micha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I assure her. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want me to date him\u2014and I\u2019m not\u2014but he\u2019s still my friend and he needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never told you not to date him, Ella.\u201d The rain picks up, veiling the window with water, and she raises her voice. \u201cI just told you that until you can build a steady life you should try to take things easy, and relationships generally are not easy.\u201d</p><p>I curl a strand of my hair around my finger. \u201cHow will I know when I\u2019m ready to be with him again?\u201d</p><p>She offers me an encouraging smile. \u201cOnly you know that, but can I advise you to take baby steps with any relationship you get into, so your thoughts have time to slow down and you can see what\u2019s real?\u201d</p><p>My thoughts are racing as I rise to my feet and swing my bag over my shoulder. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you when I get back.\u201d</p><p>She escorts me to the door. \u201cTake care, Ella, and remember, if you need anything just call me.\u201d</p><p>I wave good-bye and step out into the rain, taking off toward the apartment. My boots splash through the puddles, and even running the entire way, my clothes and hair end up sopping.</p><p>Ethan and Micha are sitting on the living room couch when I rush inside and slam the door, locking out the rain. Their eyes dart to me and amplify.</p><p>Micha takes in my jeans and T-shirt clinging to my body and the beads of water running down my face. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have a jacket you could put on?\u201d</p><p>I wring out my hair, making a mess on the entryway tile. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think it would rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The dark clouds weren\u2019t a dead giveaway?\u201d Ethan asks mockingly and grabs a handful of chips from a bag on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cIt usually doesn\u2019t rain here.\u201d I head toward my room while my boots leave a trail of water on the carpet. \u201cDo I have time to take a shower before we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re good,\u201d Micha calls out. \u201cJust make it a quick one.\u201d</p><p>I close my bedroom door, slip off my wet clothes, and go into the bathroom attached to the bedroom, leaving the door cracked. The warm water of the shower eases my stiff muscles and I let it run along my body longer than I\u2019d planned.</p><p>\u201cElla, are you alive in here?\u201d Micha\u2019s voice increases over the sound of the running water.</p><p>I rub the water from eyes. \u201cYeah, I was just about to get out.\u201d</p><p>I wait a minute for him to leave, and then shut off the water and draw the curtain back to step out, but he\u2019s still there, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I grab the curtain and cover myself. \u201cI thought you left.\u201d</p><p>He crosses his arms and his feral eyes bore into me. \u201cI wanted to make sure you got out. We need to go.\u201d</p><p>I reach for the towel on the hanger and wrap it around myself before releasing the curtain and stepping out. His gaze tracks me all the way as I walk into my room.</p><p>I dig through my dresser drawer for some clothes and select a gray-and-black-striped hooded T-shirt and a pair of jeans. \u201cAlright, give me a minute to get dressed and I\u2019m good to go.\u201d</p><p>He picks up a drawing of the girl with cracks in her face and studies it. \u201cWhen did you draw this?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I pull on my panties without taking off the towel. \u201cRight before I came to visit you in LA.\u201d</p><p>He drops it back onto the dresser and his fiery gaze shifts to me. \u201cIt looks like you were sad when you drew it.\u201d</p><p>I pull my pants on, stumbling around the room as my foot gets caught in the middle of the pant leg. \u201cI was sad about not being able to see you.\u201d</p><p>A ghost smile touches his lips as I stare at my bra in my hand, racking my brain for a way to get it on without flashing him. \u201cDid you run into some trouble?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I blink at him impassively. \u201cWould you mind stepping out for a minute?\u201d</p><p>He gives an overexaggerated nod. \u201cI would mind very much.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I turn around and let the towel fall to the floor. Hooking an arm through each strap, I put the bra on and reach around to clasp it together, but fingers brush my back.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not supposed to say this, since we\u2019re supposed to be friends.\u201d Micha breathes in husky tone as he clips the clamps together. \u201cBut you are ridiculously beautiful.\u201d</p><p>My lungs constrict as I peek over my shoulder and his luscious lips are only inches away. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say, breathless as my heart hammers inside my chest. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>His gaze moves to my lips, full of desire like he might kiss me, and a needy moan trembles from my mouth. Nibbling on his lip ring, he backs away, his eyes never wavering from me until he shuts the door and disappears into the hall.</p><p>Blowing out a quivering breath, I quickly put my shirt on and comb my hair, wishing he had kissed me.</p><p>Ethan drops us off at the airport with barely enough time to get checked in and make it to the gate before the plane starts to board. Everyone keeps thinking we\u2019re newlyweds and Micha is amused by it; however, it makes me uneasy. Newlyweds equal marriage, something I\u2019m not ready for.</p><p>As we\u2019re getting ready to get onto the plane, Micha tells me to go ahead without him. He\u2019s got something to do and he\u2019ll meet me on the plane. Collecting my bags, I line up with my boarding pass in my hand as he saunters off toward the gift shop area with his bag over his shoulder.</p><p>On the plane, I find our row and put my smaller bag under the seat, then stuff the larger one into the overhead compartment. I sit down by the window and gaze out at the blue sky and the wing of the airplane, wondering how bad flying is, since I\u2019ve never been on a plane before.</p><p>\u201cYou look nervous,\u201d Micha remarks when he reaches the end of the row.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assure him. \u201cI was just lost in my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>He shoves his bag into the compartment above our heads and his green plaid hooded shirt rises up just enough to show a thin space of his lean stomach muscles and smooth porcelain skin. My thoughts fill with images of running my fingers up his chest, along his stomach, savoring his soft skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying the view?\u201d He cocks an eyebrow as he adjusts his shirt back over my view.</p><p>Hiding my smile, I turn toward the window. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>He sits down in the middle seat and when I look back at him, there\u2019s a paper bag on his lap.</p><p>I point at it. \u201cWhat\u2019s in there? Is it anything good?\u201d</p><p>He opens the bag and moves it toward me. Inside is a chocolate cupcake, with pink and red sprinkles. My heart instantly surges with my love for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow, I know it\u2019s not the same.\u201d He removes the cupcake from the bag and balances it in the palm of my hand. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s close.\u201d</p><p>Tears sting at my eyes as images of my mother flash through my mind. It was her thirty-fifth birthday and I was twelve. When I asked her what she would like for a present, she told me she wanted to bake cupcakes all day. It was a good moment in my life, although most people would probably view it as strange. But she was happy. I was happy. Micha was happy. And the happiness brought a rare serenity to our lives.</p><p>\u201cYou remembered.\u201d A tear escapes from my eye and rolls down my cheek.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I remembered.\u201d He wipes away the stray tear. \u201cHow could I not remember the day I had to make dozens and dozens of cupcakes?\u201d</p><p>Through my tears, I manage to smile at the memory. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell her no. It was her birthday and she seemed so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was perfectly happy to do it,\u201d he says, wiping another tear away with his finger. \u201cAlthough I did end up puking my guts out because I ate too much batter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good memory of my mom.\u201d I shut my eyes, force back the tears, and release a shaky breath. \u201cRare, but good.\u201d</p><p>When I open my eyes again, he\u2019s watching me closely, like he\u2019s afraid I might break. I dip my finger into the frosting and lick it off.</p> <p>He restrains a grin. \u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><p>I lick some frosting off my lip. \u201cReally, really good.\u201d</p><p>A woman of about twenty-five or so, with curly blonde hair and sharp cheekbones, sits down in the seat next to Micha. She ogles him as she tucks her bag underneath her seat and shuts her phone off.</p><p>I lean forward and Micha winces, startled. \u201cYou have an admirer.\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder and when he looks back at me, his face is lit with entertainment. \u201cJust one of my many.\u201d</p><p>I lick a mouthful of frosting off the top of the cupcake, laughing, and he watches me intently, dragging his lip ring between his teeth.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I love?\u201d he asks and I expect something dirty to come out of his mouth. \u201cHow big your eyes are.\u201d He puts a finger to the corner of my eye, touching it delicately. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The woman rolls her eyes as she buckles her seatbelt and grabs a magazine from the pocket on the back of the seat in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I love?\u201d I ask, and he shakes his head. \u201cWhen you\u2019re lying naked in my bed.\u201d</p><p>She pulls a disgusted face as she flips through the pages and Micha\u2019s forehead furrows.</p><p>Cupping my hand around my mouth, I put my lips near his ear. \u201cShe\u2019s listening to our conversation and getting annoyed, so I thought I\u2019d have fun with her.\u201d</p><p>An evil smile expands across his face. \u201cYou know what I love? Your naked body underneath mine, all hot and sweaty.\u201d</p><p>She huffs exasperatedly and turns her back toward us to face the aisle.</p><p>Grinning, I bite into the cupcake. \u201cThat was fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was fun,\u201d he agrees and turns off his phone.</p><p>The plane begins to roll backward and it takes forever, but finally we\u2019re rushing into the sky. I breathe in and out, tapping my fingers on my legs, not really sure why I\u2019m all wound up, other than it seems like I\u2019m putting a lot of trust in the pilot.</p><p>Micha\u2019s fingers wrap around my wrist and he kisses my racing pulse. \u201cRelax, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I snuggle up to him and rest my head on his shoulder. He brings out his iPod and puts one earbud in his ear. Sweeping my hair to the side, he puts the other one in mine.</p><p>He scrolls through the playlists and seconds later \u201cChalk Line\u201d by Strike Anywhere flips on, the acoustic version, so it\u2019s softer. Leaning into me, he sings along with the lyrics and the sound of his angelic voice lulls me to sleep.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Micha</p><p>After the plane lands and we check into the absurdly fancy hotel my father booked, we decide to go sightseeing. The sidewalks are packed and the traffic is practically at a standstill. It\u2019s midafternoon, but chilly and the buildings are so tall, hardly any sunlight hits their lower sections or the sidewalks.</p><p>Ella has on a hooded jacket and fingerless gloves, but she shivers from the cold as she sips on her coffee.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold, baby?\u201d I ask, pulling my hood over my head.</p><p>She nods with the coffee close to her lips. \u201cI think I might have gotten a little too used to the Vegas weather.\u201d</p><p>I step up behind her and rub my hands up and down her arms a few times, building warmth from the friction. \u201cImagine how bad it\u2019s going to be when we go back home for Christmas. Star Grove is like twice as cold as here.\u201d</p><p>She drinks her coffee as I encircle my arms around her, maneuvering us through the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going anywhere for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I return to her side and capture her gaze. \u201cWhat do you mean you aren\u2019t going? You can\u2019t stay at the campus by yourself for three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to an empty house, Micha,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t be by myself. Lila\u2019s not going home either.\u201d</p><p>We stop at the crosswalk and wait with the crowd for the light to change as traffic zooms by.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay with me,\u201d I offer. \u201cI would even give you my bed.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me crossly. \u201cJust like how you got us two beds in the hotel room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, my dad booked that room,\u201d I say as she picks some pieces of her hair out of her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right?\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cHow convenient for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be very convenient for me.\u201d I am treading on thin ice. \u201cThat way if I\u2019m feeling really hot and bothered I can just get you to put your leg over me and you\u2019ll let me feel you again. You know, you\u2019re kind of naughty when you\u2019re in a dark room.\u201d</p><p>She glances at an older guy with thin hair and glasses who is listening to our conversation with a big grin on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened,\u201d she says.</p><p>I target an intimidating gaze at the pervert and he quickly turns around. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened, pretty girl, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>She gulps her coffee to obscure her mortified expression. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Threading my fingers through hers, we walk across the street with the mob of people and stop on the other side to take a look around.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to go anywhere special while we\u2019re here?\u201d I ask. \u201cCentral Park? We could go ice skating?\u201d</p><p>Her head tips back as she shields her eyes and stares up at the Empire State Building stretching toward the sky. \u201cI want to go up there.\u201d</p><p>My chest constricts as the memories of her on the bridge rush through me: her standing on the beam over the water, ready to throw away her precious life.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I check, releasing a slow breath. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a ton of stuff we could do.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she yanks on my arm. \u201cYes, now come on.\u201d</p><p>I shove the memory out of my head the best I can and reluctantly allow her to lead me across the street, because I\u2019d go anywhere with her, even if I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>Ella</p><p>We have to wait in line to get on the elevators, but it takes us up to the top fast and gives me a little bit of a head rush. When the doors open, we step out and my stomach rolls with my nerves. Tossing my empty coffee cup into the trashcan, I head for the lookout area, which is blocked off by bars.</p><p>Micha tags along with me, even though he doesn\u2019t want to be up here. It makes him edgy, so I entwine my fingers with his as I peer through the bars and down at the lively city below. It\u2019s getting dark and colorful lights sparkle for miles. That\u2019s when it crashes into me, like the wind has been knocked out of me, the same helplessness I felt on the plane.</p><p>Micha senses my uneasiness and his arms enclose around my waist. \u201cTake a slow breath and just relax and enjoy the scenery.\u201d He smothers my neck with kisses until I settle back down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I whisper. \u201cLike really amazing.\u201d</p><p>He sucks on the sensitive spot below my ear, before moving his mouth away. \u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>Shivering from the cold and his touch, I lean back against him and he rests his chin on top of my head. \u201cAnd it\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>Not many people would get what I mean, but he does and his arms constrict around me. People wander around us, but I remain still, discovering what it feels like to have a peaceful moment where my thoughts aren\u2019t bunched up in my head.</p><p>Somewhere along the line, I begin to cry, but do it noiselessly, hoping he won\u2019t notice.</p><p>His fingers seek my cheeks and wipe away the tears. \u201cWhy are you crying, pretty girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing... It\u2019s just that this is so normal,\u201d I admit, dabbing the tears with my fingertips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m being such a baby.\u201d</p><p>He kisses my head and guides me closer. \u201cYou\u2019re not being a baby. You\u2019re being real.\u201d</p><p>Feeling some of the burden fall off my chest, I pull his arms around me even more, never wanting him to let me go.</p><p>He gives me a piggyback ride back to the hotel because my feet hurt from all the walking we did. I can\u2019t stop laughing the entire time, because people keep looking at us strangely, although some are envious.</p><p>When we enter the lobby of the hotel, the bellman, who is wearing a funny hat and a buttoned uniform, approaches us with a stern look on his narrow face. \u201cNo roughhousing in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>Micha\u2019s boots scuff against the white marble flooring. \u201cAbsolutely. We\u2019ll save that for the bedroom,\u201d he replies as he backs into the elevator with me on his back.</p><p>The bellman scowls as the doors glide shut with Micha giving him a little wave. I move to climb off his back, but he links his arms underneath my legs as he punches in the button to our floor and the elevator jerks upward.</p><p>When it reaches our floor, he holds me in place as he walks through the doors and down the long hallway to our room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A middle-age couple walks by and the woman presses her hand to her heart. \u201cOh look, Harold, newlyweds.\u201d</p><p>It kills my mood, but Micha laughs as he slides the keycard into the slot and opens the door. He gently sets me down, but scoops me right back up into his arms. \u201cGotta carry her over the threshold, right?\u201d He winks at the woman and she smiles, smitten.</p><p>He carries me into the room and kicks the door close. \u201cWelcome to the honeymoon suite, where only dirty things are allowed to happen.\u201d</p> <p>I swat his arm as he heads toward the bed. \u201cWe are not newlyweds, so stop pretending.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glint wickedly and then he tosses me onto the massive bed decorated with white comforter and mints on the pillows. My body bounces when I hit the mattress and I flip onto my stomach, narrowing my eyes at him as he laughs hysterically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you pay for that,\u201d I warn with a dark look. \u201cReally, really bad.\u201d</p><p>He backs toward his bag that\u2019s on the sofa. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d</p><p>I roll onto my back and drape my arm over my forehead as I stare up at the ceiling, feeling happy, and I desperately want to hold onto it. \u201cI bet you are.\u201d</p> <p>Seconds later, he bounds on top of me, bracing himself with his hands just in time so he doesn\u2019t quite smash my body. \u201cI know what we should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Whatever\u2019s about to come out of your mouth, I don\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d I say and he traps my arms above my head. \u201cYou\u2019re in one of your moods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere everything you say is going to include being naughty. You know, I\u2019ve often wondered if you just saved it for me, or if you did this kind of stuff with the girls you hooked up with.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tenses and he slants away from me, still gripping my wrists. \u201cYou know I was never with anyone long enough to do anything with them really.\u201d</p><p>Our happy mood is dying because of me and I don\u2019t want it to end. \u201cTell me what you wanted to do and don\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p> <p>His aqua eyes sparkle like the ocean in the sunlight. \u201cWe should wrestle.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head from side to side. \u201cNo way. The last time I wrestled you you sat on me for, like, ten minutes, laughing your ass off because I couldn\u2019t get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, get your story straight. I was straddling you, not sitting on you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd second off, I only stayed on you for that long because every time you tried to get away your body would rub against me and I was getting turned on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were, like, fifteen,\u201d I contend. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see me like that yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was fifteen,\u201d he retorts. \u201cAnd you were a girl.\u201d</p><p>I giggle at his goofy smile. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s wrestle, but I\u2019m not holding back.\u201d</p><p>Sucking on his lip ring, he backs off the bed, slips off his shirt, and tosses it onto the floor. \u201cNeither am I.\u201d</p><p>I drop my face into my hands, shaking my head, aware I\u2019m about to walk into a mess, but Anna told me to be my own judge of situations. Right now, I\u2019m having fun and don\u2019t want it to end, so I get to my feet and stand up on the mattress.</p> <p>\u201cJust don\u2019t break anything,\u201d I warn, pointing at the glass lamps all around the room and the portraits on the wall. \u201cAnd don\u2019t break me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles darkly. \u201cOh trust me, I\u2019ve got big plans for you when I win.\u201d</p><p>I start to head for the side of the bed, but he matches my move and blocks my path with his arms out to my side.</p><p>To throw him off, I skitter to the other side but then whirl and backtrack, shooting for the open gap as I leap onto the floor and hurry toward the sofa.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t supposed to be a game of tag.\u201d He winds around the couch toward me and I dash to the other side. \u201cYou have to at least try to pin me to the ground.\u201d</p><p>I back toward the bathroom, debating whether or not to lock myself in there. \u201cAs soon as I\u2019m within arm\u2019s reach, I know I\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p><p>He stalks toward me, his lean arms flexing as he pops his knuckles. \u201cCome on, challenge me. You know you want to. That is unless you\u2019re too scared.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s intentionally trying to get under my skin and it\u2019s working. I search for a solution and smile when I find one. With trembling fingers, I grab the bottom of my shirt, raise it over my head, and shake my hair out.</p><p>He leisurely takes in my bare skin and black bra. \u201cNice move.\u201d</p><p>I inch toward him and he matches my steps so we meet in the center of the room. I extend my hand for him, with no other plan than to graze my fingers along his stomach muscles, but he seizes my wrist and crashes our bodies together.</p><p>He lifts me up and my legs secure around his hips as his long legs stride toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t wrestling,\u201d I say, throwing my head back, laughing.</p><p>His lips upturn to a conspiratorial grin as he brushes my hair out of my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to throw you down on the floor to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I ask as he falls down on the bed, landing on top of me.</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d With a sinister look in his eyes, he gathers my wrists in one hand, rendering me captive, while putting a leg on either side of me.</p><p>My body writhes. \u201cHow do I tap out?\u201d</p><p>He leans in closely and strands of his blond hair tickle my cheeks. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d He grazes his finger along my rib cage and I jerk upward.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d I advise, squirming to get away \u201cI mean it. It\u2019s not funny and this time I\u2019ll get you back.\u201d</p><p>His fingers move along my stomach, dithering, before he squeezes my side. My muscles tense as I squeal. \u201cMicha, please don\u2019t,\u201d I beg, forcing back the laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything you want, just don\u2019t tickle me.\u201d</p><p>He moves his hand away, looking pleased. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how you win wrestling.\u201d</p><p>I stare up at him with anger in my eyes, but my body is ecstatic with being concealed beneath his. \u201cThat was a dirty move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, I like to play dirty.\u201d He pauses, with his eyes piercing into mine as his breathing speeds up. \u201cElla... I\u2019m not sure how far to push you. I know you said you needed time to get better, but you\u2019re lying under me and it feels so fucking good\u2014all I want to do is touch you right now.\u201d</p><p>My chest heaves as I imagine his hands all over me and my therapist\u2019s words echo in my head: baby steps. \u201cYou can touch me if you want... But just take it slow.\u201d</p><p>He waits for me to retract my statement, but I clench my lips shut with nervousness and anticipation. Purposely, his hand tracks up my side and toward my breast as he gazes into my eyes. When his hand arrives at the bottom of my bra, he stops to test my reaction. I lay motionless, craving for him to go further, and bow into him.</p><p>His aqua eyes blaze as his fingers slide underneath my bra while his mouth dips toward my neck. Sucking on my skin just below my ear, his hand massages my breast and his thumb brushes across my nipple. He doesn\u2019t try to take my bra off and instead of his hand going into my pants, he keeps it on the outside as he rubs me between my legs.</p><p>He\u2019s keeping a boundary, so he won\u2019t take it too far. I love him so much there are no words to describe it. I\u2019m extremely lucky to have him. I make a promise to myself that I will work on giving him what he wants and try to make him happy.</p><p>Seconds later, a blissful moan escapes my lips as he momentarily takes my anxiety away.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Micha</p><p>The next day is the transplant thing and we meet up with my dad at the hospital. The room they put us in is small, with a curtain, a couple of chairs, and this odd-looking machine with a lot of wires. It smells like Lysol and the loudness of the hallway flows in from the open door.</p><p>I read up on the procedure before I came out to New York and it\u2019s not too complicated. The doctor will put a needle in my arm and run some of my blood through a machine before it returns to my veins.</p><p>My dad is doing something on his phone as the three of us sit there in silence. Ella is scrapping her fingernail polish off, and I can\u2019t stop tapping my foot against the floor. Ella\u2019s got a hickey on her neck from where I sucked on her skin last night. She tried to cover it up with makeup, but it\u2019s still visible and I love that it is.</p><p>\u201cMicha, could you knock that off?\u201d my dad asks rudely as he eyes my foot. \u201cI have a headache.\u201d</p><p>I stop jiggling my leg and Ella slides me a sidelong glance before staring coldly at my father.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind getting off your phone?\u201d she asks him, pulling at the ends of her sleeves \u201cIt\u2019s kind of rude since he\u2019s here to help you.\u201d</p><p>God, I love when she gets this way. Even though it\u2019s rare, her spitfire attitude is beautiful. At least to me, but probably not so much for the people she\u2019s directing it at.</p><p>My dad scowls at her harshly as he pushes a button on his phone. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, excuse you,\u201d she counters. \u201cInstead of doing that, you should be sitting here thanking him, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I cover my mouth with my hand to hold back a smile and place my other hand over hers, sketching my finger along her wrist, thinking about what it felt like to touch her last night.</p><p>My father looks at me, hoping I\u2019ll intervene, but I shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>The nurse enters before anyone can say anything else. She has a clipboard in her hand and her eyes skim the papers. Her hair is the same shade as Ella\u2019s but she is at least ten years older, with brown eyes and freckles. \u201cAlright, is it Micha?\u201d</p><p>I flash her a charismatic smile. \u201cYeah, you even pronounced it right, which doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me, a little frazzled as she sets the clipboard down on the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s probably better if you two wait outside. It\u2019ll take a little while.\u201d</p><p>Ella looks at me and I nod my head while my dad hurries out of the room like it\u2019s on fire.</p><p>Before she leaves, Ella kisses me on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be right outside if you need me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s been acting weird since last night, more affectionate, which I don\u2019t mind, but it\u2019s puzzling.</p><p>Once the room is cleared out, the nurse prepares the machine and puts a needle in my arm. I barely notice the sting. My thoughts are with Ella and what she\u2019s saying to my dad.</p><p>Ella</p> <p>As soon as I lay eyes on Micha\u2019s dad, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s an arrogant asshole. He\u2019s wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, like he needs to prove he has somewhere important to be. Micha hasn\u2019t really talked to me much about what goes on between them, but it\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s been bad.</p><p>After the nurse asks us to leave, I sit in the waiting area and Micha\u2019s dad seats himself across from me. It\u2019s loud, with screaming children and people coughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that little girl who lived next door, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Micha\u2019s dad asks with a disdainful tone. He looks like Micha, with aqua eyes and attractive facial features, only older. \u201cThe one who had the family with all the problems.\u201d</p><p>He hits me in my weak spot and it takes a lot of mental preparation before I retaliate. \u201cAren\u2019t you the asshole who walked out on his family?\u201d</p><p>The old lady beside me turns her head in our direction, shunning me with a look for my foul language.</p> <p>Micha\u2019s dad leans forward in his seat, buttoning up the cuff of one of his sleeves. \u201cI\u2019d like to know why you think you can talk to me this way. You don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do know you.\u201d I cross my legs and rest my arms on my lap. \u201cYou\u2019re the man who walked out on the greatest person you\u2019ll never know. And you know what, I\u2019m kind of glad you did, otherwise Micha might have turned into a dick like you.\u201d</p><p>Micha\u2019s dad looks at me like he wants to slap me and the old lady narrows her eyes at me, about to say something, but I leave the room before she gets an opportunity.</p><p>I wander around the hospital halls and pass the nurse\u2019s desk, deciding to steal a lollipop from out of the bin to give to Micha as a joke. The hospital is a sad place, full of crying and screaming people and beeping machines. It\u2019s like everyone is waiting around for someone to die and it puts an unnerving feeling in the air. It brings me back to the day my mother died and we went to the hospital with her, even though she was pronounced dead on arrival. I didn\u2019t cry, but my dad and Dean did, hugging each other while I stood near the end of the hall, watching the nurses and doctors walk by.</p><p>I felt out of place, like I shouldn\u2019t have been there. Finally I ended up leaving and walked all the way home, curled up in my bed, and stared at the ceiling until the sun rose, knowing my life would never be the same.</p><p>When I reach the psychiatry services area, it feels like an invisible hand winds around my neck and strangles me. I back away from it quickly, bumping into a nurse wearing blue scrubs.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She glances over my shoulder at the shut door. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be back here.\u201d</p><p>I inch away from her. \u201cNothing. I was just looking for the restroom.\u201d</p><p>I collect my thoughts about how I might end up in a place like this and I return to the front desk area. Micha is waiting for me in one of the chairs, flipping through a magazine. His skin is pale and his blond hair sticks to his forehead. He has on a Rise Against T-shirt and black jeans and the leather bands that were on his wrist are replaced by a bandage.</p><p>Hiding the lollipop in my hand behind my back, I approach him. \u201cYou made it out alive.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at me and smiles tiredly. \u201cOf course I did, but where did you wander off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere really.\u201d I sit down in the chair beside him and he tosses the magazine onto the table. \u201cI wanted to get away from your father.\u201d</p><p>He searches my face. \u201cWhat did you say to him? Because he came back to the room all pissed off.\u201d</p><p>I give a one-shouldered shrug. \u201cNothing but the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Grinning, he stretches his legs out in front of himself and raises his arms above his head. \u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you I\u2019d like to go back to the hotel room and sleep. That took a lot out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to wait for your dad to get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not really.\u201d He drops his hands to his lap. \u201cWhat are you hiding behind your back?\u201d</p><p>My mouth curves into a grin as I extend my hand out to him with the red lollipop in my palm. \u201cThis is for being a very brave boy.\u201d</p><p>He laughs softly and takes the lollipop. \u201cGod, I love you.\u201d</p><p>I get to my feet and help him to his. His movements are lethargic as we head toward the sliding-glass doors.</p><p>He peels the wrapper off the lollipop and puts it in his mouth. \u201cAs much as I love your gift, there are a ton more ways you could make me feel better when we get back to the room.\u201d</p><p>I laugh under my breath, not protesting, because at that moment I\u2019d do anything for him.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Micha</p><p>The leaves have fallen from the trees and the air has cooled, but it\u2019s nothing compared to Star Grove. It\u2019s almost time to go home for Christmas break, and Christmas seems to be everywhere. Ella is still being stubborn about it. I try multiple times to convince her to go with me, but every time she declines politely.</p><p>Two nights before Ethan and I are supposed to leave just happens to be my first gig at The Hook Up. It\u2019s Friday night and every table and booth is full. People crowd the bar, yelling out orders to the bartender, a midtwenties woman with bright tattoos on her arms and dreadlocks and a piercing in her nose. There are red and green lights strung up along the ceiling and a Christmas tree centerpiece on each table.</p><p>It\u2019s been a while since I played by myself and there\u2019s unnatural nervous energy pouring through my blood. From the back doorway, my eyes scan the room, taking in the noisy people.</p><p>Someone pinches my ass from behind and I spin around. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>Ella smiles brightly at me. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous.\u201d</p><p>My eyes stroll lazily down her body. Her hair is done up in this messy twist with bits and pieces framing her face, her full lips shine in the light, and she\u2019s got this short, green, thin-strapped shirt on and a pair of skin-tight jeans that hug every inch of her curves. \u201cGet real, pretty girl. You know I never get nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look nervous,\u201d she repeats, dragging her bottom lip between her teeth.</p><p>I trace my finger across her red lips. \u201cYou look a little nervous yourself.\u201d</p><p>She nips playfully at my finger, startling me and turning me on. \u201cI\u2019m only nervous for you.\u201d</p><p>Ever since we left New York, our relationship has been on a strict friends basis. She seemed to close the door when we returned to our real lives so I backed off, even though I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cDid you come back here just to psych me out?\u201d I joke to cover up the sexual tension. I rake my hands through my hair and glance over my shoulder at the people pouring in through the front door. \u201cBecause that is very mean of you.\u201d</p><p>She throws her arms around my neck and bites at my earlobe. \u201cI\u2019m feeling very mean tonight.\u201d</p><p>Gently pushing her back by the shoulder, I notice her eyes are glossy and dilated. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><p>She bobs her head up and down, looking cute as hell. \u201cI had a rough night so Lila gave me some shots of Bacardi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila gave you Bacardi?\u201d I question with a doubtful arch of my eyebrow. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem like the Bacardi type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... Ethan gave it to her.\u201d She teeters to the side, falling toward the floor, and my arm snakes around her waist.</p><p>I help her recompose her balance and keep a hand on her side. \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine...\u201d Her eyes drift to the middle of the room where people are dancing beneath the bright lights. \u201cWe should dance.\u201d</p><p>Suppressing a laugh, I scoot us to the side when a group of rough-looking guys walks by. I turn her back to the wall and she leans against it while I brace a hand possessively beside her head. \u201cElla May, I have to play in, like, five minutes. I can\u2019t dance right now.\u201d</p><p>She pouts out her bottom lip, sulking and batting her eyelashes. \u201cPretty please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla...\u201d I start through a laugh and then my shoulders jerk upward as one of her hands rubs up the front of my jeans over my hard cock. I snag her hand before she can stick it down the front of my jeans. \u201cBaby, I think you might be a little drunk, so take it easy, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her free hand begins to seek the same area when Ethan and Lila appear in the doorway. Ethan\u2019s carrying a beer in his hand and Lila has a phone up to her ear, talking really loudly over the noisy room behind us.</p><p>\u201cSo she found you,\u201d Ethan calls out with a smirk. \u201cThank God. She wouldn\u2019t shut up about you.\u201d</p><p>Ella burrows her face into my chest. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did you let her drink?\u201d I ask Ethan, annoyed. \u201cToo much, obviously.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shakes his head and tips his head back to take a swing of his beer. \u201cShe chose to drink. I left them out in the living room for, like, fifteen minutes while I was taking a shower, getting ready for this little shindig. When I came out, there was a half a bottle of our Bacardi missing and these two were in the kitchen drunk off their asses.\u201d</p><p>Lila stumbles in her heels and supports herself with a hand against the wall. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really give a shit what you do,\u201d she says into the phone. \u201cI don\u2019t want you coming over.\u201d</p><p>A big grin rises across Ethan\u2019s red-tinted face as he points at Lila. \u201cShe\u2019s breaking up with some dude over the phone. It\u2019s fucking hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d I accuse, stumbling backward as Ella puts all her weight against me.</p><p>Ethan nods his head. \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>I smooth Ella\u2019s hair away from her face. \u201cWho drove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took a taxi.\u201d Ethan gulps down his beer and sets the empty bottle down near the wall with many discarded bottles and glasses. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to drive drunk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ella cups her hand around my ear and whispers, \u201cBut he didn\u2019t pay the cab driver. He made us jump out and run.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and put my arm around her lower back. \u201cLet\u2019s go get you three sat down, so I can focus on what I need to do.\u201d</p><p>I choose a booth in the far corner and ask the waitress who showed me where everything was to keep an eye on them and not serve them any more alcohol. They\u2019re trashed\u2014beyond trashed and it\u2019s only going to lead to trouble.</p> <p>Ella rests her head on the table with a sad, puppy-dog look on her face and I brush her hair away from her sweaty forehead.</p><p>I crouch down beside her and ask in a low voice, \u201cDid something happen tonight that upset you?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and turns her face away from me. \u201cNothing happened. I just want to go home and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s lying, but I can\u2019t pick her brain right now. Even though it nearly kills me, I leave the table and head for the backstage area to collect my guitar. When I step out onstage and into the light, the room quiets down a little, but it\u2019s still not the best scenario. The place is a real shithole, and for once I\u2019d just like to play somewhere where people aren\u2019t wasted.</p><p>I strum a chord, put my lips up to the microphone, and pour my heart out to a roomful of strangers who aren\u2019t listening.</p> <p>After the performance some big, bald dude corners me backstage in the hallway and hands me a card with his name and phone number on it.</p><p>\u201cHey, that was an awesome performance.\u201d He\u2019s got a scar running down half of his arm and a gold chain around his neck.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumble, reading the card. \u201cMike Anderly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are...\u201d He waits for me to tell him.</p><p>\u201cMicha,\u201d I say, excluding my last name on purpose.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m gonna get straight to the point.\u201d He talks with his hands out in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m a music producer. I work for a pretty small but good, honest company out in San Diego. I like your sound and I\u2019d love to talk to you about what your future plans are in the music business.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at the card. \u201cMy future plans?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, with your music.\u201d</p><p>I pick up my guitar case. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not sure what my plans are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when you do decide, give me a call,\u201d he says and turns for the main room. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m really interested in your sound.\u201d He walks away and I figure he\u2019s probably just some weirdo.</p><p>But what if he\u2019s not? What if it\u2019s some random act of luck? I may not have said I know what I want to do with my music, but I do. I want to play in a place that isn\u2019t shitty, where people listen and understand. I want to be a musician.</p><p>I feel like a parent, getting the three of them home, and by the time we\u2019re stumbling into my apartment, I\u2019m ready for all of them to pass out. I pick up Ella and carry her back to my bed because she can barely walk.</p><p>\u201cKeep your dick in your pants,\u201d I advise Ethan as he ambles into the kitchen with his arm around a very intoxicated Lila. \u201cAnd don\u2019t drink anymore.\u201d</p><p>He waves me off and Lila giggles as she opens the fridge, knocking over bottles. I descend down the hall and back to my room with Ella in my arms. Her breathing is soft and she keeps murmuring something about wanting it all to go away. It\u2019s scaring the shit out of me.</p> <p>Without putting her down, I kick my boots off into the corner with the rest of my shoes and carefully lay her down on my bed. The lights in my room are off, but the moonlight gleams through the window and onto her face, her plump lips, her beautiful, flawless pale skin.</p><p>She snuggles into my pillow and murmurs, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I pull the blankets over her. \u201cFor what, baby?\u201d</p><p>She sighs, disheartened. \u201cFor ruining your first performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin my performance, pretty girl.\u201d With a small smile on my face, I kiss her cheek. \u201cI love you. Now go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>By the time I get my shirt off, she\u2019s passed out. I take a quick shower, washing the icky feeling of the night away. I\u2019m not thrilled to have to play in places where people barely listen. I want more, and even though the guy was sketchy, I wonder if maybe he could be legitimate.</p><p>When I return to the bedroom with a towel wrapped around my waist, Ella is sitting up on the bed and the lamp is on. She has a musing look on her face, like she\u2019s about to start some trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be asleep,\u201d I tell her, tossing my dirty clothes into the hamper and grabbing some clean pants from the top dresser drawer. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s checking me out, which would be great, except she\u2019s drunk and I can\u2019t do anything with her without feeling bad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d Her speech is slightly slurred and her eyes are red. \u201cCan we do something?\u201d</p><p>I climb into bed and sit down next to her. \u201cI think we should go to sleep. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan and Lila are still awake.\u201d She retrieves a bottle of Jack that was hidden behind her back, twists off the cap, and flicks it to the foot of the bed. \u201cThey\u2019re playing strip poker.\u201d</p><p>My eyes enlarge. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>She bobs her head up and down. \u201cThey\u2019ve already both taken off their shirts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you just out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, where do you think I got this?\u201d She shakes the bottle in front of my face and my hand darts out to steal it away, but she jerks her hand back, laughing. \u201cUh-huh. No way, Micha Scott. Not until you play with me.\u201d She kneels up in front of me and swings her leg over my lap, tipping her head back to take a gulp. She gags, before her face turns serious. \u201cYou remember that time... that night my mom died?\u201d</p><p>My body constricts. \u201cHow could I forget that night?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a mischievous look in her green eyes, and I wonder where the fuck this conversation is heading. \u201cYou remember how you kissed me before climbing down that tree?\u201d</p><p>I nod, wrapping my fingers around her waist. \u201cOf course I remember, but I\u2019m surprised you do.\u201d Because she was just about as drunk that night as she is now.</p><p>She licks her lips seductively. \u201cIt was a nice kiss, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I remove the bottle from her hands and force down a big swig, knowing I\u2019m going to need it. I\u2019ve never seen this side of her and even though she\u2019s drunk, I am really fucking curious what lies ahead. \u201cIt was a very nice kiss.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward and places her hands on my shoulders. \u201cWe should do it again.\u201d</p><p>An internal struggle develops inside me over what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and she softly presses her lips to mine. She rarely kisses me first and it\u2019s a nice change, to know I\u2019m wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sexy.\u201d Her finger draws along my stomach muscles and my breath hitches. \u201cI used to secretly stare at you all the time when you would work on cars with your shirt off.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh at the secret she\u2019s divulged and playfully trail kisses down her jawline to distract her from her confession. \u201cHow about we go see what Lila and Ethan are up to.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, she leaps off the bed and knocks the lamp over. Not bothering to pick it up, she backs toward the hall. \u201cIf you want me in bed, you\u2019re going to have to come get me first.\u201d She takes off running.</p><p>I slip on a pair of jeans and a shirt, grab the bottle of Jack, and go out into the kitchen where Ethan and Lila are sitting at the table with their shirts off and cards out in front of them. Ella slumped over the fridge door, digging noisily through the beers.</p><p>Ethan drops the cards down on the kitchen table and surrenders his hands. \u201cLila talked me into it.\u201d</p><p>Lila gazes up at me with little recognition. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I did.\u201d</p><p>I drop down in the seat between them and take a shot. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m giving up on trying to stop this regrettable night.\u201d I collect the cards and shuffle them. \u201cSo don\u2019t come crying to me when you\u2019re all naked and cold.\u201d</p><p>Ella</p><p>I didn\u2019t plan on drinking this much, and I feel guilty for dragging Micha and everyone else into my mess. But I wanted to forget for two goddamn seconds that my father is going home for Christmas and invited Dean and Caroline back to the house for the weekend, but not me. I had to hear what was going on when Dean called and asked me where the key to the Cutlass were because he was planning on fixing it up and selling it or some shit\u2014I hung up on him before I heard the full story.</p><p>Then the letter arrived from my dad. The freaking letter that I just couldn\u2019t open, because it felt like whatever was in it could potentially crush my world into a billion pieces.</p><p>By the time we showed up to Micha and Ethan\u2019s house, I was verging on a panic attack and I\u2019d forgotten to take my medication that morning.</p><p>When Ethan had gone to take a shower, Lila pulled out a bottle of Bacardi and ordered me to spill my guts over a few drinks. A few turned into a very long blurry line and suddenly it\u2019s several hours later. I have cards in my hand, a beer up to my lips, and a very intense game of strip Texas Hold\u2019em going on. My shirt\u2019s on the floor, along with my socks and boots.</p><p>Ethan and Lila left the house to go make a beer run. Micha made them give him the keys to the truck so he knew they would walk instead of trying to drive. Micha and I keep the game going, both of us determined to win. My drunken state has simmered down since I switched to beer, but my ability to make good choices is hindered.</p><p>Micha sits across the table from me, mulling over his cards. \u201cI think I\u2019ll raise you your bra.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head with my eyes narrowed at him. \u201cNo way. Only one article of clothing per hand.\u201d</p><p>He flicks his lip ring with his tongue, trying to seduce me and play dirty. \u201cAnd who made up those rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d I circle my finger above my head. \u201cSee this invisible crown right here. That means I\u2019m the Queen of Poker and therefore I get to make up any rule whenever I want.\u201d</p><p>An off-pitch laugh bursts from his lips. \u201cThat motion you made is for a halo, not a crown, and an angel is something you\u2019re not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My jaw drops and I throw a chip at him, hitting him in the chest. \u201cI am so an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d He rubs his nipple where the chip scraped. \u201cThat was vicious.\u201d</p><p>I nip my teeth at the air and then laugh, taking a drink of my beer. \u201cNow back to the game. What do you have?\u201d</p> <p>He taps his fingers on the table, eyeing his cards and then targets an inside-melting gaze on me. \u201cI want to up the bet,\u201d he says, and when I start to gripe, he adds, \u201cIf you win you get my signed Silverstein shirt, but if I win you have to get naked.\u201d</p><p>My heart thumps deafeningly in my chest. \u201cI thought you said you\u2019d never give me that shirt\u2014that it was your pride and joy for getting it signed.\u201d</p><p>He gives a blas\u00e9 shrug. \u201cI\u2019m making an exception right now.\u201d</p><p>I measure the pair of queens in my hand and the one laid down on the table, but there is also a pair of aces dealt. Shit. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ella May,\u201d he says, wiggling his eyebrows up and down. \u201cLoosen up.\u201d</p> <p>From over my cards, I glare at him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. If you lose you give me the shirt, but if I lose I\u2019ll take off my bra and jeans, but the panties are staying on.\u201d</p><p>Micha chuckles and takes a shot. \u201cThat\u2019s not very fun.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you play poker with girls like this before and you never offer up anything this rewarding unless you have a good hand and know you\u2019ll win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen you play enough times that I know you won\u2019t back down from a good challenge,\u201d he retaliates, slamming the bottle onto the table. \u201cSo come, pretty girl, are you in or out?\u201d</p><p>I consider it, but not for very long, and lay my cards down on the table. \u201cI\u2019m in. Now what do you have?\u201d</p><p>A soon as his lips turn upward, I know how it ends. He slaps his cards down on the table. \u201cGet naked, Ella May.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou had the fucking ace.\u201d I smack some of the cards off the table and they float to the floor. \u201cI knew you had it.\u201d</p><p>He continues to grin. \u201cAnd yet you kept playing. Now get naked.\u201d</p><p>I stare inanely at him. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t fair. You tricked me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hold mine powerfully as he pats his hands on the table. \u201cThat was a totally fair hand and you know it, so stop being a baby and hand over your losings.\u201d</p><p>Staring him down, I come to the conclusion that there\u2019s no point in fighting. Keeping my eyes on him, I get to my feet and carry my chin high.</p><p>He raises a finger as he shoves the chair away from the table. \u201cJust a second.\u201d He saunters into the living room and disappears out of my sight.</p><p>Confused, I start to head for the doorway to find out what he\u2019s doing, but as soon as my foot inches forward, the stereo clicks on and I stop as \u201cCloser\u201d by Nine Inch Nails clicks on.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding me?\u201d I mumble as Micha struts into the kitchen with a pleased grin on his face as he rubs his hands together. \u201cNo way. Music was not part of the deal.\u201d</p> <p>He braces his hands on the door frame and the light highlights the muscles on his chest and the shameless blaze in his aqua eyes. \u201cNow, most guys would have gone with some sexy song you had to dance to, but I\u2019m a lyrical man myself and I think this song fits perfectly.\u201d</p><p>The lyrics make my cheeks heat. \u201cIn no way, shape, or form did I offer up a striptease.\u201d</p><p>His tongue slips slowly out of his mouth and when he pulls it back in, he draws his lip ring with it as his fingers comb through his disheveled hair, leaving strands sticking up. \u201cPay up, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>Pressing my lips firmly together to bury my nerves, I reach around to the back of my bra and unclasp it. Wavering temporarily, I inhale an insecure breath, release the fabric from my fingers, and allow it to fall to the floor.</p><p>His eyes drift to my chest, unashamed, as he sips a beer. When he pulls the bottle away from his lips, he makes a motion with his finger. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>I want to smack him upside the head, but I unbutton my jeans. With my knees shaking, I step out of my pants and stand vulnerable in the spotlight, something I despise. Thankfully, I\u2019m wearing boy-cut panties so at least my ass is covered. His eyes lazily move up my long legs, across my bare stomach, finally resting on my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can sit down now,\u201d he says like he\u2019s the boss.</p><p>Proving a point, I walk across the kitchen and steal a beer from the fridge. \u201cI don\u2019t have to sit down just because you tell me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Warm fingers grip my side and reel me around, snatching the beer from my hand as my back presses against the fridge door. Micha stands only a sliver of space away from me, eyes fierce, lips tantalizing, his expression yearning with need.</p><p>He leans in to kiss me, but my hand pushes at his chest, and his bare skin is warm as I hold him back. \u201cNo way. You didn\u2019t win anything but a show.\u201d</p><p>Lowering my head, I duck under his arm, but he snags my wrist and pins it above my head kind of roughly. We\u2019re drunk and neither of us is thinking rationally, but my interest in what\u2019s coming renders me motionless.</p><p>His pupils are so large only a ring of aqua is left. His breath is hot against my cheek as he takes my other arm and confines it above my head so my body is exposed to him. It seems like I should be nervous, but excitement bubbles through my very starved body.</p><p>He inclines toward me and his chest brushes my tingling nipples. \u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d His voice is husky.</p><p>I shake my head with honesty. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The thumb of his free hand travels down my side and along each rib before settling on my hipbone. Wetting his lips with his tongue, he moves his mouth toward my breast and my eyes close as he takes my nipple in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I moan as ecstasy shoots up between my legs and coils through my stomach as my back curves into him. \u201cMicha...\u201d</p><p>He releases my arms, and before an objection departs my lips, his picks me up and smashes his lips into mine. I vice-grip my legs around his hips and my lips open willingly, allowing his tongue to enter my mouth for a heart-stopping kiss. Backing toward the sofa blindly, his hands feel all over my skin, leaving a trail of heat everywhere.</p><p>\u201cNot on the couch,\u201d I murmur. \u201cLila and Ethan could be back at any moment.\u201d</p><p>He gives a glance at the front door and then turns us in the direction of the hallway. His fingers sneak up the bottom of my panties and cup my ass as he kicks his bedroom door open hard with his foot and the doorknob bangs into the wall. Without our lips parting, we fall onto the mattress with a bounce. Giggling, my fingers slide down his hard chest and to the button of his jeans, but he halts my hand with his.</p><p>\u201cElla, maybe we shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he says, blinking dazedly through the alcohol.</p><p>I manage to slip my other hand down the front of his jeans and his breath falters. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Sucking a sharp breath through his nose, his head slumps forward as I rub him and drive him crazy. \u201cTrust me, that\u2019s not it. I think we...\u201d</p><p>I hit the right spot and all his thoughts drift away. His lips pursue mine again and he kisses me freely as his hand slides down my stomach and to the edge of my panties. Hooking his finger into the top, he yanks them down my legs and when they reach my feet, I kick them off.</p><p>Instead of his lips returning to my mouth, they endeavor to my stomach just above my belly button. Smoothing kisses down my skin, his warm tongue licks a path all the way down and my legs open up so his tongue can slip inside me and my mind becomes even foggier.</p><p>When my eyes open, sunlight filters into the room and my head is pounding. A blanket is bunched up over me and my pores feel icky. Wiping the sweat from my cheek, I sit up and glance down at the signed Silverstein T-shirt covering my body.</p><p>A smile breaks through as I spot a folded-up piece of paper on the pillow beside me and pick it up. Micha\u2019s handwriting is scribbled across the lines in red ink.</p><p>Hey beautiful,</p><p>So that was quit the drunken night... never done one of those with you before. I think I might have a new song to add to our list.</p><p>Anyway, don\u2019t get all worked up. I stopped it before it got too far, in case you can\u2019t remember. I didn\u2019t want you to have to suffer through a drunken mistake. Trust me, I\u2019m an expert at them and they\u2019re not fun.</p><p>I hate to bail on you, but I got to go to work. I\u2019ll stop by your place later. And you can keep the shirt. It looks better on you anyway.</p><p>Love you more than life itself, more than the sun and the air.</p><p>You own my soul, Ella May.</p><p>Micha</p><p>Still smiling, I climb out of bed and slip my jeans on. Leave it to Micha to sign a letter like that. He\u2019s always had such a poetic way with words and his beauty shines with each letter.</p><p>Grabbing my shirt off the floor, I depart for the front door, folding up the note carefully and tucking it safely into the back pocket of my jeans. I feel light, even though I\u2019m hungover. I don\u2019t regret what happened, although it would have been nice if we were sober. The feeling is strange, but maybe that means I\u2019m getting better at dealing with life.</p><p>The living room is trashed, beer bottles all over the floor and coffee table, and there\u2019s an empty Bacardi bottle on the table, along with scattered poker cards. Getting a garbage bag from the kitchen drawer, I rack my brain for where my phone and purse are. I remember being at the club, Micha playing on stage, and then coming here and his hands all over me. My eyelids drift shut as I remember every moment of it.</p><p>\u201cOnly One\u201d by Yellowcard begins playing from somewhere in the room and my eyes snap open. With my ears perked up, I follow the sound, which guides me to the couch. Under a frayed throw pillow is my phone. My eyebrows scrunch as I scoop it up, not recognizing the ringtone. When I glance at the screen, however, it makes sense.</p><p>I answer the phone. \u201cDid you change my ringtone for you?\u201d</p><p>His laughter fills the other end of the line. \u201cIt seemed fitting this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like you\u2019re trying to send me a message through your notes and your song choice.\u201d I collect a bottle from off the top of the television and drop it into the bag. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not mad about last night, right? I was sober enough that I can remember stuff... You don\u2019t have to feel guilty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel guilty,\u201d he assures me over banging in the background. \u201cI\u2019m glad last night happened. The note and the song were my way of sending you a message.\u201d</p><p>Bending down, I pick up an empty beer carton and toss it into the bag, then tie it shut and drop it outside the front door, leaving the door open to grab my purse, which is near the television. \u201cWhat message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for you to figure out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what if I can\u2019t figure it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he responds. \u201cBut whether or not you say it out loud is a whole other story.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I already have it figured out, but saying it out loud is something I can\u2019t quite do.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very cryptic.\u201d Stepping outside into the warm sunshine, I shut the front door and drag the garbage bag down the stairs with the bottles clinking together. At the bottom, my eyes scan the parking lot. \u201cHow am I supposed to get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could stay there until I get home,\u201d Micha offers. \u201cOr better yet, you could just move in.\u201d</p> <p>My lungs compress, reducing the flow of oxygen as his heavy words crumble my mood. \u201cI have to get home. I have a class tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you have class at night?\u201d he questions. \u201cAre you just saying that because of my little moving-in remark?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother picking up the bag as I trudge toward the Dumpster and heave it inside. \u201cNo, I really have class,\u201d I lie. \u201cI\u2019ll call you a little bit later, okay? I need to find a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d His tone is clipped. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up before I can and it leaves me feeling hollow, like a part of me has been removed. Shaking the sensation away, I punch Lila\u2019s number into the keypad.</p><p>\u201cWell, look who decided to finally wake up,\u201d she answers with humor radiating from her voice. \u201cDid you do the walk of shame?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMicha and I didn\u2019t have sex, Lila,\u201d I respond in a snippy voice and then, feeling terrible, apologize. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just hungover or something. And I need to get home and lay down, but I don\u2019t have a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could take the bus.\u201d She pops a bubble into the phone. \u201cAlthough I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get home?\u201d I press my fingertips to the brim of my nose as my headache from hell surges.</p><p>\u201cEthan gave me a ride.\u201d A door slams and I hear keys hit the counter. \u201cI was actually just out to lunch with Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were done with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, he insisted.\u201d</p><p>I start toward the exit that is situated near a brick wall. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll track down a bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod luck with that. And watch out for the licker,\u201d she jokes with an evil laugh. \u201cKeep your elbows tucked in and stay away from the back of the bus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHa-ha, you\u2019re a freaking riot,\u201d I say derisively. \u201cTalk to you later.\u201d</p><p>I drag my exhausted legs toward the Starbucks at the corner of the street. After I have some caffeine in my system, my brain turns back on. But by the time I reach the apartment and recollect what made me drink that much in the first place, all I want to do is go to my room, turn the lights off, and sleep for an eternity. The letter from my dad still lies on the coffee table, unopened.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to open that?\u201d Lila appears in the doorway, dressed in a blue dress and heels that match. Her blonde hair is curled around her face and pinned by a few diamond barrettes.</p><p>Slipping off my sandals, I drop down on the couch and stare at the white envelope addressed to me. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>Clipping an earring in, she sits down beside me on the couch. \u201cElla, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and cross my feet up on the table. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>She picks up the letter and flips it over to the back. \u201cWhat are you so afraid of? With this letter? With Micha? With life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling it all\u2014losing it all,\u201d I say and her face twists. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just not sure what my dad is going to say and it kind of worries me.\u201d</p><p>Lila doesn\u2019t know about what happened with my mother. She knows she passed away, but not the circumstances leading to her death. Only my dad, Dean, and Micha know that haunting secret and I plan on keeping it that way.</p><p>I tear the envelope, taking a deep breath, and unfold the paper, telling myself that I can handle whatever\u2019s in there. That I\u2019m stronger than I used to be.</p><p>Ella May,</p><p>I want to start off by saying I\u2019m sorry for everything. And I mean that. I\u2019ve been sober for almost a month now and they took me off the meds. My head\u2019s clear and I don\u2019t like what\u2019s in it, especially everything related to you.</p><p>My therapist had me write down everything I regretted in therapy yesterday and it all seemed to be about you. It was like we all piled our garbage on you to clean up and it never should have been that way. The more I wrote, the more I realized you never really had a childhood. All those times I spent at the bar, I was being nothing but selfish. I\u2019m a terrible father who put everything on his daughter, for no other reason than I didn\u2019t want to be an adult.</p><p>That night was not your fault. You were seventeen and I was the adult. I should have been home with her, but Jack Daniels was much more important and easier to deal with.</p><p>I knew how bad she was, more than you\u2019ll ever understand, and deep down I knew I was wrong when I left you in charge that night. Now that my head is clear, I can imagine how hard it must be for you to deal with. All the pain you have to be feeling. I keep thinking about the pain in your eyes the last time I saw you and it eats away at me.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Ella. For ruining you childhood, for taking away your happiness, and just for messing up your fucking future.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>Dad</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck am I supposed to do with this?\u201d My hands shake as I clutch the letter in my hand. Tears pour out of my eyes as I force my lungs to breathe in and out as a wall around me crashes to the ground.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Micha</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I got so pissed off at Ella this morning on the phone, other than sometimes things between us feel hopeless. I love her and I know she loves me, but sometimes I don\u2019t think she does as much. It hurts when I analyze it.</p><p>That night, I pack and go to bed early, feeling down that Ella isn\u2019t coming with me. We\u2019ve spent the holidays together every single year since we were five. It was the only way to celebrate, since her family was never really into it and my mom couldn\u2019t afford to do much. She tried though, by decorating the house and making Ella and me a nice breakfast. She\u2019d always wrap a few presents up for the both of us. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was still nice.</p><p>Long after I fall asleep, my phone wakes me up. My hand fumbles across my nightstand, knocking over the lamp, until it finally brushes my phone. Still half alive, I blink my eyes into focus and see Ella\u2019s names on the screen.</p><p>I answer it quickly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She sounds hoarse. \u201cCan you come let me in? I didn\u2019t want to ring the doorbell and wake Ethan up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at my house?\u201d I rub my eyes and check the time on the clock.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m standing in front of the door.\u201d</p><p>I stumble out of bed and hurry to the door in my boxers, with the phone still held up to my ear. Flipping the porch light on, I swing open the door. The light hits her swollen eyes and the red streaks on her cheeks from the dried-up tears. She\u2019s wearing a pair of striped shorts, with flip-flops on her feet, and her hair is pulled up in a messy bun. She has no bra on under the thin tank top she\u2019s wearing and I can see her nipples through the fabric.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I haul her inside the house to hide her barely covered body away from the eyes of anyone else. Her skin is ice cold and she\u2019s shivering. \u201cDid you walk here?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and hugs her arms around herself. \u201cNo, I took the bus.\u201d</p><p>My gaze skims her bare legs and her perky nipples. \u201cDressed like that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and sinks down into the couch, grasping an envelope in her hand. \u201cThere was hardly anyone on it.\u201d</p><p>Turning the lamp on, I sit down on the couch and put my arm around her shoulder, desperate to make her feel better. \u201cWhat happened? And what\u2019s that in your hand?\u201d</p><p>She gives me the crinkled envelope with her name and address on it. \u201cThis came in the mail yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I turn it over, noting that she\u2019s opened and read whatever is inside. \u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d</p><p>She taps the return address with her finger. \u201cIt\u2019s from my dad.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>She stares at the floor, her eyes enlarged. \u201cThat he was sorry and that what happened to my mom wasn\u2019t my fault. That it was his because he was the adult and he never should have left that kind of responsibility on a child. That he should have been home taking care of his family instead of at the bar... and that he loves me.\u201d Tears flood her eyes and stream down her cheeks as her breathing becomes erratic. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted him to say that forever.\u201d</p><p>The ache in her voice almost makes me cry. She climbs onto my lap and buries her face into my chest, sobbing as she clutches desperately onto me. I scoop her up in my arms and carry her back to my bedroom where I lie down with her.</p><p>With each tear shed, she steals more of my heart, until she owns it completely. I realize that even through the hard times I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll face, I\u2019ll never be able to walk away from her.</p><p>I wake up with Ella\u2019s head pressed into the crook of my neck and her arms clasped firmly around my waist, as if she feared I\u2019d sneak off in the middle of the night.</p><p>She bawled her eyes out until she passed out and my heart nearly broke in two. Even though it makes me feel horrible, I sometimes hate her fucking family. They took a beautiful girl who was full of life and who could have done amazing things and crushed her into pieces. Although she\u2019s fixable\u2014I can see that now\u2014she is still so broken and vulnerable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRise and shine. We gotta hit the road.\u201d Ethan bangs the door open, and when he takes in the situation, his face drops. \u201cYou are still going, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I nod as Ella snuggles closer to me. \u201cYeah, give me like fifteen minutes or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, man. Just hurry your ass up.\u201d He walks away, leaving the door wide open.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, are you awake?\u201d I whisper in her ear and kiss the sensitive spot on her neck.</p><p>Her shoulder shivers upward as she nods her head with her eyes closed. \u201cHow could I sleep through Mr. Loud Mouth?\u201d</p><p>I nibble at the tip of her earlobe and breathe in the scent of her hair. \u201cI have to get ready to go... Are you sure you don\u2019t want to come with us? I really want you to.\u201d</p><p>Her leg hitches around my hip and her body bows into me. \u201cI think I\u2014I want to come with you guys, but I have to go back to my place and pack a bag real quick. And I have to stop by and do a quick visit with my therapist. We have to see if Lila will go with us too. I don\u2019t want her here alone.\u201d</p><p>My body stiffens from her intimate touch. \u201cAlright, but you know Ethan\u2019s gonna complain the entire time.\u201d</p> <p>She rolls on top of me, props herself up on her elbows, and peers down at me through her puffy eyes. \u201cI know, but he\u2019ll just have to deal with being a few hours late to wherever it is he thinks he has to be.\u201d</p><p>Knotting my fingers through her hair, I tug at the roots and bring her face close to mine, loving how her eyes roll back. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? Last night you had me worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Micha.\u201d She kisses my lips softly. \u201cLast night was a good thing, even though it was intense... and I think I need to go back home. If nothing else than to talk to my father.\u201d</p><p>She begins to recoil, but seizing her hips, I trap her in place and entice her lips back to mine. I slip my tongue inside her mouth and she lets out a quiet moan. When I let her go, our breathing is ragged. She backs off of me and I try not to think about our unbalanced love for each other. She\u2019ll get there eventually, once she understands what love is.</p><p>When I call out \u201cI love you\u201d as she heads for the hallway and she returns it with only a smile, it stings a little.</p><p>Ella</p> <p>Ethan lectured me the entire time I packed my bag and then his face got really red when I announced I had to go see my therapist before we took off. I need to talk to her, though, about my revelation last night. Ever since I was a little kid, I thought love wasn\u2019t real. Then Micha showed me differently, but I still couldn\u2019t love him like he deserved.</p><p>Whether intentional or not, my dad\u2019s letter released me from some of the burden I\u2019d been carrying. Not all of it, but some, and last night when I was curled up beside Micha, I envisioned something I\u2019d been blind to.</p><p>A hope for a future.</p><p>Anna is locking up her office door when I arrive. \u201cI thought I was supposed to meet you?\u201d</p><p>She whirls around, pressing her hand to her heart, her eyes amplified as her keys fall from her hands to the floor. \u201cGood God, you scared me.\u201d</p><p>I scoop up the keys and hand them to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just thought we had an appointment today.\u201d</p><p>She drops her keys into her purse. \u201cI was actually getting ready to call you. I got a call from my sister and she needs me to come over a couple days early. She\u2019s very worried about hosting Christmas dinner for everyone.\u201d</p><p>We make our way down the hallway of the school and push out through the doors, which latch shut behind us. It\u2019s a cloudy day and the violent breeze cools my skin and stings my cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cSo I guess I\u2019ll see you when you get back,\u201d I say, getting ready to leave her and cut across the grass toward my apartment.</p><p>She turns for the parking lot, but stops at the curb. \u201cOf course, first thing on Monday. And make sure to call me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s lifted truck drives up to the sidewalk and he lays on the horn. Anna\u2019s eyes dart toward it and the heel of her shoe catches in the grass, causing her to trip.</p><p>I sigh and redirect my direction to the truck. \u201cSorry about that. He just gets kind of antsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d She frees her shoe from the grass and steps back up onto the sidewalk.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI decided to go with Micha and Ethan back home.\u201d</p><p>She does the buttons of her navy blue jacket up. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad you decided to go.\u201d</p><p>I shield the wind from my face with my hand. \u201cWhy? I thought you said you weren\u2019t sure if I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said only you would know if you should.\u201d She pauses and wisps of her short hair flap in the breeze. \u201cElla, can you do something for me on this vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying so much and have fun. It\u2019s what you need,\u201d she says with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI do have fun... sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, try to have fun the entire time.\u201d</p><p>I pluck bits of my hair out of my mouth as I take in her words. \u201cYou remember what you said about being in a relationship with Micha and that only I would know when I was ready. Well, I think I\u2019m ready. I know it\u2019s really soon and everything, but last night, well, I saw a glimpse of a future with him that I really, really wanted. And that\u2019s never happened to me before.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look upset, like I\u2019d expected she would. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad you were able to see that. But remember to take things as slow as you need to. I want you to focus on yourself.\u201d She waves and walks across the grass toward the parking lot. \u201cHave fun, Ella, and I mean it. You deserve to.\u201d</p><p>Fun? Is that the magic cure to repair my mind? I tuck my chin in and fight against the wind, heading toward the car\u2014heading home.</p><p>Road trips with Ethan and Micha are a pain in the butt. I forgot about the guys\u2019 \u201cno bathroom stop\u201d rule: they\u2019ll only stop, like, every four hours for a break. If there isn\u2019t a restroom close by, then they consider a bush a good substitution.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t bother me that much, but poor Lila isn\u2019t used to their crap. We\u2019re sitting in the back of the truck on opposite sides and she\u2019s bouncing up and down, jiggling her legs to hold it in.</p><p>\u201cJust pull over.\u201d I slap the side of Ethan\u2019s arm for being an asshole and refusing to pull over. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to pee off the side of an off-ramp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll back the truck up, so it blocks her,\u201d he replies, stunning Lila. \u201cNo one will see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think...\u201d Lila presses a look at me for help.</p><p>I unbuckle my seatbelt and lean over the seat to pinch Ethan\u2019s arm. \u201cPull the damn truck over now,\u201d I threaten. \u201cIf not for me, for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw, you\u2019re always so evil,\u201d Ethan complains and then taps the brakes hard, sending me flying over the seat. \u201cBut I\u2019m much eviler.\u201d</p><p>I summersault over and my legs hit the dash as the shifter stabs me in the back. Sitting up straight, I smooth my hair into place and extend my hand toward him to do something equally as sinister, but Micha snags my elbow and pulls me onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cEasy, you two,\u201d he says, hugging me close and conforming his lap against my backside. \u201cWe have a long drive ahead of us still.\u201d</p><p>Shooting me a dirty look, Ethan swerves the truck off the nearest off-ramp that leads directly to a truck stop. Semis line the chain-linked fence that borders the building and there\u2019s a flashing marque promising everyone ten cents off each gallon when paying with cash.</p><p>He pulls up to an empty gas pump and silences the engine as he zips his plaid hooded jacket up. \u201cBut just so you know, this is for Lila, not you.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him as Lila hops out of the truck and dashes toward the entrance of the building. She\u2019s wearing a white dress and pearls around her neck, looking completely out of place at the truck stop. When I asked her why she was overdressing for a road trip, she shrugged and said she was used to having to dress up for days related to holidays.</p><p>Micha gets out of the car and offers his hand to help me out. The cool air hits my bare legs as I stretch my arms above my head.</p><p>Micha eyes me with amusement as he ruffles his blond hair into place so wisps are dangling across his forehead. \u201cYou know you give Lila crap for overdressing, but you kind of undressed.\u201d He gestures at my jean shorts and purple T-shirt. \u201cWhat were you thinking when you put that on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it was hot when we left,\u201d I argue, adjusting the bottom of my shirt back over my stomach. \u201cAnd I wanted to be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>He unzips his black hoodie, and his T-shirt rides up a little, showing a glimpse of his abs. \u201cPut this on before you freeze to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d I assure him, enclosing my arms around myself.</p><p>He urges the jacket at me with persistency. \u201cTake it, because I\u2019m not putting it back on.\u201d</p><p>I take the jacket and give him a quick kiss on the cheek before sticking my arms through the sleeves and zipping it up. It smells like his cologne mixed with a scent that belongs only to him and I inhale deeply, relishing it.</p><p>\u201cDid you just smell my jacket?\u201d he inquiries with a cock of his eyebrow. \u201cIs that like some kind of weird ritual or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt smells like you,\u201d I explain and pull the front of the jacket over my nose to shield it from the cold. \u201cAnd I like the smell of you.\u201d</p><p>He seems pleased with my odd response and tugs the hood over my head. \u201cSmell away.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I turn for the gas station as a red Mustang, the same years as Blake\u2019s, inches up to the pump two rows down. I shrug it off as coincidental, until Blake gets out of the car. He\u2019s has on a gray beanie and a hoodie over a blue shirt. His jeans don\u2019t have paint smudges on them and he has gloves on his hands. Micha and Ethan are distracted by a blonde who has her butt sticking out as she attempts to fill up the oil in her car. Ethan is saying something vulgar about her ass while Micha encourages him to go help her \u201cfill up her tank.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rolling my eyes, I mosey over to Blake as he slides his credit card into the slot.</p><p>\u201cSo this is a freakishly weird coincidence,\u201d I say, startling him and he drops his card onto the ground.</p><p>\u201cShit, you scared me.\u201d He squats down to retrieve the card and then stands up straight. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>My gaze flicks to Micha laughing at Ethan attempting to hit on the blonde, who rolls her eyes and slams the hood down, uninterested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m headed home for the holidays.\u201d I redirect my attention to Blake. \u201cWhat about you? What are you doing all the way out here? Don\u2019t you know California\u2019s the other way?\u07e5</p><p>The corners of his mouth quirk at my lame joke. \u201cMy mom lives in Cali, but my dad lives over in Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re about to break to the east,\u201d I say. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>After punching some buttons on the credit card machine, he removes the nozzle, puts it into car, and the gas gurgles.</p> <p>He leans back against the car and folds his arms. \u201cSo you\u2019re on the road with your boyfriend,\u201d he says with an underlined meaning.</p><p>I flinch with guilt. \u201cYeah, about that night at the restaurant, I\u2019ve been meaning to track you down and say sorry.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lift with skepticism. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, because it seems like you\u2019ve been avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cWas it that easy to tell?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cElla, you practically ran away from me when I shouted out to you after class, but I just wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>I blow out an uneven breath as I fiddle with the zipper on my hoodie. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just didn\u2019t know what to say. He was drunk that night and upset about some stuff.\u201d</p> <p>He glances over his shoulder at Micha removing the receipt from the pump and Ethan who\u2019s digging out some soda from the cooler in the back of the truck. \u201cHe seems intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the thing. He\u2019s not,\u201d I say, defending him with irritation surfacing in my voice. \u201cHe\u2019s normally not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you say so,\u201d he says tolerantly.</p><p>I rest my butt on the top of the hood, letting my legs dangle over the side as I change the subject. \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t bring your girlfriend with you?\u201d</p><p>The gas pump clicks and he turns to take it out. \u201cWe broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d I ask, surprised. \u201cYou looked so happy.\u201d</p><p>He rips his receipt from the machine and shoves it into his back pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The last time I was there, things just were off.\u201d He rubs his hand over his face. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dating since we were fifteen and I think it only went on for that long because we were both too afraid to be without something we\u2019ve had forever... We were together because we were attached to the idea of us.\u201d</p><p>My mind wanders to Micha and myself. We\u2019ve known each other forever. Is this how it will turn out? Anxiety grasps at my chest. I don\u2019t want to lose Micha. Ever.</p> <p>\u201cWell, if you need anything, you can call me whenever.\u201d I hop off the hood and my sandals splash in a rainbow-tinted puddle. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be doing anything except for probably getting into trouble.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles as he rounds the back of the car. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem like much of a troublemaker.\u201d</p><p>A laugh sputters from my lips and I shuffle over to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cThat shows how very little you know me.\u201d</p><p>He opens the car door. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I hardly know you, except for that you love to draw, don\u2019t have a car, and think Professor Marlina\u2019s watercolor\u2019s look like paint-by-numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d I tell him in a serious tone. \u201cI swear to God she copied them from one of those books.\u201d</p><p>He grins, glances over in Micha\u2019s direction, and then his gaze lands back on me. \u201cSo I have a question.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He wavers, considering something with his hand resting on top of the door. \u201cSo say I\u2019m hanging out at my father\u2019s house and I get really bored. Can I call you? Just to talk.\u201d</p><p>I shift uncomfortably, putting my hands up into my sleeves. \u201cYeah, if you want.\u201d</p><p>He winks at me and my uneasiness shoots up a notch. How the hell did things shift so fast? \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to that.\u201d</p><p>I give him a tense smile as I step back so he can shut the door. Waving, he backs out and drives out of the gas station parking lot. As I turn for Ethan\u2019s truck, my body smacks into someone.</p><p>\u201cAre you having fun?\u201d Micha asks in a condescending tone, with eyes as cold as snow.</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking.\u201d I move backward and then to the side to walk around him, but he sidesteps me and barricades my route.</p><p>\u201cElla May, I\u2019m sorry to break it to you, but the guy was totally hitting on you.\u201d He lowers his voice to a protective growl as he leans in and his eyes darken. \u201cAnd if I see him do it again, he\u2019s going to get punched in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo violence,\u201d I plead with a heavy-hearted sigh. \u201cWhy do guys always have to hit each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to knocking someone down to the ground and pulling their hair until they cry?\u201d He edges out of the way of a car pulling in and tugs on my sleeve to drag me along with him.</p><p>\u201cI did that once when I was twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr biting them on the arm?\u201d</p><p>I huff a frustrated breath and wrench my arm away from him. \u201cAlright, do whatever you want. I\u2019m removing myself from the situation.\u201d</p><p>As I march by him, his fingers grip my hip and he yanks me against him. Folding his arms around my shoulders, he walks behind me to the truck, freeing me only to open the door.</p><p>\u201cI only want to hit him because I love you,\u201d he says with a frown developing at lips. \u201cIt pisses me off how he looks at you, like that night at the restaurant. You may not see it, but even through my drunk eyes it was completely obvious.\u201d</p><p>I take in the jealously written all over his face. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous of Blake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m fucking jealous.\u201d He gapes at me like I\u2019m a moron. \u201cHe gets to be around you all day because you go to the same school. Plus, who knows how many times you hung out with him while I was on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice outside of class.\u201d I hurl myself into the backseat and accidentally bump the top of my head on the ceiling. \u201cAnd once was because Lila needed to get off campus for a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking a code even talking to him,\u201d he tells me with sternness.</p><p>My jaw drops. \u201cA code? Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>He props his foot on the sidestep of the lifted truck and puts his hand on the back of the seat. \u201cScoot over.\u201d</p><p>I move over into the middle of the seat and he scoots into the backseat beside me. Folding my arms, I aim an irritated look of him. \u201cSo about these codes, you might need to let me know what they are. I mean, am I breaking some kind of code by being by myself in the backseat?\u201d</p><p>He blinks, unentertained. \u201cArgue all you want, but you didn\u2019t see the way he was looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha, I\u2019m not some prize everyone wants.\u201d I inch toward the door to put more distance between us. I\u2019m pissed off at his accusations and the fact that he doesn\u2019t seem to trust me. \u201cI\u2019m a brat who has mental issues and who can\u2019t make up her mind about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the fact that you can admit that out loud,\u201d he says as he slides closer me with his arm draped over the back of the seat, \u201cmakes you something special. Do you know how many people won\u2019t admit their flaws and the things they need to work on\u2014how many people can\u2019t even see themselves?\u201d He sneaks his hand between my thighs, his eyes forceful as he lures me back over to him and my heart leaps inside my chest. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking special and if I want to act all possessive over you when some stupid art guy hits on you right in front of me, I\u2019m going to. Either that or I\u2019m going to have Ethan chase him down right now so I can punch him in the face.\u201d</p><p>I clamp my jaw shut to stop my smile from appearing. \u201cYou\u2019re funny when you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>He kisses my temple. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you find my pain so entertaining.\u201d</p><p>I peer up at him through me eyelashes. \u201cI just have to say that I\u2019ve seen you flirting with girls many times, making out with girls, taking them to your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>He winces at the last part. \u201cBut what did I always say when you asked me about it?\u201d</p><p>A smile breaks through. \u201cThat you were just buying time until I came around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He rubs his lips together and all I want to do is lick them, take his lip ring into my mouth, and stroke his with my tongue. I want to do a lot of dirty things to him right now.</p><p>\u201cYour mind\u2019s going into the gutter, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he mocks arrogantly. \u201cI can see lust written all over your face.\u201d</p><p>I direct my concentration to the window, laughing under my breath. \u201cYou know, for someone who\u2019s so sure of himself, you worry an awful lot about losing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019d be lost without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotal player\u2019s line, Micha Scott.\u201d</p><p>Fixing a finger under my chin, he angles my head back toward him, so our lips are inches apart. \u201cRemember the pact. You and I are in it for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat pact?\u201d Lila asks as she jumps up into the passenger seat, breathless from the climb into the tall truck. She has a large bag of Skittles and a bottle of water in her hand.</p><p>\u201cA secret pact.\u201d He beams a grin at me.</p><p>I\u2019d almost forgotten about the pact made by two children trying to seek something that they could never really have\u2014normalcy.</p><p>Ethan gets into the truck and spins the tires as he drives away from the gas station, racing toward the freeway, cranking up \u201cSilhouettes\u201d by Smile Empty Soul.</p><p>\u201cI think we need a drink,\u201d Micha declares, reaching for the back sliding window, so he can get into the cooler. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I seize his hand and hold it against my chest over my heart. \u201cNot while we\u2019re driving.\u201d</p><p>Daggers shoot from his eyes as he scowls at my hand over his. \u201cWhy not? I\u2019m not the driver.\u201d</p><p>My lips part, about to confront him about his drinking, but I hear Anna\u2019s warning echo in my head and I chicken out. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we should start drinking yet when we know we\u2019re going to be doing that for most of the weekend.\u201d</p> <p>He withdraws his hand and rotates in the seat. \u201cExcellent point. Although, it would help pass the time.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at the window as the land progressively changes from green to white, lost in my thoughts. Will I ever be stable enough to help people instead of cause them problems?</p><p>Micha</p><p>It\u2019s late when we arrive at Star Grove. The sky is black and the stars are covered by clouds. A thick layer of snow blankets the streets, the houses, and the yards, and red and green Christmas lights flash around the trimming of my house.</p><p>Lila is asleep in the front seat with her head relaxed against the window. Ella fell asleep in my lap and with her face so close to my cock that my mind has been filled with dirty scenarios almost the entire drive. But I boxed up my sexual tension, not wanting to relive another episode where Ethan overhears us doing naughty things.</p> <p>When Ethan parks the truck in my driveway, Lila wakes up and stretches her arms above her head like a cat. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d She blinks her eyes at my two-story house and then at Ella\u2019s house next door. There are no tire tracks in the snow in the driveway of her house, which means no one is home.</p><p>My mom\u2019s car is parked out in front of the open garage where the back end of the Chevelle sticks out. Ethan jumps out, leaving his door wide open, and tramples through the snow to the back of the truck. Lila follows, letting the cold air in, and meets Ethan at the tailgate. They begin to get the frozen suitcases out of the back.</p><p>Ella is nuzzled in my lap, fast asleep, and I just can\u2019t help myself. Nibbling on my lip ring to stifle my laughter, I gently pinch Ella on the rib, right below her boob. She jumps up from her deep sleep, green eyes wild and glowing in the dim cab light.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d She smacks my arm, blinking the wreariness out of her eyes. \u201cThat was the meanest way to wake me up ever.\u201d</p><p>I rub my arm where she hit me. \u201cIt was actually one of the funniest things I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA jerk move.\u201d She leans forward toward my neck, but at the last second heads south and bites at my chest through my shirt</p> <p>I wince, but smile. \u201cYou know that turns me on more than anything.\u201d</p><p>She brings her bottom lip in between her teeth. \u201cYou\u2019ve been turned on for most of the drive. I could feel it pressed against my cheek.\u201d</p><p>Ready to end the battle, I finish with a winning line. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re mouth was only inches away from my cock.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heat up as her lip pops free, all red and swollen and so tempting. I get out of the car into the freezing cold and offer my hand to her. She takes it, about to jump out in the snow in her flip-flops.</p><p>\u201cWait a second.\u201d I retract my hand and turn my back to her. \u201cHop on or else you\u2019re going to freeze your toes off.\u201d</p><p>She mounts my back willingly and I carry her to the porch. Icicles dangle from the trimming and the ice on the steps has been sprinkled with salt. My breath laces out in front of me as I reach above the porch light and retrieve the house key hidden below a clay pigeon. I lower Ella to the ground, hand her the key, and dismount off the steps into the driveway, my boots crunching in the snow.</p><p>\u201cUnlock it and go inside,\u201d I instruct, backing toward the car. \u201cI\u2019ll get our stuff.\u201d</p><p>She watches me, her skin like porcelain beneath the porch light. \u201cWho said I was staying here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho said you weren\u2019t?\u201d I smirk. \u201cNow quit being a pain in the ass and get your butt inside where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>Before she turns away, a trace of a smile reveals itself on her lips. She unlocks the door and goes inside while I get our bags. Ethan decides he\u2019s going to crash on the couch, which he\u2019s done a lot since we were kids. Lila takes the bed in the spare room. That leaves Ella in my bed, something I\u2019m thrilled about, although she probably won\u2019t share the feeling.</p><p>After I show Lila where the room is and toss Ethan a blanket, I carry the bags to the bedroom. The light is on and Ella is lying in my bed on her stomach, flipping through the pages of...</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck did you get that?\u201d I lunge for the notebook, but she rolls to the side, laughing and hugging it to her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh my God... is this like your little black book?\u201d She flinches as I leap on top of her and steal the notebook away from her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a little black book,\u201d I practically growl. \u201cIt\u2019s just a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJournal that keeps track of all the girls you\u2019ve slept with.\u201d She slaps her hand over her mouth as she laughs so hard her face turns red. When she recomposes herself, she kneels up in front of me. \u201cYou know, I thought I knew everything about you, but I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>I toss the notebook into the trashcan. \u201cWhere did you find that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, lies back on her stomach, and slides her hands underneath the pillow. \u201cIt was under here.\u201d</p><p>I kick the bags under my computer desk and turn on a lamp before shutting the ceiling light off. Then I shuck off my shirt and lie down in bed with her.</p><p>She\u2019s shivering because the room is ice cold, but that\u2019s how my mom likes to keep it to reduce the power bill. \u201cThere were a lot of names in there... more than I thought.\u201d</p><p>I release a slow breath and rub my hand across my face. \u201cElla, I don\u2019t know what you want me to say... I never wanted anyone to find that. It was just for my own personal thing, so I could...\u201d I tense. \u201cKeep track.\u201d</p><p>She watches me expressionlessly and the level of awkwardness is maddening. \u201cMy name wasn\u2019t in there.\u201d</p><p>I rotate on my side and look into her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s because I knew I wasn\u2019t going to have to keep track anymore. There\u2019s been no one since you and there never will be again.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing accelerates and she starts to get up. Thinking she\u2019s going to leave, I reach to stop her, but all she does is discard her shoes onto the floor and shimmy out of her shorts. I instantly get excited at the sight of her ass sticking out of her panties.</p><p>She leaves my jacket on and climbs beneath the covers. \u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d she states with unreadable eyes.</p><p>I unbutton my jeans, slip out of them, and get under the covers with her, wincing when my feet brush hers. \u201cYour feet are fucking cold.\u201d I place a hand on her hip. \u201cGod, you\u2019re cold everywhere.\u201d</p><p>She wiggles her feet between my ankles and snuggles closer. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to keep me warm.\u201d</p><p>I set my chin on top of her head. \u201cYou confuse me sometimes, pretty girl. You really do. One minute you\u2019re mad at me and the next minute you seem to want me.\u201d</p><p>She buries her face into my chest and her hot breath warms my chilled skin. \u201cI confuse myself sometimes.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI think there\u2019s something really wrong with my head, because reading that list just makes me want to have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in my body freezes. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me right.\u201d Her finger tickles circles around my nipple. \u201cLike I said, I think there\u2019s something very wrong with my head... It just made me want to take claim of you or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d I hold my breath, waiting for her reaction.</p><p>She slants back and looks me in the eyes. \u201cNot tonight. I\u2019m tired, but you do have a birthday coming up in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just to get things clear now, I want you wrapped up in a bow and nothing else. Well, maybe high heels. Those fucking gorgeous legs of yours look ridiculously sexy in heels.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she rests her cheek back on my chest and tangles her leg with mine, opening herself up to the top of my thigh and I can feel the warmth flowing off her. \u201cMaybe that can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>I embrace her and inch my legs closer, rubbing gently against her. \u201cYou seem to be in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>Her breath catches from my touch and she rocks her hips slightly. \u201cI\u2019m just trying not to worry. Doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>My hands slip around to her backside and I rest my palm on her thigh. \u201cSo does that mean that the old Ella May just might return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Her eyes close as my finger traces a line back and forth along her soft skin. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can exist anymore, but I\u2019m pretty sure I can give you the real, current me... if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want.\u201d I grip her ass, shut my eyes, and breathe her in. \u201cI want it all.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Ella</p><p>I wake up to the smell of bacon and eggs. It\u2019s been a while since I had a good breakfast and my mouth instantly salivates. Stumbling out of bed, I pull a pair of jeans on, noticing that Micha took the garbage out, probably to get rid of the notebook.</p><p>\u201cIt should bother me,\u201d I say to myself, slipping a long-sleeved thermal shirt over my head. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t. God, is my head really that messed up?\u201d</p><p>I wander out into the kitchen. Micha\u2019s mom is cooking over the stove as pans sizzle. Her blonde hair is in a bun and she\u2019s wearing a pink sweatpants suit. A guy, at least ten years younger than her, is at the table reading the sports section of the newspaper and drinking juice. His brown hair is thick except for a small bald spot on the top and he has dark circles under his hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sweetie,\u201d Miss Scott greets me with a cheery smile. \u201cWould you like some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>I glance at the stranger at the table, who makes me nervous as he evaluates me. \u201cUmm... where is Micha and everyone else?\u201d</p><p>She stabs the bacon with a fork and turns it over. \u201cThey went outside. Micha\u2019s really excited that his dad paid to get his car fixed, I think... It was really nice of him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to say it aloud and Miss Scott looks at me perplexedly.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d she asks, scrapping the eggs around in the pan with a spatula.</p><p>I snatch one of Micha\u2019s jackets off the hanger near the back door and step outside, not answering her. There is no way in hell he could be excited about that.</p> <p>Outside, the air is below freezing and sends me into a shivering frenzy. My boots crunch against the snow as I hike to the garage where the Chevelle is parked. The once smashed in side is now as smooth as silk, repainted a smokin\u2019 black, with a cherry red racing strip down the hood. It\u2019s in racing condition but only because of Micha\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe he fucking did this?\u201d Micha\u2019s sharp voice surprises me and I whirl around, nearly falling on my ass as my shoes slip on a patch of ice.</p><p>Micha\u2019s hand snaps out to catch me, but he slants sideways, losing balance. I grab the hem of his jacket and get my footing for the both of us.</p><p>Clutching onto my shoulder with one hand, Micha grasps the beer in his hand like it\u2019s the most important thing in the world. \u201cMy father thinks he can pay me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask, letting go of his arm and turning back to the car.</p> <p>He strolls around me and jumps up from the ground, knocking some icicles off the trimming of the garage roof. \u201cHe sent my mom some money after I helped him out with his little thing to fix up my car as a thank-you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m unsure how to approach the situation. \u201cWell, I guess it was kind of nice of him. I mean, at least he did something good.\u201d</p><p>His aqua eyes are as cold as the ice beneath our feet. \u201cI\u2019d rather him have call me, at least then he\u2019d be acknowledging my existence. But instead he sends my mom a fucking card.\u201d Wrestling a piece of paper out of his pocket, he throws it in my direction, but it makes it only half way between us and falls to the snow.</p><p>I swipe it up, dust the snow off it, and open the card. Please use this money to fix Micha\u2019s car up like we talked about on the phone and tell him thank you for helping me. It was a very nice thing he did, and my family and I are grateful for it.</p><p>\u201cHis family and he are grateful.\u201d He kicks the tire with the tip of his boot and chucks the beer bottle at the wall, and it shatters all over the cement. \u201cHe\u2019s a fucking asshole. Like I\u2019m not his family.\u201d</p><p>I set the card down on the hood and open my arms to give him a hug, but he backs away. \u201cI just need a moment, okay? Can you go inside or something?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s more wasted than I thought. Up close, the red lines in his glossy eyes are visible and his cheeks are flushed. His hair is sticking up, like he\u2019s dragged his hands through it multiple times. There\u2019s anger in his eyes that only an excessive amount of alcohol can bring out.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be inside if you need me.\u201d I trek for the door, but pause at the steps, noticing that Ethan\u2019s truck is gone. I turn back to Micha to ask where he went, but he\u2019s shutting the garage door as he pulls out another beer from the pack on the shelf, locking away the world as he buries his pain in alcohol.</p><p>I think about confronting him\u2014about his drinking problem and pushing me away\u2014but when I make it to the bedroom, exhaustion overtakes my body and I fall onto the mattress, wondering why I came here in the first place.</p><p>Depression and anxiety are the devil. Anything can trigger them and flip my mood in a heartbeat. Luckily, Anna taught me to notice when I\u2019m sinking into the hole of despair that can turn into a bottomless pit. She taught me how to realize when it\u2019s taking over and how to fight the darkness. If I work at it, I can get ahold of the light again. But it\u2019s all about pushing through my dark thoughts and not giving up.</p><p>About thirty minutes later, I push my way back into the light and storm out of the house, marching straight for the garage. Ethan\u2019s truck is in the driveway and there are footprints leading to the garage.</p><p>I shove open the door and step inside. Ethan and Micha are sitting on the hood, with their boots propped up on the front bumper and beers in their hands. Lila is talking on her phone in the corner with her finger pressed to her ear as she attempts to block out their chatter.</p><p>Micha\u2019s eyes connect with mine and the rawness in his face almost shies me away. \u201cHey, where\u2019d you go?\u201d He stumbles off the hood and, with his long legs, strides toward me.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a gray thermal shirt with a tiny hole in the hem and his black jeans are secured around his hips with a studded belt. His hair\u2019s a mess, his eyes lost, and the smile on his face means trouble is about to start.</p> <p>His hand seeks my waist, but I edge back. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Ethan glances at me with his black hair in his eyes and his face carries a warning. \u201cElla, just let it be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSo stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019ve got that tone like you\u2019re about to bring up something personal and he can\u2019t deal with personal right now.\u201d He shoves the sleeves of his green shirt up and lies back on the hood with his hands behind his head.</p><p>Micha blinks confusedly at me. \u201cWait, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s made me nervous so I back down and head for the cooler. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I can\u2019t even remember what I was going to say.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my elbow and reels me into his chest. \u201cLet\u2019s go do something really, really fun.\u201d</p><p>I try to squirm away. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>His forehead furrows as he scratches the back of his neck. \u201cWhy are you acting funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I bend my arm out of his grip. \u201cI just don\u2019t like that you\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019ve been drunk plenty of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and that\u2019s the problem.\u201d I bite down on my tongue. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>His eyes burn with rage. \u201cYou get drunk just as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely true,\u201d he snaps and the loudness of his voice causes me to jump. \u201cYou drink as much as I do, whether it\u2019s for fun or because you\u2019re trying to bury something. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve all been doing since we were fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t bring me into this,\u201d Ethan argues, climbing off the hood. \u201cI cleaned up my shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Micha trips over the laces of his boots and slams into one of the shelves, knocking tools and car parts to the ground. Lila\u2019s eyes bulge as she hangs up her phone. \u201cYou still drink when you feel like shutting down\u2014all of us do.\u201d</p><p>A silent moment builds around us as our breath fogs out and we take in the realization that he\u2019s right. We all started drinking around the age of fourteen. It began as curiosity, but the older we got, the more we used it as an escape from the reality of our lives.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m done,\u201d I finally say, surrendering up my hands as I back toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with you too!\u201d he yells, red faced. \u201cI\u2019m sick of your fucking mind games and problems. I\u2019m sick of it and I want out.\u201d</p><p>My hands fall lifelessly to my side. \u201cI meant I was done with drinking, but it\u2019s nice to know where you stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla, he didn\u2019t mean that. He\u2019s just drunk, so stop acting crazy and get over it,\u201d Ethan interrupts, shaking his head at Micha. \u201cYou better get your shit together right now, man.\u201d</p><p>Micha glares at Ethan. \u201cStay out of this.\u201d He turns back to me, but I\u2019m already out the door.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t follow me as I run down the street. The wind blows in my hair and stings at my cheeks as I try to flee from the hurt and pain, but anxiety nips at my heels.</p><p>Micha has never gotten that mad at me. Ever. It\u2019s like a knife to the heart and I don\u2019t know how to pull it out. It hurts everywhere.</p><p>When I reach the corner, I slow down and try to regain control of my thoughts. I take my phone out of my pocket and dial Anna\u2019s number.</p><p>She answers after four rings and a piano plays in the background. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Anna, this is Ella.\u201d I feel bad for calling her when it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s with her family.</p><p>After a few seconds I hear a door close and the noise quiets. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I stare up at the graffiti on the street sign. \u201cI did something you told me not to do... I confronted Micha about his drinking problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said some... stuff.\u201d</p><p>She pauses. \u201cWhat kind of stuff? Hurtful stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of stuff. And yes, it hurts.\u201d I press my hand to my aching heart as I hunch over. \u201cReally bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does the pain make you want to do?\u201d she asks as a car drives by and splashes slush up from the street. \u201cElla, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing on the corner of the street and all I want to do is run,\u201d I admit. \u201cI want to cry... I want to scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo scream,\u201d she encourages. \u201cGo ahead. Let it all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m on the street.\u201d I glance up the road at an older couple walking down the sidewalk. \u201cAnd there are people around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about them. Just let it all out\u2014let the worry and pain go. Don\u2019t hold it in, Ella. We\u2019ve talk about that.\u201d</p><p>Feeling like an idiot, I open my mouth and let out a quiet scream.</p><p>\u201cYou can do better than that,\u201d she insists. \u201cReally scream, Ella.\u201d</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, I give it all I got, letting it all out, and it echoes for miles.</p><p>After I clear the congestion out of my chest, I walk down the road toward Cherry Hill where the cemetery is located, thinking about the people I\u2019ve lost. My mom and Grady, both were taken out of my life way too early.</p><p>A crisp layer of snow coats the tombstones and trees, the grass is buried, and icicles hang from the fence. Walking up to the leafless tree in front of my mother\u2019s grave, my shoes fill with snow and my nose turns pink. I bend down and brush a bunch of snow from the top of her grave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I read out loud the words that are far too simple to sum her up. \u201cMaralynn Daniels, loving mother and wife.\u201d There was no mention of her struggle or how she got dealt a shitty hand at life.</p><p>My thoughts drift back to a conversation she and I had when I was about fifteen. We were watching television, although she was dazing off a lot and not paying attention.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m this way?\u201d she asked abruptly with a contemplative look on her face.</p> <p>I turned the volume of the television down. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mom?\u201d</p><p>She stared at the wall as if it had held the answers to life. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I escape the dark thoughts, like everyone else? Why can\u2019t I think the same as everyone?\u201d</p><p>I racked my brain for a good answer to give her. \u201cI don\u2019t think everyone thinks the same, Mom. Everyone\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but why do some people get it easy?\u201d She looked at me and her green eyes were huge, like she was hypnotized. \u201cThey just walk through life without problems.\u201d</p><p>I let out a slow breath, knowing my words were going to be important to her. \u201cEveryone has their problems, Mom. It\u2019s just that some people\u2019s are harder.\u201d I inched toward her and the fear in her eyes began to subside. \u201cI think the people who go through more can end up stronger in the long run. They have insight in to what a lot of people don\u2019t have and a better understanding\u2014they can be more open-minded.\u201d</p> <p>The corners of her mouth tipped upward and she gave me a rare smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart girl, Ella May, and I believe that one day you\u2019ll grow up to do great things... I really hope you do.\u201d</p><p>The knots in my stomach began to unwind. I\u2019d said the right thing and she was relaxed and happy, which had been my goal. I thought I\u2019d made an impact on her, but it turned out I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom,\u201d I whisper to her grave. \u201cI really am... Sometimes I feel like I owe you my happiness.\u201d</p><p>The wind rustles around me, whispering through my hair. I sit down in front of the tombstone and sit with her grave in silence, promising myself I\u2019ll come back and visit often, vowing she won\u2019t be forgotten.</p><p>I don\u2019t see Micha for the rest of the night. I sleep in the same room with Lila and then sneak out of the house before Micha wakes up from his drunken stupor. I\u2019m not really mad at him anymore for drinking. What he said was true. We all do it to hide our pain and we all need to stop. But his harsh words still haunt me.</p><p>Lila and I go out to my garage and I start up my dad\u2019s Firebird so we can go get some lunch. My dad keeps a spare key under the visor, but the car\u2019s been sitting for so long that it takes forever to start. Finally I get the engine to roar to life and then let it run for a while as I tromp through the snow looking for a way to get into the house.</p> <p>Lila follows me, zipping up her coat, and then she slips on her gloves. \u201cIt is so cold here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I peer up at the frosted window of the kitchen, noticing that it\u2019s not completely shut. \u201cWell, I think I found our way in, although it\u2019s going to be equally as cold in there since the damn window\u2019s probably been open for months.\u201d</p><p>I step back from the window and my phone beeps from inside my pocket, alerting me that I have a text message.</p><p>Blake: Whatcha doin?</p><p>I hesitate then text back.</p><p>Me: Trying to break into my house.</p><p>Blake: Sounds fun.</p><p>Me: Not really.</p> <p>Blake: I\u2019m just kidding. So what else are you doing? Anything fun? I was thinking of bailing out on my dad a few days early and going back to the campus. When are you going back? Maybe we cold meet up and get some coffee or something.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Lila peers over my shoulder at the screen and her nose scrunches. \u201cOh my God, is he seriously texting you?\u201d</p><p>I sigh, locking the screen so it shuts off. \u201cI told him he could.\u201d</p><p>Lila tsks me with a wave of her finger. \u201cEl, I\u2019m warning you now to back off this supposed friendship with that guy. You\u2019re only going to end up in a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is just a friendship.\u201d I move away from the window and toward the car. \u201cAnd besides, you encouraged it once so you could get a ride from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I regret it.\u201d She follows after me, slipping on the ice a few times. \u201cI saw him talking to you at the gas station and there was nothing but lust in his eyes... and now he doesn\u2019t even have a girlfriend so there\u2019s nothing stopping him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m regretting telling you that,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. Even if he did like me I would never do anything with him.\u201d</p><p>She grabs my arm and forces me to look at her. \u201cWalk away from this right now. Blake is hot and you two have that whole art thing going on. You may not think anything could happen, but sometimes stuff just does. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you speaking from experience?\u201d I ask as my phone beeps with another text message.</p><p>Blake: I didn\u2019t scare u off, did I... look, I know you have a boyfriend, so I\u2019m not proposing a date. Just going to get coffee as two fellow artists who love coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of experiences with this crap,\u201d Lila continues, letting go of my arm. \u201cI\u2019ve had many guys accidently get caught up in the moment and slip up. And I know plenty of girls who have done it too. And you\u2019re so lucky, Ella. You really are. Please, for the sake of all women, just get away from Blake and focus on the beautiful relationship you have in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what happened yesterday, you still think it\u2019s beautiful?\u201d I ask doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cYou two fighting makes it more beautiful.\u201d She sighs and her breath fogs out. \u201cI also know that right now you\u2019re mad and the last thing you want to be doing is texting some guy who has a crush on you. You might do something stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad at Micha. Just upset with... stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I text Blake back.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m going to be here until the end of winter break. Maybe I\u2019ll c u when I get back.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond and Lila and I get into the car with the heater blasting at our faces. I don\u2019t really care whether Blake texts me back or not. He was a nice friend, but that was it. My thoughts revolve around a much bigger issue: when I face Micha and tell him it\u2019s over.</p><p>Micha</p><p>Something wet hits me in the face and I jump up with my fist raised in front of me.</p><p>\u201cSettle the fuck down.\u201d Ethan stands over me with a cup in his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s just water.\u201d</p><p>I wipe my face with the sleeve of my shirt. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He sets the cup down on top of my dresser. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve been asleep for about fourteen hours and so I thought I\u2019d make sure you were still alive.\u201d</p><p>Clutching my throbbing head, I check the time on the clock mounted on my wall beside the window. It\u2019s early morning and snow flutters outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I swing my legs over the side of the bed, preparing to get up, but a bitter taste in my throat forces me to lie back down.</p><p>\u201cWell, you drank practically all the alcohol in the house,\u201d Ethan says, crossing his arms. \u201cAnd then you ruined your relationship with almost everyone you know, besides me, but that\u2019s because I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p><p>I rake my hand through my hair and roll to my side. \u201cWhat about Ella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one is probably the worst.\u201d He messes with an alarm clock on my nightstand, rotating the nob on the back.</p><p>I turn back around. \u201cWhy? What\u2019d I say?\u201d</p><p>He makes air quotes and says, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m sick of your fucking mind games and problems.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I drape my arm across my face as I shake my head. \u201cGod damn it. What was I thinking... God fucking damn it!\u201d I punch the headboard and then wince when my knuckles pop.</p><p>He props the clock up beside the lamp. \u201cYou were drunk, which was the reason the fight started. Ella doesn\u2019t want you drinking so much anymore and I have to agree with her. Yes, we all drink, but it seems like you do it more as a coping mechanism than the rest of us. In fact, you\u2019ve kind of been doing it a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>I peer up at him from underneath my arm. \u201cDude, what the hell have you been reading? You sound like a psychiatrist.\u201d</p><p>He backs up toward the doorway with a grin on his face. \u201cHow to clean up your best friend\u2019s drunken mistakes. Now, get your ass out of bed, so you can go patch things up with Ella before she runs away again.\u201d</p><p>I kick the blanket off me and sway to the side as I get to my feet. \u201cShe ran off... She\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down.\u201d Ethan rolls his eyes. \u201cAfter you yelled at her, she ran to the end of the street, but came back. She bunked up with Lila last night. I guess she doesn\u2019t have a key to her own house, which is weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not weird.\u201d I signal at him to get out as I grab a pair of clean jeans from my dresser drawer. \u201cHer dad and brother are assholes.\u201d</p><p>Giving an agreeing nod, he leaves the room and shuts the door. My stomach aches and my head feels like it\u2019s going to explode, but most of the pain lies in my heart.</p><p>I was the only one in Ella\u2019s life who\u2019d never done anything to intentionally hurt her, but now I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not answering her phone,\u201d I mutter, pacing the living room floor. The carpet is old and brown and has holes in it, and the walls are this icky shade of green that resembles puke. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s run off again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, settle down.\u201d Ethan peels open a cheese stick and sinks back into the leather sofa that\u2019s missing an arm. \u201cI texted Lila and she says they\u2019re just out getting some lunch.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing my forehead, I plop down into the recliner and kick an empty soda bottle out of the way so I can put my feet up on the table. \u201cGod, why is our relationship always so up and down?\u201d</p><p>Ethan peels at the string cheese and rolls his eyes. \u201cBecause you both have problems, yet you won\u2019t talk to each other about them because you want to spare one another the pain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I steal a handful of candy from the dish my mom set out on the coffee table. \u201cAgain, what have you been reading? Because you\u2019re seriously on a roll today.\u201d</p><p>He crumbles the wrapper up and tosses it onto the table. \u201cI\u2019ve just been around you both forever and I have eyes. Plus, my mom does that shit all the time with my dad. She lets him get away with anything just because she\u2019s afraid of confrontation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what we do?\u201d I mull it over.</p> <p>His eyes widen in mockery. \u201cUm, yeah. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve been doing since you were kids.\u201d He stands up, dusting some crumbs off his jeans. \u201cMaybe if you two would just be completely honest with one another for once, you\u2019d be okay. I have to go. My mom wants me to pick up a fucking ham for dinner.\u201d Sliding his keys out of his pocket, he departs for the back door. \u201cIt\u2019s the day before Christmas, for God sakes. I don\u2019t know how she thinks I\u2019m going to find one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wise man, Ethan,\u201d I call out, knowing I\u2019m going to annoy him and myself a little, but it needs to be said. \u201cThanks for spelling it out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all weird on me because I said what I think.\u201d He steps outside and then the door slams.</p><p>I flip through the channels, restless, until the back door creaks open. My mom and Thomas walk in.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, what\u2019s up?\u201d He nods his head at me as he takes a seat in the sofa. He has a pair of cargo pants on, brown work boots, and there\u2019s a stain on his white shirt. \u201cAre you watching the game?\u201d</p> <p>I toss the remote down on the coffee table. \u201cDo I look like someone who would be watching the game?\u201d</p><p>He looks at the tattoo on my arm, the piercing in my lip, and my black shirt and jeans. \u201cUmm... I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Forcing back an eye roll, I leave the couch and meet up with my mom in the kitchen. \u201cOkay, so I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s unloading a sack of groceries into the fridge and peeks up of over the fridge door. \u201cDon\u2019t get what?\u201d</p><p>I motion my thumb over my shoulder at the living room where Thomas is channel surfing. \u201cHe seems like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really nice, Micha.\u201d She rummages around in a plastic bag on the counter and takes out a few cans of pumpkin. \u201cAnd he makes me happy.\u201d</p> <p>I eye her white button-down shirt that\u2019s tied at the waist and her jeans with diamond studs on them. \u201cHe\u2019s making you dress weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m dressing younger.\u201d She lifts her chin up with confidence. \u201cI lost a lot of my youth and if I want to have fun now then I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you had me?\u201d I steal a bag of chips from her hand. \u201cOr because of dad?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head as I pop the bag open. \u201cNo, you were the best thing that ever happened to me. I lost my youth because of my choices, but now I\u2019d like to make the choice to get some of it back and enjoy life a little.\u201d</p><p>I cast a glance back at Thomas, who\u2019s laughing at something on the television. \u201cWith him?\u201d</p><p>She closes the cupboard. \u201cWith him.\u201d</p><p>I grab a handful of chips, making a mess on the floor. \u201cFine, if that\u2019s what you want right now then I\u2019ll back down.\u201d I pop my knuckles. \u201cBut if he hurts you, I\u2019m punching him in the face.\u201d</p><p>She ruffles the top of my head tolerantly like I\u2019m still a kid, then takes out two beers from the fridge and heads for the living room. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re wanting to make up with Ella, you should know that I just saw her climb inside the window to her house.\u201d</p> <p>I pick up the chips I dropped on the ground. \u201cHow did you know we were fighting?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cHoney, when you two fight the whole world knows.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what she means, but I slip my jacket on and step outside into the freezing cold. Snow drifts down from the sky and coats the ground as I hike over to the chain-link fence. The metal freezes the palms of my hands as I hop over it and knock on the back door.</p><p>After two knocks, Lila answers. She has on pink boots with fur on top, a coat, a hat, and a scarf. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d I joke, trying to lighten the mood, but all she does is frown. \u201cSorry, not the best time for jokes, huh?\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms, her blue eyes very unwelcoming. \u201cYou know how much I encouraged her to let you in\u2014that you loved her so much and would never hurt her? You\u2019ve basically crushed her and I look like a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make it better,\u201d I insist, stepping toward the threshold, hoping she\u2019ll move over and let me through.</p><p>She stays still, blocking the doorway. \u201cBefore I let you in, you have to promise no more drinking when you\u2019re upset and no more hurting her. I swear to God if you continue to hurt her, I\u2019ll rip out your lip ring.\u201d</p><p>I put a hand over my mouth to protect my lips. \u201cI promise, never again.\u201d</p><p>She moves back to let me in and then shuts the door behind us. \u201cShe\u2019s upstairs in her room.\u201d</p><p>I head for the stairway. \u201cYou know, Lila, you\u2019re pretty hard core. Not many people would dare threaten the lip ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not most people,\u201d she calls out. \u201cElla\u2019s my best friend and she needs protecting. Something you usually do, only this time you were the cause of her needing it.\u201d</p><p>I leave her in the kitchen and climb the stairs. The house is freezing and the sound of music flows through the air: \u201cOne Thing\u201d by Finger Eleven. The door to the bathroom where her mom died is wide open and there\u2019s something colorful all over the tile.</p><p>\u201cElla,\u201d I say, walking toward the door. \u201cAre you up here?\u201d</p><p>She walks out of her room with a handful of markers and her eyes widen when she sees me. \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila, let me in,\u201d I explain, my breath fogging out in front of me. \u201cDidn\u2019t you turn the heat on?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and dismisses me, heading to the bathroom. She has her leather jacket and fingerless gloves on. When she reaches the bathroom, she crouches down and scribbles something on the floor.</p><p>I approach the scene with caution, knowing it has to mean something important. \u201cPretty girl, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She sketches a black line along the tile. \u201cI\u2019m making a shrine... And don\u2019t call me pretty girl, please.\u201d</p><p>I squat down behind her and hold my breath as I set my hands on her shoulders. She doesn\u2019t shrug them off, but tenses under my touch. \u201cYou have no idea how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>She traces a circle around a woman with wings and a cupcake in her hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry. I\u2019m not mad at you.\u201d</p><p>My brow knits with perplexity. \u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She shades in the eyes of the angel and then fills in the flame of the candle in the cupcake. \u201cThat I was right\u2014about everything.\u201d</p><p>I brush her hair to the side as she writes I love you below the angel\u2019s feet. \u201cRight about what?\u201d</p><p>She writes, I love you, Mom, and happy belated birthday. Clicking the cap back on the marker, she stands up and turns to face me. \u201cThat I ruin you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snap wide as she squeezes by me and rushes into her bedroom. That was not what I expected at all.</p><p>I catch up with her right as she\u2019s about to shut the door and brace my hand against, shoving it back open. \u201cYou don\u2019t ruin me, Ella May. How could you ever think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it because it\u2019s true.\u201d She chucks the markers onto her dresser. \u201cMy problems do anyway.\u201d</p><p>I bite at my lip, working to maintain a steady voice. \u201cYou know as well as I do that when people are drunk they say hurtful things they don\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>She swallows hard. \u201cBut sometimes they mean them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I promise. God, I wish I could have, like, a redo or something, because I\u2019d slap myself for even thinking those words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRedo\u2019s don\u2019t exist,\u201d she breathes softly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I should do this anymore\u2014I wasn\u2019t even supposed to be doing this to begin with. I was supposed to stay out of relationships until I got my shit together, but every time I\u2019m around you, it\u2019s impossible. All you do is look at me and I feel like I\u2019m drowning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean,\u201d I say with caution. \u201cIs that a good thing or a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>She puffs out a frustrated breath, collapses onto her bed, and buries her face in her arms. \u201cIt could be a good thing, if I wasn\u2019t so messed up... When I\u2019m with you, every part of me is consumed by you.\u201d</p><p>I climb onto the bed with her and place a hand gently on her back. \u201cYou know that\u2019s the most honest thing you\u2019ve said to me.\u201d</p><p>She peeks up at me through her veil of auburn hair. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I brush her hair out of her eyes. \u201cEthan suggested a weird thing to me today. That maybe you and I need to be more honest with each other, instead of always trying to protect each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you were pretty honest in the garage,\u201d she replies coldly. \u201cMicha, if you want to walk away, then do it now because if things get any deeper, I swear it\u2019s going to kill me next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how important you are to me.\u201d I get off the bed and hold my hand out to her, knowing it\u2019s time to pour our hearts out to each other. \u201cWill you come somewhere with me?\u201d</p><p>She eyes my offered hand suspiciously. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a secret.\u201d I wink at her, acting calm, even though I\u2019m terrified she won\u2019t go with me\u2014that I\u2019ve ruined everything I\u2019ve worked so hard at with her. \u201cBut I promise, it\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>She sets her hand in mine, trusting me, and I can breathe again. I make a silent vow that I will never hurt her again.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Ella</p><p>\u201cOkay, so sometimes I really don\u2019t get you.\u201d My gaze scans the park full of bent and broken bars and empty dreams. It\u2019s the playground we grew up going to, but there were more drug dealings going on than children playing. The merry-go-round is crooked and the teeter-totter is missing a seat. The chains of the swing are rusted and the slide is buried in snow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tugs me toward the swing set with a big grin on his face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t remember.\u201d He dusts off the snow from the seat and sits down. \u201cIt\u2019s like one of the best memories of my childhood.\u201d</p><p>I brush the snow off the swing beside his and drop down in it, wrapping my fingers around the cold metal chains. \u201cYou mean when we made the pact? I remember that.\u201d</p><p>He runs backward and picks up his feet, soaring up toward the sky. \u201cYeah, but do you remember what we were doing before the pact was made?\u201d</p> <p>I twist back and forth as snow falls from the links. \u201cWe were playing truth.\u201d</p><p>Braking with his shoes, he halts the swing and twirls to face me. \u201cSo you do remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember.\u201d I roll my eyes and spin around once with my legs stretched out in front of me. \u201cIt was the day you made me admit that I had never kissed anyone before.\u201d</p><p>His grin broadens. \u201cAnd the day I took your first kiss.\u201d</p><p>I clamp my jaw shut to keep from grinning. \u201cOnly because I was too na\u00efve to see that you were totally playing me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was fourteen,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing you. I was just curious what it would be like to kiss my best friend, because all the other girls I\u2019d made out with just weren\u2019t doing much for me.\u201d</p><p>I nudge his foot with my toe. \u201cYou are such a liar.\u201d</p><p>He crosses his heart with his finger. \u201cI\u2019m totally being truthful here. Ethan kept yammering about all his awesome make-out sessions and I just didn\u2019t get it. Every time I was with a girl, it felt like there should be more.\u201d</p><p>I suppress a laugh. \u201cAnd did the kiss fulfill all of your wildest dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d He grins haughtily. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how soft your lips were for, like, days.\u201d His eyes shadow over. \u201cBut what I really think added fuel to my developing obsession with you was that, like, a year and half later I saw you walking around naked in your room.\u201d</p><p>I prod him in the shin with my foot. \u201cYou did not.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles proudly and motions a finger at the swings we\u2019re sitting in. \u201cOh no, I\u2019m not. These swings are a no-lying area, remember?\u201d</p><p>I let the swing sway back and forth. \u201cWell, while we\u2019re telling the truth, I once had a naughty dream about you.\u201d</p><p>In a faint glow of the lamppost, his eyes sparkle like the snow. \u201cWhat exactly happened in this naughty dream?\u201d</p><p>I pump my legs, taking the swing higher as I lean back freely. \u201cThat\u2019s a secret I\u2019ll never tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I call bullshit.\u201d He kicks off, joining me in the sky. \u201cCome on, pretty girl. You just made my night. Do you know how long I\u2019ve thought that this was a one-sided crush?\u201d</p><p>I laugh to myself as my cheeks heat at the memory of the dream. \u201cMicha, it\u2019s way too embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>He catches the chain of my swing and plants his feet down in the snow, abruptly jerking us to a stop. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s going to drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Our faces are only inches apart and his breath is hot against my cheeks.</p> <p>Staring down at the ground, my hair falls to the side of my face. \u201cI had a dream that you and I had sex on the hood of your Chevelle.\u201d</p><p>He sweeps my hair back and the look on his face tells me I\u2019m in for it. \u201cWere you on you back or did I have you bent over.\u201d</p><p>My frozen cheeks start to burn. \u201cI was on top of you on the hood.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his jawline, letting out a low laugh. \u201cWe are so doing that while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I swat his arm. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be taking things easy... and after what happened in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand over my mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s why I brought you here\u2014to tell you the truth. You need to understand how I feel about you and I figure this is the perfect place since it\u2019s where it all really began.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to play truth again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to play truth again.\u201d</p><p>We stare out at the quiet street. There is something about the holidays and the snowfall that shuts everyone up in the neighborhood. It\u2019s nice and was my favorite time of the year as a kid.</p><p>\u201cDo I make you miserable?\u201d I ask suddenly.</p><p>He shakes his head swiftly. \u201cNever. Not one single time. Sad, yes. Miserable, no.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cHave you and Blake ever done anything?\u201d</p><p>My head whips toward him. \u201cThat\u2019s your question?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not once did I ever even think about it,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat about you? Did you ever do anything on the road?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes like it\u2019s the most ridiculous question he\u2019s ever heard. \u201cEven when I thought you cheated on me and I wanted to go back to my old habits, I just couldn\u2019t get there.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAlthough, Naomi did try to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>My jaw tightens as anger trickles through me. \u201cLila was right.\u201d</p><p>He draws his hood over his head and tucks his hands into his sleeves. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Naomi had a thing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that where all that bitchiness came from in LA?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYep, she overheard Naomi talking crap about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause I trusted you.\u201d I shrug. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to start trouble.\u201d</p><p>He traces my lip with his chilled finger and it sends a shiver coursing through my body. \u201cI want you to be more honest with me. I don\u2019t want you to be afraid to tell me things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep things from me,\u201d I remind him. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t think I can handle stuff. And I need to learn how to handle stuff, otherwise, explosions happen.\u201d</p><p>He moves his hand back to the chain. \u201cLike your panic attacks?\u201d</p><p>I swallow the giant lump in my throat. \u201cYeah, like those... and you need to really consider if you want to deal with that shit for the rest of your life, because I may be able to get it under control, but sometimes stuff will trigger it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the rest of my life?\u201d His voice softens. \u201cDo you want that, Ella May? Do you want me eternally, infinitely, forever, till death do us part?\u201d</p><p>My chest pressurizes with the heaviness of his words, so I make a joke. \u201cHave you been reading the thesaurus again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo jokes.\u201d He rolls up the sleeve of his jacket, and reveals the black lines of the infinity tattoo. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to marry me, but I want to know if you see us together forever, because I sure as hell do.\u201d</p><p>My insides quiver at the honesty in his aqua eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m broken.\u201d</p><p>His gaze never wavers from me. \u201cI know what I\u2019m getting into and I want it more than anything, but the question is, do you want me?\u201d</p><p>My heart thumps fitfully inside my chest as I let the shield around it evaporate into dust and listen to it wholly for once, shoving away the worry. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>It feels like the sky has opened up and the sunshine has been freed from the clouds.</p><p>Micha lets out a gradual breath as he stares off at the road. \u201cFuck, I\u2019ve been waiting for you to say that for forever.\u201d</p><p>I lean over to kiss him, but he pulls away, and instead holds up his hand. \u201cNow we need to make the pact again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to spit in my hand,\u201d I say with disgust. \u201cAnd then let you mix your spit with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You did it before.\u201d He spits in his hand. \u201cBesides, we\u2019ve done a lot dirtier things than this.\u201d</p><p>I know once I do it, I\u2019m making a commitment. \u201cWe have so many problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ease up on the drinking if that\u2019s what you need. Hell, I\u2019d cut my fucking arm off if you\u2019d just let me be with you,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, Ella, we can wait around, wasting years, hoping we\u2019ll reach perfection in our lives. But it doesn\u2019t exist. We\u2019ll always have problems, but as long as we work through them together, I think we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many problems.\u201d I pull off my glove and spit in my trembling hand. \u201cBut if this is what you want, then I\u2019m in. Although, I have to say that cutting your arm off would be a disgusting gesture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, if you really want me to, I\u2019ll keep my arm.\u201d He jokes, then hesitates, edging his hand away. \u201cIs this what you really want though? Because all I want is for you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>I search my brain for the truth. \u201cI want it more than anything, just as long as you promise me one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat if at any time it gets to be too much for you, you\u2019ll leave me\u2014walk away and get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will never happen,\u201d he guarantees me. \u201cYou need to give me some credit. You left me, ripped out my heart, and then came back acting like a robot, and you know what? We made it through. You and I, good or bad, belong together. We make each other whole.\u201d</p><p>Tears threaten to spill out and my heart nearly stops. To anyone else, it would sound like a line, but I know it\u2019s the truth. I lift my hand up with my palm facing him. \u201cI need you to promise, just so I can have peace of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He says tolerantly. \u201cI promise that if things get too bad, I\u2019ll walk away.\u201d</p><p>I let out a breath of relief. \u201cThen I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the exact words I said during our last pact when we promised to run away together, get a nice house, good jobs, and have a happy life.</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He spits into his hand again. \u201cGotta make sure it\u2019s nice and slimy for you.\u201d</p><p>Snorting a laugh, I press my palm to his and I swear the earth stops, because this moment is the beginning of forever.</p><p>\u201cNow we have to kiss,\u201d Micha says, leaning in. \u201cIt\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><p>I meet him halfway and brush my lips to his. His hand cups my cheek and he instantly intensifies the kiss, stroking his tongue with mine. Our breaths collide and swarm around us as the swings\u2019 chains clink together with our movements. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pulling away slightly, he captures me by the waist and aids me over to his lap, so I\u2019m facing him with my legs tucked through the space on each side of him.</p><p>\u201cNo flinging us out onto the ground,\u201d I order, putting my glove on before winding my hands around the chains. \u201cLast time I nearly broke my arm.\u201d</p><p>A devious look masks his face as he picks up his feet and soars us off into the sky. It\u2019s cold as hell and there are dogs howling in the background as someone starts to shout, but I can still feel it\u2014the lightness that comes with letting someone love you completely.</p> <p>Chapter 18</p><p>Micha</p><p>Early the next morning, Caroline called to ask Ella if she would mind doing the shopping for Christmas dinner. Ella agreed and Caroline gave her a list of stuff. I was kind of annoyed, since Ella used to have to take care of this shit all the time when we were growing up. Dean should have offered her a break. So after we cleared out all the alcohol from the house in preparation for the arrival of Ella\u2019s father, we went to the local grocery store.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession,\u201d I announce as we walk up the frozen-food aisle. The store is crowded and picked over since it\u2019s Christmas day and everyone in the damn town has rushed to buy last-minute stuff.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to hear your confession,\u201d she responds with a smile as she scans the list. She\u2019s wearing a tight pair of jeans that hug at her hips, and every time she bends over to grab something off the bottom shelf, I get a nice view of her ass. \u201cThings have been going so well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s kind of important and it\u2019s been bugging me since our game of truth yesterday, because it should have been said.\u201d I pause. \u201cI want you to know that I talked to this music producer down in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes slowly lift from the paper. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened, like, a couple of days ago.\u201d I inch the cart out of the way as an old woman nearly runs into the back of me. I have my hood over my head and she looks at me like I\u2019m going to rob her, so I charm her with a smile, before returning my attention to Ella. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not really a big deal. Some guy came up to me and handed me his card when I was playing at The Hook Up. I don\u2019t even recognize his name or anything, although I Googled him and he does work for a small studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call him?\u201d She opens a freezer door to get a bag of frozen peas.</p><p>I nod, taking the bag from her hand and tossing it into the cart. \u201cYeah, he wants me to come out for a meeting in, like, a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>She wraps her leather jacket tighter around her with a puzzled look on her face. \u201cAnd what happens if it works out for you? Then you\u2019ll move to California?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe... I don\u2019t know,\u201d I lie with hesitance. \u201cI haven\u2019t let myself think about the what-if\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>She adds another bag of frozen peas to the cart and starts walking down the aisle. \u201cBut what if something happens? Because it could. You are amazing after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if something does happen...\u201d I clear my throat, feeling like a total pussy over the fact that I\u2019m nervous. \u201cThen I was thinking that maybe you could move there with me. They have a couple colleges nearby that you could transfer to so you don\u2019t have to give that up.\u201d</p><p>He eyes widen just like I anticipated. \u201cAnd we would just, what? Live together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t thinking we\u2019d move out there and live separately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive together,\u201d she repeats. \u201cLike, with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, okay? You don\u2019t have to answer now.\u201d I toss a bag of chips into the cart and push it forward. \u201cJust think about it.\u201d</p><p>She scratches off an item on the list with the pen. \u201cOkay... I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p> <p>I opt to end the conversation there, right on a good note, because it will keep me in a good mood all day.</p><p>Ella</p><p>I unpack the groceries and read through the many past-due bills that were piling up in the mailbox. One in particular is a notice that the house is about to go into foreclosure. My chest tightens as I read it and the paper shakes in my unsteady hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Micha asks, coming up behind me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d I stuff the letter back into the envelope and set it down on the kitchen table. \u201cJust bill stuff that I have no idea what to do with.\u201d</p><p>I head to take a shower. I\u2019ve been frozen since we arrived and the hot water sounds great at the moment. Plus, I need a minute alone to mull over his declaration that he wants us to live together. Live together. My mind can barely grasp the idea of it.</p><p>Micha trails after me toward the stairs. \u201cYou should let me get in with you,\u201d he says with a captivating smile on his lips. \u201cIt could be for my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour birthday isn\u2019t until tomorrow,\u201d I remind him, stopping at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cAnd besides, I have to take a quick shower and get dinner started.\u201d I glance at my watch. \u201cEveryone is going to be here in, like, four or five hours.\u201d</p><p>He presses his hand to his heart with the most appealing look on his face. \u201cI\u2019ll be quick. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you think\u2019s going to happen during this shower?\u201d I ask as his fingers spread across my hips, just below the hem of my shirt, and he guides me against him. \u201cBecause I plan on getting clean.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head slowly with fire blazing in his eyes. \u201cNo way. Showers are made for dirty things.\u201d He backs me around the banister and into the wall, tangling his fingers through my hair forcefully and dipping his voice to a husky whisper. \u201cThink about the last time you and I showered together. How good it felt.\u201d His hand comes up between by thighs, not stopping until it reaches the top. Even through the fabric of my jeans, heat devours my skin.</p><p>Something between a moan and a whimper escapes the back of my throat and he takes that as a yes, colliding his lips into mine. I suck his tongue deep into my mouth as I unbutton the front of his shirt and rip it off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any clean clothes,\u201d I murmur against his lips as he backs us toward the downstairs bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Kicking the door open, we stumble in and he locks the door before returning his lips to mine. Trailing soft kisses down my jawline, he unfastens the button of my jeans and I slip them off, then tug off my shirt and shake out my hair.</p><p>The desire in his eyes nearly melts me and my body craves him inside me so badly. I quickly unclasp my bra, then grab the waist of his jeans and haul him toward me. When my nipples brush his skin they instantly perk up and his eyes close as his lips find mine. Desire pours through me as his hands glide around to my backside, searing hot as he enfolds our bodies together.</p><p>Reaching behind my back toward the tub, I manage to turn on the water and steam slowly engulfs the room. My skin dampens and my thighs tingle to be touched. I start to take off his jeans and he helps me out enthusiastically. Once the rest of our clothes are off, we climb into the shower and he draws the curtain closed. I can\u2019t help but smile at the memories that surface.</p><p>Water drips from his blond hair, beads across his lips, streams down his lean chest. His hand travels down my side and along my stomach, but before he can slip his fingers inside me, I jump up and link my legs around his waist, surprising him.</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me,\u201d I whisper, letting my reservations go. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids open and his lashes flutter against the splashes of the shower. My confession shocks us both and without any more hesitation, he braces a hand on the wall and thrusts inside me.</p><p>My breath comes out ragged and my legs tighten around his hips as he pushes deeper into me. I can barely breathe... barely think. It feels so good. When he hits the right spot, I moan and grip my fingers into his shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cMicha, I love you,\u201d I murmur between breaths and realize that this is what I want. Forever.</p><p>Micha</p><p>It startles the shit out of me when she says she wants me inside her. She has never been so upfront about what she wants and it turns me on so badly that my cock actually hurts.</p><p>Once I\u2019m inside her, it feels so goddamn good, and I\u2019m probably not going to last long. Water runs down our bodies and makes everything slippery, which is an added bonus. Bracing against the wall with one hand to keep us from falling, I rock into her over and over again, driving her to the edge. When her head tips back, the flow of the shower streams along her tits and I can\u2019t help myself. I want a taste.</p><p>I lower my mouth to one of her breasts and suck the water off while tracing her nipple with my tongue until she groans. Her fingers knot through my hair and she guides my mouth closer, seeking more. And I give it to her. Hard. Until she scream out my name. Her hair is soaked and water beads on her eyelashes as her head angles back against the wall and her green eyes glaze over. Moments later I join her, breathing loudly as I struggle to hold us up.</p><p>Once we\u2019ve both caught our breath, I slip out of her, turn off the water, and we climb out. She wraps a towel around herself and I tie one around my waist. I feel so alive right now there are no words.</p><p>She chews on her lip as she slants back against the wall. \u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, rolling my tongue to retain the smile from getting bigger. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was.\u201d</p><p>She kisses me on the cheek. \u201cYou have this big grin on your face, so just tell me what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want the truth?\u201d I question. \u201cBecause it\u2019s intense.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head and her wet hair drips water down her shoulders. \u201cI want the truth.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her lips lightly and whisper in her ear, \u201cI was thinking how we could do this every day when we have our own place.\u201d</p><p>Her faltering breath hits my cheek and I worry she\u2019s going to freak out. \u201cI think we should start trying some different places beside the shower.\u201d</p><p>My grin enlarges as I lean back and search her eyes. \u201cI could throw you down on our table. Or better yet, I could bend you over the banister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t picture us having a banister,\u201d she replies thoughtfully. \u201cI think I just want a small apartment. It\u2019s easier to keep clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting me excited, Ella May,\u201d I proclaim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. I want you to be excited.\u201d She bites down on her lip. \u201cI\u2019m scared though. I mean this is huge, you know.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m glad she admits it to me. \u201cMe too, but then I think about how we\u2019re going to have the \u2018no clothes on inside the house\u2019 rule and I just get happy again.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and combs her fingers through her hair. \u201cIf you don\u2019t end up moving to California, then what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are going to get are own place eventually no matter where we live,\u201d I say and kiss her forehead. \u201cYou may think it\u2019s fast, but you got to remember that technically you and I have been living together since we were kids. I mean, we barely left each other\u2019s side since we were six.\u201d I pause as tears abruptly fill her eyes. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She wipes the tears away with the back of her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just really want it to work out.\u201d</p><p>Hugging her against me, I rest my chin on top of her head and gently rub her back. \u201cIt will, and you want to know why?\u201d I ask and she nods. \u201cBecause most people go into this blind. They don\u2019t know the bad side of the person they\u2019re with. But we know each other\u2019s flaws and cracks\u2014we know what we\u2019re getting into and that makes us stronger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI really do love you.\u201d She tightens her arms around me.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I reply, trailing kisses down her neck. \u201cMore than anything.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Ella</p><p>I\u2019m proud of myself for telling the truth to Micha and for not worrying too much during the trip, at least so far. By the time I\u2019m dressed and walking out of my room, I\u2019m feeling kind of happy. When I enter the kitchen, however, my good feeling deflates.</p><p>Caroline is by the stove, with her black hair wound up out of her face, stirring a pan with an apron tied around her waist. Micha is over by the microwave waiting for the butter to heat up, wearing a pair of jeans that hang loosely at his hips and his blond hair is a little damp still from the shower. Dean is at the table, in slacks and a button-down shirt, and he\u2019s peeling off the husk of the corn on the cob.</p> <p>\u201cWe brought them with us,\u201d he explains when he notices me staring at the corn. \u201cCaroline wanted them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d I turn to Caroline. \u201cWhat still needs to be cooked?\u201d</p><p>She shoos me away with her free hand. \u201cYou are not cooking anything.\u201d</p><p>I pick up a spoon off the counter. \u201cI always cook Christmas dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why it always sucked,\u201d Dean remarks under his breath as he tosses a husk into the garbage.</p><p>\u201cI did my best,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like I wanted to. No one else would. And half the time no one would eat it.\u201d</p><p>Caroline turns the stove\u2019s temperature down. \u201cYou are not cooking this year. It\u2019s not right that you\u2019ve spent your whole life taking care of everyone else.\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at Micha. \u201cWhat have you been telling her?\u201d</p> <p>The microwave beeps and he opens the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her anything.\u201d</p><p>Perplexed, I look at my brother. \u201cDid you...\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, he tosses a cob into a large crockpot on the table. \u201cLook, all I did was mention that you cooked for us almost everyday while I was growing up.\u201d</p><p>Caroline smiles as she covers the pan with a lid. \u201cHe\u2019s been seeing someone about his anger issues.\u201d</p><p>My eyes dart back to Dean, waiting for him to snap at her, but he just shrugs and grabs another cob on the corn that needs to be shucked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll cook dinner.\u201d Caroline signals for Dean to add something.</p><p>He lets out a frustrated breath. \u201cYou should go out and do something fun. Be a kid for a change or whatever. We\u2019ll get things ready for when dad arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he even getting here?\u201d I ask, setting the spoon down on the counter. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis counselor is dropping him off,\u201d Caroline explains, plugging in the mixer. \u201cI guess he lives about an hour away from here.\u201d</p><p>She starts to hum as she mixes some orange stuff in a bowl. Dean focuses on the corn and I stand there unsure of what to do with myself. Finally I glance at Micha for help.</p><p>\u201cWe could go out to Back Road and spin some doughnuts,\u201d he suggest, setting the butter down on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYour car\u2019s not made to spin doughnuts,\u201d I say as he walks toward me. \u201cHence the last time we got stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got chains we can put on it if it gets stuck.\u201d He steals a marshmallow out of an open bag on the counter. \u201cBesides I need a few dents in that tainted car to make it whole again.\u201d He tosses a marshmallow at me and I open my mouth to catch it, but it pegs me in the forehead.</p><p>\u201cBut I love your car.\u201d I pick up the marshmallow and toss it into the trash. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loathe it now,\u201d he annunciates. \u201cMy father has officially tainted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to ruin it,\u201d Dean chimes in, \u201cthere\u2019s a sledge hammer in the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Micha replies in a clipped tone as he snatches the bag of marshmallows and tugs me toward the door. Micha has never liked Dean very much. \u201cI got another idea.\u201d</p><p>I grab my jacket off the door hanger and giggle as he hauls me toward the fence. He hops over it effortlessly, and then he picks me up by the waist and lifts me over easily.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your big idea?\u201d I say breathlessly as he leads us toward the garage and snow fills my shoes. \u201cRunning it into a wall, racing it until the engine explodes?\u201d</p><p>He lets out his evil villain laugh as he opens the garage door. \u201cWe\u2019re going to spin doughnuts dangerous style.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head quickly. \u201cNo way. Last time, I almost got a concussion when you rammed the snowbank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you better man up.\u201d He opens up the passenger door for me. \u201cBecause it\u2019s gonna get intense.\u201d</p><p>I duck my head into the cab and drop into the seat. \u201cI don\u2019t man up. I\u2019m a dainty little girl.\u201d</p><p>He snorts a sharp laugh. \u201cOkay, if you say so.\u201d</p><p>He slams the door and circles the front of the car. His gaze fleetingly lands on the twelve pack nestled on the shelf between the toolbox and oil. When he spots me looking at him, he grins and gets in the car, pushing the garage door opener latched onto the visor. Punching the gas, he peels out down the driveway, skidding from left to right and fishtailing it when we hit the icy road.</p><p>\u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201d I ask as he cranks the wheel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you want,\u201d he answers straitening out the car.</p><p>\u201cCan you try not to kill us?\u201d I say, cranking up the heat. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve started planning a future, I kind of want to have one.\u201d</p><p>Ethan and Lila follow us up to Back Road in Ethan\u2019s truck. The sky is cloudy but silent from the snow drifting to the ground. About halfway up to the old racing spot. Micha has to get out and put the chains on the tires. Watching him bend over and get them on is very entertaining because his pants keep slipping down on his hips. When he catches me checking him out, he winks at me and waggles his eyebrows suggestively. I turn in my seat, smiling to myself.</p><p>After we make it to the end of the road, Micha gets out and takes the chains back off so we can \u201cspin doughnuts dangerous style,\u201d as he put it. Ethan parks his truck near a snowbank and Lila and he climb into the car with us. The area in front of us is open and packed with snow. Icicles hang from the branches of the trees that border around us and the roof of The Hitch, a rundown brick building that was once a restaurant, has caved in.</p><p>With his hand on the steering wheel and his eyes locked ahead, Micha pumps the gas and a cloud of smoke puffs out the exhaust. The tires spin and I cover my eyes with my hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he wonders with humor. \u201cWhere\u2019s my dangerous girl tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time with the fact that you\u2019re going to destroy the car.\u201d I peek between my fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s just too tragic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to destroy it.\u201d He picks up his iPod and hands it to me. \u201cYou want to do the honors?\u201d</p><p>I take it and scroll through the selection, finally clicking on \u201cFace to the Floor\u201d by Chevelle.</p><p>Micha grins. \u201cExcellent choice.\u201d</p><p>My hand instantly shoots for the side of the seat and I prop my foot up on the dash as I slouch down.</p><p>\u201cEl, what are you doing?\u201d Lila peers around the seat at me. \u201cAnd what the hell is this music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chevelle,\u201d Ethan says like she should know.</p><p>She arches her eyebrows as she sinks back in the seat. \u201cOkay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust put your seatbelt on,\u201d I instruct as Micha laughs, revving the engine.</p><p>She obeys, quickly clicking it on and Ethan leans forward, resting his elbows on the console. \u201cDon\u2019t hit the fucking snowbank like last time. I don\u2019t want a concussion again.\u201d</p><p>Ethan and I trade looks because the concussion involved him and me smacking heads upon impact.</p><p>\u201cI got this,\u201d Micha assures us confidently, shifting into drive. \u201cAt least I think... if anyone wants to bail out, now is the time.\u201d</p><p>We target an assumption at Lila.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not a wimp.\u201d She places her hand over her heart, offended. \u201cAnd I\u2019m staying in.\u201d</p><p>Micha pushes the gas pedal and the tires spin. We lunge forward, slowly speeding up and swerving all over the place as the car battles against the deep snow. Frost flurries around the car as he shifts into a higher gear and accelerates, heading for the end of a road that\u2019s blocked off by a massive snow hill. Shutting my eyes, I wait for it because I know it\u2019s coming. It happens every single time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverybody hang on,\u201d Micha instructs, before he jerks on the e-brake.</p><p>The car spins out of control, like a carnival ride. With my eyes closed it feels like I\u2019m flying. I want to stick my hands out and bask in the freeness. Moments later, the car smacks into the bank and the abrupt impact sends me flying for real. I land on top of Micha, banging my head on his as the car jerks to a stop.</p><p>\u201cOh, motherfucker,\u201d Ethan moans. \u201cFuck. Lila, are you okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assures him with terror in her voice. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t anyone warn me?\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and look into Micha\u2019s aqua blue eyes. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He delicately touches my head with his fingertips. \u201cWe hit heads pretty hard.\u201d</p><p>I press the heel of my hand to my head. \u201cI think you did that on purpose, so I would end up in your lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe just a little.\u201d He leans down and kisses me passionately, sucking on my bottom lip before pulling away, leaving my body suffocated in warmth. \u201cActually I was aiming for a nice slide in, but I choked at the last second and didn\u2019t pull the brake quick enough.\u201d</p> <p>I start to sit up, but he holds me down by placing a hand on my chest. \u201cI think you should just stay there for a while. It\u2019s a good place for you.\u201d</p><p>My head is resting in his lap and I can feel the bulge through his pants. \u201cReally? Even in this situation.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkle with delight. \u201cAgain, your face is, like, inches away from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two better shut the hell up with that,\u201d Ethan warns sharply from the backseat. \u201cIt\u2019s seriously getting annoying and I don\u2019t have the stomach for it.\u201d</p><p>Micha kisses me again, making an overexaggerated moan to irritate Ethan more. The car door slams as Ethan removes himself from the car and Micha helps me sit up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to get the tow strap out of the trunk.\u201d</p> <p>As soon as he\u2019s out of the car, Lila dives over the console and into the passenger seat. \u201cSo let me get this straight. He got his car stuck only so they could tow it out?\u201d</p><p>I waver, cranking up the heat to full blast. \u201cHe got his car stuck to make a statement to his father about fixing his car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his father\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s more for himself.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t get it and I don\u2019t try to explain it to her. If this makes Micha feel better, then I\u2019m glad. It\u2019s what he deserves.</p><p>About an hour later, the car is unstuck. Micha got the tires wedged in really deep and we finally had to bring out the snow shovels Ethan had in back of his truck.</p><p>It\u2019s not the only time we\u2019ve been stuck out here and we learned our lesson the first time we got stranded to always be prepared with a snow shovel, tow strap, and chains. Otherwise, it\u2019s a long walk home in below-freezing weather.</p><p>After the car is back in the shallow end of the snow, Micha takes the tow strap off and winds it around his hand as he proudly takes in the scratches and dents on the front fender.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ride home with Ethan,\u201d Lila tells me, reaching for the handle of the door.</p><p>\u201cWait, I have to ask you something.\u201d I hesitate and rotate in the seat to face her. \u201cAre you sleeping with Ethan?\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes round as she ties the scarf around her neck. \u201cNo, we\u2019re just friends. God, Ella, I don\u2019t sleep with everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you two seem close... and I mean, what do you guys do when you\u2019re alone?\u201d</p><p>She pushes the door open and steps out, her feet sinking into the snow. \u201cWe talk.\u201d</p><p>I lean over, wondering what the two of them could possibly have in common. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife.\u201d She shuts the door, tramples to the back of the car where Ethan\u2019s truck is running, and climbs inside.</p><p>One day, I\u2019ll get her to confess to me what is they do. I turn up the music and sing along as I wait for Micha to get in. When he opens the door, a gust of wind blows in and chills the cab.</p><p>He pokes his head in, his cheeks pink from the cold and snowflakes speckling his hair. \u201cWhat? Are you driving?\u201d</p><p>I run my hand along the top of the steering wheel. \u201cI was thinking about it. Why? Are you not going to let me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will totally let you.\u201d He laughs. \u201cBut there\u2019s something I need to do first.\u201d</p><p>With my shoulders slumped, I swing my leg over the console and sit down in the passenger seat. \u201cWhat do you need to do?\u201d</p><p>He shuts the door, pausing as he nibbles at his lip ring and stares pensively out the windshield at the sky, which is getting darker. \u201cI\u2019m still deciding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really should be getting back,\u201d I say, checking my messages. \u201cDean texted me, like, five minutes ago and said dinner is in an hour. I guess my dad is there now and your mom and her boyfriend are going to be over soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem sad that your dad\u2019s there,\u201d he states, looking at me intently.</p><p>I stare up at the cloudy sky and the snowflakes falling from the sky. \u201cI\u2019m not sad, just nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought the letter made it better,\u201d he says. \u201cThat he let you know it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>My breath puffs out unevenly. \u201cMicha, I\u2019ll always carry that night with me, whether my dad says it\u2019s my fault or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla, it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Panic flares in his eyes; he\u2019s worried I\u2019m reverting. \u201cYou have to start believing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha, I\u2019m okay.\u201d I place a hand on his as a comforting gesture. \u201cIt\u2019s when I don\u2019t say these things aloud that there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>His Adam\u2019s apple bobs up and down as he swallows hard. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>We sit in silence, watching the snowflakes land on the hood and drift through the beam of the headlights.</p><p>When he looks at me again, the lust in his eyes forces me to suck in a sharp breath. \u201cAlright, no more drowning in our sorrows. It\u2019s confession time again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we done a lot of that over the last day?\u201d I thread my fingers through his. \u201cI think I might be all confessed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have this dream,\u201d he says, ignoring my request. \u201cWell, it\u2019s more like a fantasy... But anyway, you and I have sex in my car. We are in the driver\u2019s seat, with you on top of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds an awful lot like the dream I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because great minds think alike. But having sex on the hood in this weather doesn\u2019t seem like it would work, so I\u2019m going with inside.\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at the road. \u201cYou want to have sex in the car? Right now? What if someone comes up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly anyone comes up here in this kind of weather. You know that.\u201d He stares at me, biting on the damn lip ring and my body burns hot with longing. Without even thinking, I maneuver over the console and straddle his lap.</p><p>His lips quirk. \u201cI really thought it would take more persuading than that.\u201d</p><p>He considers something, and then moves me over to get out of the car. Popping the trunk, he grabs something before hurrying back in, shivering from the cold air. There\u2019s snow on his shoulders and a blanket in his hand. \u201cJust in case someone does show up then we can at least be covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep a blanket in you trunk?\u201d I say. \u201cMan, you are prepared. How many times have you had sex in your car?\u201d</p><p>He pulls me back onto his lap and wraps the blanket around us. \u201cThis is a first for me, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never done anyone in the car before?\u201d I question with cynicism.</p><p>His face is humorless as he tucks a strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cI know you saw me with a lot of girls, but I think you totally mistake how much effort I put into it. Doing it in a car is going to be fucking complicated. Besides, I\u2019ve been saving this place for you.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I fasten my arms around the back of his neck. \u201cAnd what would have happened if we\u2019d never gotten together? Then you would have never lived out your fantasy. And what if I wasn\u2019t into it?\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my ass. \u201cOh, I knew you\u2019d be into it. As much as you get embarrassed about stuff, cars have always turned you on. I remember the first time I took you for a ride in The Beast. It was a piece of shit back then, but it could still kick it. You were sitting in the passenger seat with your hand out the window and you had this look on your face\u2014you were getting so turned on. It turned me on so badly, I had to take care of myself when I got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t getting turned on,\u201d I lie. \u201cI was enjoying the moment.\u201d</p><p>An artful smirk curves at his lips. \u201cIf I would have pulled over and asked you to do me, you totally would have.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head in protest. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t have. You would have freaked me out if you\u2019d asked me.\u201d</p><p>The intensity in his face switches to solemnity. \u201cI actually know that. You know, when it came to doing crazy things like jumping off roofs and fighting, you were good to go. But challenge you to face your feelings and you\u2019d run away like you were on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I didn\u2019t understand them,\u201d I utter quietly, staring off into the darkness outside. \u201cAnna... my therapist, thinks it\u2019s because no one ever hugged me or whatever. I don\u2019t know... She says weird stuff like that all the time to me, like she thinks it\u2019s my childhood that made me this way.\u201d</p><p>Silence incases us and finally I dare a glance at him, fearing I\u2019ve probably freaked him out with my confession. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should probably keep that stuff to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to talk to me about stuff, Ella,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised you did. You\u2019ve never said much about what goes on in therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s personal.\u201d My chest rises and falls as I breathe soundly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cups my cheek and runs his thumb underneath my eye. \u201cYou do realize we\u2019ve crossed the line of things being personal.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right, so summoning confidence, I continue. \u201cShe says I didn\u2019t get hugged enough and I told her you hugged me all the time, but she didn\u2019t seem that impressed.\u201d</p><p>He laughs softly. \u201cI remember the first time I tried to hug you... I think we were, like, eight or something. You\u2019d scraped the shit out of your knee trying to climb up a tree and I wanted to make you feel better, so I went to hug you.\u201d</p> <p>I wince at the memory. \u201cAnd then I punched you in the arm. I remember... you scared me. I\u2019d never had anyone approach me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He bushes his lips against mine as his finger traces my cheekbone. \u201cThe next time I made sure I was a little more careful, although I did sneak in a few arm wraps and pats on the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was weird for me when you did it,\u201d I confess. \u201cBut there were too many people around and I didn\u2019t want to look nuts by running away from your celebration... God, I can\u2019t believe I was that old the first time I can remember being hugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were we, like, thirteen?\u201d Micha recollects, dazing off as he coils a strand of my hair around his finger. \u201cI was so fucking excited that I\u2019d won that stupid bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a stupid bet.\u201d My eyelids flutter as his hand runs through my hair and tugs at the roots. \u201cWe all knew Danny was afraid of heights. I have no idea why he even tried to jump off the cliff into the lake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI held my breath the entire fall.\u201d I clutch onto his shoulders. \u201cI think I was scared you\u2019d hurt yourself or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you loved me. You just didn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know it either. You were just as blind as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I can remember swimming out of the lake totally stoked because I\u2019d won two hundred bucks. Plus I was so hyped up on adrenaline. When I saw you standing on the shore in the cut-off that showed off your long skinny legs\u201d\u2014he pinches my ass and I shake my head\u2014\u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking. I just went over, picked you up, and latched on to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nearly squeezed the life out of me,\u201d I recollect. \u201cAnd you got my clothes all wet... but I did like it.\u201d</p><p>He crooks an eyebrow. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d I latch onto his gaze, needing to look at him. \u201cIt was scary, but nice. Everything with you is scary, but nice.\u201d</p><p>His expression changes at my honesty and he leans in to kiss me fervidly, ending the conversation. I eagerly unzip my jacket and toss it into the backseat. He pulls my shirt over my head and quickly unfastens my bra with one flick of his finger. His gaze instantly lowers. Cupping one with his hand, he brings his mouth to my breast and I fall backward, bumping the horn. It honks into the night, but I\u2019m too lost to care as his hand glides down my stomach and delves inside my jeans. Once his fingers are inside me, my eyes seal shut and warmth ripples through my body. The horn keeps honking and \u201cDon\u2019t Wait\u201d by Dashboard Confessions flows from the speakers.</p><p>\u201cMicha, I want you,\u201d I moan as he sucks kisses along the hollow of my neck and I can hardly breathe. \u201cI really do.\u201d</p><p>He draws back slightly, his eyes penetrating mine. When his lips return to mine, it\u2019s not just about lust or desire\u2014it\u2019s about making us whole.</p><p>Rising my hips upward to take my jeans and panties off, I accidentally bang my head on the roof. Laughing softly, he steers my mouth back to his forcefully as I fumble to undo the button of his jeans and then he wiggles them down. Seconds later he\u2019s inside me and I hover forward to stop the horn from honking as I open my mouth, allowing his tongue to devour me. The windows fog up as he thrusts into me and I cling onto him like he\u2019s what keeps me thriving. Because he is.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Micha</p><p>I smile the entire drive home. Not just because she let me do her in the car, but also because so much has changed. She opened up to me and her eyes lost a little bit of the sadness in them.</p> <p>When I pull the car up to the front of her house, however, my gut wrenches at the idea that all the progress could be taken away in a heartbeat if Dean or her dad decides to bring painful things up. I decide before I get out of the car, that if they do, I\u2019ll hurt them.</p><p>Dean\u2019s red Porsche is in the driveway, along with Ethan\u2019s truck. As we walk toward the back door, holding hands, snow falling from the sky and crunching under our shoes, neither one of us speaks. When we reach the door, I pause before opening it.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d I ask. \u201cBecause we could take off right now, just you and I and go wherever you want.\u201d</p><p>She stands on her tiptoes to kiss my cheek and then nods. \u201cI think I have to.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I open the door and we walk head-on into the lion\u2019s den. At the table, Ella\u2019s dad, Lila, and Ethan are sitting quietly around bowls and plates full of corn, stuffing, chicken, peas. There are rolls and butter and much more than both of us are used to seeing. Keeping a hold of Ella\u2019s hand I walk over to the table and we take a seat side-by-side.</p><p>\u201cIt took you a long time to get back,\u201d Ethan mutters under his breath with an accusing laugh. \u201cWhat, did you get stuck again or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off.\u201d I take a roll as Ella grips my hand under the table with her eyes fixed on the tablecloth. Her dad looks awkward sitting across from us, cutting a piece of chicken into absurdly thin slices.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ella,\u201d he says formally, without making eye contact. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p><p>My muscles tense waiting for her response.</p><p>It takes her a second. \u201cGood. Really, really good.\u201d</p><p>I exhale and the heaviness and worry of the night alleviates for the moment. Dean enters with a box in his hand and a confused look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWho drew on the bathroom floor?\u201d He drops the box on the counter.</p><p>Ella raises her hand. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d His tone holds annoyance. \u201cWell, next time close the damn door. You know how I feel about it being open.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth, trying not to say anything as Ella raises her chin and looks at her father, who seems obsessed with the chicken. \u201cDad, I think the chicken is cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He sets the fork down to the side of the plate and sighs. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize I was cutting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice,\u201d Caroline hisses at Dean from behind us. \u201cOr I swear to God you\u2019re sleeping alone tonight.\u201d She appears at the table with a plate of crackers and cheese. She\u2019s wearing a red dress with a skeleton on the bottom and a cross around her neck. \u201cAlright, who\u2019s hungry?\u201d</p><p>We all dig in like we\u2019re starved animals and my mom and Thomas come waltzing in right on time. My mom has a green dress on that\u2019s a little too short and Thomas has a polo shirt and cargo pants on. Ella\u2019s dad stands up to give my mom a quick kiss on the cheek, and then they take a seat at the opposite end on fold-up chairs.</p><p>After everyone is seated, Caroline clinks her fork against her cup. \u201cOkay, so my family has this tradition where we all go around and say one thing that we\u2019re thankful for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea,\u201d Dean says, reaching for the gravy. \u201cNot here, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She swats his hand away from the food. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what you think. I think we should do it.\u201d</p><p>We wait for him to react because the Dean we used to know had a fucking hell of a temper on him. Back when we were kind of friends and played in a band, he would get pissed over everything and he broke a lot of drumsticks.</p><p>He rubs his hand tensely on the back of his neck. \u201cFine, I\u2019m really grateful for you cooking this delicious dinner for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Caroline beams at him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful every one showed up.\u201d</p><p>My mom chimes in. \u201cI\u2019m grateful the kids could make it here. It\u2019s been so lonely without them.\u201d</p><p>Thomas glances around the table, looking lost. \u201cUmm... I\u2019m grateful the Vikings won the game.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and Ella covers her mouth to hide her laughter. My mom scowls at us, but then Ella\u2019s dad clears his throat, seeming nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for being sober,\u201d he says and sips on his water. \u201cThis is the first Christmas I\u2019ve not been drunk in as long as I can remember.\u201d</p><p>Ella lets out a shaky breath and her eyes water over, like she\u2019s going to cry. No one speaks for a minute and finally Caroline looks at Ethan.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>He contemplates it with a smirk on his face. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for red lacy bras that have an easy-access clasp in the front.\u201d</p><p>I restrain a laugh as Ella\u2019s head falls onto the table, her shoulders shaking as she laughs under her breath and Lila and I join in.</p><p>\u201cEthan Gregory,\u201d my mom warns. \u201cThat was uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>He surrenders his hand in front of him. \u201cHey, I was just being honest.\u201d</p><p>My mom rolls her eyes. \u201cWhat about you, Lila?\u201d</p><p>Lila twists a strand of her blonde hair around her finger with a twinkle in her blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for candy canes.\u201d</p><p>Ella raises her head up and smoothes her hair into place, looking as mystified as everyone else, except for Ethan.</p><p>He winks at Lila, who blushes a little. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing to be thankful for.\u201d</p><p>Ella remains quiet for a while with this strange look on her face, like she\u2019s thinking deep, and then she glances at me. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for Micha.\u201d</p><p>I lean over and kiss her in front of everyone. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful you said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Dean interrupts, gaping at us with a disgusted look on his face. \u201cAre you guys dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Ella says indifferently, scooting her chair closer to the table. \u201cNow, can we please eat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We eat the rest of the meal making small talk. Ella keeps biting her lip and assessing everyone, but she doesn\u2019t look sad, just genuinely interested in what everyone is doing and saying. There are even a few moments were she looks happy.</p><p>It\u2019s a good look for her.</p><p>Ella</p> <p>Dinner is as about as awkward as possible, especially when Caroline makes us admit what we\u2019re grateful for. At first I try to think of something meaningful, but then I just listen to my heart. When dinner is over, we clean up in a drama-free environment. It isn\u2019t anything special, but it\u2019s normal, which is something I\u2019ve wanted since I was a little girl. No drunken fathers, no screaming, no working my ass off to cook a dinner that no one will eat.</p><p>I help Caroline clean up and wash the dishes while my dad goes up to his room to unpack. Dean disappeared somewhere and Micha went home for a while because his mom had a present for him. Lila and Ethan are in the living room, attempting to put a small pine tree up that Dean cut down in the front yard.</p><p>When I take the trash out back, a cloud of smoke engulfs my face when I round the porch. Dean is leaning against the house in the shadows smoking a cigarette and wearing one of his old heavy flannel jackets with the hood pulled over his head. I have a flashback of when I was fourteen and caught him smoking something else in the garage.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d I open the garbage lid and drop the bag into it.</p><p>He scratches his head and takes another drag. \u201cDo me a favor and don\u2019t tell Caroline I\u2019m out here. She thinks I quit. And I did. Kind of.\u201d</p> <p>Nodding, I hug my arms around myself and turn for the house.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s weird, right?\u201d he says abruptly.</p><p>I backtrack and squint through the dark to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>He blows out a puff of smoke. \u201cHaving him here sober.\u201d</p><p>Through the window of the house, Caroline is talking to my dad. He has a striped shirt on and a pair of slacks. His brown hair is combed neatly and his face is freshly shaven.</p><p>\u201cIt is weird,\u201d I agree, returning my attention to Dean. \u201cAnd he looks so clean.\u201d</p> <p>Dean bobs his head up and down. \u201cI know... I swear there was, like, a year where he didn\u2019t shower.\u201d He takes another drag and kicks his shoes at the snow. \u201cDid he... did he write you a letter too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d I trail off at the awkwardness of standing her talking to him about personal stuff. \u201cI\u2019m guessing he wrote you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think his therapist or counselor or whatever made him.\u201d The end of the cigarette glows in the dark as he inhales from it. \u201cI\u2019m not really fucking sure what I think of it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d I rock from side to side to keep warm. Without a jacket on, my skin is numb and probably turning purple. \u201cI like that he did it, but it doesn\u2019t erase the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing can erase the past,\u201d he states bluntly. \u201cBut we can fucking move on, which is what I\u2019ve been trying to do for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I wonder if we\u2019re going to go down that path again; the one where he tells me it\u2019s my fault this all happened.</p><p>Snow floats down on top of our heads as I stare out at the street, where the lights from the streetlamp illuminate the ice on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cShe inherited the car,\u201d he admits. \u201cThat\u2019s where she got it.\u201d</p> <p>I whip my head back toward him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He takes a long drag. \u201cThe Porsche. I guess she had, like, this rich great-aunt or something who no one knew really, and when she died, she left every single one of her relatives something and that\u2019s where she got it from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a couple of weeks before she... before she died. It was the same time she told me that when she was gone, I could have it. I thought she was being weird at the time, but now that I look back I wonder if she was, like, preplanning her death.\u201d</p><p>I force down the massive lump in my throat. \u201cAre you sure she wasn\u2019t lying, because she told stories sometimes. Like how she and dad met at a train station when they both missed their train, when really they just dated each other in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe train story was better,\u201d he says with a small smile as he ashes the cigarette. \u201cAnd yeah, she was telling the truth. I could tell because it was one of her normal days.\u201d</p><p>I let out a wobbly breath, thinking about her infrequent normal days. Those days clutch at my heart because I know there won\u2019t be any more.</p><p>Dean offers me a cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019ll calm you down. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>I pinch it in my fingers and take a hit. \u201cYou know it tastes as bad as the last time you gave me one,\u201d I say with a cough, covering my mouth with my hand.</p><p>Smiling, he drops the butt into the snow and puts it out with the tip of his shoe. \u201cYet, you still took it again.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I trample through the snow toward the door, but it swings open and my dad steps out, tugging his hood over his head. \u201cJesus, it\u2019s cold out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is December,\u201d Dean remarks with an arch of his eyebrows.</p><p>My dad pops a cigarette into his mouth and lights the end of it. \u201cIt seems like we should have decorated the house or something. We never really did that, did we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did once,\u201d I say, scuffing the toes of my shoes along the snow. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t here. I think it\u2019s when you took off with Bill for that couple of weeks to go ice fishing. Mom wanted us to do it...\u201d I trail off and we all get quiet.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we should start making it a tradition.\u201d He exhales a breath of smoke that floats toward my face. \u201cMaybe we can all come back here during Christmas, decorate the house, and have a nice dinner like we just had.\u201d He pauses, seeming nervous. \u201cWhat do you two think?\u201d</p><p>Dean flicks a glance at me and then shrugs. \u201cWhatever. Sounds good. Although I\u2019m not promising anything. I\u2019ve got a life of my own.\u201d</p><p>My dad doesn\u2019t respond and it gets quiet again. I laugh under my breath. This is probably how it\u2019s going to be with us, at least until we can all get over our issues. Things will be weird, we\u2019ll have a hard time being around each other, and we\u2019ll probably say things that are hurtful.</p><p>But what makes me able to handle it is the fact that I have people in my life who are there for me. I have Lila. And Ethan. And Micha. I can tell him about everything and I know he\u2019ll make me feel better, he\u2019ll listen, and he\u2019ll be there for me.</p><p>I back toward the fence. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go next door for a while.\u201d I climb over the fence and they watch me, perplexed. \u201cAnd I like the idea, Dad, about the Christmas thing. It sounds good. Count me in.\u201d</p><p>He nods and continues with his cigarette as Dean leaves him and goes into the house.</p><p>I enter Micha\u2019s house without knocking, just like I did when I was a kid. He\u2019s sitting at the kitchen table eating a piece of pie he must have snatched from my house before he left. His blond hair hangs in his beautiful aqua eyes, and the way his mouth moves makes me want to kiss him.</p><p>He sets the fork on the plate as he looks up at me and his eyes widen. \u201cGod, you look like you\u2019re freezing. Your cheeks are all red and your lips are purple.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together to warm them up. \u201cI was standing outside for a while talking to Dean and my dad.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a face as he puts his plate in the sink. \u201cHow\u2019d that go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I shrug and walk across the kitchen to him. \u201cNo one said anything mean, so that\u2019s always an added bonus.\u201d</p><p>He rinses off the plate and then turns the faucet off. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around him and embrace him with everything I\u2019ve got. \u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>His arms fold around me and he tilts my chin up to give me a soft but succulent kiss. When he pulls away, his eyebrows are knit. \u201cDid you smoke?\u201d</p><p>I bit my bottom lip to hide my guilty conscience. \u201cUmm... kind of.\u201d</p><p>He waits for me to explain and when I don\u2019t he kisses me again, probably enjoying the taste. \u201cWhat do you want to do for the rest of the night?\u201d he murmurs against my lips.</p><p>I consider his request. \u201cI want to lay in bed with you.\u201d</p><p>He takes my hands and leads me down the hallway, giving me exactly what I want.</p><p>Micha</p><p>I have a surprise for her for Christmas, but I\u2019m not sure how she\u2019s going to take it. My mom actually gave it to me tonight as a present. At first, I thought she was fucking insane, but she assured me she was indeed sane.</p><p>\u201cI think you should give it to Ella,\u201d she said, handing me a little black box. We were sitting on the couch across from each other while Thomas sat next to her, drinking a beer. \u201cIt was your great-grandmother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Thomas wrapped his arm around her shoulder, pretending to be interested. \u201cYeah, girls love that shit.\u201d</p><p>I opened the box and it was exactly what I thought. \u201cNot Ella... she\u2019s going to fucking flip if I show this to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha Scott, watch your language,\u201d she warned, waving her finger at me. \u201cAnd I think Ella loves you more than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she loves me.\u201d I snapped the box shut and shoved the box back in her direction. \u201cBut she\u2019s not going to like this.\u201d</p><p>She declined to take the box, crossing her legs as she leaned back into Thomas. \u201cI\u2019ve never told you the story of your great-grandmother, have I?\u201d</p><p>I sat the box down on the table and crossed my arms, slouching back into the chair and propping my boots up on the coffee table. \u201cNo, but I have a feeling you\u2019re about to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a wise child.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhenever my mom used to talk about her, she\u2019d refer to her as the lucky one in the family. I don\u2019t know if you know this or not, but I come from a long line of women whose hearts were broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t helping you with your point,\u201d I told her, and Thomas chuckled as he fidgeted with one of the ornaments on the tiny Christmas tree balanced on the end table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rolled her eyes and opened the box, so the ring was staring at me. \u201cThe point of the story isn\u2019t the women who didn\u2019t find love, but the one who did. Your great-grandmother Sherri, and my grandmother, was happily married for fifty-three years to a guy she met when she was a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit right now,\u201d I say, shaking my head. \u201cBut I have to give you props for making up the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a story, Micha Scott. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d She picked up the box from the coffee table and balanced it in the palm of her hand, urging me to take it. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who did. People envy you and Ella\u2014hell, I envy you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you were married to a douche bag for six years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you have isn\u2019t the same as your father and me. I barely knew him when I met him.\u201d</p><p>Giving up, I decided to tolerate her and took the box from her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, leaning back into Thomas, who whispered something in her ear. The longer I stared at the ring, the more my reservations crumbled. In the end, I had an idea.</p><p>As Ella and I lay in my bed with the lamp on, we cuddle close to each other because of the icy temperature. The neighbors\u2019 red and gold Christmas lights flash through the window and light up my room. Ella has on the Silverstein shirt without a bra on and her hair smells like vanilla mixed with smoke. I love the smell.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d She rolls onto her stomach and rests her chin on my chest, batting her eyelashes at me. \u201cYou\u2019re being really quiet.\u201d</p><p>I stare into her eyes, considering my next words carefully. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about giving you your Christmas present.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilts to the side. \u201cSince when do we do the Christmas present thing? We\u2019ve never done it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m thinking about starting a new tradition.\u201d With a deep inhale, I reach for the box on my nightstand and balance it on my chest right in front of her face. \u201cActually a few new traditions maybe.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes amplify as she quickly retreats and kneels on the bed. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>Collecting the box, I sit up. \u201cIt\u2019s what you think it is. However, before you go freaking out, let me get through my speech, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Her chest heaves as she breathes in and out. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shocked I even got an okay from her, so I swiftly push forward. \u201cSo, my mom told me this story about my great-grandma who apparently was, like, the only woman in the family lucky enough to ever find love.\u201d I pause, trying to pick up her vibe, but in the low light, her eyes look black and her face is barely a shadow.</p><p>I kneel in front of her, taking her hand, which trembles. \u201cShe also explained to me how lucky we are and that she kind of envies us.\u201d</p><p>She stifles a smile. \u201cYour mom envies a couple of teenagers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, tomorrow I\u2019m officially out of that category,\u201d I remind her in a light tone.</p><p>She swallows hard and her eyes flicker to the box in my hand. \u201cWhich means I should be giving you the presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you will,\u201d I assure her with a grin as I clutch the box tightly in my sweaty palm, struggling to hide my nervousness. \u201cBut tonight is about you and me and our future.\u201d Her lips open with an objection, but I talk over her and her eyes drift to the door. \u201cThe thing is, I knew when my mom suggested it that you aren\u2019t ready. I get you, Ella May, that much.\u201d I cup her cheek and compel her to look at me. \u201cLike how I know that right now you want to leave. Not because you don\u2019t love me, but because you\u2019re scared. Scared you can\u2019t do it. Scared you\u2019ll hurt me. Scared you\u2019ll actually be happy about what I\u2019m going to ask you.\u201d</p><p>She bites down on her bottom lip, looking torn, her eyes wide, her chest heaving with each unstable breath. \u201cSometimes I think you\u2019re a mind reader.\u201d</p> <p>I smile. \u201cI actually am. I just don\u2019t tell anyone because it would freak too many people out.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and sits down on the bed, settling my nerves a little. I sit in front of her and position the box between us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask you to marry me,\u201d I say and her eyebrows furrow as she raises her gaze from the box to me. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a proposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA proposition?\u201d she asks, confounded. \u201cWhat kind of a proposition?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m thoroughly enjoying myself now, knowing she\u2019s curious. I take her hand in mine and open her palm to set the box in it. \u201cI want you to wear it, not on your ring finger but on some other finger and then you can move it to your ring finger whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>She gapes at the box fearfully. \u201cAnd what happens when I move it? We just get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say simply. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the point.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze connects with mine, her pupils magnified. \u201cBut then we\u2019d be married\u2014like, really married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not happening right now, so calm down.\u201d I massage her hips to try and relax her. \u201cNow, are you going to open it, or stare at the box all day?\u201d</p><p>She stares at the box for what seems like an eternity and then tentatively flips the lid open. Her breath catches. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d she says and drops the box.</p><p>Trying not to laugh, I pick it up and remove the ring, holding it out to her. \u201cWhat do you say, pretty girl? Are you in or out?\u201d</p><p>I wait for what seems like forever and then she slips an unsteady finger through the band. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s on the ring finger of the wrong hand, which means we\u2019re not quite there. But one day we will be. And that\u2019s all I need at the moment.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Ella</p><p>I feel so strange the next day, in ways that are unexplainable. I have a ring on my finger, the diamond band twisted in knots that swirl up to a black stone in the center of glistening studs. It\u2019s actually the most perfect ring for me, not girly with a big flashy diamond on it, like a lot of girls want. It\u2019s dark, different, and has some scratches on the surface, like me.</p><p>The more I think about it, it\u2019s downright perfect.</p><p>I decide to wake him up with a nice birthday present for being the greatest person that has ever graced my life.</p><p>At the crack of dawn, when the sunlight is barely peeking through the curtain, I sneak out of bed and over to my house, which is soundless. Lila is fast asleep in my bed and I tiptoe to my closet. Searching through my old clothes, I find what I\u2019m looking for.</p><p>I remember when I wore it for Halloween. I was sixteen and decided to act like a girl for the night. Usually, I did something scary, but that year I put on a leather dress and some stilettoes that made me tower over almost everyone at Micha\u2019s party. My hair was done up and I had some bright red lipstick on. It had been a rough day at my house that day. My dad had wrecked the car and my mom had yelled at him for hours, so I was relieved to be leaving and getting a break.</p><p>When I showed up, the party had been in full mode. The music was cranked, people were wasted, girls were half naked, and furniture had been broken. Micha was talking to a girl with curly brown hair, wearing a dress equally as short as mine, but she had a lot more cleavage that nearly fell out of the top. He was dressed in a black T-shirt with a red skull on it and there were skulls all over his belt that held up his black jeans. He had sprayed black streaks in his hair and there were leather bands around his wrists.</p><p>They were in the kitchen next to the keg and I had walked up casually as if nothing was out of the ordinary.</p><p>\u201cYou know someone\u2019s broken your mom\u2019s ceramic plate, right?\u201d I told him reaching for a plastic up. \u201cOut on the back porch.\u201d</p><p>He was fully engulfed in the brunette. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll clean it up...\u201d When his eyes landed on me his voice trailed off and the brunette gave me a nasty look. His gaze skimmed my costume and he didn\u2019t look happy. \u201cWhat the fuck are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>I sipped my beer. \u201cA Halloween costume.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at me. \u201cWhat the hell are you supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA slut,\u201d I say, cutting a glance at the brunette. \u201cWhich seems to be a theme tonight.\u201d</p><p>She glared at me and then smiled sweetly at Micha. \u201cI\u2019m going to go dance. Do you want to join me?\u201d</p><p>He waved his hand at her dismissively. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk around like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I was thoroughly enjoying how upset he was over the dress. \u201cIt\u2019s how everyone else is dressed.\u201d</p><p>He leaned to the side and checked out my backside. \u201cYour ass is basically hanging out of it... and girls dress like that when they want to get fucked, so go home and change.\u201d</p><p>I started to get pissed. Knocking back the entire beer, I crumbled the cup and tossed it on the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a jealous boyfriend and it\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to protect you, Ella May,\u201d he retorted loudly over the music as I marched toward the living room where everyone was dancing. \u201cFrom all the other guys out there who are thinking the same dirty thoughts as I am.\u201d</p><p>For a brief moment, his words excited me, but I smothered the feeling. \u201cYou have no right to try and stop me from doing anything, when you do whatever you want and whoever you want all the time and I don\u2019t ever say a word.\u201d</p><p>He glared at me and I scowled back, before backing away into the crowd with my chin held up defiantly.</p><p>About an hour later, I was pretty drunk and dancing with some guy with brown hair and bloodshot eyes, who smelled like pot. He was cute, but I wasn\u2019t into him. Every time he tried to touch me, I inched out of his reach with panic soaring through me.</p><p>Finally, he grabbed my waist, digging his fingers into me roughly, and forced me to get closer to him. Anxiety had seized my throat as his fingers spread around his hips and I was just about to knee him in his special place when he was yanked away from me.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d Micha shoved him back, then clenched his hands into fists. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The guy stumbled into a few people, regained his footing, and came back at Micha with his fists out. But the threat in Micha\u2019s eyes made him rethink it and he shied away into the crowd.</p><p>When Micha aimed his gaze at me, I was thrown off by the intensity. \u201cGo into my room and lay down, before you end up doing something you\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I replied, hating to fight with him, but he was being possessive and it was getting on my nerves. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a controlling asshole.\u201d</p> <p>His expression softened and he offered his hand to me. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to protect you from stuff. You\u2019re drunk and you\u2019re dressed like...\u201d His eyes strayed up my body and then he shook his head, blinking his eyes. \u201cJust please come lie down with me.\u201d</p><p>I snatched hold of his hand and he steered me up in front of him to walk behind me with his hands on my hips. He didn\u2019t let go of me until we reached his room.</p><p>He shut the door and he sucked on his lip ring, appearing uneasy, which was very unlike him. \u201cDo you want one of my shirts to sleep in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting really, really weird.\u201d I sat down on the bed, unfastened the strap of my shoe, and wiggled my foot out, before starting on the other one. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you tonight? Did a girl blow you off or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never get upset over a girl, unless it\u2019s you.\u201d He released his lip ring from his teeth and began unclipping the bands on his wrists. \u201cI think I should be the one asking you what\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve never seen you dress like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I slipped my foot out of the shoe and turned around to climb into his bed. \u201cI just wanted to do something different.\u201d</p><p>I turned around to get under the covers and when I faced him again, he had an amused smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, pulling the blanket over me. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>He signaled for me to scoot over as he slipped his shirt off. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just can\u2019t believe you showed up wearing that.\u201d</p><p>Fuming, I rolled to my side and put my back to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s-his-face from the dance floor seemed to like it.\u201d</p><p>He got into bed with me, pressing his body closer to mine than he normal did. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it was a bad thing... it\u2019s just surprising. That\u2019s all.\u201d He placed a hand lightly on my hip and my stomach fluttered, which it had never done before.</p> <p>A loud breath escaped my lips and I winced. Sealing my lips shut, I crossed my fingers he hadn\u2019t heard it. He edged nearer, so his chest was touching my back and his warm breath feathered my skin.</p><p>\u201cElla?\u201d He sounded choked up.</p><p>It took me a second to compose myself enough to speak. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed drove me crazy.</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams,\u201d he finally said and kissed the back of my neck before rolling over.</p><p>Looking back at the memory now, I can\u2019t help but smile, realizing what was really going on.</p><p>Stuffing the dress and shoes into my bag, I hurry downstairs and run into Caroline in the kitchen. Her black hair is sticking up all over the place and she has a set of striped pajamas on. She pours herself a cup of coffee, yawning, and when she sees me, she smiles.</p><p>\u201cOh, I thought you were in bed,\u201d she says. \u201cAre you an early riser too?\u201d</p> <p>I swing the bag onto my shoulder. \u201cNot usually. This morning was just an exception.\u201d</p><p>She collects her cup of coffee and pulls out a chair at the table. \u201cDid you want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not.\u201d Setting the bag to the floor, I pour myself a cup and join her at the table, breathing in the steam. \u201cGod, I love caffeine.\u201d</p><p>She adds some milk to her coffee and takes a gulp. \u201cI\u2019d like to take some pictures of you and Micha later today, if you don\u2019t mind. I always take pictures around the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cI have to ask Micha, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be okay with it.\u201d</p><p>She gives a prolonged pause. \u201cI\u2019d like to take some of you, Dean, and your dad too.\u201d</p><p>My expression plummets as I lower my cup back to the table. \u201cWhat did Dean have to say about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d do it.\u201d She gets up to put the milk in the fridge. \u201cAs long as you two agreed to it.\u201d</p><p>I strain a smile. \u201cAlright, well, I guess that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>She returns to the table, appearing hesitant. \u201cDean\u2019s a little different than he used to be. I think anyway. I think his therapy sessions are really helping.\u201d She pauses to take a drink. \u201cYou know it took him forever to completely open up to me... about everything.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the cracks in the table, getting uncomfortable. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ella. I\u2019m not looking to talk about it,\u201d she says kindly. \u201cI just wanted to let you know that he\u2019s different and that maybe you could let him in a little more.\u201d</p><p>My gaze rises to her. \u201cI let him in as much as he wants me to let him in.\u201d</p><p>She gathers her empty cup and sets it in the sink. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, although he probably won\u2019t admit it. He doesn\u2019t really admit anything, unless you force him too\u2014he holds a lot in.\u201d</p><p>Confusion swarms my head. \u201cHe\u2019s always said whatever he thinks when he\u2019s around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he says things to push you away.\u201d She pats my arm and then heads for the doorway, the sunlight streaming in from the window to the side of her. \u201cBut that\u2019s something you two will need to talk about one day in the far future... when you\u2019re both ready. In fact, you know what you should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And I\u2019m not sure if I want to.</p><p>\u201cYou should come stay with us for the summer,\u201d she says, glancing over her shoulder at me. \u201cMaybe for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019d be a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod and she leaves the kitchen. After I finish my coffee, I grab my bag and head out the door and into the freezing cold, mulling over my future.</p><p>Micha</p><p>I\u2019m woken up to someone sucking on my neck and the scent of vanilla. I decide I might not open my eyes and just let Ella go to town.</p><p>\u201cRise and shine, birthday boy,\u201d she whispers in my ear as she nips at my lobe and her leg slides over me so she\u2019s straddling me.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I reply with my eyes shut, feeling the skin between her legs brush against my stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to suck on a lot more things to bring me out of this deep sleep.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and slants back. I open my eyes and I\u2019m instantly glad I did. She has on a short leather dress that barely covers up her body and high heels that match. Her auburn hair is done up with stray pieces hanging loosely around her face and her lips are stained red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that outfit before.\u201d My hands pursue her hips. \u201cIn fact, I remember that day very clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were so mad.\u201d She runs her finger through my hair. \u201cI thought you were going to punch that guy on the dance floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it took a lot not to,\u201d I assure her, pressing her down against my swollen cock. \u201cI was so pissed that he tried to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, though?\u201d she asks with curiosity. \u201cGuys had tried to hit on me before and you never did anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you usually beat me to the punch. But that night you acted like you were asking for it,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you know when you were climbing into bed, I got a full view of those naughty little panties you had on\u2014they barely covered anything.\u201d</p><p>Her lips part. \u201cIs that why you were smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah.\u201d I sneak my fingers up her dress and squeeze her firm ass. \u201cI got an eyeful and I was so turned on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She covers her mouth with her hand, shaking her head. \u201cThat\u2019s so embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019ve seen everything now. Hell, I\u2019ve been inside you.\u201d I jerk the top of her dress down, surprising her, and lure her breast down toward my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve kissed every single part of you.\u201d Taking her breast into my mouth, I roll my tongue along her nipple until she moans.</p><p>\u201cI had a plan,\u201d she says, breathless. \u201cI was going to...\u201d She trails off, whimpering as I suck with just enough force to drive her body crazy and she quivers against me.</p><p>Letting her go for a second, I slip her panties down her legs to her ankles. \u201cKeep the dress and the heels on.\u201d</p><p>A smile touches her lips as she kicks off her panties and gradually lowers herself onto me. I meet her halfway and push into her. Her breath hitches as her head falls back and some of her hair slips out, falling along her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMicha...\u201d she moans as I thrust into her again. \u201cOh my God...\u201d</p><p>I kiss her fiercely as my hands move down her bare shoulders, along the side of her leather dress, and rest at her hips where I grab tightly ahold of her. Our skin begins to dampen with sweat as our movements start to match each other\u2019s. When she cries out my name, with her eyes glistening, she loses it completely and I join her. Once we regain our breath, I kiss her jawline and incline away, slipping out of her. Circling my arms around her, I roll to the side, pull her close, and look into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBest birthday present ever,\u201d I say and gently kiss the palm of her hand, feeling the ring on her finger. \u201cI don\u2019t think any birthday will ever top this one.\u201d</p><p>She smiles contently. \u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d</p><p>I run my finger along the edge of the ring and it sends a rush of adrenaline through me, knowing she\u2019s close to being mine forever. \u201cNo, I know so.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s late in the afternoon when we finally get out of bed. Ella complains about being sore and it makes me proud.</p><p>She scowls at me when I tell her this as she puts her T-shirt on. \u201cSo what do you want to do for the rest of the day?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMake you sorer,\u201d I say, tugging a long-sleeve shirt over my head.</p><p>She sighs, letting her arms fall to her side. \u201cCan\u2019t I have just a tiny little break? Pretty please. Maybe just like an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I frown, disappointed, and search for something else to do. \u201cOkay, I know what I want to do.\u201d</p> <p>She wiggles into her jeans and does up the button. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I back for the door, scooping up a lighter my dad left behind when he bailed out on me. \u201cI want to burn all the stuff that ever reminded me of my dad.\u201d</p><p>I wait for her to lecture me, but she picks up her jacket and zips it. \u201cWe should probably do it in an open area, like the driveway,\u201d she says, unfazed. \u201cJust to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no one else in the world who can get me like you do, pretty girl.\u201d I take her hand and we head outside to build a fire.</p><p>The sun is actually out and shining down, but the air is still cold. Everything is concealed in frost and the driveway has been plowed.</p> <p>Ella hunts for the lighter fuel and some wood while I go into the garage and collect some things that belonged to my dad. When I return to the driveway, she has a small fire going and a relaxed look on her face as she stares at the flame with her head tilted to the side.</p><p>I start throwing things into the flames one by one, starting with an old work shirt that was left in the garage. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not going to talk to him again.\u201d</p><p>She takes the lighter and tosses it into the flames. \u201cBut what if he calls and really wants to be in your life again?\u201d</p><p>I chuck one of his old screwdrivers into the fire, even though it won\u2019t really burn. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to do a hell of a lot more than call.\u201d I take a deep breath and stare at the photo of my dad and me in front of his old Dodge Challenger parked in the garage. We used to work on it every day. It was our thing, until he bailed and took the car with him, and all that was left was an empty garage full of bullshit memories.</p><p>I crumple up the photo and toss it into the fire, watching it singe. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to earn it.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers grab mine and she squeezes my hand. \u201cGood, because he doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p> <p>With the next thing I try to add, she quickly tries to stop me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks, snatching ahold of my wrist to stop me from throwing the six-pack of beer into the fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting rid of my baggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha, I didn\u2019t say you had to stop drinking, just that you should stop trying to deal with your problems that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cBut right now, I think this is what we both need.\u201d</p><p>Looking into my eyes, she nods and lets go of my arm. I chuck the pack into the flames, which rush up toward the sky excitedly as the bottles break. As we stare at the blazing flame melting away at the snow, Ethan\u2019s truck pulls up and he and Lila hop out.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I so want to know what this is for,\u201d Lila says, stuffing her hands into her coat pockets, the glow of the fire reflecting in her wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re saying good-bye.\u201d I swing my arm around Ella\u2019s shoulder and draw her closer.</p> <p>\u201cGood-bye to what?\u201d Ethan asks, zipping up his coat and pulling the hood over his head.</p><p>Ella and I trade a secret glance.</p><p>\u201cTo the past,\u201d she says, and I smile, because that\u2019s exactly what it is.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Ella</p><p>The next few days are relaxing and filled with long drives and small conversations. Caroline takes her pictures of us out in the front yard. We all manage to smile in some of them, but it\u2019s much easier in the pictures of just Micha and me. When we\u2019re getting ready to leave to go back to our lives, she assures me that she\u2019ll send me copies.</p><p>Lila and Ethan returned back to Vegas the day before and Micha and I are taking the dinged-up Chevelle back home. Micha is waiting in the car while I say a quick good-bye to everyone. Dean gives me a halfhearted pat on the back and Caroline gives me a real hug, throwing me out of my comfort zone.</p><p>When she pulls back, my anxiety is pounding through my chest, but I mentally talk myself down and approach my dad, who\u2019s standing on the back porch with a heavy brown coat on. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to stay for a few extra days and help you get the house all set up. Or go with you to your first AA meeting?\u201d I don\u2019t really want to, but I worry he won\u2019t go if someone isn\u2019t watching him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he assures me, dragging his hand along the railing as he steps down from the top step. His hair is combed and his eyes have life in them. I\u2019m not sure how long it will take me to get used to his new look. Probably a while, since I can\u2019t remember him ever looking this healthy. \u201cCan we talk for a minute, though?\u201d</p><p>Perplexed, I nod and follow him out back. Frost glazes the entire yard as the sunlight sparkles down on it. He dithers in his thoughts for a while, staring at the garage as if it holds the answers to life.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that I meant what I said in that letter,\u201d he finally says with an uneasy tone. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just hard for me to express myself out loud.\u201d</p><p>I nod, understanding as I scrape my boots at the snow. \u201cI get it. I really do.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his hand across his face. \u201cWould you consider coming back here for spring break, just to visit, not to look after me or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you know the house is about to enter foreclosure, right?\u201d I ask nervously. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see any of the bills on the table?\u201d</p><p>He nods, raking his hands through his hair. \u201cI did and I might have to let it go. But the thing is, Ella, it\u2019s not for you to worry about. That\u2019s kinda what this is all about. You need to go live your life and I\u2019ll live mine. I\u2019m learning how to do that now.\u201d</p><p>The feeling makes me nervous, yet frees me at the same time. It\u2019s confusing and new, but so is everything really. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He hesitates and then opens his arms to give me a hug.</p><p>Scratching the back of my neck, I move in awkwardly for a hug and his arms wrap around me. Never can I remember him hugging me. Not once, even when I was a kid. It\u2019s weird and unnatural, but I\u2019m glad it happened. And when it\u2019s over, I wave good-bye and head for the driveway, letting go and moving on.</p><p>When I climb into the car, Micha grins at me, sets the iPod down in the console, and laces our fingers together. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>I nod as a smile breaks through. \u201cI\u2019m more than ready.\u201d</p><p>Returning my smile, he backs out of the driveway and onto the slush-covered road. As we drive away from our houses, I can feel myself moving forward toward the beginning of my own life.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Six months later</p><p>Ella</p><p>It\u2019s June and the Vegas heat is stifling even though I am wearing a tank top and short shorts. Lila and I stand underneath the shade of the carport at Micha and Ethan\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m going to miss you so much.\u201d Tears flood from Lila\u2019s eyes and she folds her arms around me, giving me a hug.</p><p>A lot of people have been doing that lately and I\u2019m getting used to it. Although sometimes it\u2019s just strange, like when Ethan hugged me. He was drunk, but still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you too.\u201d I hug her back the best I can and then we pull away. \u201cBut you\u2019ll see me in, like, a week when you and Ethan bring out the rest of the stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not the same. You won\u2019t be right across the hall.\u201d She dabs her eyes, wiping away the running mascara, and sniffles. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving me here alone, to go live in my hometown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always come back,\u201d I say, hopeful. \u201cI bet you could even talk Ethan into coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not a fucking pushover,\u201d Ethan calls out as he tosses the last box into the trunk of the Chevelle. \u201cAnd no girl is going to ever get me to up and change my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, we\u2019ll see,\u201d I state with an attitude I know is going to annoy him.</p><p>He makes a face as he slams the trunk and then leans against the door, folding his arms and staring out at a tree. His hair has grown out and he looks kind of scraggily and he\u2019s added three more tattoos to his collection.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sad his best friend\u2019s leaving him. And you,\u201d Lila whispers with a small smile and she fixes a strand of her blonde hair that\u2019s fallen out of a clip. \u201cHe admitted it to me last night when he was drunk.\u201d</p><p>We giggle quietly so we don\u2019t piss him off more.</p><p>Lila\u2019s expression turns serious as she taps the ring on my finger. \u201cOh yeah, and let me know when that changes fingers. In fact, I better be the first person you call when it does.\u201d</p><p>I smile at the idea, which is no longer scary but exciting. \u201cAlright, I promise I will, and let me know when you and Ethan finally hook up.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cNever going to happen.\u201d</p><p>We wait by the car silently until Micha trots down the stairs with the phone up to his ear. He has a on gray T-shirt and a pair of black jeans, and wisps of his blond hair dangle in aqua eyes.</p><p>As soon as we got back from winter break, he started talking to the music producer out in San Diego on the phone. At first it went nowhere, so he went on with his life, playing at The Hook Up and other places and working his job in construction. But then he got a call back. He took a leap of faith and went out there for a meeting. They loved him and I wasn\u2019t surprised when he said he was moving out there. Then he proceeded to tell me I was coming with him. I hid out in my apartment for about a day.</p><p>\u201cPretty girl,\u201d Micha had called out through my door. \u201cJust let me in so we can talk. You\u2019ve been in there for a while and you\u2019re starting to worry me.\u201d</p><p>I paced the floor with my hands on my hips, inhaling and exhaling. \u201cI\u2019m fine, but I can\u2019t talk about it yet.\u201d</p><p>There was a soft thud. \u201cWe already talked about this, remember? You knew it was coming.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stopped in the middle of my room and turned in a circle, looking for my phone. \u201cJust give me some time, okay.

As soon as I heard her pick up, I sputtered out, \u201cMicha wants me to move to San Diego with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow calm down, Ella,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew this may have been coming\u2014you\u2019ve been talking to me about it since you came back from Christmas break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sunk down onto my bed. \u201cBut now it\u2019s real. And real is scary sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut you can\u2019t run away from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could make a list,\u201d she suggested. \u201cOf the pros and cons and how you feel.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced at a notebook and pen on top of my dresser in the corner. \u201cThat\u2019s your advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my advice,\u201d she said, and someone talked in the background. \u201cI have to go, but make a list like I said and then call me later and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I sighed, hung up, and did what she told me to do. In the end, the list told me what I had known all along, but I was just too afraid to admit it aloud without some encouragement.</p><p>I applied for some jobs online in San Diego and we made a trip out there a couple weeks ago for job interviews. We picked out a one-bedroom apartment in a decent area. It\u2019s scary as hell, but with Micha by my side, I know I can handle it.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Micha asks as he approaches me with his hand extended.</p><p>My anxiety bubbles as I slip my hand into his. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ll be living together and I\u2019m interested how our story will go.</p> <p>Lila gives me another hug while Ethan and Micha give each other a guy pat on the back and pound fists. Micha and I get into the car and he turns the engine on as I balance a photo on the dashboard.</p><p>Caroline had sent the picture to me not long after Christmas. Micha and I had been standing beside each other out on the front porch and his head was turned toward me instead of at the camera. He had whispered a perverted comment into my ear and I had laughed right as Caroline snapped the shot. It was the perfect picture, because even though we weren\u2019t looking at the camera we were genuinely happy and we were making each other feel that way.</p><p>The backseat is full with bags and boxes, so Micha uses the side mirror to back out. I give a quick wave to Lila, who\u2019s sobbing and Ethan comes up and puts an arm around her.</p><p>Once we reach the exit, my phone rings and I answer it. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d Anna says. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure that you called that therapist number I gave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I have an appointment in a few weeks with her,\u201d I say, buckling my seatbelt. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make sure to go, just like I told you I would yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She pauses. \u201cAnd if you ever need anything, and I mean anything, don\u2019t hesitate to call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promise. \u201cAnd Anna, thank you for what you said the other day\u2014about me being a different girl than the one who first came in. I know I\u2019ve changed, but it\u2019s nice to hear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI only said the truth, Ella. You have changed and I think you\u2019ll do fine in life. You just need to remember that asking for help isn\u2019t a bad thing, so make sure to do it, because there will be times when you need it.\u201d</p><p>I smile at Micha, who\u2019s observing me with curiosity. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cRemember to have fun and don\u2019t worry so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I hang up and Micha threads his fingers through mine.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Micha asks, halting at a red light.</p><p>\u201cAnna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she have to say?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at the sunlight sparkling in the sky. \u201cThat she thinks I\u2019m going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>A few hours later, we pull over into a rest stop for a quick bathroom break and to get some snacks out of the trunk. We park along the turnout on a rocky cliff that overlooks a lake. Just a ways to the side, people are cliff-diving into the water. It\u2019s not very high and they look like they\u2019re having fun. While I\u2019m waiting on Micha, I inch over to the edge and peer down at the water rippling in the sunlight, remembering the bridge and how badly I wanted to jump that night.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Micha\u2019s worried voice abruptly rises over my shoulder and his hands grip my waist.</p><p>I stare at a woman as she summons up the courage to jump off the ledge. With her eyes shut and arms flying, she soars downward, free as can be. Seconds later she splashes into the water.</p><p>\u201cI think we should jump.\u201d When I meet Micha\u2019s eyes, he doesn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d He tugs me by the hand away from the cliff. \u201cWe need to hit the road.\u201d</p><p>I squirm from his hold, slip off my shoes, and put my hair up with an elastic band from around my wrist. \u201cCome on, it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d He stuffs his hands into his pockets and shakes his head. \u201cNot with this.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d He shrugs, kicking the tip of his boot at the dirt. \u201cThe idea of you jumping freaks the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>I take his hand and move closer to the cliff. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about letting go. I want to do this.\u201d</p><p>He wavers, glancing out at the shimmering lake. \u201cFine, you win. I\u2019ll do it, but only because I love you and have the hardest time saying no to you when you look at me like that.\u201d He shucks off his T-shirt, revealing his lean muscles and the tattoo on his rib cage. His unlaces his boots before slipping them off and then takes his wallet and change out of his pockets. \u201cBut you\u2019re holding my hand the entire time.\u201d</p><p>I grin, excited. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>We walk to the edge, hand in hand. The cliff is straight down with only a few jagged ledges, a doable fall, unlike the bridge back home.</p><p>He dithers, sucking his lip ring into his mouth, and then a smile creeps up on his face. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, shut my eyes, and whisper, \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He counts under his breath. \u201cOne... two... three.\u201d</p><p>We dive off the cliff, holding hands. The fall is brief, yet it feels like it lasts forever before we hit the water together. With his help, I break back through the surface of the water in an instant.</p><p>Panting loudly, I glance back up at the cliff, which doesn\u2019t seem as high. My clothes cling to my body and my chest feels weightless. \u201cThat was fun.\u201d</p><p>He laughs as he wipes droplets of water off his skin, his lips, his long eyelashes. His blond hair is slicked back as he runs his hand over his head. \u201cI\u2019m glad. Now can we swim back to shore and hit the road? I want to get there before dark.\u201d</p><p>I look into his liquid-blue eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? We could stay out here all day, floating around in the water, just you and me.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me close to him and paddles us backward toward the sandy shore nestled near the bottom of the cliff. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to do? Float in a lake all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just want to see if you\u2019ll do it for me.\u201d I hook my arms around his neck and fidget with the ring until it slips off my finger and into my palm, still deciding.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you ask me to anything, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d He kisses me and I suck the water off his lips. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a sucker for those sad-puppy eyes you give me every time you want something.\u201d</p><p>I move my hands away from his neck, fastening my legs around his waist to hold myself up. I still hesitate, but then finally I let all my reservations go. \u201cAnd now I want to give you something.\u201d</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow, confused until I lower the ring onto my other finger. It feels right, like it\u2019s belonged there forever. At first his expression is stoic and I worry he\u2019s changed his mind about marrying me.</p><p>\u201cI can take it off,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to put it on there yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it off?\u201d He gapes at me like I\u2019m crazy and brings me closer, so every inch of our wet bodies touch while he keeps us afloat by kicking his legs. \u201cWhy the hell would I ever want you do that? I never want you to take it off. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you look like you\u2019re upset or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shocked. I thought it was going to be years and years and years before you ever put that thing on your other finger.\u201d</p><p>A smile emerges at my lips. \u201cYou want me to keep it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want you to keep it on.\u201d Happiness fills his eyes, as blinding as the sunlight behind him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re never allowed to take it off.\u201d</p><p>I nod and he crashes his lips into mine, kissing me with everything he has and I return his passion equally as we kiss our first kiss of our forever. </p> </body></html>"]
