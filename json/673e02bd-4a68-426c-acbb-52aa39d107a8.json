Others\u2014and this she knew firsthand\u2014were battlefields, bloody and dark, littered with shrapnel and body parts.</p><p>She might only be seventeen, but Jolene Larsen already knew about war. She\u2019d grown up in the midst of a marriage gone bad.</p><p>Valentine\u2019s Day was the worst. The mood at home was always precarious, but on this day when the television ran ads for flowers and chocolates and red foil hearts, love became a weapon in her parents\u2019 careless hands. It started with their drinking, of course. Always. Glasses full of bourbon, refilled again and again. That was the beginning. Then came the screaming and the crying, the throwing of things. For years, Jolene had asked her mother why they didn\u2019t just leave him\u2014her father\u2014and steal away in the night. Her mother\u2019s answer was always the same: I can\u2019t. I love him. Sometimes she would cry as she said the terrible words, sometimes her bitterness would be palpable, but in the end it didn\u2019t matter how she sounded; what mattered was the tragic truth of her one-sided love.</p> <p>Downstairs, someone screamed.</p><p>That would be Mom.</p><p>Then came a crash\u2014something big had been thrown against the wall. A door slammed shut. That would be Dad.</p><p>He had left the house in a fury (was there any other way?), slamming the door shut behind him. He\u2019d be back tomorrow or the next day, whenever he ran out of money. He\u2019d come slinking into the kitchen, sober and remorseful, stinking of booze and cigarettes. Mom would rush to him, sobbing, and take him in her arms. Oh, Ralph ... you scared me ... I\u2019m sorry, give me one more chance, please, you know I love you so much ...</p><p>Jolene made her way through her steeply pitched bedroom, ducking so she wouldn\u2019t konk her head on one of the rough timbered support beams. There was only one light in here, a bulb that hung from the rafters like the last tooth in an old man\u2019s mouth, loose and unreliable.</p><p>She opened the door, listening.</p> <p>Was it over?</p><p>She crept down the narrow staircase, hearing the risers creak beneath her weight. She found her mother in the living room, sitting slumped on the sofa, a lit Camel cigarette dangling from her mouth. Ash rained downward, peppering her lap. Scattered across the floor were remnants of the fight: bottles and ashtrays and broken bits of glass.</p><p>Even a few years ago, Jolene would have tried to make her mother feel better. But too many nights like this had hardened her. Now she was impatient with all of it, wearied by the drama of her parents\u2019 marriage. Nothing ever changed, and Jolene was the one who had to clean up every mess. She picked her way through the broken pieces of glass and knelt at her mother\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cLet me have that,\u201d she said tiredly, taking the burning cigarette, putting it out in the ashtray on the floor beside her.</p><p>Mom looked up, sad-eyed, her cheeks streaked with tears. \u201cHow will I live without him?\u201d</p><p>As if in answer, the back door cracked open. Cold night air swept into the room, bringing with it the smell of rain and pine trees.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back!\u201d Mom pushed Jolene aside and ran for the kitchen.</p><p>I love you, baby, I\u2019m sorry, Jolene heard her mother say.</p> <p>Jolene righted herself slowly and turned. Her parents were locked in one of those movie embraces, the kind reserved for lovers reuniting after a war. Her mother clung to him desperately, grabbing the plaid wool of his shirt.</p><p>Her father swayed drunkenly, as if held up by her alone, but that was impossible. He was a huge man, tall and broad, with hands like turkey platters; Mom was as frail and white as an eggshell. It was from him that Jolene got her height.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave me,\u201d her mother sobbed, slurring the words.</p><p>Her father looked away. For a split second, Jolene saw the pain in his eyes\u2014pain, and worse, shame and loss and regret.</p><p>\u201cI need a drink,\u201d he said in a voice roughened by years of smoking unfiltered cigarettes.</p><p>He took her mother\u2019s hand, dragged her through the kitchen. Looking dazed but grinning foolishly, her mother stumbled along behind him, heedless of the fact that she was barefooted.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he opened the back door that Jolene got it. \u201cNo!\u201d she yelled, scrambling to her feet, running after them.</p><p>Outside, the February night was cold and dark. Rain hammered the roof and ran in rivulets over the edges of the eaves. Her father\u2019s leased logging truck, the only thing he really cared about, sat like some huge black insect in the driveway. She ran out onto the wooden porch, tripping over a chain saw, righting herself.</p><p>Her mother paused at the car\u2019s open passenger door, looked at her. Rain plastered the hair across her hollow cheeks, made her mascara run. She lifted a hand, pale and shaking, and waved.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the rain, Karen,\u201d her father yelled, and her mother complied instantly. In a second, both doors slammed shut. The car backed up, turned onto the road, drove away.</p><p>And Jolene was alone again.</p><p>Four months, she thought dully. Only four more months and she would graduate from high school and be able to leave home.</p><p>Home. Whatever that meant.</p><p>But what would she do? Where would she go? There was no money for college, and what money Jolene saved from work her parents invariably found and \u201cborrowed.\u201d She didn\u2019t even have enough for first month\u2019s rent.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she stood there, thinking, worrying, watching rain turn the driveway to mud; all she really knew was that at some point she became aware of an impossible, unearthly flash of color in the night.</p><p>Red. The color of blood and fire and loss.</p><p>When the police car pulled up into her yard, she wasn\u2019t surprised. What surprised her was how it felt, hearing that her parents were dead.</p><p>What surprised her was how hard she cried.</p><p>One</p><p>April 2005</p><p>On her forty-first birthday, as on every other day, Jolene Zarkades woke before the dawn. Careful not to disturb her sleeping husband, she climbed out of bed, dressed in her running clothes, pulled her long blond hair into a ponytail, and went outside.</p><p>It was a beautiful, blue-skied spring day. The plum trees that lined her driveway were in full bloom. Tiny pink blossoms floated across the green, green field. Across the street, the Sound was a deep and vibrant blue. The soaring, snow-covered Olympic mountains rose majestically into the sky.</p><p>Perfect visibility.</p><p>She ran along the beach road for exactly three and a half miles and then turned for home. By the time she returned to her driveway, she was red-faced and breathing hard. On her porch, she picked her way past the mismatched wood and wicker furniture and went into the house, where the rich, tantalizing scent of French roast coffee mingled with the acrid tinge of wood smoke.</p><p>The first thing she did was to turn on the TV in the kitchen; it was already set on CNN. As she poured her coffee, she waited impatiently for news on the Iraq war.</p><p>No heavy fighting was being reported this morning. No soldiers\u2014or friends\u2014had been killed in the night.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she said. Taking her coffee, she went upstairs, walking past her daughters\u2019 bedrooms and toward her own. It was still early. Maybe she would wake Michael with a long, slow kiss. An invitation.</p><p>How long had it been since they made love in the morning? How long since they\u2019d made love at all? She couldn\u2019t remember. Her birthday seemed a perfect day to change all that. She opened the door. \u201cMichael?\u201d</p><p>Their king-sized bed was empty. Unmade. Michael\u2019s black tee shirt\u2014the one he slept in\u2014lay in a rumpled heap on the floor. She picked it up and folded it in precise thirds and put it away. \u201cMichael?\u201d she said again, opening the bathroom door. Steam billowed out, clouded her view.</p><p>Everything was white\u2014tile, toilet, countertops. The glass shower door was open, revealing the empty tile interior. A damp towel had been thrown carelessly across the tub to dry. Moisture beaded the mirror above the sink.</p><p>He must be downstairs already, probably in his office. Or maybe he was planning a little birthday surprise. That was the kind of thing he used to do ...</p><p>After a quick shower, she brushed out her long wet hair, then twisted it into a knot at the base of her neck as she stared into the mirror. Her face\u2014like everything about her\u2014was strong and angular: she had high cheekbones and heavy brown brows that accentuated wide-set green eyes and a mouth that was just the slightest bit too big. Most women her age wore makeup and colored their hair, but Jolene didn\u2019t have time for any of that. She was fine with the ash-gold blond hair that darkened a shade or two every year and the small collection of lines that had begun to pleat the corners of her eyes.</p><p>She put on her flight suit and went to wake up the girls, but their rooms were empty, too.</p><p>They were already in the kitchen. Her twelve-year-old daughter, Betsy, was helping her four-year-old sister, Lulu, up to the table. Jolene kissed Lulu\u2019s plump pink cheek.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, Mom,\u201d they said together.</p><p>Jolene felt a sudden, burning love for these girls and her life. She knew how rare such moments were. How could she not, raised the way she\u2019d been? She turned to her daughters, smiling\u2014beaming, really. \u201cThanks, girls. It\u2019s a beautiful day to turn forty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so old,\u201d Lulu said. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re that old?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Jolene opened the fridge. \u201cWhere\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left already,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>Jolene turned. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Betsy said, watching her closely.</p><p>Jolene forced a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s probably planning a surprise for me after work. Well. I say we have a party after school. Just the three of us. With cake. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith cake!\u201d Lulu yelled, clapping her plump hands together.</p><p>Jolene could let herself be upset about Michael\u2019s forgetfulness, but what would be the point? Happiness was a choice she knew how to make. She chose not to think about the things that bothered her; that way, they disappeared. Besides, Michael\u2019s dedication to work was one of the things she admired most about him.</p><p>\u201cMommy, Mommy, play patty-cake!\u201d Lulu cried, bouncing in her seat.</p><p>Jolene looked down at her youngest. \u201cSomeone loves the word cake.\u201d</p><p>Lulu raised her hand. \u201cI do. Me!\u201d</p><p>Jolene sat down next to Lulu and held out her hands. Her daughter immediately smacked her palms against Jolene\u2019s. \u201cPatty-cake, patty-cake, baker\u2019s man, make me a...\u201d Jolene paused, watching Lulu\u2019s face light up with expectation.</p><p>\u201cPool!\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>\u201cMake me a pool as fast you can. Dig it and scrape it and fill it with blue, and I\u2019ll go swimming with my Lu-lu.\u201d Jolene gave her daughter one last pat of the hands and then got up to make breakfast. \u201cGo get dressed, Betsy. We leave in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Precisely on time, Jolene ushered the girls into the car. She drove Lulu to preschool, dropped her off with a fierce kiss, and then drove to the middle school, which sat on the knoll of a huge, grassy hillside. Pulling into the carpool lane, she slowed and came to a stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo not get out of the car,\u201d Betsy said sharply from the shadows of the backseat. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing your uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I don\u2019t get a pass on my birthday.\u201d Jolene glanced at her daughter in the rearview mirror. In the past few months, her lovable, sweet-tempered tomboy had morphed into this hormonal preteen for whom everything was a potential embarrassment\u2014especially a mom who was not sufficiently like the other moms. \u201cWednesday is career day,\u201d she reminded her.</p><p>Betsy groaned. \u201cDo you have to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour teacher invited me. I promise not to drool or spit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is so not funny. No one cool has a mom in the military. You won\u2019t wear your flight suit, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do, Betsy. I think you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Betsy grabbed up her heavy backpack\u2014not the right one, apparently; yesterday she\u2019d demanded a new one\u2014and climbed out of the car and rushed headlong toward the two girls standing beneath the flagpole. They were what mattered to Betsy these days, those girls, Sierra and Zoe. Betsy cared desperately about fitting in with them. Apparently, a mother who flew helicopters for the Army National Guard was tr\u00e8s embarrassing.</p><p>As Betsy approached her old friends, they pointedly ignored her, turning their backs on her in unison, like a school of fish darting away from danger.</p><p>Jolene tightened her grip on the steering wheel, cursing under her breath.</p> <p>Betsy looked crestfallen, embarrassed. Her shoulders fell, her chin dropped. She backed away quickly, as if to pretend she\u2019d never really run up to her once-best friends in the first place. Alone, she walked into the school building.</p><p>Jolene sat there so long someone honked at her. She felt her daughter\u2019s pain keenly. If there was one thing Jolene understood, it was rejection. Hadn\u2019t she waited forever for her own parents to love her? She had to teach Betsy to be strong, to choose happiness. No one could hurt you if you didn\u2019t let them. A good offense was the best defense.</p><p>Finally, she drove away. Bypassing the town\u2019s morning traffic, she took the back roads down to Liberty Bay. At the driveway next to her own, she turned in, drove up to the neighboring house\u2014a small white manufactured home tucked next to a car-repair shop\u2014and honked the horn.</p><p>Her best friend, Tami Flynn, came out of house, already dressed in her flight suit, with her long black hair coiled into a severe twist. Jolene would swear that not a single wrinkle creased the coffee-colored planes of Tami\u2019s broad face. Tami swore it was because of her Native American heritage.</p><p>Tami was the sister Jolene had never had. They\u2019d been teenagers when they met\u2014a pair of eighteen-year-old girls who had joined the army because they didn\u2019t know what else to do with their lives. Both had qualified for the high school to flight school helicopter-pilot training program.</p><p>A passion for flying had brought them together; a shared outlook on life had created a friendship so strong it never wavered. They\u2019d spent ten years in the army together and then moved over to the Guard when marriage\u2014and motherhood\u2014made active duty difficult. Four years after Jolene and Michael moved into the house on Liberty Bay, Tami and Carl had bought the land next door.</p> <p>Tami and Jolene had even gotten pregnant at the same time, sharing that magical nine months, holding each other\u2019s fears in tender hands. Their husbands had nothing in common, so they hadn\u2019t become one of those best friends who traveled together with their families, but that was okay with Jolene. What mattered most was that she and Tami were always there for each other. And they were.</p><p>I\u2019ve got your six literally meant that a helicopter was behind you, flying in the six o\u2019clock position. What it really meant was I\u2019m here for you. I\u2019ve got your back. That was what Jolene had found in the army, and in the Guard, and in Tami. I\u2019ve got your six.</p><p>The Guard had given them the best of both worlds\u2014they got to be full-time moms who still served their country and stayed in the military and flew helicopters. They flew together at least two mornings a week, as well as during their drill weekends. It was the best part-time job on the planet.</p><p>Tami climbed into the passenger seat and slammed the door shut. \u201cHappy birthday, flygirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Jolene grinned. \u201cMy day, my music.\u201d She cranked up the volume on the CD player and Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain\u201d blared through the speakers.</p><p>They talked all the way to Tacoma, about everything and nothing; when they weren\u2019t talking, they were singing the songs of their youth\u2014Prince, Madonna, Michael Jackson. They passed Camp Murray, home to the Guard, and drove onto Fort Lewis, where the Guard\u2019s aircraft were housed.</p><p>In the locker room, Jolene retrieved the heavy flight bag full of survival equipment. Slinging it over her shoulder, she followed Tami to the desk, confirmed her additional flight-training period, or AFTP; signed up to be paid; and then headed out to the tarmac, putting on her helmet as she walked.</p><p>The crew was already there, readying the Black Hawk for flight. The helicopter looked like a huge bird of prey against the clear blue sky. She nodded to the crew chief, did a quick preflight check of her aircraft, conducted a crew briefing, and then climbed into the left side of the cockpit and took her seat. Tami climbed into the right seat and put on her helmet.</p> <p>\u201cOverhead switches and circuit breakers, check,\u201d Jolene said, powering up the helicopter. The engines roared to life; the huge rotor blades began to move, slowly at first and then rotating fast, with a high-pitched whine.</p><p>\u201cGuard ops. Raptor eight-nine, log us off,\u201d Jolene said into her mic. Then she switched frequencies. \u201cTower. Raptor eight-nine, ready for departure.\u201d</p><p>She began the exquisite balancing act it took to get a helicopter airborne. The aircraft climbed slowly into the air. She worked the controls expertly\u2014her hands and feet in constant motion. They rose into the blue and cloudless sky, where heaven was all around her. Far below, the flowering trees were a spectacular palette of color. A rush of pure adrenaline coursed through her. God, she loved it up here.</p><p>\u201cI hear it\u2019s your birthday, Chief,\u201d said the crew chief, through the comm.</p><p>\u201cDamn right it is,\u201d Tami said, grinning. \u201cWhy do you think she has the controls?\u201d</p><p>Jolene grinned at her best friend, loving this feeling, needing it like she needed air to breathe. She didn\u2019t care about getting older or getting wrinkles or slowing down. \u201cForty-one. I can\u2019t think of a better way to spend it.\u201d</p><p>The small town of Poulsbo, Washington, sat like a pretty little girl along the shores of Liberty Bay. The original settlers had chosen this area because it reminded them of their Nordic homeland, with its cool blue waters, soaring mountains, and lush green hillsides. Years later, those same founding fathers had begun to build their shops along Front Street, embellishing them with Scandinavian touches. There were cutwork rooflines and scrolled decorations everywhere.</p><p>According to Zarkades family legend, the decorations had spoken to Michael\u2019s mother instantly, who swore that once she walked down Front Street, she knew where she wanted to live. Dozens of quaint stores\u2014including the one his mother owned\u2014sold beautiful, handcrafted knickknacks to tourists.</p><p>It was less than ten miles from downtown Seattle, as a crow flew, although those few miles created a pain-in-the-ass commute. Sometime in the past few years, Michael had stopped seeing the Norwegian cuteness of the town and began to notice instead the long and winding drive from his house to the ferry terminal on Bainbridge Island and the stop-and-go midweek traffic.</p><p>There were two routes from Poulsbo to Seattle\u2014over land and over water. The drive took two hours. The ferry ride was a thirty-five-minute crossing from the shores of Bainbridge Island to the terminal on Seattle\u2019s wharf.</p><p>The problem with the ferry was the wait time. To drive your car onboard, you had to be in line early. In the summer, he often rode his bike to work; on rainy days like today\u2014which were so plentiful in the Northwest\u2014he drove. And this had been an especially long winter and a wet spring. Day after gray day, he sat in his Lexus in the parking lot, watching daylight crawl along the wavy surface of the Sound. Then he drove aboard, parked in the bowels of the boat, and went upstairs.</p><p>Today, Michael sat on the port side of the boat at a small formica table, with his work spread out in front of him; the Woerner deposition. Post-it notes ran like yellow piano keys along the edges, each one highlighting a statement of questionable veracity made by his client.</p><p>Lies. Michael sighed at the thought of undoing the damage. His idealism, once so shiny and bright, had been dulled by years of defending the guilty.</p><p>In the past, he would have talked to his dad about it, and his father would have put it all in perspective, reminding Michael that their job made a difference.</p><p>We are the last bastion, Michael, you know that\u2014the champions of freedom. Don\u2019t let the bad guys break you. We protect the innocent by protecting the guilty. That\u2019s how it works.</p><p>I could use a few more innocents, Dad.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t we all? We\u2019re all waiting for it ... that case, the one that matters. We know, more than most, how it feels to save someone\u2019s life. To make a difference. That\u2019s what we do, Michael. Don\u2019t lose the faith.</p><p>He looked at the empty seat across from him.</p><p>It had been eleven months now that he\u2019d ridden to work alone. One day his father had been beside him, hale and hearty and talking about the law he loved, and then he\u2019d been sick. Dying.</p><p>He and his father had been partners for almost twenty years, working side by side, and losing him had shaken Michael deeply. He grieved for the time they\u2019d lost; most of all, he felt alone in a way that was new. The loss made him look at his own life, too, and he didn\u2019t like what he saw.</p><p>Until his father\u2019s death, Michael had always felt lucky, happy; now, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He wanted to talk to someone about all this, share his loss. But with whom? He couldn\u2019t talk to his wife about it. Not Jolene, who believed that happiness was a choice to be made and a smile was a frown turned upside down. Her turbulent, ugly childhood had left her impatient with people who couldn\u2019t choose to be happy. Lately, it got on his nerves, all her buoyant it-will-get-better platitudes. Because she\u2019d lost her parents, she thought she understood grief, but she had no idea how it felt to be drowning. How could she? She was Teflon strong.</p><p>He tapped his pen on the table and glanced out the window. The Sound was gunmetal gray today, desolate looking, mysterious. A seagull floated past on a current of invisible air, seemingly in suspended animation.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have given in to Jolene, all those years ago, when she\u2019d begged for the house on Liberty Bay. He\u2019d told her he didn\u2019t want to live so far from the city\u2014or that close to his parents, but in the end he\u2019d given in, swayed by her pretty pleas and the solid argument that they\u2019d need his mother\u2019s help in babysitting. But if he hadn\u2019t given in, if he hadn\u2019t lost the where-we-live argument, he wouldn\u2019t be sitting here on the ferry every day, missing the man who used to meet him here ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the ferry slowed, Michael got up and collected his papers, putting the deposition back in the black lambskin briefcase. He hadn\u2019t even looked at it. Merging into the crowd, he made his way down the stairs to the car deck. In minutes, he was driving off the ferry and pulling up to the Smith Tower, once the tallest building west of New York and now an aging, gothic footnote to a city on the rise.</p><p>At Zarkades, Antham, and Zarkades, on the ninth floor, everything was old\u2014floors, windows in need of repair, too many layers of paint\u2014but, like the building itself, there was history here, and beauty. A wall of windows overlooked Elliott Bay and the great orange cranes that loaded containers onto tankers. Some of the biggest and most important criminal trials in the past twenty years had been defended by Theo Zarkades, from these very offices. At gatherings of the bar association, other lawyers still spoke of his father\u2019s ability to persuade a jury with something close to awe.</p><p>\u201cHey, Michael,\u201d the receptionist said, smiling up at him.</p><p>He waved and kept walking, past the earnest paralegals, tired legal secretaries, and ambitious young associates. Everyone smiled at him, and he smiled back. At the corner office\u2014previously his father\u2019s and now his\u2014he stopped to talk to his secretary. \u201cGood morning, Ann.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Michael. Bill Antham wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Tell him I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He went into his office, the largest one in the firm. A huge window looked out over Elliott Bay; that was really the star of the room, the view. Other than that, the office was ordinary\u2014bookcases filled with law books, a wooden floor scarred by decades of wear, a pair of overstuffed chairs, a black suede sofa. A single family photo sat next to his computer, the only personal touch in the space.</p> <p>He tossed his briefcase onto the desk and went to the window, staring out at the city his father had loved. In the glass, he saw a ghostly image of himself\u2014wavy black hair, strong, squared jaw, dark eyes. The image of his father as a younger man. But had his father ever felt so tired and drained?</p><p>Behind him, there was a knock, and then the door opened. In walked Bill Antham, the only other partner in the firm, once his father\u2019s best friend. In the months since Dad\u2019s death, Bill had aged, too. Maybe they all had.</p><p>\u201cHey, Michael,\u201d he said, limping forward, reminding Michael with each step that he was well past retirement age. In the last year, he\u2019d gotten two new knees.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, Bill,\u201d Michael said, indicating the chair closest to the desk.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He sat down. \u201cI need a favor.\u201d</p><p>Michael returned to his desk. \u201cSure, Bill. What can I do for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was in court yesterday, and I got tapped by Judge Runyon.\u201d</p><p>Michael sighed and sat down. It was common for criminal defense attorneys to be assigned cases by the court\u2014it was the old if you require an attorney and cannot afford one bit. Judges often assigned a case to whatever lawyer happened to be there when it came up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man killed his wife. Allegedly. He barricaded himself in his house and shot her in the head. SWAT team dragged him out before he could kill himself. TV filmed a bunch of it.\u201d</p><p>A guilty client who had been caught on TV. Perfect. \u201cAnd you want me to handle the case for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask ... but Nancy and I are leaving for Mexico in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Michael said. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Bill\u2019s gaze moved around the room. \u201cI still expect to find him in here,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Michael said.</p> <p>They looked at each other for a moment, both remembering the man who had made such an impact on their lives. Then Bill stood, thanked Michael again, and left.</p><p>After that, Michael dove into his work, letting it consume him. He spent hours buried in depositions and police reports and briefs. He had always had a strong work ethic and an even stronger sense of duty. In the rising tide of grief, work had become his life ring.</p><p>At three o\u2019clock, Ann buzzed him on the intercom. \u201cMichael? Jolene is on line one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did remember that it\u2019s her birthday today, right?\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He pushed back from his desk and grabbed the phone. \u201cHey, Jo. Happy birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t scold him for forgetting, although she knew he had. Jolene had the tightest grip on her emotions of anyone he\u2019d ever seen, and she never ever let herself get mad. He sometimes wondered if a good fight would help their marriage, but it took two to fight. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you. How about dinner at that place above the marina? The new place?\u201d</p><p>Before she could offer some resistance (which she always did if something wasn\u2019t her idea), he said, \u201cBetsy is old enough to watch Lulu for two hours. We\u2019ll only be a mile away from home.\u201d</p><p>It was an argument that had been going on for almost a year now. Michael thought a twelve-year-old could babysit; Jolene disagreed. As with everything in their life, Jolene\u2019s vote was the one that counted. He was used to it ... and sick of it.</p><p>\u201cI know how busy you are with the Woerner case,\u201d she said. \u201cHow about if I feed the girls early and settle them upstairs with a movie and then make us a nice dinner? Or I could pick up takeout from the bistro; we love their food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat matters is that we\u2019re together,\u201d she said easily.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI\u2019ll be home by eight.\u201d</p><p>Before he hung up the phone, he was thinking of something else.</p><p>Two</p><p>That evening, Jolene chose her clothes carefully. She and Michael hadn\u2019t had dinner alone, just the two of them, in forever, and she wanted this evening to be perfect. Romantic. After feeding the girls, she bathed in scented water, shaved, slathered her skin with a citrus-scented lotion, and then slipped into a pair of comfortable jeans and a black boatnecked sweater.</p><p>Downstairs, she found Betsy seated at the coffee table, doing homework, while Lulu was on the sofa, wrapped up in her favorite yellow \u201cblankee,\u201d watching The Little Mermaid. The remnants of their impromptu birthday party were still on the dining room table\u2014the cake, with its candle holes; the pink journal Betsy had given Jolene; the sparkly barrette that had been Lulu\u2019s gift; and a pile of wrinkled paper and discarded bows.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the boss of me,\u201d Lulu said when Jolene walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cTell her to shut up, Mom. I\u2019m trying to do homework,\u201d Betsy responded. \u201cShe\u2019s singing too loud.\u201d</p><p>And it started. Their voices climbed up and over each other, rising in volume.</p><p>\u201cShe is not the boss of me,\u201d Lulu said again, more adamantly. \u201cTell her.\u201d</p><p>Betsy rolled her eyes and left the room, stomping up the stairs.</p><p>Jolene felt a wave of exhaustion. She hadn\u2019t known how tiring it could be to parent a preteen. How much eye rolling could one girl do? If Jolene had tried that, her father would have smacked her across the room.</p><p>Lulu ran over to the toy box in the corner of the room and rummaged around inside it. Finding the kitten-ears headband that had been a part of last year\u2019s Halloween costume, she put it on and turned around.</p><p>Jolene couldn\u2019t help smiling. There stood her four-year-old daughter, wearing gray cat ears that were beginning to look worn in places, with her hands on her hips. The sharp little gray triangles framed Lulu\u2019s flushed face and made her look even more elfin than usual. For no reason that anyone could explain, Lulu thought she was invisible when she wore the headband. She made a mewing sound.</p><p>Jolene frowned dramatically and looked around. \u201cOh, no ... what happened to my Lucy Lou? Where did she go?\u201d She made a great show of looking around the room, behind the television, under the overstuffed yellow chair, behind the door.</p><p>\u201cHere I am, Mommy!\u201d Lulu said with a flourish, giggling.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Jolene said with a sigh. \u201cI was worried.\u201d She picked up Lulu and carried her upstairs. It took Lulu forever to brush her teeth and get into her pajamas, and Jolene waited patiently, knowing her youngest had a strong independent streak. When Lulu was finally ready, Jolene climbed into bed beside her, pulled her close, and reached for Where the Wild Things Are. By the time she said, \u201cthe end,\u201d Lulu was almost asleep.</p><p>She kissed Lulu\u2019s cheek. \u201c\u2019Night, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Mommy,\u201d Lulu murmured sleepily.</p><p>Then Jolene walked down the hall to Betsy\u2019s room, knocked, and went inside.</p><p>Betsy was sitting up in bed, with her social studies book open in her lap. Her corn silk blond hair fell in fusilli curls along her bare, skinny arms. Someday Betsy would prize her porcelain skin and blond hair and brown eyes, but not now, when straight hair was all the rage and pimples had ruined her complexion.</p><p>Jolene went to her daughter\u2019s bed and sat down on the edge. \u201cYou could be nicer to your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d Jolene saw how Betsy\u2019s eyes widened, and she smiled gently. \u201cAnd so am I. Families are like that. And besides, I know what this is really about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw how Sierra and Zoe treated you this morning at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always spying on me,\u201d she said, but her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cI watched you walk into school. That\u2019s hardly spying. You three were best friends last year. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said mulishly, pressing her lips together, hiding her braces.</p><p>\u201cI can help, you know. I was twelve once, too.\u201d</p><p>Betsy gave her the you-must-be-crazy look that had become familiar in the last year. \u201cDoubtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should hang out with Seth after school tomorrow. Remember how much fun you used to have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2019s weird. Everyone thinks so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth Andrea, don\u2019t you dare act like a mean girl. Seth Flynn is not weird. He\u2019s my best friend\u2019s son. So what if he likes to wear his hair long and if he\u2019s ... quiet. He\u2019s your friend. You should remember that. You might need him one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. She\u2019d seen this movie before; no matter how often she asked, Betsy wouldn\u2019t say anything more. Whatever meant the end. \u201cOkay.\u201d She leaned forward and kissed Betsy\u2019s forehead. \u201cI love you to the moon and back.\u201d</p><p>The words were the slogan of this family, their love distilled into a single sentence. Say it back to me, Bets.</p><p>Jolene waited a moment longer than she intended and was immediately mad at herself for hoping. Again. Motherhood in the preteen years was a series of paper-cut disappointments. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said at last, standing up.</p><p>\u201cHow come Dad\u2019s not home yet? It\u2019s your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here any minute. You know how busy he is these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he come up to say good night to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Betsy nodded and went back to reading. When Jolene was to the door, she said, \u201cHappy birthday, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Jolene smiled. \u201cThanks, Bets. And I love the journal you gave me. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Betsy actually smiled.</p><p>Downstairs, Jolene went into the kitchen and put the last of the dishes away. Her dinner\u2014a rich, savory pot of beef short ribs braised in red wine and garlic and thyme\u2014bubbled softly on the stove, scenting the whole house. The girls hadn\u2019t loved it, but it was Michael\u2019s favorite.</p> <p>Wrapping a soft pink blanket around her shoulders, she poured herself a glass of soda water and went outside. She sat down in one of the worn bent-twig chairs on the porch and put her bare feet on the weathered coffee table, staring out at the familiar view.</p><p>Home.</p><p>It had begun with meeting Michael.</p><p>She remembered it all so clearly.</p><p>For days after her parents\u2019 deaths, she had waited for someone to help her. Police, counselors, teachers. It hadn\u2019t taken long for her to realize that in her parents\u2019 deaths, as in their lives, she was on her own. On a snowy Wednesday morning, she\u2019d wakened early, ignoring the cold that seeped through the thin walls of her bedroom, and dressed in her best clothes\u2014a plaid woolen skirt, Shetland sweater, kneesocks, and penny loafers. A wide blue headband kept the hair out of her eyes.</p> <p>She took the last of her babysitting money and set off for downtown Seattle. At the legal-aid office, she\u2019d met Michael.</p><p>His dark good looks and easy smile had literally taken her breath away. She\u2019d followed him to a shabby little office and told him her problem. \u201cI\u2019m seventeen\u2014eighteen in two months. My parents died this week. Car accident. A social worker came by and said I would have to live with foster parents until I turned eighteen. But I don\u2019t need anyone. Certainly not some fake family. I can live in my own house until June\u2014that\u2019s when the bank is repossessing it\u2014and then I\u2019ll be done with high school and I can do ... whatever. Can you make it so I don\u2019t need to go to a foster family?\u201d</p><p>Michael had studied her closely, his eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019d be alone then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am alone. It\u2019s a fact, not a choice.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d finally said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you, Jolene,\u201d she\u2019d wanted to cry.</p><p>In the next hour, she\u2019d told him a tidied-up version of her life. He\u2019d said something about attorney-client privilege and how she could tell him anything, but she knew better. She\u2019d learned a long time ago to keep the truth secret. When people knew she\u2019d grown up with alcoholic parents, they invariably felt sorry for her. She hated that, hated to be pitied.</p> <p>When they were done and the paperwork was filled out, Michael had said, \u201cCome back and see me in a few years, Jolene. I\u2019ll take you out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>It had taken her six years to find her way back to him. By then, she\u2019d been a pilot in the army and he\u2019d been a lawyer in partnership with his father, and they\u2019d had almost nothing in common. But she\u2019d seen something in him that first day, an idealism that spoke deeply to her and a sense of morality that matched her own. Like her, Michael was a hard worker and had a keen sense of duty. True to his word, Michael had taken her out to dinner ... and that had been the beginning.</p><p>She smiled at the memory.</p><p>In the distance, lights came on along the shore, golden dots that indicated houses in the darkness. Gauzy clouds wafted across the moon; in their absence, it shone more brightly. It was full night now, and dark. She glanced at her watch. Eight thirty.</p><p>She felt a pinch of disappointment and pushed it away. Something important must have come up. Life was like that sometimes. Things were rarely perfect. He would show up.</p><p>But ...</p><p>Lately, it seemed that their differences were more pronounced than the things they shared. Michael had always hated her commitment to the military. She\u2019d left active duty for him and gone into the Guard instead, but that hadn\u2019t been good enough for Michael. He didn\u2019t want to hear about her flying or her drill weekends or her friends who served. He\u2019d always been antimilitary, but since the war in Iraq had started, his opinions had grown stronger, more negative. Their once-companionable silences had become awkward. It was pretty lonely when you couldn\u2019t talk to your husband about the things that mattered to you. Normally, she looked away from these truths, but tonight they were all that occupied the chair beside her.</p><p>She got up and went back inside.</p> <p>8:50.</p><p>She opened the heavy yellow pot lid and stared into the meal she\u2019d made. The rich sauce had reduced too far; it looked a little black around the edges. Behind her, the phone rang. She lunged for it. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jo. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate was an hour ago, Michael. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What can I say? I got into work and forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot,\u201d she said, wishing it didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>She almost said how? but what was the point? Why make it worse? He hadn\u2019t meant to hurt her feelings. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to get home quickly, but...\u201d</p><p>Jolene was glad they were on the phone; at least she didn\u2019t have to smile. The thought came to her that he hadn\u2019t been trying hard enough lately, that his family\u2014and his wife\u2014seemed not to matter to him. And yet she still loved him as deeply as the day he\u2019d first kissed her, all those years ago.</p><p>Time, she thought. It will be okay next week or next month. He was still grieving over the loss of his father. She just needed to be understanding.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She hung up the phone and sat down at the kitchen table. In the shadowy room, decorated with her family photos and mementos and the furniture she had salvaged and restored herself, she felt alone suddenly. All dressed up, sitting in this darkened room. Lonely.</p><p>Then there was a knock at the door. Before Jolene even stood up, the kitchen door opened. Tami walked into the house, holding a bottle of champagne. \u201cYou\u2019re alone,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe got caught up at work,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d Sadness passed through Tami\u2019s eyes, and Jolene hated how it made her feel. Then Tami smiled. \u201cWell. It\u2019s no good to turn forty-one without an audience,\u201d she said, kicking the door shut behind her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m dying to know if you\u2019ll start wrinkling up right in front of me, like Gary Oldman in Dracula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not going to start wrinkling up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChampagne?\u201d Jolene said, arching one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for me. I don\u2019t have alcoholic parents. You can guzzle soda water, as usual.\u201d</p><p>Tami popped the champagne bottle effortlessly, poured herself a glass and headed into the family room, where she plopped down on the overstuffed sofa and raised a glass. \u201cTo you, my rapidly aging best friend.\u201d</p><p>Jolene followed Tami into the family room. \u201cYou\u2019re only a few months younger than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe Native Americans don\u2019t age. It\u2019s a scientific fact. Look at my mom. She still gets carded.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sat down in an overstuffed chair and curled her bare feet up underneath her.</p><p>They looked at each other. What swirled between them then, floating like champagne bubbles, were memories of other nights like this, meals Michael had missed, events he\u2019d been too busy to attend. Jolene often told people, especially Tami, how proud she was of her brilliant, successful husband, and it was all true, but lately he seemed unhappy. His father\u2019s death had capsized him. She knew how unhappy he was, she just didn\u2019t know how to help.</p><p>\u201cIt must hurt your feelings,\u201d Tami said.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d Jolene said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to him about it, tell him how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? Why make him feel worse than he already does? Shit happens, Tami. You know Michael\u2019s work ethic. It\u2019s one of the things I love about him. He never walks away from responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless it\u2019s a family obligation,\u201d Tami said softly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just really busy right now. Since his father\u2019s death...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Tami said, \u201cand you two don\u2019t talk about that, either. In fact, you don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talk.\u201d</p><p>Tami gave her an assessing look. \u201cMarriages go through hard times. Sometimes you have to get in there and fight for your love. That\u2019s the only way for it to get better.\u201d</p><p>Jolene couldn\u2019t help thinking of her parents, and the way her mother had fought for a man\u2019s love ... and never gotten it. \u201cLook, Tami. Michael and I are fine. We love each other. Now, can we please, please talk about something else?\u201d</p><p>Tami lifted her half-full glass. \u201cTo you, my friend. You look fabulous for being so freakishly old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look fabulous, period.\u201d</p><p>Tami laughed at that and launched into a funny story about her family.</p><p>It was ten forty before they knew it, and Tami put her empty glass down on the table. \u201cI have to get home. I told Carl I\u2019d be home for Letterman.\u201d</p><p>Jolene got to her feet. \u201cThanks for coming, Tam. I needed it.\u201d</p><p>Tami hugged her fiercely. Together, they walked to the back door.</p><p>Jolene watched her friend cut across the driveway and head toward the adjoining property. At last, she closed the door.</p><p>In the quiet, she was alone with her thoughts, and she didn\u2019t like their company.</p><p>It was midnight when Michael pulled into the garage and parked next to Jolene\u2019s SUV. On the seat beside him lay a dozen pink roses bound in cellophane. He\u2019d been on the ferry, already on his way home, when he remembered that Jolene preferred red roses. Of course. Soft and girly wasn\u2019t her style, never had been, not even on that first, sad day when she walked into his life.</p><p>She\u2019d been seventeen. A kid, dressed in thrift-store clothes, with her long blond hair a mess and her beautiful green eyes puffy from crying, and yet, with all of that, she\u2019d walked into the legal-aid office with her back straight, clutching a ratty vinyl purse. He\u2019d been an intern then, in his first year of law school.</p><p>She had seemed impossibly brave to him, a girl refusing help even in the worst days of her life. He\u2019d fallen a little in love with her right then, enough to ask her to come back and see him when she was older. It had been her boldness that spoke to him from the beginning, the courage she\u2019d worn as easily as that cheap acrylic sweater.</p><p>Six years later she\u2019d walked back into his life, an army helicopter pilot, of all things. He\u2019d been young enough to still believe in love at first sight and old enough to know it didn\u2019t happen every day. He\u2019d told himself it didn\u2019t matter that he was blue state and she was military, that they had nothing in common. He\u2019d felt so loved by her, so adored, that he couldn\u2019t breathe. And their lovemaking had been amazing. In sex, as in everything, Jo had been all in.</p><p>He picked up the roses and the small Tiffany\u2019s box beside it, wondering if the expensive gift would redeem him. She would see that he\u2019d bought it before\u2014that he\u2019d remembered her birthday in time to have her gift engraved\u2014but would that be enough? He\u2019d missed her birthday dinner\u2014forgotten. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It exhausted him, just thinking of the scene that was coming. He would use his charm to make her smile, beg for her forgiveness, and she would grant it with a grace and ease that would make short work of the whole thing, but he would see the hurt in her green eyes, in the way her smile wouldn\u2019t quite bloom, and he would know that he\u2019d disappointed her again. He was the bad guy here; there was no doubt about that, and she would remind him of it in a million tiny ways until he could hardly look at her, until he rolled away from her in bed and stared at the wall and imagined a different life.</p><p>He got out of the car and went into the house. In the shadowy kitchen, he found a vase and put the roses in it, then carried them up the stairs.</p><p>The master bedroom lights were off except for a small, decorative lamp on the desk by the window. He set the flowers on the antique dresser and went into the bathroom, where he undressed and got ready for bed. Climbing in, he pulled the heavy down comforter up to his chest and lay there in the dark.</p><p>It used to soothe him, listening to his wife\u2019s breathing, but now every sound she made kept him awake.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and hoped for the best, knowing before he even tried that it would be hours before he fell asleep and that, once found, his slumber would be haphazard at best, plagued by dreams of a life unlived, a path unchosen.</p><p>When he woke, hours later, he felt as if he hadn\u2019t slept at all. Watery light came through the windowpanes, making the sage-colored walls look gray as driftwood. The dark wood floors swallowed whatever sunlight came their way.</p><p>He pushed up to his elbows, felt the coverlet fall away from his chest.</p><p>Jolene lay awake beside him, her blond hair tangled to one side, her pale face turned slightly toward him.</p><p>The hurt was already in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jo.\u201d He leaned down and kissed her quickly, then drew back. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just a birthday. Maybe I made too much of it.\u201d</p><p>He got out of bed and got the Tiffany\u2019s box off the dresser and brought it back to her.</p><p>It occurred to him that she\u2019d asked for something for her birthday, something special. Not a gift, either; that wasn\u2019t Jolene\u2019s way. She wanted ... something. He couldn\u2019t remember what it was, but he saw the slight frown dart across her face as she saw the box; then it was gone, and she smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cTiffany, huh?\u201d She sat up in bed, positioned her pillows behind her, and then opened the box. Inside, a sparkling platinum and gold watch was curled around a white leather bed. A single small diamond took the place of the number twelve.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d She turned it over, to the back, on which Jolene, happy 41st was engraved. \u201cForty-one,\u201d she said. \u201cWow. Time is going fast. Betsy will be in high school in no time.\u201d</p> <p>He wished she hadn\u2019t said that. Time wasn\u2019t his friend lately. He was forty-five\u2014middle-aged by any standard. Soon he\u2019d be fifty, and whatever chance he\u2019d had to become another version of himself would be gone. And he still had no idea what that other version would look like; he just knew that the color had gone out of who he was.</p><p>He sat down on the bed beside Jolene. He looked at her, needing her suddenly, wanting to feel about her the way he used to. \u201cHow did you get through ... their deaths? I mean, really get through it? You had to change your life in an instant.\u201d</p><p>He saw her flinch, turn slightly away. The question was like a blow that glanced off her shoulder, bruised her. When she looked at him again, she was smiling. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger. I chose happiness, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. More platitudes. Suddenly he was tired again. \u201cI\u2019ll make you breakfast in bed, and then maybe we can all go for a bike ride.\u201d</p><p>She set the watch, still in its box, on the nightstand. \u201cTonight\u2019s my birthday party at Captain Lomand\u2019s house. You said you might come.\u201d</p><p>And there it was: the thing she\u2019d asked for. No wonder he\u2019d forgotten. \u201cI have nothing in common with those people. You know that.\u201d He stood up and walked over to the dresser, opening his top drawer.</p><p>\u201cI am those people,\u201d she said, and just like that they stumbled onto the familiar and rocky terrain. \u201cIt\u2019s a party for me. You could come just this once.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her. \u201cWe\u2019ll go out to dinner tomorrow night. How\u2019s that? All four of us. We\u2019ll go to that Italian place you like.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene sighed. He knew she was considering another volley across the net of this old argument. She wanted him to be a part of her military life\u2014she\u2019d always wanted it, but he couldn\u2019t do it, couldn\u2019t stand that rigid world of one for all and all for one. \u201cOkay,\u201d she finally said. \u201cThanks for the watch. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. Silence gathered in the air, as bitter and rich as the scent of coffee. There were things to be said, he knew, words that had been withheld too long, hoarded in the dark and spoiled. Once he gave them voice, said what he really felt, there would be no going back.</p><p>Later that afternoon, carrying a foil-covered casserole dish, Tami walked into Jolene\u2019s kitchen. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked, kicking the door shut behind her.</p><p>Jolene glanced back into the family room, making sure her kids weren\u2019t around. \u201cHe\u2019s really sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cHe brought me roses and a beautiful watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one that needs the watch,\u201d Tami said. At Jolene\u2019s look, she shrugged. \u201cJust sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cI asked him to come to the party. He doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tami said.</p><p>Jolene managed a smile. She couldn\u2019t help thinking how different life was for Tami. Although Carl wasn\u2019t in the military, he supported Tami fully, came to every event, and often told her how proud he was of her service. Tami\u2019s military pictures decorated the walls of their house, were hung alongside Seth\u2019s school pictures and shots from their family gatherings. All the pictures of Jolene in uniform were hidden away in drawers somewhere.</p><p>She turned away from the disappointed look in Tami\u2019s eyes and walked to the bottom of the stairs. \u201cGirls!\u201d she yelled up. \u201cCome on down. It\u2019s time for the party.\u201d</p><p>Lulu came down the stairs, grinning, dragging her blanket. She was dressed for the party in a pink princess dress, complete with a tiara. Betsy appeared at the top of the stairs with her arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cPleeease don\u2019t make me go,\u201d Betsy pleaded.</p><p>\u201cTicktock, ticktock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad doesn\u2019t have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s working,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Betsy stomped her foot and spun around. \u201cFine,\u201d she said, marching back to her room.</p><p>\u201cI remember how much I wanted a daughter,\u201d Tami said, coming up beside Jolene. \u201cLately I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I do or say is right. Honestly, she breaks a little piece of my heart every day. She swears she\u2019ll skip school if I go to career day. Apparently a mother in the military is only slightly less humiliating than one in prison.\u201d</p><p>Tami leaned against her. \u201cYou were raised by wolves, so you don\u2019t know this: it\u2019s normal. My mom swore she tried to sell me to gypsies at twelve. No takers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Seth coming today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He\u2019s a boy. They\u2019re like puppies; girls are like cats. He just wants to make me happy and play video games. Drama has not yet made an appearance at our house. Although, he does miss Betsy.\u201d</p><p>Jolene glanced up the stairs. \u201cI hope she\u2019s nicer to him.\u201d</p><p>Tami nodded. \u201cMy son is a fashion disaster. He\u2019s a geek boy who gets excited to answer a question in biology. Betsy wants to hang with the popular girls. I get it. I do. He\u2019s social suicide, and the fact that they used to be best friends does not help her any. Still, he doesn\u2019t get it. He wonders why she quit skateboarding and doesn\u2019t like to look for sand crabs anymore. He still has the birthday poster she made him tacked up on his wall.\u201d</p><p>Jolene didn\u2019t know what to say to that. Before she\u2019d thought of anything, Lulu came to the last step and hurled herself forward. Jolene scooped up her youngest daughter and settled her on her hip, carrying her out to the SUV. After Jolene strapped Lulu into her car seat, she went back into the house. \u201cCome on, Betsy!\u201d</p><p>Betsy stomped down the stairs, looking mutinous, with her iPod\u2019s earbuds firmly in place. The message was clear: I\u2019m coming, but I won\u2019t like it. Jolene let the little defiance pass, and followed her daughter to the SUV.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Seth?\u201d Betsy yelled, opening the passenger door.</p><p>Jolene climbed into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cHe and Carl are meeting us there. They went fishing this morning. Be nice to him.\u201d</p><p>Betsy already wasn\u2019t listening. She put on her seat belt and started fiddling with her iPod.</p><p>\u201cMusic?\u201d Jolene asked Tami.</p><p>\u201cThe queen today, I think. In your honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadonna it is.\u201d Jolene popped a CD into the player and drove off to the familiar beat of \u201cMaterial Girl.\u201d</p><p>She and Tami alternately talked and sang; Lulu talked nonstop; Betsy didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>In no time, they were pulling into the Gig Harbor subdivision called Ravenwood, which was about forty minutes from the post. The Guard crew came from all over this part of the state\u2014some of the people would have driven hours to get here.</p><p>The captain lived in a pretty Wedgwood-blue tract house with white trim and a wraparound porch. Kids ran around the yard, their voices raised into a single, echoing squeal. The house and yard were a reflection of the family\u2014of the man\u2014who lived here. Everything was trimmed and well cared for. Fifty-year-old Captain Benjamin Lomand was one of the best men Jolene had ever met.</p><p>Most of the flight crew and their families were already here; Jolene could tell by the multicolored snake of cars parked in the cul-de-sac. Though she couldn\u2019t see the backyard from here, she knew that the men\u2014and the female soldiers\u2014would be gathered around the barbecue, holding bottles of domestic beer or cans of Coke, while the wives stood in groups, talking to one another and herding children. Everyone would be smiling.</p><p>Jolene pulled up to the side of the driveway and parked. Tami\u2019s husband, Carl, and her son, Seth, were standing outside the garage. Waving, they strode down the driveway toward the car. Dressed in baggy jeans and a Seahawks jersey, with a baseball cap down low to conceal his thinning hair, Carl looked like one of those slightly heavy, solidly built men who\u2019d been a high school football star and gone on to work on the line at Boeing. That image was surprisingly accurate, except that he was a mechanic who owned his own garage.</p><p>Seth looked nothing like his dad. At twelve, he was a strange and gawky kid, with a pronounced case of acne, eyes that seemed just a little too big for his narrow face, and jet-black hair that fell almost to the middle of his back. Today he was wearing tight Levi\u2019s (everyone knew that baggy pants were \u201cin\u201d) and a huge Nine Inch Nails tee shirt that accentuated the thinness of his arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tami got out of the car at her husband\u2019s approach, taking a foil-covered casserole dish with her.</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s the love of my life,\u201d Carl said, opening his arms. Tami grinned and handed him the dish. No doubt it was her famous seven-layer dip.</p><p>\u201cHappy belated birthday,\u201d Carl said to Jolene when she got out of the car.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Carl.\u201d She opened the back door and unhooked Lulu\u2019s car seat. It was like loosing the Kraken. Lulu skipped off, squealing in delight, looking for someone to play with.</p> <p>Betsy stepped out of the car slowly, her earbuds still in place. When she saw Seth, her eyes widened in shock at what he was wearing; her mouth compressed. Jolene knew her daughter was terrified to be seen talking to her childhood best friend. So she gave her a little push.</p><p>Betsy stumbled forward, almost fell into Seth. He reached out, steadied her, saying, \u201cWhoa...\u201d The single word cracked, came in two volumes.</p><p>\u201cI hope no one saw that,\u201d Betsy said, pulling away from him, walking off. Seth stared after her for a long moment, then shrugged and headed over to a place in the grass. There, he sat down cross-legged and played some electronic game.</p><p>Jolene made a mental note to talk to Betsy again about being nice to Seth. Honestly, she didn\u2019t understand how her daughter could be so mean.</p><p>Carrying the foil-covered glass bowl full of coleslaw she\u2019d made, Jolene followed Carl and Tami into the backyard. They stepped around the corner of the house, and there they were: the flight crew\u2014her friends. They gathered together often, this group that had trained together for so many years. In the \u201coutside\u201d world, they were from all different walks of life\u2014dentists and loggers and teachers and mechanics. But for one weekend a month and two weeks a summer, they were soldiers, training side by side, serving their country with pride. Although Michael would roll his eyes at it, the truth was that Jolene loved these people. They were like her; they\u2019d joined the military because they believed in serving their country, in being patriots, in keeping America safe. They believed. There wasn\u2019t a member of this crew who wouldn\u2019t give his life for Jolene\u2019s, and vice versa.</p> <p>At her arrival, everyone started singing \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d</p><p>Jolene laughed, feeling a rush of pure, sweet joy. There was only the smallest of nicks in her happiness; she wished Michael were here with her. She would have loved to turn to him right now and tell him how much these friendships meant to her. How much this moment meant to her. God knew, her birthdays had never mattered to her parents.</p><p>When the song ended, she made the rounds, thanking everyone, talking. As she put her coleslaw down on a table already groaning under the weight of salads, casseroles, desserts, and condiments, Owen \u201cSmitty\u201d Smith offered her a glass of lemonade. He was the newest member of their crew\u2014a freckle-faced twenty-year-old kid who had joined the Guard to pay for college.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Smitty,\u201d she said.</p><p>He grinned, showing off a full set of braces. \u201cHappy birthday, Chief,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re the same age as my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, laughing, and then he was gone, hurrying off to catch up with his latest girlfriend.</p> <p>\u201cWarrant Officer Zarkades,\u201d Jamie Hix said, sidling up to her at the table, tilting a Corona at her. He was the other gunner on her crew. Twenty-nine and newly divorced, Jamie was trying to get joint custody of his eight-year-old son from his ex-wife, Gina. Their recent divorce was becoming increasingly contentious. \u201cForty-one, huh?\u201d</p><p>She plucked a raw carrot from the vegetable tray in front of her, swiping it in ranch dressing. \u201cHard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad Michael couldn\u2019t make it today.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised by the sentiment; she knew that most of her friends here wondered why Michael rarely made an appearance at their functions. They were protective of her. They\u2019d all drilled together so long there weren\u2019t many secrets between them. \u201cHe works hard, and his job is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Gina didn\u2019t come around much either.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the comparison between their spouses, however subtle. She was going to say so, but the compassion in Jamie\u2019s eyes made her feel suddenly lonely. Saying something\u2014she wasn\u2019t quite sure what\u2014she moved away, made her way past the barbecue, where everyone seemed to be laughing, and came to the captain\u2019s rose garden. She looked down at the bright, tightly coiled pink buds. Pink. Her favorite was red. Michael used to know that.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Tami said, sidling up to her, bumping her hip to hip.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she answered too quickly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you,\u201d Tami said softly, as if she knew everything that was turning through Jolene\u2019s mind. \u201cWe all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jolene said, looking around at the people who mattered so much to her. Everyone she looked at smiled and waved. They loved her, cared about her; these people were as much her family as Michael and the girls. She had so many blessings in her life.</p><p>It was okay that Michael wasn\u2019t here; they were married people, not conjoined twins. They didn\u2019t have to share every aspect of their lives.</p><p>Three</p><p>On Wednesday morning, Jolene returned from her run to find Betsy standing on the porch, wearing a robe she\u2019d outgrown over flannel pajamas and a pair of pink Ugg boots. Her face was scrunched in irritation\u2014a familiar expression these days.</p><p>Jolene ran up the driveway, breathing hard, her breath clouding in front of her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s Wednesday,\u201d Betsy said in the same tone of voice you\u2019d use to whisper the words you have cancer.</p><p>Oh. That. \u201cShoo.\u201d Jolene herded Betsy back into the house, where it was warm.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go, Mom. I\u2019ll say you are sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to career day, Betsy,\u201d Jolene said, turning on the coffeepot.</p><p>Betsy practically shrieked with displeasure. \u201cFine. Ruin my life.\u201d She stomped out of the kitchen and up the stairs. She slammed her bedroom door shut.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d Jolene muttered, following her daughter\u2019s route up the stairs. At the closed bedroom door on the second floor, she knocked hard.</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>Jolene knocked again.</p><p>\u201cFine. Come in. You will anyway. There\u2019s no privacy in this stupid house.\u201d</p><p>Jolene accepted the lovely invitation and opened the door.</p><p>Betsy\u2019s bedroom was a reflection both of the twelve-year-old who currently inhabited it and the tomboy who\u2019d lived here only a few months ago. The walls were still the pale wheat-yellow color that Jolene had chosen nearly a decade ago. Long gone were the white crib and dressing table and framed Winnie the Pooh prints. In their place were a four-postered bed covered in denim bedding, an antique yellow dresser with blue knobs, and posters of mop-headed boys from teenybopper bands. The war between childhood and adolescence showed everywhere: on the nightstand lay a tangle of makeup (which she wasn\u2019t allowed to wear outside the house), a mason jar full of beach glass and agates, and a once-favorite bug catcher that Seth had given her for her eighth birthday. Piles of clothes\u2014tried on and discarded before school yesterday\u2014lay in heaps on the floor.</p><p>Betsy sat on her bed, looking pissed off, with her knees drawn up to her chest.</p><p>Jolene sat down on the edge of the bed. Her heart went out to her daughter, who had been so undone by middle school. This once-buoyant, confident tomboy had become lost in a sea of mean girls and impossible social choices; lately she was so unsure of herself that nothing came easily and no decision could stand without peer approval. Nothing mattered more than fitting in, and clearly that was not going well.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to go to career day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. I told you: no one cool has a mom who\u2019s a soldier.\u201d</p><p>Jolene didn\u2019t want to let it hurt her, and she was mostly successful. It was just a tiny sting, like the prick from a needle. \u201cYou don\u2019t know embarrassing,\u201d she said softly, remembering her own mother, stumbling drunkenly into a parent-teacher conference, saying whad she do in a slurry voice.</p><p>\u201cSierra will make fun of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s not much of a friend, is she? Why don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s happening, Bets. You and Sierra and Zoe used to do everything together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t let me do anything. They get to wear makeup and go to the mall on the weekends.\u201d</p><p>This old argument. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to wear makeup. Thirteen is our deal for makeup and pierced ears. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I agreed,\u201d Betsy said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t like you because you don\u2019t wear mascara\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBets,\u201d Jolene said in her gentlest voice. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>That did it, the gentleness. Betsy burst into tears. Jolene scooted over on the bed and took Betsy in her arms, holding her while she cried. This had been a long time coming. Betsy cried as if her heart were breaking, as if someone she loved were dying. Jolene held her tightly, stroking her curly hair.</p><p>\u201cSi-Si-erra brought cigarettes to school last week,\u201d Betsy said between sobs. \u201cWh-when I told her it was against the rules, she ca-ca-lled me a loser and dared me to smoke one.\u201d</p><p>Jolene took a calming breath. \u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but now they won\u2019t talk to me. They call me Goody Two-shoes.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to hold her daughter until these dangers passed, until Betsy was old enough to handle them with grace and ease. Jolene needed to say the right thing now, the perfect motherly thing, but she was out of her element. Until the army\u2014with its rigid rules of behavior\u2014she had never fit in anywhere. The kids in her school had known she was different\u2014probably it had been the out-of-date clothes or the events she could never go to, or maybe it had been because she couldn\u2019t invite anyone home. Who knew? Kids were like Jedi in that way; they could sense the slightest disturbance in the Force. Jolene had found a way even then, as a girl, to compartmentalize her feelings and bury them.</p><p>So she didn\u2019t know about wanting to fit in so desperately you felt sick at the smallest slight. Ordinarily, she would talk to Betsy about inner strength now, about believing in herself, maybe even about cutting her friends some slack.</p><p>But smoking on the school grounds changed all that. If Betsy\u2019s friends, ex-friends, were smoking, Jolene needed to be more firm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Sierra\u2019s mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my GOD, you will not. Promise me you won\u2019t. If you do, I\u2019ll never tell you anything again.\u201d</p><p>The fear in Betsy\u2019s eyes was alarming.</p><p>\u201cPromise, me, Mom. Please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cI won\u2019t say anything for now. But, honey, if Sierra and Zoe are smoking cigarettes at school, you don\u2019t want to follow their lead. Maybe you need to make new friends. Like the girls on your track team. They seem nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think everyone seems nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Seth?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Betsy rolled her eyes. \u201cPuh-lease. Yesterday he brought his guitar to school and played it at lunchtime. It was superlame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to love listening to him play his guitar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? I don\u2019t now. People were laughing at him.\u201d</p><p>Jolene stared at Betsy; her daughter looked utterly miserable. \u201cAh, Betsy. How can you be mean to Seth? You know how much it hurts when Sierra and Zoe are mean to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m his friend no one will like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to learn not to be a lemming, Bets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, a rodent? Are you saying I\u2019m a rodent?\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. \u201cI wish I could make all this easier on you. But only you can do that. You need to be your best self, Betsy. Be a good friend and you\u2019ll have good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to make it easier on me? Skip career day.\u201d</p> <p>And just like that, they were back to the beginning. \u201cI can\u2019t. You know that. I made a commitment. When you make a promise to someone, you follow through. That\u2019s what honor is, and honor\u2014and love\u2014matter more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Be all that you can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t volunteer next year. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked at her. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d Jolene tried not to care that she\u2019d finally drawn a reluctant smile out of her daughter by promising not to be a part of her life.</p><p>Career day was as bad as expected. Betsy had been mortified by Jolene\u2019s appearance at the middle school. Jolene had tried to be as quiet as possible, modulating her voice carefully as she told the kids about the high school to flight school program she\u2019d entered at eighteen. The kids had loved hearing about the missions she flew in state, like last year\u2019s rescue of climbers on Mount Rainier during a blizzard. They questioned her about night-vision goggles and guns and combat training. Jolene tried to underplay everything, including the coolness of flying a Black Hawk, but all the while, she saw Betsy slinking downward in her seat, trying her best to disappear. At the end of the event, Betsy had been the first one out the door. On the other side of the gymnasium, Sierra and Zoe had pointed at Betsy and laughed.</p> <p>Since then, Betsy had been even more hormonal and moody. She yelled; she cried; she rolled her eyes. She had stopped walking and begun stomping. Everywhere. In and out of rooms, up the stairs. Doors weren\u2019t shut anymore; they were slammed. When the phone rang, she lunged for it. Invariably, she was disappointed when the call turned out to be for someone else. No one was calling her, which for a twelve-year-old was the equivalent of being stranded on an ice floe. Jolene might be overreacting, but she was worried about her daughter. Anything could set her off these days, send her spiraling into depression.</p><p>\u201cAnd today is the first track meet. You know what that means. Potential humiliation. I\u2019m worried,\u201d she said to Michael that morning. He was beside her in bed, reading.</p><p>She waited for him to respond, but it quickly became apparent that he had nothing to say, or he wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cMichael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh. That again. She\u2019s fine, Jolene. Quit trying to control everything.\u201d He put down his newspaper and got out of bed, heading into the bathroom, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Jolene sighed. As usual, she was on her own for family matters. She got out of bed and went for her run.</p><p>When she was finished, she took a shower and dressed quickly, tying her wet hair back in a ponytail as she awakened the girls. Downstairs, in the kitchen, she poured herself a cup of coffee and started breakfast. Blueberry pancakes.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Michael said from behind her.</p><p>She turned and looked at him.</p> <p>He smiled, but it was tired and washed out, that smile; it didn\u2019t reach his dark eyes. In fact, it wasn\u2019t his smile at all, really, not the one that had coaxed her so completely into love once upon a time.</p><p>For a moment, she was struck by how good-looking he was. His black hair, still without a trace of gray at forty-five, was damp and wavy. He was the kind of man who drew attention; when Michael Zarkades walked into a room, everyone noticed\u2014he knew it and loved it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make the track meet, right? I know how busy you are at work, and normally I get that you can\u2019t come home, but just this once I think it\u2019s important, okay? You know what a daddy\u2019s girl she is,\u201d she said.</p><p>Michael paused, the coffee cup inches from his mouth. \u201cHow many times are you going to remind me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m a little obsessive? What a surprise. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s important that you be there. On time. Betsy is fragile these days and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Betsy shrieked \u201cMom!\u201d and skidded into the kitchen. \u201cWhere\u2019s my orange hoodie? I need it!\u201d</p><p>Lulu ran up beside her, looking sleep-tousled, holding her yellow blanket. \u201cHoodie, hoodie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Betsy screamed.</p><p>Lulu\u2019s face crumpled. She shuffled over to the kitchen table and climbed up into her chair.</p><p>\u201cI washed your good-luck hoodie, Betsy,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cI knew you\u2019d need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Betsy said, sagging a little in relief.</p><p>\u201cApologize to your sister,\u201d Michael said from his place at the counter.</p><p>Betsy mumbled an apology while Jolene went to the laundry room and retrieved the hoodie\u2014a gift from Michael that had become Betsy\u2019s talisman. Jolene knew it wasn\u2019t unrelated\u2014the source of the gift and the magic that went with it. Betsy needed attention from her father, and sometimes the hoodie was all she got.</p><p>Betsy snatched the orange-sherbet-colored hoodie from Jolene and put it on.</p><p>Jolene saw how pale her daughter was, how shaky. She glanced over at Michael, to see if he\u2019d noticed, but he had gone back to reading the newspaper. He was in the room with them but completely apart. How long had it been that way? she suddenly wondered.</p><p>Betsy went to the table and sat down.</p><p>Jolene patted Betsy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI bet you\u2019re excited about the meet. I talked to your coach and he said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to my coach?\u201d</p><p>Jolene paused, drew her hand back. Obviously she\u2019d gone wrong again. \u201cHe said you\u2019d been doing great at practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d Betsy shook her head and stared down at the two pancakes on her plate, with their blueberry eyes and syrup mouth.</p><p>\u201cI want pancake men,\u201d Lulu yelled, irritated not to be the center of attention.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s natural to be nervous, Bets,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen you run. You\u2019re the best sprinter on the JV team.\u201d</p><p>Betsy glared up at her. \u201cI am not the best. You just say that because you\u2019re my mom. It\u2019s, like, a rule or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only rule that I have is to love you,\u201d Jolene said, \u201cand I do. And I\u2019m proud of you, Betsy. It\u2019s scary to put yourself out there in life, to take a chance. I\u2019m proud of you for trying. We all are,\u201d she said pointedly, her words aimed at Michael, who stood by the counter, reading his paper. Beside him, tacked to the wall, was Jolene\u2019s calendar that listed everything she needed to do this week, and everywhere she needed to be. TRACK MEET was written in bold red on today\u2019s date.</p><p>Betsy followed Jolene\u2019s look. \u201cWill you be at the meet, Dad? It starts at three thirty.\u201d</p><p>A silence followed, a waiting. How long did it last? A second? A minute? Jolene prayed that he would look up, flash that charming smile, and make a promise.</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d she said sharply. She knew how important his job was, and she respected his dedication. She rarely asked him to show up to any family event, but this first track meet mattered.</p><p>He looked up, irritated by her tone. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy reminded you about her track meet. It\u2019s at three thirty today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d He put down his newspaper and there it was, the smile that had swept so many women, including Jolene, off their feet. He gave it to Betsy, full power, his handsome face crinkling in good humor. \u201cHow could I forget my princess\u2019s big day?\u201d</p><p>Betsy\u2019s smile overtook her small, pale face, showing off her braces and big, crooked teeth.</p><p>He walked over to the table, leaned down, and kissed the top of Betsy\u2019s head and ruffled Lulu\u2019s black hair and kept moving toward the door, grabbing his coat off the back of the chair and his briefcase off the tile counter.</p><p>Betsy beamed under his attention. \u201cDid you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>He left the house, the door snapping shut behind him, snipping Betsy\u2019s sentence in half.</p><p>She slumped forward, a rag doll emptied of stuffing.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hear you,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like when he has to catch the ferry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have his hearing checked,\u201d Betsy said, shoving her plate aside.</p><p>Four</p><p>Michael stood at his office window, staring out. On this cold, gray day, Seattle simmered beneath a heavy lid of clouds. Rain obscured the view, softened the hard steel edges of the high-rise buildings. Far below, messengers on bicycles darted in and out through traffic like hummingbirds.</p><p>Behind him, his intercom buzzed.</p><p>He went back to answer it. \u201cHey, Ann. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Edward Keller is on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to my knowledge. But he says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut him through.\u201d Michael sat down behind his desk. Urgent calls from strangers were a fixture of criminal defense.</p><p>The phone rang; he picked it up.</p><p>\u201cMichael Zarkades,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cThank you for taking my call, Mr. Zarkades. I understand you\u2019re my son\u2019s court-appointed attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeith Keller. He was arrested for killing his wife.\u201d</p><p>The case Judge Runyon had assigned to Bill. \u201cRight, Mr. Keller. I was just getting up to speed on the facts of the case.\u201d He rifled through the piles of papers and folders on his desk, looking for the Keller file. When he found it, he said, \u201cOh, right. In fact, I have an appointment with your son today at two.\u201d</p><p>Two o\u2019clock.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The track meet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about him, sir. He won\u2019t talk to me. I\u2019d like to come in and talk to you, if you don\u2019t mind. You need to know what a good kid he is.\u201d</p><p>Murder notwithstanding. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll need to talk to you soon, Mr. Keller,\u201d Michael said. \u201cBut I need to speak with my client first. Did you give my secretary your number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Zarkades? He is a good kid. I don\u2019t know why he did it.\u201d</p><p>Michael wished he hadn\u2019t said that last sentence. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you, Mr. Keller. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Michael hung up the phone and glanced at his watch. It was 12:27. He\u2019d forgotten about this appointment with Keller\u2014he should have cancelled it because of the track meet.</p><p>He still could. Or he could go early. It wasn\u2019t like Keller had a full social calendar.</p><p>He looked at his watch again. If he left now, he could be at the jail by 12:45, interview his new client, and still make the 2:05 ferry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The room in the King County jail was dank and dreary. There was no CSI two-way mirror on the wall; instead, there was a pair of green, banged-up light fixtures hanging above a desk that had been marked up through years of use and a small metal trash can in the corner. Nothing that could be used as a weapon. The table legs were bolted to the concrete floor.</p><p>Michael sat in the chair across the table from his new client, Keith Keller, who was young, with short blond hair and the kind of build that hinted at either steroids or obsessive weight lifting. His cheekbones were sharp and his lips looked like he\u2019d been biting at them.</p><p>The wall clock kept a steady record of the minutes that passed in silence.</p><p>Well, not silence.</p> <p>Keith sat as still as a stone, his gray eyes strangely\u2014disturbingly\u2014blank.</p><p>They\u2019d been sitting here alone, the two of them, for over thirty-five minutes. Keith hadn\u2019t said a word, but the kid breathed loudly, a rattling, phlegmy kind of breathing.</p><p>Michael glanced at the clock, again\u20141:21\u2014and then down at the paperwork on the wooden table in front of him. All he had so far was the arrest report, and it wasn\u2019t nearly enough upon which to base a defense. According to the police, Keith had gone on a rampage, shooting up everything until his neighbors called for help. When the police arrived, Keith barricaded himself in his house for hours. At some point in all of this, he\u2019d\u2014allegedly\u2014shot his wife in the head. The report indicated that he\u2019d threatened to kill himself before the SWAT team captured him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make sense. Keller was twenty-four and a half years old, with an unblemished record. Unlike most of Michael\u2019s clients, Keller had never been arrested for anything before this, not even shoplifting as a teen. He\u2019d graduated from high school, joined the Marines, and been honorably discharged. Then he\u2019d gotten a job. He had no known gang affiliations, no history of drug abuse.</p><p>\u201cI need to understand what happened, Keith.\u201d</p> <p>Keith stared at the same spot on the wall that had held his attention for three-quarters of the last hour.</p><p>And that awful, shuddering breathing.</p><p>Michael sighed and looked at his watch. If the kid didn\u2019t want to help himself, that was his business. Michael had to leave right now or he\u2019d miss the ferry\u2014and the start of the track meet. \u201cFine, Keith. I\u2019m going to ask the court for a psych eval on you. You won\u2019t be competent to stand trial if you can\u2019t participate in your own defense. Would you rather be in a psychiatric hospital than the jail? It\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>Still, nothing.</p><p>He waited another moment, hoping for a response. Getting nothing from his client, he stood up and gathered his files. \u201cI\u2019m on your side, Keith. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>Putting his papers in his briefcase, he closed it up, grabbed the handle, and went toward the door. He was just about to push the button for the guard when Keith spoke.</p> <p>\u201cWhy bother? I\u2019m guilty.\u201d</p><p>Michael stopped. Of all the things the kid could have said, that was probably the least productive. A criminal defense attorney didn\u2019t actually want to know that\u2014it limited the defenses he could offer. He turned around slowly, expected to see Keith looking at him, but the kid was staring at his own fingers, as if the secret to immortality lay in the dirty nail beds. \u201cWhen you say guilty...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shot her in the head.\u201d His voice broke on that. He looked up. Michael had grown used to grief, and he saw it in the young man\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy would you be on my side?\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Now he had to explain the attorney-client relationship and the idea of American jurisprudence, the whole innocent-until-proven-guilty thing. He looked down at his watch. 1:37. There was no way he was going to make the start of the track meet, but he could be late, couldn\u2019t he?</p><p>He went back to the desk and sat down, pulling a pad and paper out of his briefcase. \u201cLet me explain how this works...\u201d</p><p>At 2:20, Jolene pulled up in front of her mother-in-law\u2019s gardening shop, the Green Thumb, and led Lulu inside.</p><p>A bell tinkled gaily overhead. The small, narrow shop\u2014once an old-fashioned drugstore, complete with a soda fountain\u2014was a treasure trove for gardeners. Michael\u2019s mother, Mila, had opened the shop ten years ago\u2014just for fun\u2014but in the months since Theo\u2019s death, it had become her sanctuary. Like her son, Mila had a strong work ethic, and lately she spent long hours here.</p> <p>\u201cYia Yia!\u201d Lulu yelled, yanking free. She charged forward with her usual enthusiasm. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>Mila pushed through the shimmering glass-bead curtain of the back room. \u201cDo I hear my granddaughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Yia Yia!\u201d Lulu squealed.</p><p>Mila wore her usual work outfit: a thigh-length tee shirt, a green canvas apron (designed to camouflage her weight), and jeans tucked into orange rubber boots. Heavy makeup accentuated the dramatic beauty of her face\u2014arching jet-black eyebrows, sparkling brown eyes, and full lips that smiled easily. She looked as Greek as she sounded, and she spoiled her grandkids as much as she\u2019d spoiled her son. She had also become the mother Jolene always wanted.</p><p>As a young mother, Jolene had spent hours hunkered down in the rich black dirt with her mother-in-law beside her. At first she\u2019d thought she was learning about weeds and the importance of a solid root system and levels of sunlight needed for growth; in time, she\u2019d realized that her mother-in-law was teaching her about life and love and family. When it had come time for Jolene and Michael to purchase a home in which to raise their own family, she had never questioned the location. This town had become \u201chome\u201d for Jolene the moment Mila first hugged her and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re the one for him, but you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Lucy Louida,\u201d Mila said, swinging her granddaughter up into her strong arms and setting her on the counter by the cash register.</p><p>\u201cHi, Yia Yia,\u201d Lulu said, grinning. \u201cYou want to play patty-cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, kardia mou.\u201d</p><p>Jolene came up behind her mother-in-law and hugged her tightly. For as long as she lived, the scent of Shalimar perfume would remind her of this woman.</p><p>Mila leaned back into the embrace. Her dyed black hair\u2014piled up \u00e0 la an aging Jersey girl\u2014tickled Jolene\u2019s cheek. Then she clapped her plump hands together. \u201cNow it is time to watch my granddaughter run like the wind. I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d Mila gave some instructions to the older man who was her assistant manager, and in no time they were headed to the middle school, where, finally, the sun had brushed the clouds away.</p><p>The track was a hive of activity; all around them, students and teachers and parents were readying the track and football field for the events. The opposing team was huddled at the opposite end of the field. Betsy was with her team beneath the goalposts, dressed in her blue and gold sweats. At their arrival, she looked up, waved, and ran up to them.</p><p>Betsy grinned. \u201cHi, Yia Yia.\u201d</p><p>Jolene smiled down at her daughter, who for just a second looked proud that they were here to watch her run. She felt a little catch in her throat. This was such a big moment for her daughter; the first school athletic event. Jolene leaned forward and kissed Betsy.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d Betsy gasped and stumbled back, her eyes huge.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jolene said, trying not to smile. \u201cNo one saw.\u201d</p><p>Mila laughed. \u201cThe horror. The horror. Your father used to hate it when I kissed him in public also. I did not care about his horror, either. I told him he was lucky to have a mother who loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Betsy said. She glanced over at the team, and bit her lower lip nervously.</p><p>Jolene moved forward. \u201cYou\u2019re ready for this, Bets.\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked up, and in that instant Jolene saw her little girl again, the one who\u2019d loved digging in the sand and capturing caterpillars. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose. Just so you know. I might even fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to fall, Betsy. Life is like an apple. You have to take a big bite to get all the flavor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Betsy said, looking miserable. \u201cWhatever that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means good luck,\u201d Mila said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go up into the stands to watch,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d Betsy asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cThe ferry is just landing now. Good luck, baby.\u201d</p><p>Jolene slung Lulu onto her hip and carried her over to the stands. There were probably forty people in the bleachers, mostly moms and kids. They climbed up to a seat in the middle and sat down. About five minutes later, Tami showed up, a little out of breath and red-faced.</p><p>\u201cDid I miss anything?\u201d she said, sliding to sit next to Jolene.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>At exactly three thirty, a gun went off and the first event started\u2014the boys\u2019 mile run.</p><p>Lulu screamed at the sound. She lurched to her feet and ran back and forth in the bleachers, yelling, \u201cLook at me, Mommy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Michael?\u201d Mila asked worriedly. \u201cI reminded him yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s on his way,\u201d Jolene answered. \u201cHe better be.\u201d</p><p>Tami shot her an are-you-worried look.</p><p>Jolene nodded.</p><p>The mile race finished. Then they called the girls\u2019 mile.</p><p>Jolene fished her phone out of her purse and dialed Michael\u2019s cell phone. It went straight to voice mail. She tapped her foot nervously.</p><p>Come on, Michael ... get here on time ...</p><p>At 4:10, they called Betsy\u2019s event\u2014the hundred-meter dash. Runners, take your spots ...</p><p>Jolene\u2019s phone rang. It was Michael. She picked up fast. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the parking lot, you need to run. They just called her race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the jail,\u201d he said. \u201cMy client\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll miss it,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>Below, on the track, Betsy approached the starting line. She bent over, placed her palms on the track, fit her feet into the blocks.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Jo\u2014\u201d</p><p>The starting gun went off. Jolene said, \u201cI gotta go,\u201d and hung up on him. Getting to her feet, she cheered for Betsy, who was running hard, pumping her arms and legs, giving it her all. Pride washed through Jolene, brought tears to her eyes. \u201cGo, Betsy, go!\u201d</p><p>Betsy was the second one across the finish line. Afterward, she bent over, breathing hard, and then she looked up into the stands. She was beaming, her smile triumphant as she looked up at her family.</p><p>Slowly, her smile faded. She saw that Michael wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Then she ran off to be with her team.</p><p>Jolene sank slowly back onto the bleacher seat. She knew what it was like to need a parent\u2019s attention and be denied, how much that hurt. She had never wanted her children to know that pain. She knew she was overreacting\u2014it was just a track meet, after all\u2014but it was the start. How long would Betsy remember this, be wounded by it? And how easily could Michael have made a different choice?</p><p>There was another race\u2014the 220\u2014and Betsy gave it her all, but her sense of triumph was gone; so was her smile. She came in fourth. After that, the races went on and on, and Lulu kept running back and forth in the bleachers, but the three adults just sat there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Mila said at last. \u201cI reminded him twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your twice and doubled it,\u201d Tami said. \u201cThe only way he could legitimately have forgotten was if he had a brain tumor.

Their jobs are important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is the family,\u201d Jolene said quietly.</p> <p>Mila sighed. \u201cYes. This I told his father, too.\u201d</p><p>Lulu twirled in front of Jolene, banging into the seat. Her eyes sparkled in that I\u2019m-either-going-to-scream-or-fall-asleep-any-second kind of way.</p><p>When the meet ended at five fifteen, Jolene took Lulu\u2019s small hand in hers and stood. \u201cWell. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They made their way down the bleacher steps and onto the field, where athletes from both schools milled around.</p><p>\u201cThere she is,\u201d Lulu said, pointing to Betsy, who stood alone, beneath the football goalpost.</p> <p>Jolene pulled Betsy into a fierce hug. \u201cI am so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond place. Big deal,\u201d Betsy said, pulling back.</p><p>Jolene could see the hurt turning into a brittle shell of anger. That seemed to be Betsy\u2019s modus operandi these days\u2014any sharp emotion turned into anger.</p><p>\u201cI have never seen such running, kardia mou. You were like the wind.\u201d</p><p>Betsy didn\u2019t even try to smile. \u201cThanks, Yia Yia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if we go out for pizza and ice cream?\u201d Mila suggested, clapping her hands together.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Betsy said glumly.</p><p>They walked out together. It was obvious to Jolene\u2014and certainly to Betsy\u2014that everyone was trying to talk at once, hoping to mask Michael\u2019s absence. For the next hour, they pretended, laughing a little too loudly, making jokes that weren\u2019t funny. Jolene lost track of the times someone told Betsy how amazing she had been. The words hit her daughter\u2019s brittle wall, failing to evoke even a small smile. There was an empty seat at the table and all of them felt it keenly.</p><p>By the time they left the restaurant and drove home, Jolene was as mad at Michael as she\u2019d ever been.</p><p>He could disappoint her\u2014hell, she was an adult, she could take it. But she wouldn\u2019t let him break their daughter\u2019s heart.</p><p>Mila was the only one who addressed the white elephant in the car with them. At her house, before she got out of the car, she turned to Betsy and said, \u201cYour father wanted to be here today. I know he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig deal,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>Mila seemed to consider a response to that, but, instead of saying anything, she smiled sadly, unhooked her seat belt, and got out of the car.</p><p>At home, Jolene parked in the garage and unhooked Lulu\u2019s car seat.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy?\u201d Lulu said sleepily.</p><p>\u201cHe was too busy to come,\u201d Betsy said sharply. \u201cNot that I care.\u201d On that, she slammed the car door shut and ran into the house.</p><p>Jolene pulled Lulu into her arms and carried her up the stairs. She readied her youngest for bed, read her a story, and tucked her in. Lulu was asleep before her head hit the pillow.</p><p>Then she went to Betsy\u2019s room, knocked on the door, and went inside.</p><p>Betsy was already in bed, her pimply face pink from scrubbing. Her blue and gold tracksuit was a tangled heap on the floor. The red ribbon she\u2019d won lay on the nightstand.</p><p>Jolene got into bed beside her. Betsy eased sideways to make room and then leaned against her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his excuse this time?\u201d</p><p>What could Jolene say? That Michael\u2019s work ethic and sense of duty sometimes trumped his family? She could hardly fault him for that: it was one of the things they shared. And he\u2019d learned it from his father. The Zarkades men could disappoint their wives and children, but they never let down a client. \u201cAh, baby ... sometimes we have to forgive the people we love. That\u2019s all there is to it. And you know how important his work is. People\u2019s lives depend on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care anyway,\u201d Betsy said, but her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Jolene held Betsy close. \u201cOf course you care. You\u2019re mad at him, and you have a right to be. But he loves you, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pretty much rocked today, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She felt Betsy relax a little. \u201cI sort of did.\u201d</p><p>They lay there for a long time, saying nothing of importance. Finally, Jolene kissed her daughter\u2019s temple, said good night, and went downstairs.</p><p>She sat on the cold brick hearth, with the black, empty fireplace behind her, and stared down at her hands. In her mind, she yelled at Michael, railed at him for disappointing their daughter.</p><p>This time, she\u2019d say it all. She\u2019d get his attention and make him understand that there were moments in life that could simply be lost. Too many and a relationship could founder.</p><p>It was just past nine o\u2019clock when she heard his car come up the driveway. Moments later, he walked into the kitchen, looking harried. \u201cHey, Jo. Sorry I\u2019m late, but once I missed the track meet, I figured, why hurry home?\u201d</p><p>Jolene got to her feet. \u201cReally. Is that what you thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to do something. How utterly surprising. And in a balancing of needs, yours won out. I\u2019m shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Jo, it wasn\u2019t intentional. If you\u2019d just listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt her feelings,\u201d she said, moving toward him. He was a tall man\u2014six feet, but in her shoes, Jolene was only an inch shorter. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we important to you anymore, Michael?\u201d</p><p>A change came over him. He took a step backward, eyeing her hard. \u201cDon\u2019t start a conversation you don\u2019t want to have, Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care why I did it, and you don\u2019t trust me to have a good reason. An important reason. I\u2019m tired of you defining every second of our life. We live here because it\u2019s what you wanted. You make all the rules\u2014where we live, where we vacation, how we spend our weekends. When was the last time you asked what I wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to turn this into my fault. We picked this house together, Michael. You and me, back in the days when we did things together. And if I manage our family, it\u2019s because someone has to. All you ever seem to care about lately is your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even listening to me. I\u2019m trying to say something here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could you possibly say, Michael? Your daughter needed you today, just this one time. You should have quit whatever you were doing and gotten here. But no, you put us on the back burner again.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant to say us; she\u2019d meant to say her. Our daughter. This wasn\u2019t about them.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Jo, it\u2019s a track meet, not her wedding. My dad didn\u2019t make it to every game, but I knew he loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the kind of father you want to be? Like yours? He was too busy to get to your high school graduation.\u201d She knew instantly she\u2019d gone too far; she saw it in the way he stiffened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that. I know how much you loved him, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d he said softly, shaking his head.</p><p>Jolene frowned. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here, Michael? You screwed up tonight. Why can\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t love you, Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d It felt as if something inside of her were tearing apart, ripping muscle from bone. She grabbed the counter edge for support. In the roar of noise in her head, she heard a small, indrawn breath. She turned slowly, slowly, slowly, thinking, please, God, no ...</p><p>Betsy stood in the family room, holding her second-place ribbon. She gasped quietly, her eyes widening slowly in understanding. Then she turned and ran up the stairs.</p><p>Five</p><p>Michael couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d said the words out loud.</p><p>I don\u2019t love you anymore.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to say it; the words had formed in anger and spilled out without warning. But they\u2019d been there, waiting for him, building inside him. And he\u2019d thought them before, more often than he\u2019d like to admit.</p><p>He could say he was sorry and she\u2019d forgive him, maybe not instantly, but soon. Their family, this family, was everything to her, and she loved him. He knew that, had always known it; even tonight, as he\u2019d wounded her, she still loved him.</p><p>He wanted to love her. But that wasn\u2019t the same thing, and it wasn\u2019t enough for him anymore. If he backpedaled now, retrieved those sharp words and softened them, shaped them into something different, nothing would change. He would keep living this life where too often he felt constricted by her rules and regulations, emasculated by her strength.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to measure up to Jolene. It wasn\u2019t enough for her that he loved his children and had a successful career and did his best. She demanded more, in that silent, competent way of hers; he had to compensate somehow for all the love she hadn\u2019t had as a child, and it was too much for him.</p><p>He was done pretending to be the man she wanted. It was time\u2014finally\u2014to find out who he wanted to be.</p><p>The decision freed him. He wanted to tell her all this, make her understand so he could feel better, but now was not the time. He needed to get out of here. He was reaching for his car keys when she said, \u201cGo talk to Betsy.\u201d</p><p>In all of this, he\u2019d forgotten. He looked at her for the first time since he\u2019d said I don\u2019t love you anymore. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>She looked like one of those marble statues in the Louvre. Already she was retreating emotionally, pulling her feelings back inside where they\u2019d be safe.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your daughter, Michael, and you hurt her. If there\u2019s any chance of making her feel better, it lies in you. Maybe she\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d</p><p>He heard the emphasis she placed on the pronoun. \u201cI haven\u2019t asked for your forgiveness, Jo,\u201d he said.</p><p>He saw how deeply that hurt her. \u201cNo, Michael, you haven\u2019t. Do you want a divorce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He saw the way she looked at him then. When it came to love, Jolene was like a recovering alcoholic, a zealot. Love was either there, hot as fire, or it was dead, as cold as ash. She saw no middle ground, and she had no patience for uncertainty. It made him feel small, the way she looked at him, and he almost hated her for that. She was always so damned strong, even now, when he had broken her heart. Had he wanted her to fall apart and say she loved him?</p><p>He walked away from her, went up the stairs.</p><p>Outside Betsy\u2019s closed door, he paused, then knocked.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Mom.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>She saw him and started to cry. \u201cI don\u2019t wa-want you in h-here. G-Go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Lil Bit,\u201d he said. At the childhood nickname, so long unused, she cried harder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He went to the bed, sat down facing her. He felt unable to sit straight in her presence; his shoulders slumped forward, as if his spine had begun to go soft. \u201cBetsy,\u201d he said tiredly.</p><p>She sniffed, looked at him from beneath heavy lashes.</p><p>In her teary eyes, he saw the full import of what he\u2019d done, what he\u2019d said. His love for Jolene was only a part of their life together, the skeleton of their family; but there was more. Their children were the sinew and muscles. The heart. How could one love be extracted from the other without it all collapsing?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed your race.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was stupid anyway. I didn\u2019t win\u201d was what she said, but in her eyes, he saw heartbreak.</p><p>\u201cYou ran the race, that\u2019s what matters. There will be lots of winning and losing in your life. All of it makes you who you are. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes and studied him.</p><p>He could see what she was thinking. He sighed, pushed a hand through his hair. Turning slightly, out of his depth, he glanced out the window.</p><p>\u201cGrown-ups fight,\u201d he said, too ashamed to look at her. Was he lying? He didn\u2019t even know. Ten minutes ago it had been so clear to him\u2014he had fallen out of in love with his wife. Now he saw that it had been a drop of water, that moment, falling into the ocean of their connected lives. \u201cYou and Lulu fight all the time and you still love her, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust forget it, Betsy. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her at last. \u201cA mistake,\u201d he repeated, hearing the word as something unfamiliar. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you heard our fight, and I\u2019m sorry I missed your track meet. Forgive me?\u201d</p><p>Betsy stared at him so long he thought maybe she was going to say no. Finally, though, she nodded solemnly.</p><p>He leaned forward and drew her into his arms. He felt her start to cry again, so he held on, let her be. When she finally quieted, he let go of her and eased off the bed, standing beside her.</p> <p>She looked up at him. \u201cYou love Mom, too, right?\u201d</p><p>He said yes\u2014the right answer\u2014but he could tell by the sadness in her eyes that he had waited too long, that the silence convinced her of more than his words had.</p><p>Leaving her, he went back downstairs, steeling himself to face Jolene, but she wasn\u2019t down there, waiting. She\u2019d picked up the room and turned off the lights.</p><p>That was Jolene, cleaning up even while life was falling apart.</p><p>Jolene made it up the stairs and into her bedroom without coming apart, although how she did it, she wasn\u2019t quite sure. Somehow, her heart was still beating and her brain was still sending signals of the most rudimentary kind\u2014breathe, lift your foot, step forward.</p><p>She closed the door quietly behind her, wondering for a split second why she didn\u2019t slam it shut. Maybe a sound like that, a crack, would make her feel better.</p><p>Through her window, she saw a block of night and the Big Dipper, slanted on its side.</p><p>She meant to sit on her bed, but she missed, was off by inches, and so she slid down to the floor.</p> <p>She sat there, her knees drawn into her chest, staring into the darkness.</p><p>I don\u2019t love you anymore.</p><p>It hurt so much she thought her heart might stop.</p><p>She leaned back against the bed she shared with her husband.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about that, or him, but how could she help herself now?</p><p>He had changed her, completed her. Or so she\u2019d thought.</p><p>In the army, she\u2019d found herself; in the air, she\u2019d found her passion. But it wasn\u2019t until she met Michael that the missing part of her began slowly, cautiously to fill back in.</p><p>Tami had encouraged her to go in search of the young lawyer who\u2019d helped her, and flight school had given her confidence to do it. He\u2019d been easy to find at Zarkades, Antham, and Zarkades.</p><p>You came back, he said when he saw her standing in the lobby. Those were the very first words he spoke. He said it, smiling, as if the six years in between had passed in a breath. She knew then that he\u2019d been waiting, too, in his way. I came back, she answered, not even surprised when he reached for her hand. It had been more than a start; love was a deep blue sea and they dove in. She hadn\u2019t known how to believe in love, but he\u2019d swept her away; it was as simple as that. With their first kiss, she\u2019d forgotten the love that had been her birthright and begun to believe in him and forever.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, she\u2019d forgotten that love had a dark underside. Too many years in its sunlight had blinded her. She\u2019d handed Michael her heart, wrapped it up and placed it in his hands, and she\u2019d never bothered to worry that he might be careless with it. Even as he\u2019d pulled away from her in the last few years and spent more hours at the office, she\u2019d believed in the durability of their vows and made excuses for him. Like Pollyanna, always believing ...</p><p>Downstairs, she heard a door slam shut, then a car engine start. She stumbled over to her window and stood there, watching him drive away, wondering if he would come back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Jolene spent the restless, unbearable hours of the night cleaning and doing laundry. She vacuumed, dusted, polished silver, and scrubbed toilets\u2014anything to keep her mind off his I don\u2019t love you anymore.</p><p>Not that it worked. The words had changed her perception of her life, if not herself.</p><p>Five words to change a world, to dissolve the ground beneath a woman\u2019s feet. It was a tidal wave, that sentence, whooshing in without warning, undermining foundations, leaving homes crumbled in the aftermath.</p><p>By morning, she was so exhausted she could barely stand and so wired she didn\u2019t bother making coffee. More than anything, she wanted to escape this too-quiet house and get in her helicopter and fly away. Instead, in the pink and lavender light of a rising dawn, she went for an eight-mile run, but it didn\u2019t help.</p><p>When she got back, she took a long shower, dressed in worn jeans and a gray army sweatshirt, and then went to wake up Betsy. She knocked on the door and went inside. \u201cHey, Betsy,\u201d she said, forcing a smile. She should have spoken to her daughter last night\u2014that was what a good mother would have done, a stronger mother, but Jolene had been afraid of breaking down in front of her child, of crying, of scaring Betsy even more.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d Betsy said dully.</p><p>\u201cI know Daddy talked to you. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do NOT want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Jolene stopped, unsure of what to say anyway. How did you talk to a child about such adult things? She\u2019d never been good at knowing when to push with Betsy and when to back off. Invariably, she pushed when she should have let go. It was one of Jolene\u2019s flaws: she was good at holding on. Letting go, not so much.</p><p>But one thing she saw clearly: Betsy was afraid and confused, and so she was angry. There was nothing Jolene could offer that would help. How could she talk about what she herself didn\u2019t understand?</p><p>Instead, Jolene went to her daughter and pulled her to her feet and took her into her arms. It took a supreme act of will not to layer words onto the hug, but she managed it, just let it be.</p><p>She felt Betsy\u2019s haggard sigh, and knew how her daughter felt. It was terrifying to see your parents fight. She knew Betsy would remember last night, and she would notice Michael\u2019s absence this morning.</p><p>Lulu walked into the bedroom, dragging her favorite yellow blanket behind her. \u201cHey, I want a hug, too.\u201d</p><p>Jolene opened one arm and Lulu rushed forward, folding her little body alongside her sister\u2019s. They stood there a second longer; then Lulu pulled back. She scratched her tangled black hair, pushed it out of her eyes. \u201cCan I have Cap\u2019n Crunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Captain Crunch. That\u2019s for special mornings,\u201d Jolene answered automatically.</p><p>\u201cToday could be special,\u201d Lulu chirped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of special,\u201d Betsy said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lulu wanted to know.</p><p>Jolene sighed. \u201cCome on, girls. Let\u2019s get breakfast going.\u201d</p><p>As they made their way downstairs, Jolene felt Betsy\u2019s gaze on her. In the kitchen, Betsy seemed to notice everything\u2014the way Jolene\u2019s hands shook just a little when she got out the flour and eggs for pancakes, the way she kept sighing, the way she opened the fridge and just stared inside. Finally, she couldn\u2019t take it anymore, being under this scrutiny. She poured the girls Cheerios.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy?\u201d Lulu asked, concentrating on getting the right number of Cheerios in her spoon.</p><p>\u201cAt work,\u201d Jolene said, wondering what she\u2019d say if he stayed away tonight, too.</p><p>Betsy looked up sharply. \u201cHe left already?\u201d</p><p>Jolene turned to pour herself more coffee. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like when he has to catch an early ferry,\u201d she lied, not looking at her daughter.</p><p>The moment seemed to draw out; she could feel Betsy\u2019s suspicious gaze on her back. \u201cHurry up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to leave in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>As soon as breakfast was over, Jolene herded the girls upstairs to finish getting ready. They left right on time, and by nine fifteen, she was home again.</p><p>She parked in her garage and then walked next door. Waving to Carl, who was working on a Ford truck, she went to the front door, opened it, and said, \u201cHey, Tam,\u201d at the same time she went inside.</p><p>Tami was in the living room, in a fraying blue robe and sheepskin slippers, sipping coffee from a huge insulated mug. Behind her, the wood-paneled walls were studded with dozens of family photographs, all framed in white. Dead center was Tami\u2019s military portrait.</p><p>\u201cHey, flygirl,\u201d Tami said, grinning. She sat on the blue plaid sofa, her slippered feet propped on the glass coffee table.</p><p>She looked at Tami, and for a second she couldn\u2019t say it, couldn\u2019t force the words out.</p><p>Tami frowned and put down her coffee cup. \u201cWhat is it, Jo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael said he doesn\u2019t love me anymore,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me say it again.\u201d</p><p>Tami walked forward slowly, put her arms around Jolene, and held her. It took Jolene a minute to lift her own arms, to hold on to Tami, but once she did, she couldn\u2019t let go. She wanted to cry, was desperate for a way to release this pain, but no tears came.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay?\u201d Jolene stepped out of the embrace. \u201cAfter I don\u2019t love you, what is there to say?\u201d</p><p>Tami sighed. \u201cCouples fight, Jo. They yell, they say things they don\u2019t mean, they storm off and come back. Granted, Michael said a stupid thing, but he didn\u2019t mean it. You can forgive him. This isn\u2019t the end.\u201d</p><p>Jolene heard the undertone of pain in Tami\u2019s voice, knew her friend was remembering the affair Carl had had ten years ago. \u201cI know about forgiving people and loving them anyway, even after they hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She did know. Jolene had spent a childhood forgiving her parents, hoping that tomorrow or next week or next month they would change. But they hadn\u2019t changed and they hadn\u2019t loved her. She\u2019d started to get better when she accepted that simple truth. She\u2019d stayed whole, become whole, by not needing their love anymore. She knew what Tami was saying; hell, it was what Jolene would have said if the situations were reversed. One sentence couldn\u2019t end a marriage. But she couldn\u2019t hang on alone, either. Hadn\u2019t she learned that from her mom? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it. Michael loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to believe that,\u201d Jolene said quietly, and it was true; she wanted to believe in Michael and his love for her, but her faith had been shaken. She was afraid to trust him so completely again. If he could just fall out of love with her, what did it all mean?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before Tami could finish, her phone rang. She went to the kitchen and answered. \u201cOh. Hi. Yes, sir.\u201d She turned to Jolene, mouthed Ben Lomand, and then said into the phone, \u201cReally? I see. When, sir? So soon? Oh. Okay, Jolene and I will handle the phone tree. Thank you, sir.\u201d Tami hung up the phone slowly and turned to face Jolene.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re being deployed.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>When Jolene and Michael had first seen the house on Liberty Bay, it had been a beautiful sunlit July day. They\u2019d been out driving, enjoying their time together after an afternoon barbecue at his parents\u2019 house. They hadn\u2019t been looking for a house.</p><p>But there it was, just sitting at a bend in the road, waiting for them, a for-sale sign stuck haphazardly by the mailbox. A quaint little farmhouse in need of love, a sagging wraparound porch, and three green acres that cascaded down to the black ribbon of a quiet country road. Across the road, there was a small patch of land, an afterthought really, that lay tucked between the road and the sweeping gray crescent of beach.</p><p>It was the little bit of beachfront that drew them in. The first thing they did to the property was build a deck above the sand. They built it with their own hands, she and Michael, laughing and talking and dreaming the whole time.</p> <p>We\u2019ll barbecue out here on the Fourth of July ... and show Betsy how to find sand dollars ... and eat dinner from paper plates while the sun sets into the water ...</p><p>It was only a thin strip of grassy land stitched alongside a winding ribbon of asphalt, but it was Jolene\u2019s dream, her slice of paradise. The smell of the sea and the sound of the waves comforted her. She had always come out here to think, to recharge. Especially in those long, barren years between Betsy and Lulu, when Jolene had been so desperate to conceive another child. Here, alone, month after month, she\u2019d cried when her period started. And here was where she\u2019d come to thank God when her prayer had finally been answered.</p><p>Now, she sat in one of the Adirondack chairs that flanked a rusted metal fire pit. It was raining, but she hardly noticed. She stared out at the flat gray waters, pockmarked by falling rain, and thought: How will my children handle this? How will I? How will Michael?</p><p>How much a world could change in three hours ...</p><p>They\u2019d always known she could be deployed; at least since September Eleventh they\u2019d known it, and yet she and Michael had never discussed it. How could they? Michael didn\u2019t want to hear about her career in the military. Every time she even brought up the idea of other soldiers deploying, he\u2019d gone off on a rant about the wrongheadedness of sending troops to Iraq.</p><p>She knew what he thought, what he saw\u2014the military\u2019s dark side, the mistakes, the way the brass let down soldiers and veterans. That was politics, though. Separate, somehow. For her, it was different. The Guard was her family, too.</p> <p>Honor. Duty. Loyalty. These were more than words to Jolene; they were part of her. She\u2019d always been two women\u2014a mother and soldier\u2014and this deployment ripped her in half, left a bloody, gaping tear between the two sides of her.</p><p>Who would help Betsy through the rocky terrain of adolescence, give her advice about bad boys and mean girls and all the kids in between? Who would walk Lulu into kindergarten and hold her when she woke, sobbing, from a nightmare?</p><p>And there was the risk. Jolene was a helicopter pilot. She would tell Michael and the girls that she wasn\u2019t allowed in combat, that she would be far from harm\u2019s way, but she knew it wasn\u2019t true. Helicopters were shot down all the time.</p><p>We\u2019ll come home, Tami had said.</p><p>Jolene had nodded, smiling, although she knew\u2014they both did\u2014that no such promise could be made. It didn\u2019t matter now anyway. Tomorrow and the future wasn\u2019t something they could control. For now, they had a job to do, a job they\u2019d been trained for. Civilians didn\u2019t understand, maybe they couldn\u2019t, but a soldier stepped up when he or she was needed. Even if she was afraid, even if her children needed her. It was Jolene\u2019s time to give back to the army, her time to serve her country.</p><p>She placed a hand over her chest, feeling the slow, even beating of her heart. She closed her eyes, hearing her heartbeat mingle with the whooshing of the waves on the pebbled beach and the exhalations of her breath. Tears stung her eyes, fell down her cheeks, mixing with the rain. She imagined all of it\u2014the good-bye, the missing, the loss. She pictured her daughters crying for her, reaching out for her, unable to really understand her absence.</p><p>But she had no choice to make. At that, she felt a kind of peace move through her, an acceptance of the situation and a realization of who she was. She had given her word that if called to serve, she would go.</p><p>She hated leaving her children\u2014hated it with a passion that could have crippled her if she gave in to it, but she had no choice. She would go to Iraq for a year, do her job, and come home to her family.</p> <p>That was what she would tell them ... what she would believe.</p><p>She was prepared, had always been prepared, for this moment. For more than twenty years, she\u2019d trained for it. A small part of her even wanted to go, to test herself. She wanted to go ... she just didn\u2019t want to leave.</p><p>She pulled her hand slowly away from her chest, let it fall in her lap. At her feet, a small collection of dried white sand dollars lay in a cloverleaf pattern, a reminder of last summer. She bent down, plucked one up, rubbing the pad of her thumb over the porous surface. Then she stood up.</p><p>She was going to war.</p><p>At one o\u2019clock Jolene called the preschool and arranged for Lulu to stay later, and then she called Michael at work. He kept her waiting long enough that she began to think he wasn\u2019t going to answer, and when he did finally take the call, he sounded preoccupied.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jo. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to come home tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>He paused; she heard him breathing. \u201cI have a lot of work to do. I think I\u2019ll sleep at the office tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, please,\u201d she said, hating how it sounded as if she were begging. \u201cSomething has come up. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need some time apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Michael. I need to talk to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll be on the six o\u2019clock boat.\u201d</p><p>For the next few hours, she tried not to think about the future, but it was impossible. As the time for carpool approached, she found her spirits lagging. The thought of seeing her children\u2014looking at them, seeing their bright smiles, and knowing the pain that was coming their way\u2014was terrible. She kept losing her balance, stumbling. Once, in the kitchen, she\u2019d looked at the yellow-school-bus framed photo of Betsy\u2019s school years, and she actually had to sit down.</p><p>Help me through this, she prayed more than once.</p><p>At the preschool, she parked out front and went inside slowly, hearing the high-pitched buzz of children\u2019s laughter before she even reached the gate that led to the backyard.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d Lulu said, shrieked really, throwing her hands in the air and scrambling to her feet. She ran at Jolene, threw herself into Jolene\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cDo you have something in your eye, Mommy?\u201d Lulu asked. \u201cCuz I gotted sand in my face at lunch and it made me cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Lucy Louida,\u201d Jolene said, grateful that Lulu didn\u2019t hear the thickening of her voice. She carried Lulu out to the car, strapped her into the seat in the back, and drove across town to the middle school. As usual, Betsy was one of the last ones out of the school. She hung back from the other kids, as if she didn\u2019t want to be seen. Then she ran to the SUV and climbed into the backseat, slamming the door shut.</p><p>Jolene stared at her daughter in the rearview mirror and felt a flutter of panic. She\u2019s so fragile now ...</p><p>\u201cAre you going to just sit here all day?\u201d Betsy said, crossing her arms.</p><p>How would Betsy get through seventh grade without her mom? What would happen when she started her period? Who would help her?</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Betsy said sharply. \u201cAre you brain-dead?\u201d</p><p>Jolene drove into the stream of carpool traffic. She meant to start a conversation, say something, but her throat felt tight. When she pulled up to Mila\u2019s house, her eyes stung with tears that didn\u2019t fall.</p><p>Her in-laws\u2019 house was a small L-shaped rambler built in the late seventies. It was small in comparison with the newer houses on either side of it, but the land was stunningly beautiful. Set on a deep, treed waterfront lot, it overlooked the placid waters of Lemolo Bay. Giant evergreens studded the landscaping; here and there, mounds of multicolored flowers grew around their rough brown trunks. Mila had turned this yard into a showpiece; every year it was on the local home and garden tour as a magnificent example of Northwest landscaping. The water out front was shallow and clear; in the summer, it warmed enough for swimming.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d Betsy asked.</p><p>Jolene didn\u2019t answer. Instead, she parked in front of the garage and let the girls out of the car. Before they even reached the front door, Mila came around the side of the house. She waved, smiling brightly, wearing a big flannel shirt over jeans tucked into bright orange rubber boots. A multicolored scarf covered her poofy black hair, \u00e0 la Liz Taylor, and fist-sized silver hoops dangled from her ears. In her left hand was an enameled watering can. \u201cHey, girls,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to call at the last minute like this,\u201d Jolene said, bumping the car door shut with her hip.</p><p>Mila shook the dirt from her gardening gloves; it rained onto her boots. \u201cAh, honey, what\u2019s family for?\u201d</p><p>Lulu got out of the car and put on her kitten-ears headband, mewing loudly for attention.</p><p>\u201cNot this again,\u201d Betsy said, pushing past her sister.</p><p>Mila put down her watering can and glanced around. \u201cHmmm. Where is my granddaughter, Jolene? Did you leave her at home? In the car?\u201d</p><p>Lulu giggled.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that noise?\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>Lulu whipped off the headband. \u201cI\u2019m here! Yia Yia.\u201d</p><p>Mila picked Lulu up and held her.</p><p>For a moment, Jolene couldn\u2019t say anything. The weight of her future pressed down on her chest so hard she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Mila frowned. \u201cAre you okay, Jo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Michael and I need to talk, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll pick the girls up tomorrow if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Mila stepped closer. \u201cYou tell my son he needs to do better. Work is important, but so is family. I tried to teach his father this lesson, too, but...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou will do a better job of it than I did.\u201d</p><p>Jolene could only nod. It seemed a lifetime had passed since the missed track meet. She almost blurted out\u2014I\u2019m being deployed. She needed to tell Mila, needed to feel a mother\u2019s embrace, but she couldn\u2019t do it, couldn\u2019t be comforted yet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She mumbled good-bye and went back to her car. By the time she got home, she was sick to her stomach.</p><p>This deployment changed everything. He would see that. Whatever their problems were\u2014had been\u2014they would have to be set aside. She and Michael would have to come together now, for the children, for their family. And she would need him now, really need him. His love would save her over there, keep her warm at night, just as her children\u2019s love would bring her home.</p><p>She thought about what Tami had said. Couples fight. They say things they don\u2019t mean; they stomp off.</p><p>They come back.</p> <p>She wanted to believe that, believe in that, even though she\u2019d never seen it. She wanted to forgive Michael and find a way to scrub his declaration from her brain so they could go back to who they\u2019d been.</p><p>All she had to do was give him a chance.</p><p>She could do it; she could be strong enough to let him know she still loved him. These were the things she told herself as she waited for him.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>Finally, at seven o\u2019clock, he came into the kitchen and immediately poured himself a scotch.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jolene said, rising from her seat on the hearth.</p><p>He turned. In the ambient light from above the stove, he looked more than tired. His hair was a mess. The skin beneath his eyes had a violet cast, as if he\u2019d slept as badly as she had last night.</p><p>\u201cJo,\u201d he said quietly; there was a gentleness in his voice that surprised and saddened her. It swept her back, in a breath, to who they used to be.</p><p>She ached for that\u2014needed it, needed him. \u201cI\u2019m being deployed.\u201d</p><p>Michael went so still it was as if he\u2019d stopped breathing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d he finally said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not kidding. Who kids about going to war?\u201d Jolene\u2019s voice cracked. For a split second, her strength wavered. She realized how desperate she was to have him take her in his arms and tell her they\u2019d be okay through this. \u201cI\u2019m going to Fort Hood first for combat training, then it\u2019s off to Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the Guard, for Chrissake. You\u2019re not a real soldier.\u201d</p><p>Jolene flinched. \u201cI\u2019m going to do you a favor and forget you said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to war, Jo. Come on. You\u2019re forty-one years old\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are dying over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them you\u2019re a mother. They can\u2019t expect you to leave your children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMen leave their children to go off to war every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut you\u2019re a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a soldier first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a damn game, Jo. You are not going to war. Tell them thanks but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in disbelief. \u201cI would be court-martialed for that. I\u2019d go to jail. You don\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit then.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know her at all if he could say that to her. Honor was just a word to him, and lawyers made a game of playing with words. He had no real idea what a dishonorable discharge meant. \u201cI gave my word, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was \u2018I do\u2019?\u201d he snapped back.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d she yelled at him. \u201cFor all these years, I\u2019ve loved you. Adored you. And last night you tell me you don\u2019t love me anymore, that maybe you want a divorce. And then, because you\u2019re a selfish prick who doesn\u2019t know me at all, you tell me to quit the Guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of mother could leave her children?\u201d</p><p>She drew in a sharp breath. It would have hurt less to be smacked across the face. \u201cHow dare you say that to me? You, who are the least reliable person in this family. It breaks my heart to leave them, but I have to.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to war,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like a choice, Michael. There\u2019s no choice here. Either I go to war or I go to jail. How can you not understand this? I\u2019m being deployed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re surprised I\u2019m pissed off. I never wanted you in the stupid military in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for minimizing what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar\u2014and this war in particular\u2014is a waste, and I might not be Colin Powell, but I know that helicopters are big targets in the sky that get shot at. What am I supposed to say? \u2018Good for you, Jolene. You go off to Iraq and be careful. We\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said quietly. The fight drained out of her. \u201cThat would have been really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you married the wrong man then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously. Look on the bright side, Michael. You wanted time apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck you, Michael.\u201d On that, she turned on her heel and walked out of the room. She didn\u2019t run, although she wanted to. She kept her chin up and her shoulders squared as she walked up the stairs and into her bedroom.</p><p>Downstairs, a door slammed. She was reminded of her childhood and all the fights she\u2019d heard from a distance. She\u2019d never imagined she would grow up to be a wife listening to her own husband leave. But even with the pain of that sad and pathetic echo, she thought Go, Michael, run.</p><p>She should have known better anyway. She knew better than to count on anyone to stand beside her, to stay. And yet even knowing that, knowing that she was alone again and that she was strong enough to take it, she felt herself breaking inside. She sat down on her bed, unable to stand any longer.</p><p>Sometime later, the floor outside her bedroom door creaked, and the door opened. Michael stood there, looking both angry and defeated. His hair was a mess, as if he\u2019d run his hands through it repeatedly, which he probably had. It was a nervous habit. A half-full drink\u2014scotch, no doubt\u2014hung from one hand. She found herself looking at that hand for a moment; his fingers were long, almost elegant. She\u2019d often said he had pianist\u2019s hands, painter\u2019s hands. She\u2019d loved what those hands could do to her body.</p><p>But they were uncalloused, those hands, unused to manual labor. A thinking man\u2019s hands, unlike her own. Maybe it all came down to that. Maybe she should have seen this scene unfolding the second she first held his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going,\u201d he said, and his voice was thin, tinged with the kind of banked anger she\u2019d never heard from him before.</p><p>\u201cI have to,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter that we need you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it matters.\u201d</p><p>He finished his drink and came into the room. Putting the empty glass on the nightstand, he sat down on the bed beside her, but not close enough to touch. With a sigh, he slumped forward. The wavy mass of his hair spilled forward. Seeing him now, his sharp profile, his defeated shoulders, she was reminded of the week in which his father had lain dying. Michael had been unable to stand seeing Theo that way, gray and hollow and in pain, connected to life by machines. He\u2019d tried to sit by the bed, but he could never do it for long. More often than not, Jolene had found him pacing in the hallways, beating himself up for his weakness. She had gone to him then, taken him in her arms and held him until he could breathe again. To her, it had been second nature, caring for him when he was hurting. But now she saw what she had never dared to see before: this love of hers was one-sided. She was the one who took care; he was the one who took.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>Jolene felt a profound sense of relief. She didn\u2019t realize until right now, when her breath rushed out, how nervous she\u2019d been, sitting beside him, waiting. \u201cSo you\u2019ll wait for me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow long until you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks. That\u2019s quicker than usual. Special circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be gone for a year.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll get Leave in six months. I\u2019ll be able to come home for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>He sighed again. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell the girls tomorrow. And my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jolene said, but it was barely above a whisper, that word; there was so much more to say, plans to be made, problems to be solved, but neither one of them said anything.</p><p>They sat on the bed in which they\u2019d made love so many times, silent, each staring out at nothing, until it was time to turn out the lights.</p><p>Seven</p><p>The next morning, Michael and Jolene drove to Mila\u2019s house.</p><p>He pulled into the driveway and turned off the car\u2019s engine. For the first time all morning, he looked at her. \u201cAre you ready to do this?\u201d</p><p>Jolene saw the banked anger in his eyes and it made her feel empty and painfully alone. She didn\u2019t bother to answer. Instead, she reached for the handle and opened the door and got out. As they walked to the front door, she couldn\u2019t help noticing how far apart from her he stood.</p><p>Michael knocked on the door. In moments, the sound of footsteps came from inside. Then the door swung open and Mila stood there in a fuzzy pink bathrobe, with her black hair a tangled mess. Behind her, the room was a wash of pale green walls, windows to the water view, and rattan furniture from the fifties positioned on wide-planked pine floors. The overstuffed cushions were in muted tones of celery and rose and white. \u201cOh, you\u2019re early!\u201d she said, stepping aside to let them in to a living room strewn with toys and books and DVDs.</p><p>Lulu jumped up from her place on the cream-colored shag rug. She was wearing the kitten headband.</p><p>\u201cSomeone has embraced her invisibility,\u201d Mila said quietly, smiling.</p><p>Jolene frowned thoughtfully and made a great show of looking around. \u201cHmmm ... Mila, have you seen Lulu? I wonder what happened to my kitten? Has anyone seen my Lucy Louida?\u201d</p><p>Lulu giggled.</p><p>Michael frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about? She\u2019s right\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lulu whipped off the headband and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m here, Mommy!\u201d</p><p>Jolene rushed forward and took Lulu in her arms. \u201cYou sure are.\u201d Jolene buried her nose in Lulu\u2019s velvety neck, smelling her little girl sweetness, trying to memorize it.</p><p>\u201cMommy,\u201d Lulu whined, kicking to be free. \u201cYou\u2019re smovering me.\u201d</p><p>Jolene loosened her hold on Lulu, let her wiggle to the floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Mila asked, picking up an empty DVD case, frowning, looking around for the disc.</p><p>\u201cActually, we have something to tell you and the girls,\u201d Michael said tightly.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Mila looked up. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Michael actually stepped aside. \u201cThis is Jolene\u2019s show, Ma. She\u2019s the one with the news.\u201d</p><p>Mila frowned. \u201cJo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Betsy?\u201d Jolene said, unable to get much volume out of her voice. She could fly helicopters and shoot machine guns and run ten miles with a full pack on her back, but the thought of saying these few words to her children made her feel weak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get her,\u201d Lulu said and ran off, screaming, \u201cBet\u2014sy! Get out here!\u201d</p><p>Mila looked from Jolene to Michael, and back to Jolene. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Betsy came into the living room, trailing behind Lulu, looking sleepy, rubbing her eyes. She was wearing a huge tee shirt and white ankle socks. \u201cWhy did you wake me up?\u201d</p><p>Jolene picked Lulu up, carried her to the sofa, and sat down. \u201cHave a seat, Betsy. We need to talk to you guys. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Michael sat down on the sofa beside Jolene.</p><p>Betsy stopped suddenly. \u201cAre you getting divorced?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElizabeth Andrea,\u201d Mila said. \u201cWhy would you say such a\u2014\u201d</p><p>Michael sighed. \u201cJust sit down, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>Betsy knelt on the ivory-colored shag rug in front of them, crossing her arms, jutting her chin out. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>They were all looking at Jolene. She almost lost her nerve; she looked at Michael, who shrugged.</p><p>She was alone in this. What a surprise. With a sigh, Jolene looked at Betsy and then down at Lulu. \u201cYou remember the story I told you about when I joined the army?\u201d she said. \u201cI was eighteen and had no direction. My parents had just died. I was so alone. You can\u2019t imagine how alone. Anyway, you all were a dream I had, but of course, you were in my future then.\u201d</p> <p>Betsy sighed impatiently. \u201cDuh. Can I go back to sleep now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this well,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cJust tell them,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>Lulu started bouncing on Jolene\u2019s lap. \u201cTell us what?\u201d</p><p>Jolene took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to Iraq to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Betsy said, clambering to her feet.</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jolene,\u201d Mila whispered, bringing a hand to her mouth. She sank into the celery-colored, overstuffed chair by the window.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cOh my God, no one has a mom in the war. Will people know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your concern?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>Jolene was losing control of this.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a mom,\u201d Betsy cried out. \u201cI need you here. What if you get killed?\u201d</p><p>Lulu\u2019s eyes filled up with tears. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d Jolene said, trying to keep her voice even. \u201cI\u2019m a woman. They don\u2019t let women in combat situations. I\u2019ll be flying VIPs around, moving supplies. I\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. You can\u2019t know that,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cTell them you won\u2019t go. Please, Mommy...\u201d</p><p>At that, the small Mommy, Jolene felt a tearing in her heart. She wanted to hold Betsy close, reassure her, but what comfort could she offer? This was a time for strength. \u201cI have to go. It\u2019s my job,\u201d Jolene said at last.</p><p>\u201cIf you go I won\u2019t forgive you,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cI swear I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cYou love the army more than us,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>Beside her, Michael made a sound. Jolene ignored him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Bets,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou and Lulu are the air in my lungs. The blood in my veins. Without you, my heart stops. But I have to do this. Lots of working women have to leave their kids sometimes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Betsy screamed. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid. Do those moms get shot at on their business trips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come home, right, Mommy?\u201d Lulu asked, biting her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cOf course I will,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cDon\u2019t I always? And in November I\u2019ll be home for two weeks. Maybe we could even go to Disneyland. Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Betsy said and ran out of the room, slamming the door shut behind her.</p><p>Mila got slowly to her feet. She started to walk toward Jolene, then stopped dead, as if she couldn\u2019t make her legs work quite right. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d she asked. Her voice wobbled with the effort to appear strong.</p><p>\u201cOne year,\u201d Michael answered.</p><p>Lulu frowned. \u201cHow long is a year? Is that like next week?\u201d</p><p>Jolene turned to her husband. \u201cMaybe you should talk to Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? What the hell am I supposed to say to her?\u201d</p><p>That single question brought it all crashing down on Jolene and scared her as much as everything else combined. How would he be a single father? Would his children be able to count on him in a way that Jolene no longer could?</p><p>Jolene stood up. She tried to put Lulu down, but the child clung like a barnacle. So she said nothing to Michael or Mila, just walked out of the living room and down the hallway to the guest bedroom, carrying Lulu. It wasn\u2019t ideal, trying to talk to the girls together, but nothing was ideal about this situation.</p><p>She knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Betsy yelled.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Jolene answered. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to talk now.\u201d She waited a moment, collected herself, and then went into the room, which was papered in a wild 1970s foil paper and decorated with a collection of whitewashed furniture.</p><p>Betsy sat on one of the wicker twin beds with her knees drawn up. She looked royally pissed off.</p><p>\u201cCan I sit down?\u201d Jolene asked.</p><p>Betsy nodded mulishly and scooted sideways. Jolene and Lulu sat down beside her. Jolene wanted to jump into the ice-cold water of the conversation, but she knew Betsy needed to find a way through this, so she waited quietly, stroking Lulu\u2019s hair.</p><p>Finally Betsy said, \u201cMoms aren\u2019t supposed to leave their children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jolene said, feeling the sharp point of those words sink deep into her. \u201cThey aren\u2019t. And I\u2019m sorry, baby. I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you said you wouldn\u2019t go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d court-martial me and put me in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019d be alive.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked at her daughter. There it was, the fear that lay beneath the adolescent fury. \u201cIt\u2019s my job as a mom to keep you safe and be with you and help you grow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s also my job to show you what kind of person to be, to teach you by example. What lesson would I teach you if I ran from a commitment I made? If I was cowardly or dishonorable? When you make a promise in this life, you keep it, even if it scares you or hurts you or makes you sad. I made a promise a long time ago, and now it\u2019s time to keep that promise, even if it breaks my heart to leave you and Lulu, and it does ... break my heart.\u201d</p><p>Jolene willed her tears away. Nothing in her life had ever hurt like this, not even hearing Michael say he didn\u2019t love her anymore. But she had to keep going, had to make her daughter understand. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up safe and loved, so you can\u2019t know how it feels to be truly alone in the world. When I joined the army, I had nothing. Nothing. No one. I was all alone in the world. And now my friends need me\u2014Tami, Smitty, Jamie. The rest of the Raptors. I have to be there for them. And the country needs me. I know you\u2019re young for all this, but I believe in keeping America safe. I really do. I have to keep my promise. Can you understand that?\u201d</p><p>Tears sprang into Betsy\u2019s eyes. Her lower lip trembled mutinously. \u201cI need you,\u201d she said in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jolene said, \u201cand I need you, baby. So much...\u201d Her voice caught again; she had to clear her throat to keep going. \u201cBut we\u2019ll talk on the phone and e-mail, and maybe we\u2019ll even write good old-fashioned letters. I\u2019ll be home before you know it.\u201d</p><p>Lulu tugged on her sleeve. \u201cYou\u2019ll be home before I start kindergarten, right?\u201d</p><p>Jolene closed her eyes. How was she going to do this, really?</p><p>\u201cMommy?\u201d Lulu said, her voice shaking.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jolene said finally. \u201cNot for kindergarten, Lulu, but your daddy will be home for that...\u201d</p><p>Lulu started to cry.</p><p>Michael sat on the couch, alone now, and looked up at his mother. He could see the concern in her eyes, the unasked question. She wondered why he was out here while Jolene was handling this alone.</p><p>She stared at him for a long, assessing moment. Then she walked out of the living room and came back a few minutes later, carrying a cup of coffee in one hand and a plate full of baklava in the other. Of course. Food. Her answer to everything.</p><p>She put the cup and plate on the table beside him and then sat down on the sofa next to him. She placed her hand on his knee. \u201cWhen I was young ... during the war ... it was a terrible time in Greece. My father and uncles and cousins were all gone. Many of them did not come back. The family stayed strong, though, and faith kept us together.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He\u2019d heard her stories all his life. World War II had seemed distant to him, barely understandable; now he thought of the relatives he\u2019d lost to enemy fire. They\u2019d been just names in a book before. Without thinking, he reached over for a baklava and began eating it. God, he wished his father were here now.</p><p>\u201cI will move into the house and take care of the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ma. There\u2019s no bedroom for you, and you\u2019ve got the Thumb. I\u2019ll hire someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly will not. No stranger will take care of my grandbabies. I will hire another part-time employee for the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe store can\u2019t afford that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can. I will be at your house after school each weekday. I\u2019ll pick Lulu up from preschool and meet Betsy\u2019s bus. We will be just fine. You can count on me, and the girls will count on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day, Ma? That\u2019s a big job.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI am a big woman, as you may have noticed. I need to help you, Michael. Let me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to respond: he still couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around how completely his world had changed.</p><p>\u201cThese are details, though, and not the thing that matters most.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cYou should be with her now, telling your children they will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they ... be fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your children you should be worrying about right now, Michael. Their time will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jo?\u201d he said. \u201cWill she be fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a lioness, our Jolene.\u201d</p><p>Michael could only nod.</p><p>\u201cAlready you are letting her down. Your father was like this, God rest his soul. He was selfish. This is a time for you to see beyond yourself.\u201d She touched his cheek, resting her knuckles against his skin as she\u2019d done so often in his youth. \u201cYou be proud of her, Michael.\u201d</p><p>He knew he was supposed to nod and agree and say that of course he was proud of his wife, but he couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what needs to be done,\u201d he said instead, and knew that he\u2019d disappointed his mother.</p><p>How many more people would he let down before this was over?</p><p>Michael spent the weekend watching his life as if from a distance. Betsy alternated between being blazingly pissed off and desperately clingy. Lulu was so confused she became overwrought and cried at everything. Michael couldn\u2019t bear any of it, could hardly look at the pain in his daughters\u2019 eyes, but Jolene was a warrior, as strong as tested steel. He saw how carefully she treated the girls, how tenderly. It was only when they weren\u2019t looking that her pain was revealed; tears welled in her green eyes, and when they did she turned away quickly, dashing the moisture away with the back of her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An hour ago, she\u2019d put them to bed. God forgive him, but Michael had let her do it alone.</p><p>Now he was in the family room, standing in front of the fireplace. Bright orange and blue flames danced across a tepee of logs, sending off waves of heat, and yet still he was cold. Frozen, really.</p><p>He glanced through the kitchen. In the window above the sink, he could see moonlight skating across the bay.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re asleep,\u201d Jolene said, coming into the room. \u201cWe can talk now.\u201d</p> <p>Michael wanted to say no, I don\u2019t want to talk, not about this, not yet, not anymore. He knew it was selfish of him, and small, but it pissed him off to be left here as Mr. Mom. Not that he could tell anyone this. He\u2019d look like an asshole if he admitted that he didn\u2019t want this job that had fallen in his lap, didn\u2019t know if he could even do it. How was he supposed to manage a sixteen-person legal firm, defend his clients, and handle the day-to-day minutiae that came with raising two kids? Carpool. Field trips. Meals. Laundry. Homework.</p><p>Just the thought of it overwhelmed him.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to do it?\u201d he said, turning to her. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom will be a huge help. She said she\u2019ll hire someone for the store, and that\u2019s perfect. I don\u2019t want a nanny taking care of the girls\u2014they\u2019ll be so scared and confused,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cEspecially Betsy, she\u2019s fragile these days, and kids can be cruel. She\u2019ll need you, Michael. They both will. You\u2019ll have to be really present. I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want.\u201d Already he was losing patience with that sentence. \u201cClassic, Jo. You\u2019re the one leaving\u2014but not before you tell me how you want me to handle things while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot things, Michael. My children.\u201d</p><p>He heard the way her voice broke on that and knew how deeply his words had cut her. Not that long ago, he would have turned to her and taken her in his arms and apologized. Now, he just stood there, dropping his chin forward, staring dully at the scuffed hardwood floor beneath his stockinged feet. The echo of that word\u2014divorce\u2014hung like smoke in the air between them.</p><p>She waited a long time. Her breath sounded like waves breaking along a shore, ragged and uneven. He could feel her judging him. Then, quietly, she left the room.</p><p>On Monday morning, Tami showed up after carpool, and honked her horn.</p><p>Jolene walked down the driveway and climbed into her friend\u2019s big white truck.</p><p>They looked at each other, and in that look\u2014unaccompanied by words\u2014they revealed their fears, their hopes, their worries.</p> <p>Tami sighed. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrutal,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cFor you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely survived.\u201d She put the truck in reverse and backed down the driveway. In no time, they were speeding down the interstate toward Tacoma.</p><p>\u201cSeth tried to act cool when I told him,\u201d Tami said after an unfamiliar silence that had gone on for miles. \u201cHe asked what would happen if I didn\u2019t come back. He\u2019s not even thirteen. He\u2019s not supposed to have to ask his mom a question like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy was pissed off. She said she wouldn\u2019t forgive me if I left her. That I love the army more than I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl cried,\u201d Tami said softly after another long silence. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him cry before. It was like...\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cMan, this is hard.\u201d</p><p>Jolene swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse,\u201d she said quietly, \u201ca man who cries when you go to war or one who doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>At that, they both fell silent. The miles passed quickly, and in no time, they were at the post, driving up to the checkpoint.</p> <p>They handed over their IDs, nodded to the soldier, and drove onto the post.</p><p>In the hallway outside the Black Hawk classroom, they found several members of the unit seated in chairs along the wall. No one was saying much of anything, except for the younger men, who seemed amped up and eager. Smitty\u2014young, young Smitty, with his braces and pimples and puppy-dog buoyancy\u2014was grinning, going from man to man, asking what combat was like, saying they were going to kick some ass over there. Jolene wondered how his mother felt right now ...</p><p>Jolene and Tami leaned back against the concrete-block wall, waiting their turns.</p><p>The classroom door opened. Jamie Hix strode out. His army-issue hair\u2014short and dirty blond\u2014stood up from his tanned, broad forehead. Lines fanned out from the corners of his gray eyes\u2014they were new, those lines, etched in the days since their deployment had been announced. No doubt he was thinking about his young son. Would his ex-wife use this deployment to take his son away from him? \u201cYour turn, Jo,\u201d he said.</p><p>With a nod, Jolene walked into the classroom, where she found a man in dress uniform seated at a long desk with papers spread out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cChief Zarkades?\u201d he said, looking up at her. \u201cAt ease. Have a seat. I\u2019m Captain Reynolds. Jeff.\u201d</p><p>She sat down in a chair facing him, her back ramrod straight, her hands in her lap.</p><p>He pushed a stack of papers toward her. \u201cYour family plan is in place. Your daughters, Elizabeth Andrea Zarkades and Lucy Louida Zarkades, will be cared for by your husband, Michael Andreas Zarkades. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother-in-law is also available, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>The lawyer looked down at the paper, tapped his pen. \u201cDeployment can be difficult on a marriage, Chief. Is there any cause to worry about this plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>The captain looked up. \u201cDo you have a will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m married to an attorney, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He pushed a stack of papers toward her. \u201cSign and date your family plan. And the funeral arrangement addendum. I assume you want Michael notified in the case of your death. Anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, Chief. That\u2019s all. Dismissed.\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Chief? We recommend you write letters ... to your loved ones.\u201d</p><p>Jolene nodded. Letters. Good-byes. They recommended she write letters in which she said good-bye to the people she loved most in this world. She tried to imagine that ... Betsy opening a letter one day in the blurry future, seeing her mother\u2019s handwriting, reading her last words\u2014and what would they be, those last words, written now, before she knew all that she had to say, before they\u2019d had this lifetime together? Lulu would be crying, wailing, yelling, What? She\u2019s gone where? her small heart-shaped face scrunching up, tears forming in her dark eyes as she tried to understand what that even meant.</p><p>\u201cBe safe, Chief. God bless.\u201d</p><p>The next two weeks passed so quickly Jolene half expected to hear a sonic boom echoing along behind. She wrote and edited and rewrote at least a dozen to-do lists, filled a three-ring binder with every bit of information she could think of. She canceled the magazines she wouldn\u2019t receive, hired a neighbor\u2019s son to mow the grass in the summer and check the generator next winter, and she paid as many bills in advance as possible. All of this she did at night; during the day she was at the post, preparing to go off to war. She and her unit flew so many hours they had begun to breathe as one. By the first of May, she\u2014and the rest of the unit\u2014were actually getting itchy to leave. If they were going to do this thing, they wanted to go. It was the only way they\u2019d start marking off the time until their return.</p><p>At home, life was an endless series of poignant moments and elongated good-byes. Every look, every hug, every kiss took on the weight of sorrow. Jolene didn\u2019t know how much longer she could stand it. Every time she looked at her babies, her throat tightened.</p><p>And then there was Michael.</p><p>In this short time they had left together, he had pulled away even further, spent even more time at the office. She rarely caught him looking at her, and when she did she saw resentment in his eyes and he looked away quickly. She had tried to talk to him about all of it, the deployment, her feelings, his feelings, her fear, but every volley had been met with retreat until finally, exhausted, she\u2019d given up.</p><p>It seemed he\u2019d told her the truth: he didn\u2019t love her anymore.</p><p>Sometimes, late at night, when she lay in bed beside him, unable to sleep, afraid to touch him and aching for him to touch her, she wondered if she even cared anymore. She wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, interpret his coldness as fear and concern, but in the end her innate optimism failed her. She needed him now, maybe for the first time, and he had let her down. Just like her parents.</p><p>Tonight, after a long day at the post, hours spent getting ready to leave, she pulled her SUV up into the garage and parked, sitting in the darkness for the minutes it took to find strength. When she felt sure she could be herself, she got out of the car and went inside.</p><p>The house was filled with golden light and the scent of lamb stewing in tomato and spices. A hint of cinnamon sweetened the air. She could hear the girls talking somewhere, but their voices were muted. No one seemed to have much to say these days. They were all holding their breath for the last good-bye. Betsy had taken it particularly hard; she\u2019d begun acting out, throwing tantrums, slamming doors. Supposedly someone in class had made fun of her for having a mom who was going off to fight \u201cin that stupid war,\u201d and Betsy had had a near breakdown. She\u2019d come home begging Jolene to quit the military.</p><p>Jolene hung her coat on a hook in the mudroom and went into the kitchen, where she found Mila at the sink, washing up the dinner dishes. Michael was still at work\u2014lately, he rarely got home before ten o\u2019clock.</p><p>At 8:10, the sun was beginning to set; the view through the window looked like a Monet painting, all bronze and gold and lavender pieces juxtaposed together.</p><p>Jolene came up behind Mila, getting a waft of the woman\u2019s rose-scented shampoo as she touched her shoulder. \u201cHey, Mila. Moussaka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It is your favorite.\u201d</p><p>That was all it took these days for Jolene to feel melancholy. She squeezed her mother-in-law\u2019s upper arm. \u201cThanks for coming over tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours is in the fridge. It needs about three minutes in the microwave,\u201d Mila said, drying the last plate, setting it on the counter. \u201cHow was training today?\u201d</p><p>Jolene drew back. \u201cGreat. I couldn\u2019t be more ready to handle myself over there.\u201d</p><p>Mila turned, looked up at her. \u201cPretend with Betsy and Lulu and even my son, if you must, but not with me, Jo. I don\u2019t need your strength. You need mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can tell you I\u2019m a little afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget, Jo, I have lived through a war before. In Greece. The soldiers saved our lives. I am proud of what you are doing, and I will make sure your daughters are proud, too.\u201d</p><p>It meant so much to hear those few simple words. \u201cAnd your son?\u201d Jolene asked at last.</p><p>\u201cHe is a man, and he is afraid. This is not a good combination. He loves you, though. This I know. And you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that enough?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLove? It is always enough, kardia mou.\u201d</p><p>Love. Jolene turned the word around in her mind, wondering if Mila was right, if love was enough at a time like this.</p><p>\u201cWe will be waiting for you to come home, safe and sound. Do not worry about us.\u201d</p><p>Jolene knew that she had no choice in this matter. She had to let go of the people she loved back here. She could miss her family, but the emotion\u2014the longing\u2014would have to be buried deep. \u201cI can do it,\u201d she said quietly. She\u2019d been compartmentalizing her emotions all her life. She knew how to put fear and longing in a box and hide it away. \u201cI have to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy son will rise to the occasion,\u201d Mila said. \u201cHe is like his father in that way. Michael would never shirk his duty. He will not let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Mila smiled. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>During the first week of May, Michael handled the Keller arraignment, put in a not guilty plea to the charge of murder in the first degree, and set about discovery on the case. He needed to find all the facts he could\u2014and his client still wasn\u2019t talking. Keith had said \u201cI\u2019m guilty\u201d that day in the jailhouse interview and then pretty much gone silent again, responding to each of Michael\u2019s questions with a glazed look. Now and then he mumbled, \u201cI killed her,\u201d but that was it. And hardly helpful.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at home, Jolene kept handing him to-do lists. Every time she caught his eye, she rapid-fired some chore at him: don\u2019t forget to wrap the pipes in November ... to fertilize the plants ... to clean the barbecue grates. This was how she filled their evenings together. During the day she was at the post, preparing to go off to war. He could tell that she was starting to get itchy to leave. Last night she\u2019d told him she wanted to go, do this thing so it could be over, and I can come back.</p><p>Soon she\u2019d have her wish.</p><p>In two days he would say good-bye to his wife, watch her walk onto a military bus and disappear.</p><p>He wanted to be stoic and sturdy and true. But he\u2019d learned something about himself in the last month: he was selfish. He was also worried and scared and pissed off. Truth be told, he was pissed off most of all. He was angry that she had chosen the military over their family, angry that she hadn\u2019t quit years ago, angry that he had no choice in any of this.</p><p>He\u2019d gone to the ridiculous family-readiness group meeting that Jolene had recommended. What a debacle that had been. He\u2019d been running late all day, and getting to the meeting was no exception. He\u2019d been breathless when he finally arrived, a little harried, going through the papers in his briefcase, looking for the contact name when he walked into the room.</p><p>Women. That was what he saw. There had to be at least fifty women in the room; most were busy wrangling screaming, crying children. On an easel, a big poster board read: Support Your Soldier. Below it was a bullet-pointed list. Care Packages. Phone Calls. Loneliness. Sex. Financial Help. As if he were going to talk to these strangers about the problems he encountered with his wife\u2019s deployment.</p> <p>At his entrance, every woman in the room looked up. The place fell silent.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cwrong place,\u201d and left.</p><p>He\u2019d had no intention of sitting in that room, hearing those women talk about how to be good wives while their soldiers were gone.</p><p>Everywhere he went, it seemed the news preceded him. He hated the way people looked at him when they heard Jolene was going to Iraq. Your wife is going off to war? He could see them frowning, picturing him in an apron, mixing cake batter in a silver bowl. His liberal, intellectual friends didn\u2019t know what to make of it. They quickly turned the conversation to George W. and the politics behind the war, concluding that she was risking her life for nothing. And just what in the hell was Michael supposed to say about any of it?</p><p>He knew he could support the warriors and not the war. That was the position he was supposed to take, the honorable position, but he couldn\u2019t do it with regard to his wife. He couldn\u2019t make himself support her decision.</p><p>She knew it, too, recognized his anger and his resentment. They knew each other too well to hide such contaminated emotions. Without love to protect them, they were both as raw as burn victims; every touch hurt.</p><p>So he didn\u2019t look at her, never touched her, and buried himself in work. That was how he\u2019d survived the last two weeks. Absence. He left for work early and stayed as late as possible. At night, he and Jolene lay on separate sides of the bed, breathing into the darkness, saying nothing, not reaching out. Neither of them was sleeping much, but both pretended to find solace there. Jolene had reached out for him just once, wanting to make love, saying quietly, I\u2019m leaving, Michael. He\u2019d turned away, too angry with her to attempt intimacy. The next morning, he\u2019d seen the pain and humiliation in her eyes, and it shamed him, but he couldn\u2019t change the way he felt.</p><p>On his desk, the intercom buzzed. It was his secretary telling him that the King County prosecuting attorney was here, on time, for their appointment.</p> <p>\u201cSend him in,\u201d Michael said, straightening in his chair.</p><p>Brad Hilderbrand, the prosecuting attorney, strode into the office. Michael knew Brad well: beneath the politician\u2019s slick veneer beat the heart of a zealot. Brad had been elected to be hard on crime and harder on criminals, and he did his job well because he believed in the party line. \u201cMichael,\u201d he said, smiling, his hand outstretched.</p><p>They shook hands. Michael could tell from Brad\u2019s smile that there was trouble coming.</p><p>\u201cI want to let you know that a witness has come forward in the Keller case,\u201d Brad said. \u201cIn the interest of full disclosure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a possible plea bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted you to have the information as soon as possible. Keller confessed. That\u2019s why I brought it down myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He tossed a manila file folder on the desk. \u201cThat\u2019s Terry Weiner\u2019s statement. He is Keller\u2019s cell mate.\u201d</p><p>The courthouse snitch. Ever popular with prosecutors and police. \u201cSo let me get this straight. You\u2019re suggesting that Keith Keller, who in the past few weeks of his incarceration has not spoken to his father, his lawyer, or the court-appointed psychiatrist, suddenly opened up to his cell mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said\u2014and I quote: \u2018The bitch wouldn\u2019t shut up, so I smoked her.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort, to the point, and easy to remember. I see. And let me guess, the so-called witness has been let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was only in for possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drug addict. Perfect.\u201d Michael picked up the manila folder and opened it, skimming the statement. \u201cI\u2019ll need a copy of the wit\u2019s arrest record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it sent over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this little bit of fiction all you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plenty, Michael, and we both know it.\u201d Brad paused meaningfully, looked at him. \u201cI heard about your wife. Going off to war, huh? I didn\u2019t know you were a military family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA military family? I wouldn\u2019t call us that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That seems odd. Anyway, I guess you\u2019re going to have your hands full with the kids.\u201d</p><p>Was there a smirk in Brad\u2019s voice? \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Brad. I can drive carpool, make dinner, and still kick your ass across the courtroom.\u201d</p><p>After dinner, Jolene stood at the kitchen sink with her hands deep in the hot, soapy water, staring out at the view from her own backyard. It was impossibly beautiful tonight\u2014a star-spangled sky, waves dipped in moonlight, fence rails that seemed to glow from within. She knew that if she closed her eyes, she would recall a thousand memories played out across this very view, hear her daughters\u2019 laughter, feel a small hand pulling at hers.</p><p>Good-bye. She\u2019d said it in her mind so many times in the past two weeks. To views, memories, moments, pictures, people. She had spent hours trying to memorize all of it so that she could take it with her, a scrapbook in her mind of the life she\u2019d left behind ... the life that was waiting for her.</p><p>She pulled her hands out of the water, dried them off, and let the water out of the sink. Then, slowly, she left the empty kitchen.</p><p>The family room was brightly lit\u2014every light was on and a fire danced in the grate\u2014and the television played a sitcom that no one was watching. She turned off the TV and hated the sudden silence, so she turned it back on again. Walking up the stairs, she noticed the creaking sound of the risers and kept going. Betsy was in her room, doing homework, and Lulu was asleep already. She paused at Betsy\u2019s door, let her fingertips brush the oak door. She had the idea to go in, to sit with her older daughter and try again to make her understand this deployment. But there was something else to do tonight\u2014something she\u2019d already put off as long as she could.</p><p>She went into her bedroom, turned on the light, and closed the door. As she stood there, looking at the room she shared with her husband, memories came to her. That\u2019s the bed, Michael, let\u2019s get it ... look how sturdy it is, we can make babies in that bed ... And the dresser they\u2019d found at a garage sale in the old days, and the oriental rug that had been their first major purchase.</p><p>With a sigh, she went to the dresser and fished the video camera out of her sock drawer. Setting it up on the tripod she\u2019d bought, she aimed the lens at the big king-sized bed, then hit the Record button. Climbing into bed, puffing the pillows up around her, she forced a smile, as if this were an ordinary bedtime story. \u201cHey, Lulu.\u201d Her voice snagged. She drew in a deep breath, and tried again. \u201cI\u2019m making this tape for you.\u201d She held up Lulu\u2019s favorite book, Professor Wormbog in Search for the Zipperump-a-Zoo. Opening the big colorful book, she began to read the story out loud, using all the voices and drama at her command. When she was done, she closed the book and looked into the camera, tears stinging her eyes. \u201cLucy Louida, I love you to the moon and back. Sleep tight, baby girl. I\u2019ll be home before you know it.\u201d</p><p>She climbed out of the bed and snapped the camera off. She removed that tape and put in another one. This time, she sat at the end of the bed and looked directly into the camera. \u201cBetsy,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to say good-bye to you. I know how much you need me right now. You\u2019re dealing with so much stuff at school, and I want to give you all the advice you\u2019ll ever need to get through life, but we don\u2019t have time for that, do we? How can we not have time?\u201d She sighed. \u201cI know you\u2019re mad at me, Lil Bit, and I\u2019m so so sorry for that. I only hope that someday you\u2019ll understand. Maybe you\u2019ll even be proud of me, as I am proud of you. So proud of you. You\u2019re strong and beautiful and smart and loyal. You will have a lot of hills to climb while I\u2019m gone, and it will be hard. I know it will be hard. But you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Jolene closed her eyes for just a moment, thinking that there was so much more she wanted to say. For the next ten minutes, she gave her daughter the best advice she could, about boys and girls and classes and starting your period and wearing makeup. When she came to the end of it all, she was drained. There was so much more ... and no time. \u201cI love you, Betsy, to the moon and back. And I know you love me. I know,\u201d she said simply, and she smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rising tiredly, she went to the camera and changed the tape again. This time, it was for Michael, but as she sat at the end of the bed, looking up into that small black lens, she felt a rush of loss. After all their years together, she had no idea what to say to him now and no idea if he would even listen or care. She got up and turned off the camera. She placed the two tapes on her dresser, writing LULU on one and BETSY on the other.</p><p>And now.</p><p>She went to the desk in the corner of the room, remembering the day she\u2019d found it, how Michael had laughed and said, It\u2019s the ugliest thing ever, how many times has it been painted? And she\u2019d taken his hand and pulled him toward it and said, Look deeper, baby.</p><p>She sat down at the desk and opened the bottom drawer. In it was the green metal lockbox that she\u2019d bought specifically for her deployment. She lifted it out, set it on the burnished mahogany desktop. Then she took out the stationery she\u2019d bought this week and set about the task of writing her last letters. Hopefully, they would never be read.</p> <p>To my beloved Elizabeth Andrea, writing this letter is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. Not because I don\u2019t know what to say (although I don\u2019t, not really), but because I cannot stand the idea that you will read it, that I will be gone, that you will know how it feels to be a motherless girl ...</p><p>She wrote and wrote and wrote, through her tears, until she couldn\u2019t find a single additional word to say. And still it wasn\u2019t enough. When she finished, her hands were trembling. Lulu\u2019s letter was no easier; with every word written, Jolene thought about a child who would forget her mother almost completely ...</p><p>Michael, she wrote at last in this third letter, pausing, her pen held above the paper, her tears dripping now, hitting the paper in small gray bursts. I loved you, beginning to end. Take care of our babies ... teach them to remember me.</p><p>She folded the letters, slipped each one into its own envelope, and put them in the metal box along with her wallet and her driver\u2019s license.</p><p>After she put the lockbox away and closed the drawer, she sat there, staring out at the night, feeling empty. She got to her feet\u2014she was unsteady now, weak in the knees\u2014and went to her closet, where she found her big green army-issued duffle bag. Throwing it onto the bed, she began to pack.</p> <p>She was so intent on finding the things she had put on her list and folding her uniforms in precise thirds that she didn\u2019t hear a knock at the door, but suddenly Betsy was beside her, staring down at the gaping duffle bag, unzipped and full of desert camo ACUs and sand-colored boots and army-green tee shirts.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bets,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>Betsy walked woodenly toward the bed, her gaze fastened on the small silver tangle of dog tags that lay beside the duffle bag. She picked them up, looked down at the rectangular bit of steel that recorded the facts of Jolene\u2019s service.</p><p>\u201cSierra said you were going to kill people,\u201d she said softly, her voice catching. \u201cAnd then Todd laughed and said, \u2018No she won\u2019t, women can\u2019t shoot\u2014everyone knows that.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a movie once, where a soldier was identified by dog tags. Is that what they\u2019re for? To identify you?\u201d Her eyes filled with tears.</p> <p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to me, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be going.\u201d</p><p>Jolene swallowed hard. She wanted to pull Betsy into her arms and hold her tightly and vow to stay home. \u201cI wish I weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear you\u2019ll come home okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Betsy...\u201d Jolene tried to find the right words, the way to make an unkeepable promise to a girl who would never forget what was said right now. \u201cI love you so much...\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked stricken. She made a strangled sound and burst into tears and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a promise!\u201d Then she threw the dog tags to the floor and ran out of the room and slammed the door shut behind her.</p><p>Jolene bent slowly to retrieve her dog tags. Putting them around her neck, she sighed tiredly. She would finish packing and then go to Betsy, and try\u2014again\u2014to make her daughter understand.</p><p>Tonight was their last night together. Jolene had spent the day with her daughters. She\u2019d let Betsy skip school. The three of them had seen a movie, gone ice-skating, and had lunch at Red Robin.</p> <p>Now the sun was beginning to set.</p><p>Jolene had a plan for this last evening together. She wanted to go to the Crab Pot for dinner. They needed\u2014she needed\u2014one last perfect memory to carry forward like an amulet into the separation that was coming.</p><p>For years, the Crab Pot had been \u201ctheir\u201d restaurant. In the hot, lazy days of a Northwest summer, they\u2019d walked there, strolled along the beach at low tide, often having contests along the way. There were prizes awarded, usually a two-scoop ice cream cone, for the first one to find an agate, a sand dollar, a perfect white rock.</p><p>In years past, Michael had come with them. He\u2019d carried brightly colored buckets, plastic shovels, armloads of towels, and bags of sunscreen. But in the months since his father\u2019s death, he\u2019d changed. Maybe if he could go back in time for just a second, just long enough to remember, he could give Jolene the one thing she needed most tonight: her family together before she left. She needed to know that Michael would do a good job with the girls, and that he would be waiting for her return, that she still had a husband to come home to.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Jolene said again. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Crab Pot for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Only Lulu cheered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too cold,\u201d Betsy said, thumbing through the songs on her iPod, adjusting her earbuds. \u201cNo one goes to the Pot until summer. Only old people will be there.\u201d</p><p>Michael pointed the remote at the TV, flipping through channels. In the silence, he shrugged.</p><p>That was enough agreement for Jolene. \u201cPerfect. We\u2019re going, then. Get your coats, guys. It might be cold out.\u201d She spent the next ten minutes herding her family through the checklist\u2014coats, boots, and blankets. She threw four beach chairs in the back of her car, just in case, and ten minutes later they were driving down the winding road that followed the shoreline.</p><p>The Crab Pot diner was a local institution. Built fifty years ago by a Norwegian fisherman, it was a small, shingled building positioned on a perfect lip of land between the road and the sand. A weathered gray deck fanned out all around it, decorated with picnic tables and surrounded by fencing draped in fishing nets and strung with Christmas lights. In the summer, red and white plastic tablecloths covered the tables, but in the off-season, when only the locals stopped by, the tables were bare.</p><p>Inside, the uneven floor was a thick layer of sand, reportedly brought in from the wild coast near Kalaloch. The wooden walls were barely visible beneath multicolored bits of memorabilia\u2014pictures, expired fishing licenses, dollar bills. Whatever someone wanted to tack up was fine. There were even a few bras and panties stuck in amidst the papers.</p><p>Lulu knew just where to go. She marched into the place as if she owned it, went right to the window by the cash register, and pointed up. \u201cThat\u2019s us,\u201d she said to anyone who might be listening. There were only a few patrons in the restaurant, and none of them looked up.</p><p>The waitress, a white-haired woman who\u2019d been there as long as anyone could remember, said, \u201cOf course it is, Lulu. It\u2019s my favorite picture of you, too.\u201d</p><p>Lulu beamed.</p><p>The waitress\u2014Inga\u2014led them to a table by the door. \u201cYou want the usual?\u201d she asked, pulling a pen out of her hair. It was just for show, that pen; no one had ever seen Inga actually write down an order.</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Jolene said, trying to sound happy. \u201cTwo Dungeness crabs, four drawn butters, and two orders of garlic bread.\u201d</p><p>They took their places on the twin benches\u2014Michael and Betsy on one side, Lulu and Jolene on the other. All through the meal, Jolene tried to keep up a lively conversation, but, honestly, by the time they were taking off their plastic bibs, she was disheartened. Really, only she and Lulu had talked. Michael and Betsy had pretty much communicated by shrugs and grunts. They were both unhappy on this last night, and they wanted Jolene to know it. At least that was what she figured. Michael was paying the bill when the Flynns walked into the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Betsy said, slumping forward in her seat, letting her hair fall across her face.</p><p>\u201cTami!\u201d Jolene got to her feet and stepped around the table, hugging her friend tightly. She should have known they\u2019d all show up here together. Pulling back, she smiled, said, \u201cPhoto op!\u201d</p><p>Tami and Seth and Carl immediately came together, looped their arms around each other and smiled brightly for the camera. Jolene captured their image in the clunky old Polaroid camera the Crab Pot kept for its guests\u2019 use. It was another part of their tradition; every visit included a family photo to be tacked on the wall. \u201cGot it,\u201d she said. The Flynns gathered around her, watching their picture develop. When it was done\u2014and it was a good one\u2014Carl pinned it to the wall by the door.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d Tami said, taking the camera from Jolene.</p><p>Jolene gathered with her family, put her arm around Betsy (how thin her elder daughter was, how gangly) and Lulu (her baby). Michael stepped in behind her. At Tami\u2019s say cheese, they smiled.</p><p>Flash.</p><p>Then Betsy and Michael drifted away, went outside. Jolene stood there, watching them leave.</p><p>Tami took her hand, squeezed it. \u201cHey there,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Jolene shook her head a little, forced a smile. They walked out to the deck, still holding hands. By now, it was dark. A full moon illuminated the sharp, jagged, snow-covered peaks and sent streamers across the waves.</p><p>At the end of the deck, Carl stood beside Michael. Even from here, it was easy to see how uncomfortable they were with each other, these two men with nothing in common except their wives\u2019 friendship. Michael\u2019s hands were shoved deep in his pockets; he bounced slightly on the balls of his feet. The cool night air ruffled his black hair.</p><p>Seth walked down to the beach with Lulu. At the waterline, they crouched down, looking at something. Jolene could tell that Betsy wanted to follow, but she held back.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Betsy,\u201d Jolene urged quietly. It took a moment, but Betsy finally started moving, walked down the deck steps and across the sandy beach. At her approach, Seth looked up, smiled shyly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they going to do without us?\u201d Jolene said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do without them?\u201d was Tami\u2019s reply.</p><p>They stood there until the air turned cold in their nostrils and the breeze graduated to a wind, until Carl and Michael had stopped pretending they had something to say to each other. Then the Flynns went into the restaurant and Jolene\u2019s family went home.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d parked the car and gone back into the warm, golden house, the mood had grown solemn. Even Lulu seemed affected.</p><p>\u201cMommy,\u201d Lulu said as they came into the family room. \u201cYou\u2019ll be back for my birthday, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Betsy rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot before your birthday, Lulu. But Daddy\u2019s going to make sure you have a nice party.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lulu scrunched her face in thought. \u201cWhat if I lose a tooth? You\u2019ll come home for that, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Michael sat down and turned on the TV.</p><p>Betsy made a sound of pure frustration and left the room. The sound of her footsteps on the stairs reverberated through the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat about bedtime stories? Who will read to me?\u201d Lulu said, frowning.</p> <p>\u201cLulu, honey, put your toys away. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Feeling shaky, Jolene followed Betsy up the stairs and knocked on her door.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Betsy screamed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, then: \u201cFine. Come in.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene walked into the bedroom and went to the bed.</p><p>Betsy didn\u2019t move sideways, but Jolene sat down beside her anyway. She put an arm around her daughter and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, Mom,\u201d Betsy said at last.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the news\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t watch the news, Betsy. It won\u2019t help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat will?\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. Let\u2019s synchronize our watches\u2019 alarms. That way when the alarms go off, we\u2019ll think of each other at that second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>In silence, they set their alarms.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that about the dog tags...\u201d Betsy said, her voice uneven.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you,\u201d Betsy said after a minute. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m being so mean to you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. I was twelve once. And you\u2019ve got a lot to worry about right now.\u201d Jolene kissed Betsy\u2019s cheek.</p> <p>They sat there, holding each other for a long time. In the quiet, Jolene felt as if she were coming undone. How could she leave tomorrow, walk away from her family, say good-bye to her children?</p><p>She wanted to tell Betsy everything she would need to know for her whole life\u2014just in case, to warn her about sex and boys and drugs and makeup, about social politics and college admissions and bad choices. But it was too early\u2014and too late.</p><p>Finally, she kissed her daughter\u2019s cheek, said, \u201cAre you ready to come back downstairs?\u201d and got up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like watching TV. I think I\u2019ll read,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>Jolene could hardly challenge that. She didn\u2019t really want to go back downstairs, either. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She went downstairs, where she found Michael watching TV while Lulu sat beside him on the sofa, doggedly asking him questions about how long Mommy would be gone.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Lucy Lou,\u201d Jolene said, scooping her daughter into her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s time for your bath.\u201d</p><p>Jolene carried Lulu upstairs, gave her a long, play-filled bath, then got her ready for bed.</p><p>As she looked around for last night\u2019s book, she saw Lulu scamper out of bed, put on her ratty gray cat-ear headband, and climb back into bed.</p><p>So Lulu wanted to play. Jolene turned to the bed and stopped suddenly. \u201cOh, no. Lulu, where did you go? Did the fairies steal you?\u201d</p><p>Lulu made a sound and clamped a hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWas that the wind?\u201d Jolene went to the window, opened it. \u201cLulu, are you out there?\u201d</p><p>Lulu took off her headband and burst into tears. \u201cI want to stay inbisible \u2019til you come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Lulu,\u201d she said, climbing into Lulu\u2019s narrow bed, taking her baby into her arms.</p><p>\u201cWho will find me if you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>Jolene tightened her hold, thinking of all the things she\u2019d miss.</p><p>Lulu would start kindergarten and ride the bus and make new friends, all without Jolene beside her. \u201cI love you, Lucy Louida. You remember that, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lulu snuggled under the covers and closed her eyes. In minutes, she was asleep.</p><p>Jolene kissed her cheek and left the bedroom. On her way out, she snagged one of Lulu\u2019s yellow plastic barrettes from the dresser and slipped it into her pocket.</p><p>As she went downstairs, she was struck by the quiet in her house.</p><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d</p><p>She got no answer. Moving from room to room, she didn\u2019t find him anywhere, but his car was in the garage. Finally, she caught a glimpse of something out front.</p><p>She stopped at the kitchen window and looked out. Moonlight glanced off a figure seated on their dock.</p><p>She slipped into the pair of boots that were always at the mudroom door. Zipping up her hoodie, she left the house and walked along the fence line down to the main road.</p><p>On the other side, she followed the wooden steps down to their dock. The full moon lit her way. She stepped on something that made a loud, cracking sound.</p><p>\u201cI guess you found me,\u201d Michael said, lifting a bottle to his lips.</p><p>Jolene sat down in the chair beside him. He\u2019d built a fire in the metal pit off to the side, and some heat wafted her way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell me getting drunk is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. How had they come to this place, and how would they ever find their way back?</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She reached out, said, \u201cMay I?\u201d and took the bottle from him, taking a sip of the bitter scotch. It burned all the way down.</p><p>\u201cYou must be upset,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded. Normally she stayed away from alcohol, both because of her family history and because of her career. A DUI would ground her, and she would never do anything to risk her ability to fly. \u201cI\u2019m human, Michael. In fact, getting drunk sounds good right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, Jo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to say something more, maybe reach for her. When he didn\u2019t, she turned to look at him.</p><p>In profile, his features sharpened by moonlight, he looked remote and cold. She saw the way he held his lips pursed in disapproval, as if the slightest relaxing would undo him, and she hated that she was leaving him now when their marriage was in trouble. She needed to believe he still loved her, or that he could love her again.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>He took another long drink from the scotch bottle and then turned to her.</p><p>They were close enough to kiss; all it would have taken was the slightest movement by either one of them, but neither leaned toward the other.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get hurt over there, Jo,\u201d he said, his gaze steady.</p><p>She heard a caring in the words she\u2019d thought was gone, and it filled her with a sweet and tender hope. Maybe they could fix it, maybe one perfect moment could put them back on track. She needed him so much right now she couldn\u2019t stand it; she needed to be able to take his love with her.</p><p>Slowly, she put a hand around his neck and pulled him closer, kissing him, but even as her heartbeat sped up and passion flared inside her, she felt him holding back. It was like kissing a stranger.</p><p>She drew back, humiliated. \u201cTake care of my babies,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>But he was drinking again, staring out at the rolling waves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you think you have to say that,\u201d he said.</p><p>She got up and returned to the house, alone.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Michael woke up alone. At some point, long before dawn, he\u2019d heard Jolene awaken and climb out of bed. Without turning on the lights, she had dressed in her camo fatigues\u2014ACUs\u2014grabbed her duffle bag, and left the bedroom, quietly shutting the door behind her. He had pretended to be asleep. Later, he\u2019d heard a horn honk outside; Tami had come to pick Jolene up.</p><p>Afterward, Michael lay alone. He thought he\u2019d never fall asleep again, but somehow he had, and he\u2019d been wakened hours later by the alarm bleating beside his bed.</p><p>Now, it was The Day. He woke the girls up and then took a long, scaldingly hot shower.</p><p>He had no idea what to wear for a deployment ceremony, so he went for the ever-popular charcoal slacks and matching V-neck cashmere sweater, but when he looked in the mirror, he saw a stranger. His dark eyes had a haunted look, and the shadows beneath attested to the fact that he hadn\u2019t slept well in weeks.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Betsy walked into the room, wearing white knee-length leggings, a long pink sweater cinched tight at the waist by a wide silver belt, and Ugg boots. Her long blond hair hung in frizzy ringlets to the middle of her back.</p><p>She looked like she was trying out for some Disney kid show where people burst into song at the drop of a hat.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think you\u2019re wearing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019m your father.\u201d</p><p>Betsy rolled her eyes. \u201cI came to tell you that Lulu isn\u2019t coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? She\u2019s four years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know her age, Dad. I just said she won\u2019t come. And she\u2019s wearing the headband.\u201d</p><p>Michael had no idea what difference a headband could make. \u201cFine.\u201d He sighed\u2014he was exhausted already and it was barely past eleven. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Betsy and headed down the hallway.</p><p>Lulu\u2019s room appeared to have been ransacked. There were toys and clothes everywhere; all of the bedding had been pulled off the bed and lay heaped on the floor.</p><p>She sat in the corner, wearing her ragged gray kitten Halloween costume, with her skinny legs drawn up to her chest. Her eyes were red and watery from crying and her cheeks were blotchy.</p><p>He looked at his watch. They were late. \u201cGet up, Lulu. We don\u2019t have time for this. We have to say good-bye to your mom.\u201d</p><p>When he reached down for her, she screamed, \u201cYou can\u2019t see me!\u201d</p><p>Michael frowned.</p><p>Betsy grabbed his wrist. \u201cLulu\u2019s invisible when she has the headband on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLulu,\u201d Betsy said in a singsong voice. \u201cWhere are you? We need to go.\u201d</p><p>Lulu didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Michael felt acutely out of his depth already and Jolene hadn\u2019t even left yet.</p><p>\u201cI know how afraid Lulu must be to say good-bye, but Mommy needs our kisses to keep her safe,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>Lulu burst into tears. Taking off the headband, she stood up. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to go. Will she be back for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Betsy took her sister\u2019s hand. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy birthday?\u201d Lulu said hopefully, clutching the ratty cat-eared headband. It was at least the fiftieth time she\u2019d asked this question.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Michael said tiredly. \u201cWe need to change your clothes, Lulu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed, scrambling away from him. \u201cI want my kitty costume!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should give in, Dad. Trust me,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Michael said, sighing. He picked Lulu up, and the three of them went out to the car.</p><p>They drove away in a heavy, awkward silence.</p><p>When they picked up his mother, she tried to fill the silence with chatter, but her buoyant pretense at optimism soon faded. Michael turned on the radio, let Clint Black be their voice.</p><p>At the guard tower, he eased to a stop and handed his and his mother\u2019s IDs over to a very serious-looking young man in uniform.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, sir,\u201d the guard said finally, handing him back the two licenses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The post was a hive of activity. Cars and trucks and uniformed soldiers were everywhere. Betsy read the instructions and guided them to a parking area, where they found a sign about the deployment ceremony to be held in the hangar.</p><p>The four of them were silent as they walked out to the hangar, which was a huge, open-sided building full of helicopters and cargo jets and smaller airplanes. One section had been cleared of aircraft, and rows of metal chairs had been placed in their space. Along the back wall, they\u2019d set up a wooden dais. There was a giant TV screen to its left. A large banner hung from the rafters. It read: BE SAFE RAPTORS.</p><p>A pair of Black Hawk helicopters were in the center of the hangar; they were crawling with kids and parents. In front of them, a long, low table offered pamphlets on everything from PTSD to suicide prevention to summer camps for kids.</p><p>They took seats in the front row. Lulu sat curled on Michael\u2019s lap, sucking her thumb\u2014she no longer even pretended she\u2019d given it up. In the next thirty minutes, the place filled up with people\u2014mostly women and children and older men\u2014who held posters and flowers. Over by the helicopters, a news crew gathered; a pretty woman in a blue suit talked into a microphone.</p> <p>Then the side door opened and the crowd went still. Music started; five soldiers marched out single file, wearing camouflage fatigues tucked into lace-up sand-colored boots and jauntily slanted berets, playing instruments. At the end of the song, the band formed a line along the wall. They stood straight and tall, their shoulders broad, their chins high, at attention in front of a row of flags.</p><p>On the dais, a man in uniform approached the mic and welcomed everyone to this important day. Then he turned and gave an order, and the giant hangar doors began slowly, slowly to open. The rollers made a grinding, pinging sound that filled the room. The doors parted to reveal the uniformed soldiers, all seventy-six of them, who made up the Raptors flight unit.</p><p>They stood outside, stone-faced, looking ready to go. There was his wife, in the front row, so tall, so strong-looking amid her other family. Chief Warrant Officer 3 Zarkades. He hardly knew her. She was the officer in charge of a forty-million-dollar aircraft and countless lives.</p><p>A soldier stood in front of the troops, said something that ended in \u201cpresent arms!\u201d and the Raptors saluted and marched into the hangar.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, will you please rise for the national anthem?\u201d</p> <p>Michael watched it all as if from some great distance. At the close of the national anthem, the unit members who were being deployed assembled and stood with their legs apart and their hands behind their backs as the base commander introduced the speaker. A couple of uniformed men conducted a ceremony with a flag\u2014they rolled it into a case and put it away. It would not be brought out again until the troops returned from war.</p><p>The governor of Washington State stepped up to the podium. The hangar was quiet, except for the crying of babies in their mothers\u2019 arms.</p><p>\u201cThe brave men and women standing in front of me are known to all of you,\u201d he began. \u201cThey are our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors, our parents, our children, and our friends. They are our heroes. To the soldiers, and to the families, and to all of those who are supporting our troops, no words can adequately express the depth and breadth of our gratitude. We left at home, the protected, are acutely aware of and thankful for your courage and your sacrifice.\u201d The governor looked up from his notes and leaned closer to the microphone. \u201cStanding before me are the members of Charlie Company that are being deployed today. We can all be proud of their willingness to serve this great country of ours and take comfort from the certainty that each soldier is ready, is trained, is prepared to succeed in this endeavor. But we in this room know that there is more than courage being asked of these soldiers and of you, their families. I have been privileged to speak privately with many of our state\u2019s brave soldiers, and the question I always ask them is, \u2018What is your greatest concern with this deployment?\u2019 You will not be surprised to hear that none has expressed concern for their personal safety. They worry about you. Saying good-bye to loved ones is the most difficult act for any soldier.\u201d The governor paused. \u201cThere are no words that we, a grateful nation, can offer to Charlie Company except thank you.\u201d He looked at the troops. \u201cYour willingness to put yourselves in harm\u2019s way to protect us here at home is humbling. We say thank you, and pray that you will be safe. God bless this unit and God bless America.\u201d</p><p>A soldier called out: \u201cFirst Sergeant. Release the warriors to their families.\u201d</p><p>Whatever was said next was lost in the rush of applause. The audience was on their feet, clapping and crying, rushing in a herd toward the troops.</p><p>Michael couldn\u2019t make himself move. He looked at the soldiers walking past him, going in search of their families; none looked afraid. They looked proud. Strong. Certain.</p> <p>Up ahead, he saw Jolene and Tami come together. A news crew was talking to them. As he approached, he heard the reporter say, \u201cTwo best friends who are female and just happen to fly Black Hawks. That\u2019s quite a story...\u201d</p><p>Jolene said, \u201cIt\u2019s not as unusual as you would think. Excuse me, ma\u2019am.\u201d She ducked out of camera range and headed toward Mila, who was pushing through the crowd.</p><p>Everywhere he looked, he saw heartbreak and courage. He saw a man in uniform, holding an infant who couldn\u2019t be more than a month old. The soldier stared at his baby intently, his eyes moist, as if trying to imagine all the changes that would be made in that small face while he was gone. Beside him, a pregnant woman hugged her husband, sobbing, promising that she would be okay without him.</p><p>And there was Jolene, hugging his mother so tightly it looked like they\u2019d fused together.</p><p>Lulu tightened her hold around Michael\u2019s neck. \u201cHurry, Daddy. She might go.\u201d</p><p>Michael walked toward his wife. He hadn\u2019t expected any of this. How was that? He prided himself on his intelligence, but he\u2019d been wrong, blinded by selfishness or politics or intellectualism. For years, he\u2019d watched news reports about the global war on terrorism and followed images of soldiers in the desert and he\u2019d thought about the politics of it all, about weapons of mass destruction and George W.\u2019s declaration of war and the wisdom of arming and sending out troops. He\u2019d argued with colleagues about it\u2014while he sat safe and warm and protected in his country. He\u2019d argued about the true cost of war.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known shit. The cost of war was here, in this room. It was families being torn apart and babies born without their parent at home and children forgetting their mother\u2019s face. It was soldiers\u2014some of them his age and others young enough to be his sons\u2014who would come home wounded ... or not come home at all.</p><p>His wife was going off to war. War. How was it he had missed the most important part of that? She could die.</p> <p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Jolene said gently.</p><p>Michael stared at her, his eyes bright with tears he was trying to hold back. \u201cHow can you do this? Any of you...\u201d</p><p>Lulu leaned out of his arms, toward Jolene, her arms outstretched. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Mommy. I\u2019ll be good. I won\u2019t be inbisible anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jolene pulled her youngest into her arms and held her fiercely. \u201cYou are the best girl in the world, Lucy Lou...\u201d She pinned a small golden set of wings on Lulu\u2019s costume. \u201cWhen you look at these wings, you\u2019ll know I\u2019m thinking of you, Lulu. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Michael reached out, took Jolene\u2019s hand. He should have done that before, told her he\u2019d be here for her. She grasped his hand so tightly it hurt. He wanted to wrap his arms around both of them, but he didn\u2019t dare. If he got close enough to kiss her, he might fall apart and be the only man in the room who cried. His kids didn\u2019t need to see that.</p><p>Betsy stood back, her arms crossed, one hip flung out, her mouth pulled into a tight frown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send videos and e-mails. I\u2019ll call as much as I can,\u201d Jolene promised them all.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Mila said to Jolene, hugging her, taking Lulu into her arms. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about us.\u201d</p><p>Jolene moved toward Betsy, caressed her cheek, forced her to look up. \u201cI have my watch set. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven o\u2019clock,\u201d Betsy said firmly, looking away.</p><p>Jolene bent down, looked Betsy in the eyes. \u201cI love you to the moon and back.\u201d She paused. Michael knew she was waiting. He thought: say it back to her, Bets, but the silence just hung there, until Jolene straightened, looking unbearably sad.</p><p>Behind them, a voice came through the speakers, telling the soldiers to gather at the buses. The crowd started to move like a wave, swelling toward the doors.</p><p>And then they were outside, this crowd of straight-backed soldiers with duffle bags, amid their weeping families and reaching children. A row of buses waited on the tarmac.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be good,\u201d Lulu said, crying hard.</p><p>Jolene kissed her daughters and held them tightly and then ... let them go.</p><p>Michael watched her move toward him. For a split second it was just the two of them in his mind\u2014no kids, no soldiers, no crying babies. Everything around them was a blur of sound and fury.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to do or say. He couldn\u2019t repair a broken marriage with a kiss or a touch, but he was ashamed of what he\u2019d done to get them here, and it was too late to fix it.</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d she said and he felt the sting of tears. \u201cTake care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>It was so little, that good-bye; more evidence of the shoals they\u2019d wrecked on.</p><p>\u201cYou take care of yourself. Come home to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you come home.\u201d He took her in his arms at last, holding her tightly. It wasn\u2019t until she walked away that he realized she hadn\u2019t hugged him back.</p><p>With one last agonizing look, Jolene disappeared into the crowd of soldiers and boarded the bus.</p><p>Betsy cried out, \u201cMOM!\u201d and ran the length of the bus, following her mother\u2019s progress. Her voice was lost in the din.</p><p>Michael picked up a sobbing Lulu and tried to soothe her, but she was hysterical.</p><p>In the back row of the bus, Jolene put down her window. She gazed down at her family; the smile she gave them faltered as the bus drove away.</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018I love you,\u2019\u201d Betsy said, bursting into tears.</p><p>In the months before his wife left, Michael had slept on \u201chis side\u201d of the bed. He\u2019d seen the river of rumpled white cotton between them as a no-man\u2019s-land where passion had gone to die. Now, on this morning when he woke up truly alone, he saw how false that had been. In all those nights, he\u2019d had a wife beside him, a partner with whom he\u2019d shared his life. Alone was different from separate, infinitely different. Often last night he\u2019d reached out for her and found only emptiness.</p><p>His first thought when he woke: she\u2019s gone.</p><p>He sat up in bed. Beside him on the nightstand was her \u201cbible,\u201d the huge three-ring binder that housed the endless list of his new responsibilities. In it, she\u2019d put everything she thought he might need\u2014appliance warranties, recipes, lists of mechanics and housecleaners and babysitters. He reached for it and opened it to the \u201cDaily Planner\u201d section. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Make breakfast. (Each morning came with its own carefully constructed meal plan.)</p><p>Get girls dressed. Make sure they brush their teeth.</p><p>Get Betsy on school bus. Arrival: 8:17.</p><p>Drop Lulu off at preschool. 8:30. She had provided him with an address, which pissed him off, both because she assumed he would need it and because, in fact, he did.</p> <p>He threw back the covers and got out of bed, stumbling toward the bathroom. After a long, hot shower, he felt ready to start his day. Dressing in navy wool slacks and a crisp white Armani dress shirt, he left the room.</p><p>As he walked down the darkened hallway, he knocked on the girls\u2019 doors, yelling for them to get up.</p><p>Downstairs, he made a pot of coffee, realizing too late that he\u2019d made enough for two. Then he stood there, waiting impatiently. As soon as it was done, he pulled out the glass carafe and poured himself a cup.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t done; coffee dripped down, splattering and burning on the warming pad below. He shoved the carafe back into place, ignoring the steaming sizzle, and looked at his list.</p><p>Today was \u201cclown\u201d pancake breakfast day.</p> <p>Ha.</p><p>Instead, he rifled through the cupboards, found some cereal, and thumped it down on the table. Tossing some bowls and spoons alongside it, he grabbed the newspaper from the porch and sat down to read it.</p><p>The next time he looked up, it was 8:07.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He threw down the paper and ran up the stairs, opening Betsy\u2019s door.</p><p>His daughter was still asleep.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Betsy, get up.\u201d</p> <p>She sat up in bed slowly, blinking, and glanced sleepily at the clock by her bed and then screamed.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wake me up in time!\u201d The horror on her face would have been funny any other time. He knew how precise Betsy was, just like her mom; she hated to be rushed.</p><p>\u201cI knocked on your door and yelled at you,\u201d he said, clapping his hands. \u201cGet going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time. I don\u2019t have time.\u201d She jumped out of bed and looked in the mirror. \u201cMy hair,\u201d she groaned.</p><p>\u201cYou have five minutes to be at the table for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shower?\u201d Again, the horror. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I mean it. You\u2019re twelve. How dirty can you be? Go.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him.</p> <p>\u201cMove it.\u201d He strode down the hall to Lulu\u2019s room. As usual, his youngest daughter slept spread-eagle on top of the blankets with a zoo of stuffed animals gathered around her. He threw the toys aside and kissed her cheek, pushing her tangled hair aside. \u201cLulu, honey, it\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna,\u201d she said, rolling away from him.</p><p>\u201cTime to go to preschool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna.\u201d</p><p>He turned on the light and went to her dresser. Opening the top drawer, he pulled out some tiny pink-flowered underwear and a pair of small elastic-waisted yellow corduroy pants and a green sweater. \u201cCome on, Lulu, we need to get you dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are summer clothes, Daddy. And they don\u2019t go together. Get the yellow sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy lets me pick\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, Lucy,\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>Scrunching her face up, she climbed out of bed and padded toward him. All the time he was dressing her, she was complaining.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said when she was dressed. \u201cPretty as a picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>She reached up for the pair of wings on the dresser top. \u201cPin it on me, Daddy. It means she\u2019s thinking of me. Ow! You poked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled. Picking her up, he carried her downstairs and into the kitchen. There, he put her in her chair and poured her a bowl of cereal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clown pancake day,\u201d she informed him crisply, looking down at her wings. \u201cLook at the calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Captain Crunch day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for special. Is Mommy coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d He poured the milk into her bowl.</p><p>Betsy came running into the kitchen and stopped dead. \u201cI can\u2019t go to school like this,\u201d she cried, flinging out her arms dramatically. \u201cLook at my hair.\u201d</p><p>She did sort of look as if she\u2019d just undergone electric shock therapy. \u201cPut a twisty thing in it.\u201d</p><p>Betsy\u2019s eyes widened at the thought, her face paled. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining my life already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s not coming home yet,\u201d Lulu said and burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d Michael snapped to Lulu; to Betsy, he said, \u201cSit down. Now.\u201d</p><p>Outside, he heard the grinding of gears, the rattling of an old engine. He looked through the kitchen window and saw the yellow blur of a school bus pull up at the end of his driveway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d Betsy howled. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>Michael ran to the back door and flung it open, yelling, \u201cWait\u2014\u201d</p><p>But it was too late. The bus was pulling away.</p><p>He slammed the door shut. \u201cWhen does school start? That wasn\u2019t on her damn list.\u201d</p><p>Betsy stared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat. Then go brush your teeth. We\u2019re leaving in two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to first period,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cOoooh no I\u2019m not. Zoe\u2019s in that class. And Sienna. When they see my hair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to school. I have a ferry to catch.\u201d Michael looked at the wall clock and grimaced. He was going to miss his ferry, which meant he was going to miss his first meeting of the day.</p><p>Betsy crossed her arms. \u201cI\u2019m on a hunger strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBe hungry.\u201d He grabbed the dishes and put them in the sink, cereal and milk and all. In the mudroom, he found Lulu\u2019s pink rubber boots and picked them up.</p><p>In the kitchen, Betsy hadn\u2019t moved. She sat in the chair, looking mutinous, with her chin jutted out and her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going in late. Everyone will stare at me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think you are, Madonna? A bad hair day doesn\u2019t stop school. Get your backpack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cGet your backpack and get ready, Betsy, or I\u2019ll walk you in to first period, holding your hand.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth in horror, then clamped it shut. \u201cWhatever. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>He looked through the kitchen to the family room, where Lulu lay curled on the couch, with her blanket and a stuffed orca, watching the video of Jolene reading her a story. \u201cLulu, come let me put your boots on you. Lulu. Come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wearing the headband,\u201d Betsy said primly.</p><p>Michael marched into the family room and picked Lulu up. At the movement, the headband slid off her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m inbisible!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>He carried her screaming and squealing out to the car and strapped her into her car seat. Betsy, silent and glowering, climbed in beside her.</p><p>Lulu burst into tears. \u201cI want my mommy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Michael said, starting the car. \u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d</p><p>The first week without Jolene almost drove Michael into the ground. He\u2019d had no idea how much there was to do around the house and with the kids. If his mother hadn\u2019t had such boundless energy, he would have had to hire full-time help. She\u2019d been a lifesaver, no doubt about it. Jolene had enrolled Lulu in after-preschool day care, which lasted until four o\u2019clock. That meant his mother could work until almost four, and then pick Lulu up from day care, and get to Michael\u2019s house in time to meet Betsy so that she never came home to an empty house\u2014one of Jolene\u2019s strictest rules. By the time Michael got home at six, his mom had usually started dinner and done some laundry. She was shouldering a big part of his burden.</p><p>Even so, he wasn\u2019t doing well. Betsy was a whirling dervish; he never seemed to be able to anticipate her reaction to the simplest of things. She could burst into tears over nothing and then be mad as a hornet five seconds later. And Lulu wasn\u2019t much easier to handle. She had taken to wearing her ratty gray cat ears almost all the time. She swore she was going to stay \u201cinbisible\u201d until Jolene came home, and when Michael ignored the game and picked her up anyway, she screamed like a banshee and sobbed that she missed her mommy.</p><p>And then there was the Keller case, which was showing all the signs of becoming a disaster. Keith still hadn\u2019t spoken to anyone, not even his court-appointed psychiatrist. Michael had waived his client\u2019s right to a speedy trial, but at the moment competency to stand trial was a legitimate concern.</p><p>His intercom buzzed. \u201cMichael? Mr. Keller is here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him in.\u201d Michael closed up the file and opened a pad of paper.</p><p>Edward Keller walked into the office slowly, looking nervous. He was a big man with close-shaved black hair and a bushy black Tom Selleck mustache. He was pale and sweaty-looking in his plaid shirt and Wrangler jeans.</p><p>Michael stood up, extended his hand. \u201cHello, Ed. I\u2019m Michael. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>Ed shook his hand. \u201cMy wife wouldn\u2019t come. She tried ... she just can\u2019t talk about it yet. Emily was like a daughter to us. It\u2019s hard...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Michael said, and he did. He lived in a world of crime and victims; he\u2019d seen time and again how terrible a grief came with the realization that a loved one had committed a heinous crime. Ed and his wife were the forgotten victims in a case like this.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t talk to me,\u201d Ed said. \u201cHe just sits there, staring at the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be blunt, Ed, that\u2019s our real problem now. The only one doing the talking is the prosecuting attorney, and I don\u2019t like what he\u2019s saying. They\u2019ve charged Keith with murder in the first degree, and they claim to have a witness who will testify that Keith confessed to the murder.\u201d</p><p>Ed looked miserable. The man slumped in his chair. \u201cHe was such a good kid. Popular. Friendly. The kind of kid who asks you if you need help carryin\u2019 in the groceries and how your day was. He dated lots of girls, cheerleader types, and had fun in high school, but when he met Emily, he knew right away she was the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did it start going wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. It never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEd,\u201d Michael said evenly. \u201cSomething went wrong.\u201d</p><p>Ed looked down at his own hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked ourselves that question a million times. Did he seem depressed? Did you ever hear them arguin\u2019? Did he ever say he was unhappy? Our family has looked at it six ways to Sunday. They had a happy marriage; that\u2019s what we think. She couldn\u2019t wait for him to get home from Iraq. She wrote him every day.\u201d</p><p>Michael looked up sharply. \u201cIraq? There\u2019s no mention of him serving in Iraq in what I\u2019ve got here. It just says he\u2019s an honorably discharged marine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did two tours. When he came home the second time, he wasn\u2019t the same.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all saw that he was changed. If you startled him\u2014and that was easy to do\u2014he could turn on you fast enough to take your breath away. I know he didn\u2019t sleep much. Emily told me that he\u2019d started keepin\u2019 a loaded gun by the bed. God help me, I told her a man needed to protect his family.\u201d</p><p>Michael wrote down PTSD and underlined it. \u201cDid he ever hit Emily, to your knowledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last few days, before the ... you know, I wondered about that. Keith was so edgy and upset. At a family dinner, he blew up at his brother over nothing. And the look in his eyes scared us all. It wasn\u2019t our Keith. When I asked him about it, he told me he\u2019d had too much coffee, but I didn\u2019t believe him. I think whatever happened to him in Iraq is why he killed Emily.\u201d</p> <p>Michael added: What happened in Iraq? to his notes. Diminished capacity? \u201cDid he get help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried. The VA sent him away with a prescription for Prozac.\u201d</p><p>Michael tapped his pen on the desk, thinking. So his client had tried to get help from the military and been denied. That was good. And hardly surprising. \u201cOkay, Ed. I\u2019ll do some research based on what you\u2019ve just told me, but I need to talk to Keith, and I need Keith to talk to a psychiatrist. And I need it to happen quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, Ed, he\u2019ll go to prison. Probably for life.\u201d</p> <p>Ed looked stricken by that, as Michael had intended. In the silence that followed, Michael sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you, but I can\u2019t help your son if he won\u2019t talk to me. There are two sides to every story. I need his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him to talk,\u201d Ed said.</p><p>Michael stared at him. \u201cDo that, Ed, and fast.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>The first week at Fort Hood passed in a blur of classes, assignments, paper pushing, and lectures. It had been so many years since her active army days that Jolene had forgotten how much bureaucracy there was in ordinary military life, how much of a day was spent \u201churrying up to wait.\u201d She\u2019d spent the last seven days standing in one line or another\u2014or so it seemed. They stood in line for supplies, for lectures, for paperwork to be signed. There was the SRP\u2014soldier readiness process\u2014and more medical tests and examinations and shots, finance reviews, and updating of personnel records.</p><p>The day started early here at Fort Hood; breakfast was at 0430. Immediately afterward were classes on anything and everything they would need to know in Iraq: spiders and scorpions and IEDs\u2014improvised explosive devices\u2014sexual harassment, chemical warfare. The list went on and on. The worst of the lines were at the phones. Jolene had been advised to leave her cell phone at home, since it wouldn\u2019t work in Iraq anyway. Following that advice had been a mistake. As it was, she spent much of her off-duty time standing in line to call home. More often than not, by the time it was her turn to use the phone, it was too late to talk to the girls. The few conversations she\u2019d had with Michael had been short and stilted. Neither had said I love you before hanging up. Afterward, she felt more lonely than she had before the calls.</p> <p>Now, Charlie Company was out beneath the blazing hot Texas sun, in full gear, walking along a dirt road the color of old blood. Jamie was in the lead. A lone hawk circled overhead curiously, no doubt wondering why these uniformed, helmeted adults, armed with M-16s and 9 mils, were running around in this heat. They kept pulling to the side of the road and looking for fictitious IEDs.</p><p>She knew it was important, lifesaving, even, but they were an aviation unit going in to provide support\u2014backfill\u2014for a combat aviation brigade. If she found herself on a road in Sadr City or Baghdad, in a Humvee, something had gone wrong enough that an IED would be only one of the worries.</p><p>And man it was hot.</p><p>By the time they finished that drill and made it out to the rifle range, Jolene was sweating so badly under her helmet that moisture ran into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cZarkades, get the hell down here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, sir.\u201d</p><p>She hustled to her place on the gun range and lifted her rifle. Aiming, she pulled the trigger.</p><p>\u201cGood shot, Chief. Ten more just like that and you can start the live-fire course.\u201d</p> <p>For the next four hours, Jolene did as she was ordered: stand, sit, crawl, shoot, run. Afterward, she and Tami headed across the post, hoping the phone lines would be a little shorter at this hour.</p><p>They were wrong. At least forty soldiers were already in line, standing under the waning heat of the sun, reading, talking, listening to music.</p><p>Jolene slowed. \u201cDamn.\u201d She was about to turn around when she saw Smitty wave at her. He was fourth in line. Even with dirt and sweat running down his face, he looked young enough to be her son.</p><p>\u201cHey, Smitty,\u201d Jolene said, heading toward him.</p><p>He smiled, showing off his braces. \u201cHey, Chiefs.\u201d</p><p>Tami came up beside Jolene. \u201cAre you calling your mom or is there some girlfriend pining away for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding this spot for you two,\u201d he said. At their surprised look, he added: \u201cI just remembered, my girlfriend\u2019s still at work. I can\u2019t call her for another hour. And besides\u201d\u2014he gave them both a sheepish grin\u2014\u201cI know I\u2019d want to hear from my mom.\u201d</p><p>Smitty backed away, leaving an opening in line.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t have anyone you want to call?\u201d Jolene asked. \u201cWhat about your folks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. They\u2019re driving to see my grandma today.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked at Tami, who gave her a big smile. \u201cYou\u2019re the man, Smitty,\u201d Tami said.</p><p>The women stepped into line; Smitty walked away, whistling.</p><p>When the phone was free, Tami stepped forward and made her call. As Jolene listened to the singsong sound of her friend\u2019s voice, she tapped her foot impatiently, flicked her fingers against the rough fabric of her pants, and then, finally, it was her turn. Tami hung up, and Jolene lurched forward, picked up the old-fashioned receiver, hot from so many hands, and called home.</p><p>Betsy answered, said \u201cHello?\u201d and then yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s Mom.\u201d</p><p>Jolene leaned against the sun-warmed side of the building, trying to ignore the line of soldiers behind her, but it was impossible. She could hear them moving around, talking, laughing. \u201cHey, Bets. How\u2019s your week been? I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t call yesterday. They had us busy all day and night.\u201d</p><p>Betsy launched into a breathless story about a trauma at school. Apparently Betsy had been chosen last for volleyball teams in PE. Sierra and Zoe had been behind the humiliation, had pointed and laughed until Betsy screamed at them to shut up and then received detention for her outburst. \u201cMe! I got detention and it was all their fault. Can you call my PE teacher and get me out of it?\u201d</p><p>Jolene had ten minutes on the phone, and Betsy had already used up six of those minutes telling her story. \u201cOh, honey, I can\u2019t do that, but if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. You\u2019re too busy. Don\u2019t worry about it, Mom. Lulu! Your turn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be that way, Betsy,\u201d Jolene said, her guilt surfacing again. \u201cWe get so little time to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you an e-mail as soon as I can, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, Mom, don\u2019t worry about it. I don\u2019t need you. Here\u2019s Lulu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy. I love you.\u201d</p><p>There was only breathing on the other end; then Lulu was on the phone, sounding like a mouse on helium. At the end of a story about something she made for Jolene out of macaroni and string, Lulu said, \u201cI want you to read me a story tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, baby.\u201d</p><p>Lulu burst into tears. \u201cDaddy, she\u2019s not coming home yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jo,\u201d Michael said a second later, sounding as tired as she suddenly felt.</p><p>\u201cLulu didn\u2019t say good-bye or \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s upset, Jo. She\u2019ll be fine. How are you?\u201d</p><p>Jolene had been on the phone eleven minutes. The soldiers behind her were starting to get restless. \u201cIs she having nightmares again? Because if she is, she needs her yellow blanket and her pink ribbon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jo. Did you think the girls would say good-bye to their mother, watch her march off to war, and be fine?\u201d</p><p>Behind her someone yelled out, \u201cCome on, ma\u2019am. We all have families.\u201d</p><p>There was so much she wanted to say and no time to say it. Michael\u2019s silence gnawed at her nerves. \u201cI\u2019ll write Betsy an e-mail tonight. Can you make sure she reads it before school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. So, your time\u2019s up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat talk, Jo,\u201d he said in a voice she could barely hear.</p><p>She whispered \u201cGood-bye,\u201d and hung up the phone. Another soldier moved in next to her, picked up the receiver.</p><p>Jolene backed away; she felt Tami coming up beside her. They began the walk back to their barracks.</p><p>\u201cBetsy spent ten minutes telling me about her day and asking if I\u2019d call her teacher to get her out of detention,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>Tami laughed quietly. \u201cSo we go off to war and motherhood pretty much stays the same. And Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me why I thought the girls would be fine after I went off to war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not even at war.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. \u201cHow\u2019s Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves me and misses me and he\u2019s proud of me. At least that\u2019s what he says. According to Carl, he isn\u2019t sleeping and he unplugged his Xbox and won\u2019t play video games anymore\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to see cartoon people getting blown up. And when I think of how many times I told him to get off that idiot box...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to get through this?\u201d Jolene asked quietly.</p><p>Tami had no answer for that. At their barracks, they grabbed their dopp kits and headed for the showers. Afterward, they walked over to the dining facilities\u2014DFAC\u2014and sat down with several of the members of Charlie Company, including Jamie and Smitty. They were surrounded by the smell of gravy that had been on a burner too long and sweet corn cooked down to mush. The drone of soldiers\u2019 voices was like a jet engine.</p><p>Smitty was shoveling creamed corn into his mouth at an alarming rate, talking at the same time about the rifle range. Jamie stared down at his food, poking the meatloaf with his fork. He seemed far away from all of them, and Jolene understood his distance.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get our heads in the game, Jo,\u201d Tami said. \u201cWe\u2019re soldiers first now. That\u2019s the way it has to be or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll die,\u201d Jolene said softly. She knew Tami was right; she\u2019d thought the same thing several times. No doubt it was what occupied Jamie\u2019s thoughts now, too. The point of war games was, ultimately, war. Jolene needed to put her feelings for her family in a compartment and hide it away. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop missing them. I feel guilty all the time. I keep thinking that if I can say just the right thing on the phone, we\u2019ll all be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl and I talked about this before I left. He told me I had to stop being a part of him and start being a part of this. He said he knew I loved him and that my job was to think about me and the men and women around me.\u201d Tami looked at her. \u201cTwo weeks from now we\u2019ll be in-country, Jo. You\u2019ve got to cut yourself loose from Poulsbo. Trust Michael to keep everything together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrust Michael,\u201d she said dully.</p><p>\u201cYou have no choice.\u201d</p><p>Jolene knew Tami was right, but letting go was easier said than done. She knew how it felt to be abandoned in childhood, and although this was different, profoundly different, she wasn\u2019t certain her children would really understand why she had left them. \u201cHow have men done it all these years, gone off to war and left their kids behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had wives,\u201d Tami said simply.</p> <p>Late that night, after Tami had fallen asleep, Jolene opened her laptop. She was so tired, she had trouble keeping her eyes open, but she had to write to her daughter.</p><p>Dear Betsy:</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t help you with your detention. You won\u2019t want to hear what I have to say about it, either. The bottom line is that you broke the rules. There\u2019s always a consequence for our actions. You might as well learn that early. Of course Sierra and Zoe are wrong to have goaded you and mean to have made fun of you. But how you respond is what will make you who you are.</p><p>I have so many things to say about that, and it kills me that we aren\u2019t together. Mothers and daughters are supposed to curl up on the couch and talk about anything and everything. And we will soon. You\u2019ll see. Until then, I wish I knew how to tell you how to get through the tough times in middle school. I know so much about mean girls.</p><p>When I was your age, no one liked me. I was always the girl with the ratty clothes and no lunch money. I was too ashamed to invite anyone home, so I didn\u2019t make friends. It was terrible. Lonely. I don\u2019t want that for you.</p> <p>I know how it feels to be ignored and teased. So I ignored those girls right back, and it just made me feel bad about myself.</p><p>You know what helped? Joining the Army, and not because they taught me to fly (or not only because of that), but because that\u2019s where I met Tami.</p><p>I was afraid to talk to her in the beginning. She was so confident. She didn\u2019t seem to care that we were the only women in flight school. For the whole first week, I ignored her because I figured she wouldn\u2019t like me. And you know what?</p><p>She was WAITING for me to talk to her.</p><p>That\u2019s when I learned how much one smile can matter. Let people know you\u2019re ready to be their friend, and if they give you a chance, take it\u2014don\u2019t be afraid. With Tami, all I had to do was find the courage to say hi, to sit by her in the mess hall. You never know when a sentence, a hello, can change your life.</p><p>I wish I were there to tell you how beautiful and smart and talented you are, but for now, these words on a blue screen will have to do it. Be strong, Betsy. Believe in yourself and you\u2019ll be okay.</p> <p>I love you to the moon and back.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough. Not nearly. But it was all there was, all she could say from here.</p><p>Tomorrow, she\u2019d write to Lulu.</p><p>She yawned and hit Send.</p><p>On the last Thursday in May, Michael woke early and got breakfast ready. He thought that if he could just get ahead of the curve, get a smooth schedule going with the girls, he would be okay. Ever since Jolene\u2019s departure, he\u2019d been running behind\u2014late to meetings, late for the ferry, late for dinner. Something was always going wrong. Today, he was determined to have a nice, peaceful morning.</p><p>He knew he\u2019d wasted his time when Betsy came into the kitchen wearing more makeup than a Vegas showgirl.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d he said, putting down his paper.</p><p>Betsy turned her back on him. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, opening the fridge.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not wearing that makeup to school.\u201d</p><p>She faced him. \u201cWhat makeup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wear reading glasses, Bets. I\u2019m not blind. Go wash your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr...\u201d He narrowed his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll offer to volunteer in your class today. Social studies. Aren\u2019t you guys reading the Constitution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a long minute, then stomped her foot and marched out of the room. When she returned, she was a real pain in the ass, slamming cabinet doors, muttering under her breath, being mean to Lulu, who cried through most of breakfast and kept asking when Mommy was coming back.</p><p>At work, he spent the day catching up on all the work he\u2019d missed in the past few weeks, but there was too much. Between managing the firm and defending his clients, he was overworked, plain and simple. Now, he was dictating a discovery request for Keith Keller\u2019s military record. Something he should have done weeks ago.</p><p>He buzzed his secretary. \u201cAnn? Have we heard anything from Keith Keller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He glanced back down at the papers spread out across his desk. As he reached for a pen, his cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cHi, Michael,\u201d his mother said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to call you at work, but I just got a flat tire. I\u2019m out by the Tacoma Mall for that gardening gift show. There\u2019s no way I can make it home in time to pick up Lulu and be at your house in time to meet Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Fine. Just waiting for AAA. Sarah Wheller is doing carpool today\u2014she\u2019ll drop Betsy home after track practice. About five o\u2019clock. And Lulu needs to be picked up by four thirty.\u201d</p><p>He looked at his watch. It was 3:33. The next ferry left in twelve minutes. If he missed it, Betsy would come home to an empty house\u2014a no-no according to Jolene\u2019s \u00fcber list. Although, honestly, why a twelve-year-old needed someone to welcome her home was beyond him. \u201cOkay, Ma. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to do this to you. Oh, darn, my phone is beeping. Does that mean my battery is going out? Michael? Did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Ma. No problem. Thanks.\u201d He flipped his phone shut, gathered up what work he would need, and left his office. \u201cI left some dictation on my desk for you. And try Keller\u2019s father again, remind him I really need to speak to his son,\u201d he said to Ann as he passed her desk. \u201cI\u2019ll be on my cell if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour four fifteen appointment\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancel it. I have to leave right now,\u201d he said over his shoulder and kept walking.</p><p>Outside, a steady rain drizzled from a low-slung sky. Car headlights glowed in the falling rain, looking like an endless stream of fuzzy yellow balls inching down wet streets. As he drove away from his office, blurry neon signs attested to the city\u2019s rough-and-tumble past\u2014gun shops and X-rated bookstores and dark, seedy bars. He followed the stop-and-go traffic to the ferry terminal, cursing at every red light, checking his watch.</p><p>He knew he was in trouble when he saw the ticket line. All at once he remembered that today was the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend. The tourists were out in droves, already heading to Bainbridge Island and the beautiful Olympic Peninsula. Tapping his fingers on the leather-covered steering wheel, he inched forward, following the car in front of him until it was his turn to buy a ticket. \u201cWhich ferry?\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>\u201cSix twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Michael calculated quickly: if he waited for the ferry, he wouldn\u2019t get home until at least 7:20.</p><p>But he could drive around; although the Kitsap Peninsula was only a thirty-five minute ferry ride from downtown Seattle, one could also drive through Tacoma and come into Poulsbo from the mainland. He could drive home in a little under two hours. And it was only three forty-five. He\u2019d be through Tacoma before the rush-hour traffic hit.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He pulled out of line and drove back through the city. In less than ten minutes, he was rocketing onto I-5 South. He flipped open his phone and called his mom, who didn\u2019t pick up. Her battery had probably gone dead. Then he called the day care and told the teacher that he\u2019d be late picking up Lulu.</p><p>Four o\u2019clock.</p><p>And yes, he wouldn\u2019t be home when Betsy got there.</p><p>He knew what Jolene would say, the disappointed look she\u2019d give him, but he would only be a few minutes late\u2014fifteen or twenty. Betsy was twelve years old, for God\u2019s sake, she could be home alone for fifteen minutes. Thirty at the most.</p><p>He cranked up the music\u2014a U2 concert album\u2014and concentrated on driving through the now pouring rain. He was making good time until he came to the Narrows Bridge. The soaring green stanchions looked like huge ladders in the falling rain.</p><p>And the traffic was stopped. Up in the distance, he could see the flash of red ambulance lights.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he cursed, opening his phone. He dialed home, left Betsy a message: \u201cI\u2019m stuck in traffic, Betsy. Just sit tight. I\u2019ll be home as soon as I can. Six o\u2019clock at the very latest. Call me if you want. I\u2019m on my cell.\u201d</p><p>He sat ... and sat ... and sat in the middle of a clog of cars, with rain blurring his windshield. All the while, he felt his blood pressure rising, but there was nothing he could do about it. At 5:40, he called home again. \u201cDamn it, Betsy, pick up.\u201d When she didn\u2019t, he snapped the phone shut and dialed his mom at home. She didn\u2019t answer either, so he left another message.</p><p>It was almost 6:20 when the barricades were cleared and traffic started up again. Michael hit the gas\u2014too hard\u2014and gunned for home. He had a pounding headache by the time he pulled into the day care parking lot. Inside the small well-tended house, he found the teacher waiting for him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, raking the hair back from his face. \u201cThere was an accident on the Narrows. Ugly. I got here as quickly as I could.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThings happen. I know. But Lulu\u2019s upset.\u201d She stepped aside.</p><p>Through an open door, Michael saw Lulu sitting all alone in a brightly colored playroom surrounded by dolls and stuffed animals.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, looking up at him. \u201cAll the other mommies were already here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He helped her into her coat, said good-bye to the teacher, and carried her out to the car.</p><p>Lulu didn\u2019t talk to him all the way home, but to be honest the last thing he had to worry about these days was pissing off a four-year-old.</p><p>In the house, he patted her butt and told her to be good. \u201cBetsy! I\u2019m home,\u201d he yelled, closing the door behind him. \u201cI know you\u2019re pissed, but come down and talk to me.\u201d</p><p>He tossed his briefcase on the kitchen table and loosened his tie. \u201cBetsy?\u201d he yelled again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d Lulu said, coming into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Michael looked down. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Lulu stood there, holding her ratty yellow blanket. \u201cBetsy\u2019s not home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He yelled it so loud Lulu looked startled. He ran past her and up the stairs; at Betsy\u2019s room, he shoved the door open, yelling for her.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>He ran through the house, yelling until he knew: she wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>Downstairs, Lulu was crying. \u201cShe\u2019s gone. Oh, no ... someone stoled her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one stole her,\u201d he muttered angrily as he went to the phone and called his mom at home. When she picked up, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you listen to your messages? Is Betsy with you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? I just got home. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got home late,\u201d he said, cursing under his breath. \u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d He hung up before his mom could answer. Fear latched into him, deep and profound. \u201cI\u2019ll call her friends,\u201d he said, picking up the phone again, then pausing. \u201cLulu, quit crying, damn it. Who are Betsy\u2019s friends?\u201d</p><p>Lulu wailed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>He called the school and listened to the after-hours message.</p> <p>With a curse, he hung up.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she ranned away,\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>Michael went out to the porch. The rain was falling hard; it studded the grass, collected in muddy puddles in the driveway. He thought about the bay, the deep cold of the water and its allure for his children. \u201cBetsy! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>The more he yelled her name, the more Lulu cried and the more Michael panicked. What in the hell had he been thinking? He should have left his car downtown and walked on the damn ferry and taken a cab. Or he could have called Carl. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of that then? Damn. What if some guy had watched Betsy get out of the car, followed her up to an empty house...?</p><p>Yelling her name again, he grabbed Lulu as if she were a football, perpendicular to his body, and ran through the rain toward the neighbor\u2019s house. Resettling her as he ran, he made it to Carl and Tami\u2019s house in less than a minute. He pounded on the door.</p> <p>Carl opened the door. \u201cMichael, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Michael wiped the rain from his eyes. \u201cBetsy\u2019s not home and she should be. I thought maybe she came over here.\u201d</p><p>Carl slowly shook his head, and Michael felt his stomach plunge. He thought for a second he might be sick.</p><p>Seth walked into the living room, chewing on a Tootsie Pop. Holding a tattered copy of Stranger in a Strange Land, he was wearing tight jeans and high-tops and a ratty Gears of War tee shirt. His black hair was drawn back from his narrow face in one of those samurai knots. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy\u2019s not at home,\u201d Carl said. \u201cMichael\u2019s worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I know where she is,\u201d Seth said.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Michael said. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Seth tossed his book on the sofa. \u201cWait here.\u201d He ran past Michael and went outside.</p><p>Michael and Lulu followed him down the driveway. Carl grabbed an umbrella and joined them at the mailbox. Seth paused at the street, looked both ways and then crossed, climbing down to the beach.</p><p>She\u2019s not supposed to go near the water alone. Rain thumped the umbrella overhead, drowning out the sound of their breathing.</p><p>Minutes later\u2014minutes that felt like hours\u2014Seth appeared again, with Betsy beside him. They were climbing up the beach path toward the road. Both of them were soaked.</p><p>Michael\u2019s relief was so great he almost fell to his knees. \u201cBetsy, thank God.\u201d</p><p>As they neared, he could see how angry his daughter was, and how hurt. \u201cHow could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Betsy.\u201d</p> <p>She shoved the wet hair out of her face. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be here when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never supposed to come home to an empty house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But I think you\u2019re old enough to come home by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaagh!\u201d She pushed past him and stalked into the house, slamming the door shut behind her.</p><p>He looked gratefully at Seth. \u201cThanks, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the big tree by the Harrisons\u2019 dock. She always goes there when she\u2019s upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. Thanks.\u201d It shamed him that the neighbor kid would know Betsy better than he did. He turned and went into the house. There, he wrapped Lulu in a big towel and put her in front of the TV before he went up to Betsy\u2019s room.</p><p>Her back was to him. Rainwater dripped down from her wet hair, darkening her shirt. She was staring out the window. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bets. If you had just listened to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She spun to face him. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? I thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d How had he not expected this? Jolene would have known Betsy\u2019s fear and protected against it. Of course Betsy would worry about losing the only parent here. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Betsy. I screwed up. I won\u2019t do it again. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Betsy\u2019s eyes filled with tears. She wiped them away impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>Downstairs, the phone rang.</p><p>A moment later, Lulu shrieked: \u201cIt\u2019s Mommy!\u201d</p><p>Betsy pushed past Michael and ran downstairs.</p><p>Reluctantly, he followed. This was not good timing for a call.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Betsy said, holding the phone to her ear, looking furious. \u201cDad wasn\u2019t here when I got home today. He forgot me. If you were here this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Lulu threw herself at Betsy. \u201cGive it back! I was talking to her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Betsy pushed her away. Lulu plopped onto her butt and screamed. \u201cI wanna talk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy,\u201d he said, \u201clet Lulu talk, too.\u201d</p><p>Betsy made a face, but let Lulu into the conversation. The two girls sat down together at the table, talking over each other.</p><p>Sighing, Michael went into the kitchen and poured himself a drink. Within ten minutes, Betsy was handing him the phone. \u201cShe wants to talk to you, Dad. She doesn\u2019t have much time for us. Like always.\u201d</p><p>He took the phone and went into the family room, sitting down. \u201cHey, Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Michael? You forgot her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to bitch me out, don\u2019t bother, Jolene. I feel bad enough.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, then, \u201cYou scared her, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Another pause. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it been a month already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Michael.\u201d</p><p>In the insanity of the last four weeks, he\u2019d forgotten this date, almost forgotten that she was going to war. He hadn\u2019t really forgotten, of course; the knowledge had been a shadow, rarely glimpsed in the hectic mess of his days. Up until now she\u2019d been safe, so it had been easier to think about himself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what communication will be like at Balad, or how long we\u2019ll be there. I\u2019ll keep in touch as best I can.\u201d She paused. \u201cMichael, it would be really nice if the girls could send me letters or e-mails if we have Internet.\u201d</p><p>He thought about her days over there, how empty a part of her would be without her girls. It was kind of shameful that she\u2019d had to ask this. Especially since he knew how hard it was for her to ask for favors from him or anyone. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Well. I gotta go now, the natives are getting restless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe safe,\u201d he said. \u201cTake care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cGood-bye, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>All he wanted to do was go to the counter, retrieve his drink, and finish it. He even thought fondly of getting drunk.</p><p>Instead, he dialed the local pizza shop, ordered dinner, and went upstairs.</p><p>Betsy\u2019s bedroom door was open. He peeked in, saw that she wasn\u2019t there, and walked down the hall to the bathroom.</p><p>She was peering into the mirror, messing with her face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to squeeze those things,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pivoted, screamed, \u201cGET OUT,\u201d and slammed the door shut in his face.</p><p>He stood there a long time, waiting for her to change her mind and apologize.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Finally, he went back downstairs and found Lulu watching Jolene\u2019s good-bye video again.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>The pizza arrived, and he paid the kid and slapped the pie on the table, yelling, \u201cDinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza is for birthdays, Daddy. Not dinner,\u201d Lulu said with a sigh. She walked past him and climbed up to the table just as his mother walked into the house, looking irritated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever hang up on me again, young man. Is Betsy okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how okay she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. From now on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ma. Yell at me tomorrow. It\u2019s been a hell of a day.\u201d</p><p>His mother stared up at him. \u201cYou need to do better, Michael,\u201d she said evenly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m aware.\u201d</p><p>Before she could say anything to make him feel worse, he left the kitchen and walked into his office, where, thankfully, it was quiet. He closed the door behind him and sank into the chair by his desk.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think he could do this. And this was taking care of his children.</p><p>What in the hell was wrong with him? How could he be such a success in the courtroom and in his office and with his clients but fail so completely with his own family?</p><p>He sighed. His wife had been gone less than a month, and already he was tired of feeling like a failure in his own home.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>The next morning, Betsy still wasn\u2019t talking to him. Michael awoke early, started breakfast, and got the girls to school on time. When he finally got to his desk\u2014late\u2014he was already tired. But at least he felt competent here.</p><p>At eleven o\u2019clock, the call he\u2019d been waiting for came in.</p><p>Keith had requested an interview. Finally.</p><p>Michael grabbed his notes and left the office. Fifteen minutes later, he arrived at the King County jail and took a seat in a dingy interview room.</p><p>Keith came into the room, wearing the orange jail jumpsuit, his wrists shackled in front of him, leg chains scraping and jangling across the stone-tiled floor.</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d Michael said to the guard. \u201cAnd uncuff him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncuff him,\u201d Michael repeated. \u201cI understand the risks.\u201d</p><p>The guard frowned but did as he was asked, then left the room to stand guard just outside the door.</p><p>Keith sat down at the table across from Michael, rigidly upright. In the pale overhead lighting, he looked surprisingly young and fresh-faced. His crew cut had grown out, stood up now like a jagged blond crown above his face. \u201cMy father says I have to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to keep you out of prison. You\u2019re not making my job easy, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think I don\u2019t deserve to be saved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Michael said evenly. \u201cI didn\u2019t. And neither has your father. Or your mother, who I hear cries herself to sleep at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow blow.\u201d</p><p>Michael opened his pad and uncapped a pen. \u201cYou know why I\u2019m here, Keith. You promised your dad you\u2019d tell me what happened that day. And I hear you military types are big on keeping promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed the love of my life,\u201d Keith said, and finally there was emotion in his eyes. \u201cI must have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean, \u2018you must have\u2019 ? \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy,\u201d Keith said quietly. \u201cI must be. I can\u2019t remember shooting my own wife. Does that sound sane to you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michael studied his client. Honestly, this was the first good news he\u2019d gotten on this case. He hated that he was analytical enough to hear pain and think good, but that was his job, sorting through heartache for reason. Although the law was a codified set of rules, justice was far from set in stone. In court, there was always room for ambiguity, for emotion, for sympathy. \u201cTell me what happened, Keith. Minute by minute.\u201d</p><p>Keith stared dully at the wall. Michael saw that blank look come back into the young man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to go to Pike Place. I knew it was a bad idea, but I didn\u2019t know why, I couldn\u2019t say why. And you know, I love ... loved Emily and we did what she wanted, especially after I got back from Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy then specifically?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was hard to live with. I was constantly having to make shit up to her. Anyway, we went to the market.\u201d He paused so long Michael was about to prompt an answer when Keith started talking again. \u201cIt was sunny that day. The market was crowded. Piano players, jugglers, magicians, fish throwers, bums. You couldn\u2019t walk a foot without someone bumping into you or running out in front of you or trying to sell you something.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his shaking hands. \u201cI started to get edgy, tight. So I had a straight shot of tequila at the Athenian, but it wasn\u2019t enough to calm me down. I got so jumpy. I get jumpy a lot lately. That day, every movement startled me, got my heart pumping\u2014and there were a lot of movements. I kept thinking people were after me. So, while Emily was picking out flowers, I zipped back into the Athenian, and had a few more shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d Keith sighed. \u201cI know drinking doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s something Emily and I had been fighting about. She thought I drank too much and got mean. And I could feel it that day, me getting mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you drink much before Iraq?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots. Sometimes it made the ... yelling in my head quiet down. But it didn\u2019t help that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt made it worse.\u201d</p><p>Keith nodded. \u201cWe were leaving the market\u2014I was pissed and pretty drunk by this time\u2014and this homeless guy jumped out at me. Emily said he just walked up, but it didn\u2019t seem like that to me. Or, he came up fast, and he was a skuzzy-looking guy with all this long black hair and a Jesus beard and I hit him so hard he went down. I saw blood spray up from his nose. Emily started screaming that she didn\u2019t know me anymore and there was this ... shaking that made it impossible for me to stand still. The next thing I remember is seeing Emily lying on the floor in our living room.\u201d In his lap, his hands clenched and unclenched. \u201cIt was like I woke up in someone else\u2019s nightmare. There was blood everywhere, on me, on the wall, on Em. Half of her head was just ... gone. I bent down and tried to give her mouth to mouth and I did compressions. The whole time I was screaming and crying. It wasn\u2019t until I saw the gun\u2014my gun\u2014that I knew what I\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all you remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to need you to talk to a psychiatrist. Will you do that for me, Keith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It won\u2019t make a difference, though. I don\u2019t need a doc to tell me I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>Michael looked at his client, thinking, This kid needs my help. He knew how heavily the deck was stacked against them, and for the first time in a long time, he felt hopeful. This could be the kind of case that mattered. He wished his dad were here to hear about it. \u201cI\u2019ll set up the appointment.\u201d</p><p>Dear Mom:</p><p>You are NOT going to believe this. Dad bought me a cell phone. My very own one. Yesterday I was in the lunch room and I put it down on the cafeteria table and you should have seen Sierra\u2019s face. She couldn\u2019t STAND it. Only the high schoolers have cell phones. I told Sierra she could make a call if she wanted and she did and then she walked to class with me. You said one smile could make a difference\u2014maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe she\u2019ll want to be my friend again. I really miss her. Well, I have to go now, Dad\u2019s yelling for me. Like always. He is totally stressed. Yesterday he forgot to put the garbage out for the truck. Everyone misses you. Xo Betsy</p><p>Dear Betsy:</p><p>I\u2019m glad to hear about your cell phone. It will be good for emergencies. Take good care of it and use it wisely. I wouldn\u2019t be me if I didn\u2019t say that if you have to bribe someone into liking you, she\u2019s not much of a friend, but we can talk more about this later. I\u2019m FINALLY leaving for Iraq today. I\u2019ll write again when I land. Love you to the moon and back.</p> <p>Mom</p><p>P.S. I hope you\u2019re helping your dad around the house ...</p><p>When Jolene stepped off the cargo jet and onto the flat sand at Balad, it was like stepping into a furnace. Tiny sand granules moved invisibly on the hot wind, insinuating themselves into everything\u2014eyes, ears, nostrils, hair, throat. Jolene wanted to cover her mouth and nose in protection, but she stood tall, eyes watering, waiting.</p><p>There was a lot of waiting: for orders, for supplies, for transport. Their trip seemed to have taken forever. From Texas to Germany to Kuwait to Tallil to Al Kut to, finally, Balad Air Base.</p><p>Wind blew through the base, hot as fire. In seconds, Jolene was sweating. After what felt like hours of waiting, she and Tami were assigned to a small trailer with wood-paneled walls that were pockmarked with tack and nail holes from previous tenants. A pair of sagging beds and a pair of scarred-up metal lockers were the only furniture.</p><p>Jolene dropped her heavy duffle bag on the floor: dust puffed up around it. Dust, she knew already, was one of the many new facts of her life. She sat down on the narrow bed, holding her rough, newly issued bed linens and the pillow she\u2019d brought from home. The bed squeaked beneath her.</p><p>\u201cWe need some pictures and posters,\u201d Tami said, coughing as she sat down on her own bed. \u201cLike Keanu or Johnny.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed and looked at her friend. The trailer smelled of dust and heat and of the men who\u2019d inhabited it before them. Wind rattled the room, plied at the windows and doors, trying to come in.</p><p>Suddenly an alarm sounded.</p><p>Jolene was first to the door. She opened it for Tami, grabbed her friend\u2019s wrist and pulled her through. The alarm and speakers were on a pole just outside their trailer and the repeated announcement\u2014GET TO THE BUNKERS!\u2014was so loud she couldn\u2019t hear anything else.</p><p>There were dozens of cement bunkers positioned around the base. Jolene and Tami ran for the nearest bunker and went inside.</p><p>There was no one else in here. They sat on the floor inside, in the dark, while mortar fire exploded all around them. Shards of cement rained down. Somewhere close, a rocket hit hard and exploded. The acrid smell of smoke slipped through the cracks in the door.</p><p>And then it was over.</p><p>Jolene stood up, not surprised to find that her legs were a little shaky.</p><p>\u201cYou notice we\u2019re the only ones in here?\u201d Tami said. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d</p><p>Jolene opened the door. Sunlight, bright as a starburst, blinded them. Black smoke hung in the air, burned their eyes. Everywhere she looked, she saw troops acting as if nothing had happened. They were riding bikes from one trailer to another, standing in line at Porta-Potties, playing football. She turned to Tami. \u201cThey told us Balad was called Mortaritaville. I guess now we know why.\u201d</p><p>The alarm sounded again. Mortar fire erupted to their left, a cement wall exploded. Smoke wafted their way.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll take some getting used to,\u201d Tami said when it was quiet again.</p><p>Jolene looked at her best friend and knew they were both thinking the same thing. For the next year, they could be killed any second of any day\u2014while they were sitting in their trailer or playing cards or taking a shower.</p><p>How did you handle knowing that any moment you could be killed, maimed, blown to bits? Worse than her fear was worry for her children. For the first time, she really thought, What if I don\u2019t make it home? How will my children survive without me?</p><p>That night, after a long day spent filling out paperwork, meeting the men and women she\u2019d be serving with, and listening to endless lectures about everything from the scorpions on base to the use of CSEL survival radios, Jolene finally made it to the showers at eleven o\u2019clock. Because there were so few women on base, the shower lines weren\u2019t long, but a woman didn\u2019t walk there in the dark alone. The army had come a long way\u2014but not far enough. \u201cBattle buddies\u201d were encouraged.</p><p>After their showers, she and Tami walked back to their trailer in silence.</p><p>Once inside, Tami collapsed on her bed and was sound asleep in no time.</p><p>Jolene was well past the point of exhaustion, but she was too wired to sleep, so she got out her laptop and started a letter home. She wasn\u2019t connected to the Internet yet, might not be for some time, but she could type the letter tonight and figure out how to send it from the comm center tomorrow. She needed to connect with her family right now, and this was the only means available to her.</p><p>She imagined them in detail, completely; the family, her family, gathered on the sofa, with the letter bringing them together. Betsy would read it aloud.</p><p>The base was bombed four times today and we just got here.</p><p>Jolene imagined their reaction to that ... and knew what her letters home had to be.</p><p>My loves, she wrote, missing them so sharply it was difficult to go on. She drew in a deep breath.</p><p>It was a long flight over here, and I have to admit that I\u2019m tired. Betsy, you wouldn\u2019t believe how flat it is, and how everything is the same color, like dying wheat. And man is it hot. I think I was sweating before I even got off the plane.</p><p>Tami and I are roommates in a little trailer. It\u2019s kind of how I imagine college would be. So we need photos and posters to make it homey. Can you help us out? I\u2019ll send pics when I can ...</p><p>Jolene wrote everything she could think of to say. When she ran out of steam, she closed the laptop and put it in her locker. That was when she noticed the pink journal Betsy had given her for her birthday. Reaching out, she brought it to her lap and opened it. She\u2019d intended to give this journal back to Betsy when she got home, but after less than twenty-four hours, she knew that wouldn\u2019t happen. She needed a place where she could be honest because from now on, she was Chief Zarkades, and she couldn\u2019t show fear or hesitation any more than she could tell her family the truth.</p><p>She opened the diary and wrote.</p><p>MAY 2005</p><p>This journal was supposed to be for you, Betsy. I intended to write down all my feelings over here, so that when I come home, I could give it to you, say here, this is everything I thought while we were apart. I thought I\u2019d give you all the advice you would need, that I\u2019d be wise and helpful. The perfect mother, even from a world away.</p><p>But the truth is that being your mother is breaking my heart. I have to figure out how to be strong, how to put my love for you and Lulu aside. If I can\u2019t, I won\u2019t be any good to anyone.</p><p>Here, between these pages you gave me, I\u2019ll have to talk to myself. Hopefully writing about my fear will lessen it. Maybe someday I\u2019ll give it to you, when you\u2019re old enough not to judge me too harshly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The base was attacked four times today. By the fourth time, when the alarm sounded, Tami and I just looked at each other and shrugged and stayed in our trailer. I kept putting away my clothes, but I could hear the whistling of missiles and mortar fire exploding, and I thought will I have a chance to say good-bye to my girls? and then it was over.</p><p>Over.</p><p>It\u2019s a word that seems to crop up more and more in my life lately. Like my marriage.</p><p>Over.</p> <p>I feel so alone over here, without Michael. Sometimes I pretend that he\u2019s still waiting for me back home. That he still loves me.</p><p>Then I wake up to the sound of bombs. I\u2019ve been in-country a day and here\u2019s what I think: I\u2019m going to die over here.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I think that before?</p><p>Michael left the office at about noon and drove north of the city. He pulled up to the street and checked the address he\u2019d been given. He peered through his car\u2019s side window, frowning. Yes, this was the place.</p><p>The psychiatrist\u2019s office did not inspire confidence. It was housed in a run-down midcentury house on a bad stretch of Aurora Avenue. Traffic streamed past it, honking.</p> <p>Michael parked between a rusted pickup truck and a shiny green electric car. Following a cracked, weed-patterned sidewalk to a slightly sagging front porch, he stopped at the front door and knocked.</p><p>The door was opened almost immediately by a lanky older man with shoulder-length gray hair and an elongated, wrinkled face. In a blue plaid suit, at least two decades out of date, and lime green shirt, he looked like a cross between Ichabod Crane and a low-rent British rocker. He was probably seventy years old, but there was something strangely youthful about him.</p><p>Michael hoped this wasn\u2019t the doctor. Juries liked their experts to look like experts.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Michael Zarkades,\u201d the man said, extending his hand. \u201cChristian Cornflower. Most of my patients call me Doctor C. Come in.\u201d</p><p>The doctor stepped back. In the front room, a young woman with purple hair and a silver nose ring sat at a whitewashed antique desk, her fingers clacking on a keyboard while she talked on the phone. Nodding at her as he passed, the doctor led Michael through an office that was full of comfortable, overstuffed chairs and old-fashioned oak tables. Rose-patterned paper covered the walls, which were further decorated with needlepoint samplers sporting pithy sayings like today is the first day of the rest of your life.</p><p>Finally, they came to what probably used to be the home\u2019s master bedroom. A big window framed the limbs of a beautiful old apple tree, decked out in bright green leaves and dotted with tiny new fruit. The walls here were 1970s wood paneling, decorated with more samplers and framed diplomas from Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and Berkeley.</p> <p>The doctor took his seat behind an antique mahogany desk.</p><p>Michael sat in a comfortable, overstuffed red-velvet tufted chair, facing the desk. \u201cI have to say, Doctor Cornflower, you come highly recommended. I\u2019m defending a young man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeith Keller.\u201d</p><p>Michael frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t name my client over the phone.\u201d</p><p>Christian shrugged eloquently. \u201cI may look like I was at Woodstock\u2014which, sadly, I missed\u2014but don\u2019t mistake my demeanor. I\u2019m a smart man, Michael. You took on the seemingly impossible defense of Keith Keller, who shot his wife in the head and then barricaded himself in his home for hours, threatening to kill himself. It was on television, for God\u2019s sake. A SWAT team brought him out, splattered in blood, with cameras rolling. Everyone knows he did it. I knew that if you were smart\u2014and I hoped you were\u2014that sooner or later you\u2019d end up at my door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI specialize in post-traumatic stress disorder. The minute I heard Keith Keller was a former marine, I looked into his case. He did two tours of duty in Iraq.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely criminal in its negligence in helping the troops coming back from Iraq. By the time this damn war\u2019s over, we\u2019ll have hundreds of thousands of severely traumatized soldiers trying to put the pieces of their lives back together. This thing with Keith will become, sadly, too common, if we don\u2019t start helping these young men and women.\u201d</p><p>Michael took out a notebook. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was in \u2019Nam. 1967. I saw firsthand how good men could be swallowed by war. And in Vietnam, at least you could go somewhere to blow off steam. In Iraq, nothing and nowhere is safe. The woman who smiles and waves can blow up the soldier who tries to help her cross the street. This was occasionally true in Vietnam; it\u2019s commonplace in Iraq. The roads are rigged with IEDs\u2014improvised explosive devices\u2014that kill anyone who passes by. Bombs are in garbage heaps, in animals, in people, in ditches. You\u2019re not safe anywhere over there. Our soldiers are returning with extreme post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould extreme PTSD diminish one\u2019s capacity for reasonable thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. That\u2019s the question that begs to be asked in this case. It\u2019s not some random bad guy shooting his wife and claiming he\u2019s crazy. Keith Keller served his country and, while he came back physically undamaged, it may not be the end of the discussion. I\u2019d have to speak with him to make an accurate diagnosis, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me a little more about PTSD, how it works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible Keith didn\u2019t even know he was killing his wife. He could have been disoriented enough not to know where he was or what he was doing. I can\u2019t say, of course, specifically until I speak with him. But I can say with authority that too many of our troops are coming home with devastating PTSD and that this condition can cause a soldier to snap. By all accounts, Keith Keller sounded like a good man before the war.\u201d</p><p>Michael tapped his pen on the pad of paper, thinking through the possibilities. Cornflower had just handed him a defense to murder one, but it was tricky. Jurors were notoriously reluctant to accept a diminished-capacity defense. And they hated insanity.</p><p>Christian pressed his fingertips together. \u201cPTSD is a legitimate psychiatric disorder and has been for decades. A person can literally be incapacitated by the disorder. What\u2019s happening over there ... well ... you should know as well as anyone.\u201d</p><p>Michael frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re a military family. Your wife is a helicopter pilot serving in Iraq right now, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really do your homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to know who I\u2019m talking to. Your wife, is she telling you much?\u201d</p><p>Michael didn\u2019t like the way the doctor was studying him. He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \u201cShe just got there, but they don\u2019t let women in combat situations. Mostly she\u2019ll be ferrying VIPs around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, eyeing Michael. Then he smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s a mother. Her instinct is to protect. Of course.\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cOf course, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what you need to know: some clich\u00e9s are true, and war is definitely hell. It\u2019s being afraid all the time, and when you\u2019re not afraid it\u2019s because you\u2019re so pumped full of adrenaline you could literally burst. It\u2019s watching people who you love\u2014really profoundly love\u2014get blown to pieces right next to you. It\u2019s seeing a leg lying in the ditch and picking it up to put it in a bag because no man\u2014or part of a man, your friend\u2014can be left behind. It\u2019s the dark night of the soul, Michael. There\u2019s no front line over there. The war is all around them, every day, everywhere they go. Some handle it better than others. We don\u2019t know why, but we do know this: the human mind can\u2019t safely or healthily process that kind of carnage and uncertainty and horror. It just can\u2019t. No one comes back from war the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you meet with Keith, assess him? I\u2019ll need a diagnosis if I\u2019m going to go for a PTSD defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Christian said. \u201cI would be honored to help this young man.\u201d</p><p>Honored. That was a word Michael hadn\u2019t heard in connection with one of his clients in a long time. So many of them were guilty as hell. He was proud to be a part of the criminal justice system\u2014an important part\u2014but he was rarely proud to defend an individual client.</p><p>It made him think of Jolene, for whom honor was so important. She would have liked that he took this case. He rose to his feet, shaking Dr. Cornflower\u2019s hand, saying, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>All the way home, he thought about Keith, and this new defense ... and what had happened to this formerly good and decent young man in Iraq.</p><p>What happened to him over there?</p><p>And then, he thought: Jolene, what\u2019s happening to you?</p><p>He was late getting home, as usual, and he knew by the look on Betsy\u2019s face that she\u2019d been counting the minutes, adding them up to hold against him. The thought of another angsty teenaged tirade, which he deserved, was more than he could stand.</p><p>His mother came into the kitchen. \u201cI had no problem staying an extra hour. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ma.\u201d</p><p>As he said it, the phone rang.</p><p>Somewhere, Betsy screamed\u2014actually screamed\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d</p><p>He heard footsteps thundering down the stairs.</p><p>Michael smiled ruefully, walking his mother to the back door. \u201cThanks again, Ma.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his cheek. \u201cBy the way, an e-mail came in from Jolene. Lulu is dying to read it, but I reminded her of the rules\u2014no reading it until you got home\u2014and she\u2019s a bit ... excited.\u201d</p><p>Michael kissed his mom and watched her walk out to her car. He thought, not for the first time, that he couldn\u2019t have handled this without her. When she\u2019d left, he went into the kitchen and poured himself a drink.</p><p>Lulu marched into the kitchen. \u201cWe got an e-mail from Mommy. Can we read it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have a drink and change my clothes first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy, I\u2019ve been waiting FOREVER.\u201d</p><p>Michael glanced at Jolene\u2019s calendar, seeing that tonight dinner was supposed to be baked chicken and rice. He thought a can of mushroom soup was involved. \u201cOkay. Go get your sister. I\u2019ll meet you at my computer.\u201d</p><p>Lulu ran upstairs. Mere seconds later, she was back, her little face scrunched up tightly, her cheeks red. \u201cShe\u2019s on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her to hang up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we can wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNONONONO!\u201d Lulu wailed. Tears filled her eyes.</p><p>Michael knew he was the boss here, but frankly, the thought of a Lulu tantrum was more than he could handle right now. With a sigh, he went upstairs, found Betsy in her room, talking on the phone. \u201cCan you call her back, sweetie? We\u2019re going to read Mom\u2019s letter before your sister levitates.\u201d</p><p>Betsy turned her back on him and kept talking.</p><p>\u201cBetsy,\u201d he said in a warning tone.</p><p>\u201cGet out, Dad, I\u2019m on the PHONE.\u201d</p><p>He took the phone from her, said, \u201cShe\u2019ll call you back in ten minutes,\u201d and hung up.</p><p>You would have thought he pushed the red button on a nuclear warhead. Betsy screamed, That was Sierra! so loud he went momentarily deaf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re reading the letter now. Come downstairs.\u201d He left her standing there, so mad she was practically emitting smoke, and went down to his office.</p><p>There, he planted Lulu on the chair at his desk and went to the sofa to wait for Betsy. It didn\u2019t take long. She stomped down the stairs and swept into the room like the Red Queen, muttering, Fine, where\u2019s the stupid letter?</p><p>Betsy scooted Lulu sideways and sat down, then Lulu scrambled onto her sister\u2019s lap, saying, \u201cRead, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>Betsy pulled up the e-mail, opened it.</p> <p>A photo filled the computer screen. In it, Jolene and Tami were standing in front of some open-air market stall with their arms around each other. Everything was washed out, a little colorless, as if maybe it was raining or really windy. But you couldn\u2019t miss how bright their smiles were.</p><p>\u201cMommy.\u201d Lulu pointed at Jolene.</p><p>Betsy scrolled down and started to read the letter out loud. \u201cIt was a long flight over here...\u201d</p><p>... and I have to admit that I\u2019m tired.</p><p>Betsy, you wouldn\u2019t believe how flat it is, and how everything is the same color, like dying wheat. And man is it hot. I think I was sweating before I even got off the plane.</p> <p>Tami and I are roommates in a little trailer. It\u2019s kind of how I imagine college would be. So we need photos and posters to make it homey. Can you help us out? I\u2019ll send pics when I can.</p><p>We had dinner at the DFAC tonight\u2014the dining facilities. Lulu, they had your favorite\u2014peach pie. It wasn\u2019t as good as Yia Yia Mila\u2019s, but it made me think of home.</p><p>We are what\u2019s called backfill (an army word for substitutes, kind of) for the 131st. Everyone we\u2019ve met is great. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll make lots of friends.</p><p>Well, guys, I better get some sleep.</p><p>I\u2019m thinking of you all the time and loving you to the moon and back.</p><p>XXXOOO</p> <p>Mom</p><p>P.S.: Good luck on your math test, Bets. I know you\u2019ll rock it. I\u2019m proud of you!</p><p>\u201cRead it again,\u201d Lulu said. \u201cMy part. Daddy, make her read it again,\u201d she whined.</p><p>\u201cThere, I read it. Big deal. It\u2019s hot,\u201d Betsy said. She turned to look at Michael. \u201cCan I go back upstairs and call Sierra now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Michael said, barely listening. As she ran past him, he got up from the chair and went to stand in front of the computer.</p><p>He stared at the picture of two women in uniforms smiling for the camera.</p><p>\u201cShe looks happy,\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>Michael thought about what he\u2019d learned today and he couldn\u2019t reconcile it with this photograph. He thought about the descriptions of the war he\u2019d heard, about finding your friends\u2019 body parts and roadside bombs and raining shrapnel.</p> <p>Two women, best friends, smiling for the camera.</p><p>He understood suddenly what Cornflower had meant. She\u2019s a mother. Her instinct is to protect.</p><p>This photograph was a lie, as was everything she\u2019d told him about her deployment. There\u2019s no front line over there, Cornflower had said. So there was no safe place.</p><p>Jolene\u2014always the hero, always the mother\u2014was sugarcoating her life to prove there was nothing for them to worry about. She\u2019d planted the seeds early. They don\u2019t let women in combat. I\u2019ll be flying VIPs around, nothing dangerous.</p><p>He\u2019d bought it because he wanted to. He\u2019d looked away. He shouldn\u2019t have, for God\u2019s sake. He\u2019d known it was a war. Maybe it was the political backlash about imaginary weapons of mass destruction, or the bait and switch with Saddam Hussein. He didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d imagined this to be a lesser war, maybe, one that would be over soon and with few American casualties.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the photos on the news of soldiers walking with Iraqi children, handing out water, posing for pictures, and he\u2019d read about suicide bombers, but somehow he\u2019d imagined those two things as separate. He\u2019d let himself believe Jolene when she told him that she would be far from combat.</p><p>What an idiot she must think him.</p><p>He\u2019d been so busy thinking about himself, being pissed off about how her choice impacted his life, that he\u2019d barely considered the truth of where she was and what she was doing.</p><p>How did she feel, lying in bed at night, alone and far from home, knowing any second a bomb could hit her trailer and she could be killed?</p><p>June slipped away from Michael; days fell like rain, disappearing in the ground at his feet. At home, he thought about work; at work, he thought about home. He was always rushing and almost invariably arriving late. I\u2019m sorry was his new default sentence. He\u2019d said it more in the last few weeks than in the last few years.</p><p>At the end of the school year, he\u2019d had to recalibrate his schedule. His mom was still a huge help with the girls, but summer was her busy season at the Green Thumb, and she couldn\u2019t be at his house as much as before. So he\u2019d shortened his workweek to four days. Friday through Sunday he worked from home, struggling to juggle the demands of fatherhood with those of his job. When he wasn\u2019t grocery shopping or cooking dinner or washing dishes, he was writing briefs and researching cases. He sent the girls to as many day camps as possible, and still he didn\u2019t have time to get everything done. Driving them from one place to another\u2014or finding someone else to drive them\u2014took an inordinate amount of time. Last week, he\u2019d finally admitted that he wasn\u2019t getting as much work done as he needed to. He\u2019d handed off most of his smaller cases to associates.</p><p>That gave him more time to work on the Keller defense.</p><p>Today, his plan was to work on the deposition questions for the policemen who\u2019d arrested Keith, as well as the jailhouse snitch.</p><p>He woke early and went downstairs to make breakfast. At ten o\u2019clock, he was going to drop the girls off at the Thumb, where they would \u201chelp\u201d his mother until he picked them up at two o\u2019clock. It wasn\u2019t much time to work, but these days, he took what he could get.</p><p>Lulu\u2019s questions started first thing: It\u2019s sunny today, Daddy. Can we go to the beach? Mommy almost always takes us to the beach when it\u2019s sunny. I could make a sand castle. Do you know how to make a sand castle, Daddy?</p><p>The questions came at him so fast he mumbled something and walked away, choosing to drink his coffee standing in front of the TV.</p><p>Another mistake. CNN reported that a suicide bomber had killed six people in a market in Baghdad.</p><p>The phone rang.</p><p>Lulu screamed, \u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d in a voice so loud the neighborhood dogs probably came running.</p><p>He saw Lulu run for the phone, pick it up, say \u201cMommy?\u201d Then her smile fell and her shoulders slumped. She hung up the phone and shuffled back into the kitchen and climbed up into her chair. \u201cIt\u2019s Sierra,\u201d she said glumly. \u201cBetsy is talking to her.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Betsy came thundering down the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m going to the mall with Sierra to see a movie.\u201d</p><p>Michael leaned forward, switched off the television. \u201cCan you please rephrase that in the form of a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Can I have some money?\u201d</p><p>Michael turned around, ready to say, Don\u2019t you mean please, Dad, may I go to the mall? but when he saw her, the teasing question fell out of reach.</p><p>She had on enough makeup to be an extra in the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and her outfit was equally unacceptable: pink Ugg boots, a jean skirt so short it could have been a valance, and a white sweatshirt that had been cut off to reveal an inch of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cUh. Clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother wouldn\u2019t let you out of the house in that getup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s all over your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe she could stand there and lie to him. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not? You look like Tootsie waiting for a close-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means, young lady, that you are not leaving the house like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I am. Sierra\u2019s brother is picking me up in a half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra\u2019s brother? And how old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a senior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you mean senior citizen, because no eighteen-year-old boy is taking you to the mall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are ruining my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019ve said so before. Give me Sierra\u2019s number and I\u2019ll call her mom. If you dress like a human, I\u2019ll drive you girls there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, I feel the same way about a trip to the mall. It\u2019s up to you, kiddo.\u201d He shrugged and turned the TV back on, changing the channel. An ad for the new Spielberg movie, War of the Worlds, filled the screen.</p><p>War. It was everywhere.</p><p>Betsy stomped her foot.</p><p>Michael ignored her. In the past weeks, he might not have learned everything he needed to know about parenting a preteen, but he\u2019d learned a few valuable lessons: don\u2019t back down. And use peer pressure. Oh, and try to be calm. Two crazies did not make for a good day.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go take off the makeup I\u2019m not wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd change your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaagh!\u201d she yelled, running up the stairs. He could hear her stomping around up there.</p><p>Michael shook his head. So much drama.</p><p>He walked into the kitchen, where Lulu sat at the kitchen table, kneeling on a pillow she\u2019d placed on one of the chairs. Her My Mommy Fights for Freedom coloring book was open in front of her, along with a pick-up-sticks tangle of crayons. She was furiously adding red streaks to an American flag.</p><p>\u201cHow come we don\u2019t have a flag up, Daddy?\u201d Lulu said. \u201cMommy\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Michael stopped. How was it possible that he\u2019d never considered this before? All the things he\u2019d learned from Cornflower and Keller slipped into his mind again.</p><p>They were a military family.</p><p>He heard that all the time; people said it to him and he shrugged it off, thinking, no, not really; my wife is just in the Guard. Because HE wasn\u2019t in the military, it hadn\u2019t felt real to him, and God knew he\u2019d never liked her commitment or supported it.</p><p>Still, they were a military family, and his wife was at war. And a four-year-old had seen the truth of that before he had.</p><p>He tousled Lulu\u2019s hair, watching her color a scene of a girl waving good-bye to a woman in uniform. \u201cWe\u2019ll put one up,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Betsy stomped back into the room, coming up behind him. \u201cI look sufficiently gross now. Can I go?\u201d</p><p>He turned.</p><p>Betsy was dressed in cutoffs that were too short in his opinion, but not enough to fight about, a tee shirt that read Oops! I Did It Again, and flip-flops. She\u2019d taken off most of the makeup, but was still wearing blue mascara and blush.</p><p>Did she think he couldn\u2019t see it?</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded, and at that her voice broke. He saw how much this meant to her, and he was lost. The games these preteen girls played with each other seemed ridiculous to him. Betsy could go from smiling to ballistic in a second, all based on some under-the-breath comment from a former friend. God forbid someone laughed at her hair. \u201cCome on, Dad, it\u2019s Sierra. I\u2019ve waited so looong for her to call. I need to go. Pleaaaase.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Call him a coward, but he couldn\u2019t deny her. She looked so damned desperate and lonely, and he knew now how much this turnaround with Sierra meant to Betsy. \u201cYou look fine, Betsy. And you can go to the mall. Just let me call Sierra\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already called. It was so embarrassing to say that my dad wouldn\u2019t let me ride with Tod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorrifying,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Mrs. Phillips is picking us up in ten minutes. So can I have money?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She sighed dramatically. \u201cTwenty-five.\u201d</p><p>Michael dug into his pocket and pulled out his wallet. While he was counting his bills, Betsy shrieked.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re here! Give me the money, Dad. Now! Hurry! They might leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking you out to the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He walked her out of the house and down the driveway, where a blue minivan waited.</p> <p>Sure enough, a woman was driving.</p><p>\u201cHere, Betsy,\u201d he said, handing her thirty dollars. She swiped it like a raptor taking prey and mumbled something that might have been good-bye.</p><p>The driver rolled down her window. \u201cHi,\u201d she said to him. \u201cI\u2019m Stephanie. I understand Betsy thought Tod would be driving.\u201d She smiled. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>Michael smiled back. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. I remember being eighteen. Focus behind the wheel was not my strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband says the same thing.\u201d Stephanie glanced in the backseat, then leaned closer. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the girls together again. How\u2019s Jolene?\u201d</p><p>People asked him that all the time. He never really knew what to say. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I said hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d He backed away, watching the car back down the driveway and then drive away.</p> <p>He walked back up to his house. On the porch, he stopped, looked around. Sunlight spilled across the white slats, brightening the faded chair cushions. The grass out front was still a deep, rich green\u2014summer\u2019s heat hadn\u2019t found its way here yet. Down below, across the road, he could see a family gathering, building a fire and setting up chairs for a day at the beach. In a normal year, Jolene would be down there already, setting up coolers and chairs.</p><p>He went back inside. \u201cHey, Lulu,\u201d he said, closing the door behind him. \u201cWant to help me find our flag?\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Dear Mom:</p><p>I had the best weekend EVER! You won\u2019t believe what happened. I\u2019ll start at the beginning. First, I got my phone\u2014you remember that\u2014and Sierra thought it was so cool and we sat together. Then she talked to me in PE, and THEN she got in a fight with Zoe because Zoe like, totally, lied to her about what Jimmy said about her. So Sierra is my friend again! Last week we went to the mall together and saw War of the Worlds, which was so cool.</p><p>And guess what? Zoe was there and we didn\u2019t even talk to her.</p><p>Dad says Sierra and me can go to kayaking camp together in July. Cool, huh?</p><p>Anyway, that\u2019s everything. Things are okay here.</p><p>Lulu doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s invisible all the time anymore, so that\u2019s good. We made Daddy put up a flag.</p><p>Well, I gotta go. Dad is ordering pizza for dinner again and I want pineapple on it. Be careful, Mom.</p><p>Love, B.</p><p>P.S.: Sierra wants to know if you\u2019ve shot anybody yet. Have you?</p><p>Dear Betsy:</p><p>Wow. That\u2019s a lot of news! I am so glad to hear about you and Sierra working on your friendship. You two have been friends for a long time, and those relationships are important. BUT I want you to be careful, too. I haven\u2019t forgotten about Sierra\u2019s thing with the cigarettes, and honestly, I think she can be kind of a mean girl sometimes. Be careful.</p><p>Also, you should think about how it felt when Sierra and Zoe froze you out. Do you really want to be the kind of person who treats someone like that, who hurts a girl\u2019s feelings for sport? Be nice to Zoe. Be the kind of girl I know you can be.</p><p>Glad you\u2019re having a fun summer already, though. I wish I were there. I sure do miss you guys.</p><p>And don\u2019t worry about me. I know you saw that report on CNN, but I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s dangerous over here, that\u2019s true. But mostly, Tami and I are flying way away from the bad areas. We fly a bunch of VIPs around, and supplies. You don\u2019t need to worry about me. Honest.</p><p>Love you to the moon and back. Mom</p><p>P.S. Tell your dad enough pizza! And no, I haven\u2019t shot anyone. Did Sierra really ask you that?</p><p>JULY 2005</p><p>I once read a Stephen King book that used the term SSDD. Same shit, different day. That\u2019s pretty much what the last month in Iraq has been. Day after day of rising at 0 dark thirty, getting mission orders, checking my aircraft, and flying out.</p><p>Today I was on duty for more than fourteen hours all together. Honestly, Tami and I are so tired most of the time that we hardly talk before we fall asleep. The heat and dust are unbearable. It\u2019s over 125 degrees most days, and when you consider that I\u2019m wearing a helmet, gloves, and Kevlar. Well, the way I smell after a mission cannot be good.</p><p>We\u2019ve been flying at night a lot, and that\u2019s better, at least with regard to the heat. Sometimes we\u2019re supporting the medevac guys, and I have to say, that\u2019s no easy job. I can\u2019t get the images out of my mind\u2014soldiers blown apart, bleeding, screaming for help.</p><p>Only yesterday, I ended up sitting with a kid outside one of the hospital tents. He was young\u2014no more than twenty-five\u2014and I knew he wasn\u2019t going to make it. I\u2019m no doctor, and even now I can\u2019t describe his wounds, they were too horrific. I knew, that\u2019s all. Anyway, I held his hand and listened to him talk, and mostly what he kept saying was \u201ctell my wife I love her.\u201d I told him I would, and I\u2019ll write her a letter\u2014what else can I do? But when I left him, when he died, and I was standing there, listening to the war going on and the doctors yelling and a helicopter landing somewhere close by, I thought: What would I say at the end like that? Of course I\u2019d be thinking about my children, whom I love more than the world, but what about Michael? I know he doesn\u2019t love me anymore\u2014if words hadn\u2019t been enough to prove it, the lack of letters since I went away certainly make his position clear\u2014but do I still love him?</p><p>The truth is, at the end, I\u2019d be reaching for him. I know I would. Reaching out for a man who no longer wants to be there.</p><p>Just like my mother.</p><p>By late July, Michael and the girls had settled into a manageable routine. This week, Betsy was away at a weeklong summer camp on Orcas Island, where she was learning to kayak; Lulu was spending the weekend with her grandmother. Last he\u2019d heard, they were making stuff out of dry macaroni.</p><p>Without them, the house was quiet. Maybe too quiet.</p><p>It was growing late; night was beginning to fall. After a long day at the office, Michael had come home, eaten a bowl of Raisin Bran, and then gone back to work. He\u2019d finally received a copy of Keith Keller\u2019s military records, and he had the documents laid out on his kitchen table, alongside interview transcripts. In the past week he\u2019d spoken with Ed and his wife, as well as Dr. Cornflower. There was also a list of prospective witnesses, military and civilian.</p><p>By all accounts, Keith had been an ordinary small-town boy before he went off to war. He\u2019d won local scholarships and hit home runs and graduated from high school. He\u2019d fallen in love, almost literally, with the girl next door. They\u2019d had a country club wedding, complete with DJ and no-host bar, and gone to Honolulu for their honeymoon.</p><p>And then: September Eleventh.</p><p>That day had changed the course of Keith\u2019s life. He\u2019d had a friend on Flight 93, a classmate who had gone east to check out colleges. When Keith heard about the crash, and the sudden, unexpected danger of terrorism on American soil, he\u2019d enlisted in the Marines.</p><p>He was that kind of guy, Ed had said, shaking his head. Keith wanted to be part of the solution.</p><p>So off Keith went to boot camp and then to war. He\u2019d done two tours in Iraq, and with each return, Ed said he saw less of the boy he\u2019d raised.</p><p>Michael flipped through the research his team had put together. Keith had been in the Sunni triangle, one of the deadliest regions of the war. Roadside bombs hit my brigade at least twice a day, every day, for a year, Keith had said. That\u2019s a lot of shit blowing up around you. A lot of your friends dying ... when I got home, sounds were the worst. When someone slammed a door or a car backfired, I hit the ground. Sudden light could totally freak me out.</p><p>Michael sat back. Why was it he hadn\u2019t known all this, about the deaths and the devastation, about the wounds our soldiers were suffering? This was 2005, for God\u2019s sake. The war had been going on for a while. The truth should have been more apparent. The nightly news should have been showing images of flag-draped coffins being carried onto cargo jets, of heroes coming home in boxes.</p><p>He got up, walked away from the table. The Keller case was beginning to trouble him deeply, and not for the usual reasons. The more he read about his client, the more he worried about Jolene.</p><p>He grabbed a Corona from the fridge, popped its cap, and went out to stand on the porch. There, he touched the fraying white wicker back of the chair beside him. Why get new furniture? Jolene had said when they\u2019d found this chair abandoned by the side of the road. Back then, they\u2019d had more love than money, and he\u2019d been unable to deny her anything, even a crappy used chair. I want a chair that tells a story.</p><p>The night was quiet around him. Somewhere, a coyote howled; it was a mournful, elegiac sound.</p><p>On the road below, a bicycle turned onto the Flynns\u2019 driveway\u2014Seth. Michael had a sudden memory of years ago, when Betsy and Seth had ridden their bikes together constantly, and Jolene had worried so much ...</p><p>Michael waved at Seth.</p><p>Seth saw him and pedaled from one driveway to the other.</p><p>\u201cHey, Seth,\u201d Michael said as the kid rode into the light thrown by the fixtures at the garage. As always, Seth looked thin and odd, with his flat cheeks and straight black hair. Tonight he was dressed all in black. Not a great idea when biking at night.</p><p>He got off his bike, held it beside him. \u201cHey, Mr. Z.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Seth?\u201d</p><p>The kid shrugged. \u201cFine, I guess. My grandma\u2019s staying with me. She rented a movie for tonight. It\u2019s probably G-rated and stars a talking dog. Dad had to go to Ellensburg this week for some car part. Is Betsy still at kayak camp?\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded. \u201c\u2019Til Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Michael frowned. \u201cYou want a Coke?\u201d</p><p>Seth grinned, showing off his braces. \u201cRad.\u201d</p><p>Michael took that as a yes and went inside for a soda. When he returned to the porch, Seth was leaning back against the railing; his bike lay on its side in the gravel driveway.</p><p>Michael sat down. He should have known this kid really well\u2014he had been around forever; once, he and Betsy had been inseparable\u2014but honestly, Michael had barely shared ten words with Seth in all the years he\u2019d been coming around. It was like with Carl. Michael just didn\u2019t have much in common with them. Until now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, Seth, what\u2019s the deal with you and Betsy? One day you guys were thick as thieves, and the next thing I knew you were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe started hanging with some girls\u2014I call \u2019em the bitchwolves. Sierra and Zoe. They think I\u2019m a loser. I guess Betsy agrees now.\u201d</p><p>Michael frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink again,\u201d Seth mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m not the most popular kid in school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither was I,\u201d Michael said. \u201cAnd the quarterback\u2014Jerry Lundberg, by the way\u2014is doing time. High school was probably the highlight of his life.\u201d</p><p>Seth took a drink of Coke. Then he said, \u201cThere was a bombing yesterday. I saw it on CNN. A helicopter went down. Did you know that when one of our soldiers is killed, they shut down communications on base until the relatives can be notified? I was, like, waiting for a call. They\u2019re fine though.\u201d</p><p>Michael had been in court all day. He hadn\u2019t watched the news when he got home. \u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said, his voice tight.</p><p>\u201cMom keeps sending me these pictures of her and Jo. They\u2019re like vacation photos; girls just want to have fun. She thinks I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Michael said quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s not the reason.\u201d</p> <p>Seth looked at him. \u201cMy dad says we need to believe she\u2019ll be fine and she will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, glancing down at his half-empty beer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll forget her.\u201d</p><p>Michael looked away. He understood how that could happen, how you could forget someone. Hadn\u2019t he done it himself, hadn\u2019t he forgotten Jolene while she was standing right beside him?</p><p>Michael didn\u2019t realize how long he\u2019d been silent, but then Seth cleared his throat and said, \u201cThanks for the Coke, Mr. Z. I better get home. My grandma calls the National Guard when I\u2019m late\u2014and in our family, that\u2019s no joke. She calls Ben Lomand, and he chews me out.\u201d</p><p>Michael smiled. \u201cGood to talk to you, Seth. Tell your dad I say hi.\u201d</p> <p>When the kid walked away, Michael added, \u201cYou should come around sometime, see Betsy.\u201d</p><p>Seth turned to him. The sadness in his dark glance surprised Michael. \u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>If Dante had lived in modern times, Michael had no doubt that going to the mall with your daughters would have qualified as one of the circles of hell. Especially when you were there to find a birthday present for your twelve-year-old daughter\u2019s on-again best friend. So far, they\u2019d been here an hour and found nothing. He was so tired of looking at glittery headbands and ripped-neckline tee shirts and posters of boy bands he could scream.</p><p>They were in Wal-Mart now, drifting through the makeup aisle. Lulu was like a pitbull straining on a leash; she kept grabbing Michael\u2019s hand and surging forward, yanking him toward some cheap, sparkly thing.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Betsy said, pointing to a small, neon-pink case that held an array of makeup items. \u201cShe\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Sierra allowed to wear makeup?\u201d</p><p>Betsy gave him the Look. \u201cI\u2019m the only one who can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, seeing the mascara smudges beneath her eyes and the blush that looked like war paint. \u201cRight. And you don\u2019t. Fine. Get it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet it.\u201d He would have paid anything, really, just to get out of there.</p><p>Lulu said, \u201cI want something, Daddy,\u201d and tugged at his hand.</p><p>\u201cI need wrapping paper and a card,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>Michael was pretty sure he groaned aloud. Still, he followed her out of the makeup aisle and toward whatever came next, all the while listening to Lulu shout: Stop, Dad! I want that and that and that!</p><p>In the gift-wrap aisle, Betsy stopped so suddenly Michael ran into her. Lulu yelled, \u201cGeez, Betsy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go to the bathroom,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Betsy, can you wait \u2019til\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned on him. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>She said it so forcefully, he frowned. With another sigh, he followed her to the restrooms, although it set Betsy off, caused her to hiss at him to stop following her, but what could he do? Lately he\u2019d developed an irrational fear that he\u2019d lose one of the kids. He had nightmares where he said to Jo, I don\u2019t know, I just looked away for a second.</p><p>He sat down in one of the uncomfortable chairs to wait.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, play patty-cake,\u201d Lulu said, raising her hands like a mime.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Before Lulu could start whining, Betsy came out of the bathroom, looking pale and terrified. She moved awkwardly, as if her knees didn\u2019t bend right anymore.</p><p>He rose, instantly worried. \u201cBetsy?\u201d</p><p>She glanced around. When he said her name again, louder, she flinched. \u201cShhhhh.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer. \u201cHoney? What is it?\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked up at him. Her mouth was unsteady, her eyes huge. \u201cI started my period.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s stomach literally dropped. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a period?\u201d Lulu said loudly and Betsy clamped a hand over her sister\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Lulu immediately shrieked.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Lulu,\u201d Michael hissed. To Betsy he said, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need ... something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething. Right.\u201d What she needed was a woman, but that wasn\u2019t going to happen. He took hold of her hand and led her back through the store. She walked woodenly, kept putting her hands behind her, hiding the back of her pants.</p><p>Feminine Products.</p><p>There was no doubt about that. He stared at the rows of multicolored packaging, trying to figure out what she needed. Wings! Adhesive strips! Absorbent!</p><p>Betsy looked like she was ready to vomit. \u201cHurry, Dad. Pick one.\u201d</p><p>Come on, Michael. Step up to the plate. She needs you now. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said firmly, moving closer to the products, reading the packages.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Betsy said under her breath, bouncing on the balls of her feet. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea what made one product better than the other, so he chose the most expensive and handed it to her.</p><p>Betsy gasped. \u201cI can\u2019t buy it. What if someone I know is there? Oh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the restrooms.\u201d</p><p>Betsy flushed with gratitude and ran off. Michael hefted a wiggling, complaining Lulu into his arms. All the way to the checkout, she sang \u201cperiodperiodperiod\u201d at the top of her lungs. He smiled awkwardly at the lady who rang up the sale, and then hurried back to the bathrooms, carrying a small plastic bag.</p><p>Betsy waited for him by the back wall, tapping her foot.</p><p>\u201cDo you ... uh ... know how to use these?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science, Dad.\u201d He could tell that she wanted to be sarcastic, but her voice wasn\u2019t sharp enough. She took the package and ran into the restroom.</p><p>At least fifteen minutes later, Betsy came out of the bathroom slowly, staring at Michael. She looked scared and young; ironic, since this was supposed to be the start of womanhood. Slowly, she turned around. \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Michael said softly. \u201cYour pants are fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhew,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>\u201cCan we go now?\u201d Lulu whined.</p><p>Michael picked up his youngest, and off they went, headed once again for the gift-wrap aisle. By the time they\u2019d picked out the paper and the card and bought Scotch tape and ribbon, Lulu was out of control, but her wailing and pointing was easier to take than Betsy\u2019s silence.</p><p>Michael\u2019s heart went out to her. He knew this was one of those moments that would be filed away and remembered as a day her mother had been disappointingly gone and her father had let her down.</p><p>He wanted to give her something that would take the sting out of this memory when she looked back on it. He was thinking that as they passed the jewelry counter. \u201cHey, Betsy,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you want to get your ears pierced? They\u2019re having a special today.\u201d</p><p>Betsy gasped and then grinned, showing off the red, white, and blue rubber bands on her braces. \u201cMom says I have to be thirteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close enough. And you\u2019re ... a woman now, I guess,\u201d he mumbled, uncomfortable saying it. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have to tell your mom.\u201d</p><p>Betsy threw her arms around Michael and hugged him tightly. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Me TOO!\u201d Lulu said, her voice rising.</p><p>Michael winced. Really, his youngest daughter had a screech worthy of some prehistoric bird caught in a trap. He looked around, sure people were staring. Please, Daddy, pleasepleaseplease ...</p><p>Dear Mom:</p><p>Dad says I have to write you a letter so I am. I started my period. In Walmart. With Dad.</p><p>He bought me pads that were like twin mattresses. Sierra\u2019s mom says that\u2019s what happens when you send a man to do a woman\u2019s job Ugh.</p><p>Thanks for not being there when I needed you.</p><p>AUGUST</p><p>Man, it\u2019s hot. I am getting so used to my own sweat and stink that I don\u2019t even smell it anymore. I\u2019m starting to dream about ice. When I sleep, that is.</p><p>The commander called a meeting last night. He told us what we already knew\u2014the missions are getting more dangerous. We\u2019re getting shot at all the time and we land under fire. We\u2019re going to be doing a lot more air assaults, apparently. Yay.</p><p>And Betsy started her period without me. Honestly, I can\u2019t even write about that, it makes me feel so bad. I\u2019m missing her life. Missing it.</p><p>In the middle of August, Dr. Cornflower delivered his psychiatric evaluation on Keith. His diagnosis: extreme post-traumatic stress disorder. Further, the doctor gave the opinion that Keller was competent to stand trial, that he fully understood the nature of the proceedings.</p><p>That meant the trial was a go. A court date had been set.</p><p>Michael looked out at the collection of eager, ambitious young faces seated around him. They were at a conference table. Each of the three associates chosen for the defense team had graduated at the top of his or her class and worked at least sixty hours a week. To be a great criminal defense attorney, you had to be hungry, and they were.</p><p>\u201cSo we have our start. PTSD, as you know, is a diminished-capacity defense, which means we will use it to negate intent. We\u2019ll prove that Keith couldn\u2019t form the specific intention to kill his wife; without intent, it\u2019s not murder one. I don\u2019t have to tell you all that anything less would be a victory in this case. However, juries don\u2019t like diminished capacity much more than they like insanity, so we\u2019ll need experts, eyewitnesses, and statistics.\u201d He assigned tasks\u2014some would research sentencing, some jury instructions, some precedents in Washington State and elsewhere. Others would draft the crucial pretrial motions. \u201cI want to find any case anywhere where PTSD\u2014especially with regard to Iraq\u2014was successful and any case in which it was argued. I will want a draft of our notice to raise the defense by Monday. Hilary, you get started on that. You have all the reports and expert information you need. Make sure you meet all the evidentiary rules. Are there any questions?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Michael stood, and the team did the same. As they walked out of the conference room, he repacked his briefcase and headed back to his office. For the next few hours, he worked at his computer, pulling up every case with a PTSD defense that he could find.</p><p>On the ferry ride home, he was still at it. He read Cornflower\u2019s report again, specifically focusing on Keith\u2019s telling of his own story.</p> <p>In Ramadi, we used to bet on whose tent would be hit by mortar next ... I was walking back from taking a piss when a mortar landed in our Howitzer ... we couldn\u2019t do shit ... they burned up alive in there, screaming ... And there was bagging\u2014picking up body parts ... legs, arms ... we put \u2019em in bags and carried \u2019em back. It\u2019s weird to grab your buddy\u2019s arm ...</p><p>Michael put down the report. What was happening to Jolene over there? What was she seeing? Once the question arose, he couldn\u2019t ignore it. He thought about his wife, and for the first time he imagined the worst ...</p><p>It was still light outside\u2014lavender and beautiful\u2014when he parked in front of the Green Thumb.</p><p>His mother met him at the door, looking worried.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She brushed his apology aside with an impatient wave. \u201cBetsy is upset. That girlfriend of hers\u2014Sierra\u2014called her an hour ago and told her that a female helicopter pilot was shot down today. I tried to calm her, but...\u201d</p><p>Michael glanced past his mother; he saw Lulu in the corner, seated at a garden display table, pretending to serve her doll tea in a paper cup. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside, by the big rock.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Pot for dinner. You want to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to, but I can\u2019t. Helen and I are changing the window display tonight. Labor Day\u2019s coming up\u2014the big sale starts.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cThanks, Ma.\u201d With a sigh, he headed through the store, past the shelves full of knickknacks and planters and gardening tools. At the back door, he paused for just a moment, gathering his strength, and then he went out to the parking lot that ran between the Front Street stores and the marina. A huge gray boulder sat on a patch of grass overlooking the docks. For as long as he\u2019d lived here, kids had scrambled up, down, and around the rock. Now, he saw his daughter sitting on top of it, her blond hair tousled by the warm summer breeze, her gaze turned out to sea. Hundreds of boats bobbed on the flat calm waters below.</p> <p>He came up beside the rock. \u201cHey, you,\u201d he said, looking up.</p><p>She looked down at him, her pale, pimply face ravaged by tears. There was an alarming flatness in her eyes. \u201cHi, Dad. You\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>As he stood there, trying to dredge up some words of wisdom, her watch alarm bleeped. Betsy yanked the watch off and threw it to the ground.</p><p>He bent over and picked it up, heard the beep-beep-beep that his wife was listening to at this very moment, a world away. For a moment, he imagined it, imagined her, looking down at her watch, probably feeling so far from home.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s fine,\u201d he said at last. Honestly, all of this had been easier before the Keller case, when he could believe in Jolene\u2019s optimistic letters and assurances of safety. Now, he knew better. How was he supposed to comfort a child when her fears were reasonable and he shared them? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>Betsy slid down from the rock. \u201cIt could have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>Her eyes watered at that, her mouth wavered. He could see her composure crumbling. \u201cThis time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m forgetting her,\u201d Betsy said, reaching into her pocket for the latest picture Jolene had sent, lifting it. \u201cThis ... this isn\u2019t her. She isn\u2019t only a soldier.\u201d</p><p>What could he say that wasn\u2019t a lie? \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Crab Pot and look at the picture of her. That will make you remember.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>He reached for her hand. Sometimes holding on was all you could do.</p><p>After dinner, Michael led the girls into the house and watched them run upstairs. He felt drained. He should have known how affecting dinner at the Crab Pot would be. Jolene\u2019s spirit had been so strong there. Lulu and Betsy had spent a good ten minutes staring up at the Polaroid picture of their mom tacked to the wall. Lulu wouldn\u2019t even eat\u2014she just held on to that little wings pin and cried.</p><p>He poured himself a drink and stared out the window at the night just beginning to fall across the bay. He heard Lulu come up behind him. She climbed monkeylike up his body, attaching to his hip. \u201cBetsy is crying, Daddy,\u201d she said in that squeaky voice of hers.</p><p>He kissed her forehead, sighing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Mommy,\u201d she said, then burst into tears. \u201cShe got losted or hurted, right?\u201d</p><p>He tightened his hold on Lulu. \u201cNo, baby. Mommy\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss my mommy.\u201d</p><p>He rocked her back and forth, soothing her until her tears dried. When she was calm again, he put her down on the sofa and started The Little Mermaid DVD. That would keep Lulu busy for a while. She should be in bed, of course. It was late. But all he could think about was Jo, and what could have happened.</p><p>He didn\u2019t really make a decision; rather, he found himself moving toward his office. He went inside and shut the door. His hands were shaking; ice rattled in his glass.</p><p>It could have been.</p><p>He slumped onto the sofa and bowed his head. Betsy was worried that she was forgetting her mother. But Michael had forgotten Jolene long before, hadn\u2019t he? He\u2019d lived with her, slept with her, and still somehow had forgotten the woman he\u2019d married. He glanced to his left and saw a framed picture of him and Jolene; it had been taken years ago, at the arboretum in Seattle. They had been young then, and so in love. Look at the family of ducks, Michael, that will be us one day, waddling along with our babies in tow ... In that one image, in Jolene\u2019s bright smile, he remembered her.</p><p>He was a little unsteady as he got to his feet. At the bookcase, he withdrew a leather-bound photo album and an old VHS tape. Tucking them under his arm, he went into the family room, asked Lulu to follow him, and went upstairs.</p><p>He knocked on Betsy\u2019s door. \u201cCan we come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He picked up Lulu, carried her into the room, and sat down on the bed beside Betsy. Settling a girl on each side of him, he opened the album.</p><p>Centered in the first page, covered by a shiny piece of see-through plastic, was one of the few pictures he\u2019d ever seen of his wife as a young girl. She stood on a rocky outcropping, wearing faded jeans and a cheap V-neck sweater. She was turned slightly away from the camera, looking into some invisible distance, with messy strands of long blond hair pulled across her face by the wind. Off to the left was a man walking away; all you could see was a ragged jeans hemline and a scuffed black boot.</p><p>Jolene had often said she\u2019d chosen this photo to begin her life\u2019s trail because it was so representative: her mother was missing and her dad was leaving. He\u2019d seen this picture lots of times, but now he really looked at it, saw how sharp she looked, how thin. Her hair looked as if it hadn\u2019t seen a comb in weeks, and the loss in her eyes was wrenching. She was watching the man walk away. Why hadn\u2019t he noticed that before?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s about fifteen here. Not much older than you, Bets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks sad,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cuz we aren\u2019t borned yet,\u201d Lulu said, repeating what Jolene always said about this photograph.</p><p>Michael turned the pages slowly, taking his girls on a journey down the road of Jolene\u2019s life. There were pictures of Jolene in her army uniform, seated in a chopper, out playing Frisbee. In each successive photograph, she looked taller, stronger, but it wasn\u2019t until their wedding picture that he saw her, the woman with whom he\u2019d fallen in love. She\u2019d smiled and cried through the ceremony, and told him it was the happiest day of her life.</p><p>Our lives, he\u2019d said, kissing her. We will always be in love like this, Jo.</p><p>Of course we will, she\u2019d said, laughing, and they\u2019d believed it for years and years, until ... they hadn\u2019t. No, until he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cShe looks pretty,\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>He knew all that Jolene had lost in her life, and the things she\u2019d never had and the things she\u2019d overcome, and yet in all of these pictures, she looked incredibly happy. He\u2019d made her happy; that was something he\u2019d always known. What he\u2019d forgotten was how happy she\u2019d made him.</p><p>\u201cWhen is she coming home?\u201d Lulu asked. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNovember,\u201d Betsy said with a sigh. \u201cFor just two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lulu made a small, squeaking sound. \u201cWill I be five by then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cBut she won\u2019t be here for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>Before Lulu could start crying, Michael got up and put a tape in the TV. Since Jolene\u2019s deployment, the girls had obsessively watched the \u201cgood-bye reels,\u201d as he liked to call them\u2014the tapes she\u2019d made for each of the girls. But they hadn\u2019t seen this one in years.</p><p>He hit Play and the movie started. The first scene was Jolene, bleary-eyed, holding a baby girl who was no bigger than a half gallon of milk. \u201cSay hi to your fans, little Elizabeth. Or will you be Betsy? Michael? Does she look like a Betsy to you...\u201d</p><p>Now Betsy was walking for the first time, wobbling forward, laughing as she plopped over ... Jolene was clapping and crying, saying, \u201cLook, Michael, don\u2019t miss this...\u201d</p><p>Twelve years of his life, passing in forty-two minutes of tape.</p><p>He hit Stop.</p><p>There she was, his Jo. Her beautiful face was distorted, pixellated by the stop-motion, but even through the grainy, muted colors, he saw the power of her smile.</p><p>He saw the whole of his life in her eyes, all his dreams and hopes and fears.</p><p>I don\u2019t love you anymore.</p><p>How could he have said that to her? How could he have been so cavalier with their life, with the commitment they\u2019d made?</p><p>He wanted to tell her he was sorry, but time and distance separated them now. Whatever he had to say, it would have to wait until November. Would she even want to listen?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go shopping tomorrow and send her a care package,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Lulu said, clapping her hands.</p><p>Michael nodded, saying nothing, hoping they didn\u2019t see the tears in his eyes.</p><p>Strapped in place and weighed down by the thirty pounds of Kevlar plating in her vest, Jolene piloted the Black Hawk toward Baghdad. Sweat collected under her helmet, dampened her hair, ran down the back of her neck. Her skin was flushed; she had a little trouble breathing. Inside the gloves, her hands were slick and damp. Even with the helicopter\u2019s doors open, it was a damn oven in here. The water in her bottle was at least 122 degrees\u2014hardly refreshing. Tami was in the right seat.</p><p>They flew a combat spread formation, three helicopters strong, hurtling through the darkening sky. Below, the confusing sprawl of Baghdad fanned out on all sides. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBlue rain ... blue rain...\u201d came the other pilot\u2019s voice through the radio.</p><p>It meant that the zone into which they were flying was hot, inhospitable. It could be anything\u2014mortar fire, a missile, an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade), a gunfight of some kind.</p><p>Jolene said on comm, \u201cRaptor eight-nine veering east. ETA to Green Zone, four minutes.\u201d</p><p>She moved the cyclic; the helicopter responded instantly to her touch, dropping its nose, picking up speed, hurtling forward.</p> <p>Ra-ta-ta-tat. Bullets hit the helicopter in a spray. The sound was so loud that even wearing a helmet and earbuds, Jolene flinched.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking fire,\u201d Tami said sharply.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d Jolene said, banking a hard left turn.</p><p>She heard the tink-tink-tink of machine gun fire hitting her aircraft. One first, then a splatter of hits, close together, sounding like a hard rain on tin. Smoke filled the helicopter.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Tami said. \u201cThree o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>A group of insurgents was on a rooftop below, firing. A machine gun set on a tripod spit yellow fire.</p><p>Jolene banked left again. As she made the turn, the helicopter to her right exploded. Bits of burning metal hit the side of Jolene\u2019s aircraft. Heat billowed inside, and the aftermath rocked them from side to side.</p><p>\u201cKnife oh-four, do you copy?\u201d Tami said into the radio. \u201cThis is Raptor eight-nine.\u201d</p><p>The helicopter next to them spiraled to the ground. On impact, a cloud of black smoke billowed up. For a split second, Jolene couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>Tami radioed the crash coordinates into the base. \u201cKnife oh-four, do you copy?\u201d</p><p>Jolene made a series of fast turns, evading, varying her airspeed, changing her altitude. Up, down, side to side.</p> <p>When they were out of range, she turned to look in the back bay. \u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d she said to her crew, hearing back from all of them.</p><p>Jolene followed the other Black Hawk into Washington Heliport, landing behind it. She was shaking as she unhooked her MCU vest and seat belt.</p><p>She climbed out of the seat and stepped down onto the tarmac. The sky was gunmetal gray, but even in the gloom she could see the thick black smoke still rising up from the crash site. She closed her eyes and said a prayer for the fallen airmen, even though in her heart she knew that no one had survived that explosion. Seconds later, the roar of jet engines filled the night sky; bombs exploded in bursts of red fire. As soon as possible, she knew that a medevac helicopter would go to the site and try to locate survivors and victims.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help thinking that if you were alive and hurt in enemy territory with your bird on fire, it would be the longest wait of your life.</p><p>Could she have done something differently? Would a different choice on her part have changed the outcome? They flew in formation to protect one another, but Jolene hadn\u2019t protected her partner aircraft; soon, somewhere across the world, a casualty assistance team would gather to give a family the worst possible news.</p><p>Tami and Jamie came up to stand beside her. They stood in front of their helicopter, which was scarred with bullet holes.</p><p>No one spoke. Each of them knew that one bullet in the right place, one RPG hit, and they could have been the aircraft on fire in the desert.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s hungry?\u201d Jamie said, taking off his helmet.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always hungry,\u201d Smitty said, coming up beside them, coughing. He gave everyone his trademark grin, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. Tonight, for the first time, Smitty looked old. \u201cI sure could use me a Mountain Dew.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, as always, kept up a steady stream of conversation as they walked through the Green Zone. Everything he said was funny, and each of them wanted something to smile about. They ate made-to-order stir-fry and homemade milkshakes while the maintenance crew patched up their helicopter. All the while, they talked about anything except what was on their minds.</p><p>By midnight, they were back in the air, flying over Baghdad again. They skirted the most dangerous parts of the city. Now and then gunfire rang out\u2014coming from opportunistic insurgents who could hear the helicopter and shot skyward, hoping to hit what they couldn\u2019t see. They landed back at Balad without incident.</p><p>Jolene shut down the engine. The rotors slowed by degrees, the thwop-thwop-thwop more drawn out in every rotation.</p><p>Jolene finally relaxed in her seat. Through her night-vision goggles, the world looked distorted. Here on the black tarmac, she saw ghostly green images moving in front of her.</p><p>Absurdly, she thought of souls, walking away from their bodies; that reminded her of the crew they\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cMy son has chicken pox,\u201d Jamie said from behind her. \u201cDid I tell you that?\u201d</p><p>It was what she needed: a reminder of home. \u201cKids get over that fast. He won\u2019t even remember it in a year. Betsy wanted strawberry Popsicles for every meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he remember that I wasn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>Jolene had no easy answer for that.</p><p>She unhooked the goggles from her helmet and unstrapped from the seat. When she stepped onto the tarmac, a wave of exhaustion overtook her, and it was not an ordinary tiredness; this was bone deep, a kind of standing death.</p><p>She wanted to know she\u2019d done everything possible tonight, that she was not in any way at fault, but there was no one to tell her that, no one she could believe, anyway. The thought isolated her, reminded her of how alone she was over here. She wished she could call Michael, tell him about her day and let his voice soothe her ragged nerves. So many soldiers over here had that, a marital lifeline. Like Tami and Carl.</p><p>There was little privacy over here, and since Tami and Jolene routinely stood in the phone lines together, they heard each other\u2019s conversations. She heard Tami whispering, I love you so much, baby, just hearing your voice makes me strong again.</p><p>She remembered when she and Michael had been like that, each a half of the whole. Tami came up beside her, bumped her hip to hip. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s call home. I need to hear my husband\u2019s voice,\u201d Tami said.</p><p>They walked across the base to the phones. Amazingly, the line was short. There were only two soldiers in front of them.</p><p>Jolene let Tami go first, heard her friend say, \u201cCarl? Baby? I miss you so much...\u201d</p><p>Jolene tried not to listen. The truth was she needed Michael right now, needed him to say he loved her and that he was waiting for her, that she wasn\u2019t as alone over here as she felt, that she still had a life at home.</p><p>When it was finally Jolene\u2019s turn, she dialed home, hoping someone was there. Back there, it was two fifteen on a Saturday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Michael.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, imagining his smile. She wanted to tell him more, share her feelings, but how could she? He would never understand. He wasn\u2019t like Carl; he wasn\u2019t proud of what she did over here. He didn\u2019t understand how deeply she cared about the other soldiers with whom she served. At that, she felt even more separate, more distant.</p><p>A world away, she heard the creaking of his chair as he sat down, and that simple, ordinary sound reminded her acutely of the people she\u2019d left behind and how they\u2019d gone on with their lives, making memories that didn\u2019t include her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Jo?\u201d</p><p>She felt her mouth tremble. His tone of voice was so tender; she had to remind herself that he didn\u2019t really want to know. When had he ever wanted to hear about her service? She couldn\u2019t tell him that her friends had been killed tonight, that maybe it was even her fault, a little. He\u2019d just tell her it was a ridiculous war and the soldiers had died for nothing. She straightened, cleared her throat. \u201cHow are my girls? Is Lulu excited about her birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey miss you. Betsy heard about a helicopter pilot who\u2019d been shot down. She was pretty upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019m a long way from the front line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut are you?\u201d</p><p>She thought about tonight and winced. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m safe.\u201d That was what he wanted to hear. \u201cCan I talk to the girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom took them to a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be so disappointed. They miss you so much, Jo. Lulu keeps asking if you\u2019re going to be home for her party.\u201d</p><p>They miss you. \u201cI better go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I want to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was always about what he wanted. The thought exhausted her. She\u2019d been a fool to need him. \u201cI have to go, Michael. There\u2019s a line behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself,\u201d he said after a pause.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d Her voice cracked. She hung up the phone and turned back around.</p><p>Tami had heard every word. \u201cHow about a hot shower?\u201d her friend said, putting an arm around her.</p><p>Jolene nodded. They walked to their trailer, grabbed their dopp kits, and headed for the showers. Jolene kept meaning to say something to Tami, make some idle chitchat to gloss over the emotions that lay beneath, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Even at this late hour, the base was a busy place. Thirty thousand men and women lived here. That didn\u2019t even include the contract people who came and went.</p><p>Jolene wore her flip-flops into the shower and turned on the water.</p><p>Cold.</p><p>Trying not to think about the shower\u2014and the hot water\u2014she had at home, she washed quickly, scrubbing the sweat and sand from her skin. After she dried off, she redressed in her dusty, dirty ACUs.</p><p>\u201cCold wasn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind,\u201d Tami said, smiling tiredly.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>They walked out of the shower trailer and headed back to D-Pod.</p><p>Jamie and Smitty were waiting for them, sitting on a pair of overturned crates outside the door of their trailer, which was across from Tami and Jolene\u2019s. Beside Smitty was a small blue and white cooler full of pops. \u201cWanna drink?\u201d he said. Jolene could see how hard he was trying to smile. He might be a great gunner and a courageous soldier, but he was still just a twenty-year-old kid, and tonight had shaken him. He probably wouldn\u2019t sleep well; none of them would.</p><p>Tami and Jolene sat down beside them\u2014Tami on the steps in front of the door, Jolene on the crate beside Smitty. Behind them, the metal still radiated some of the day\u2019s heat, even though it was cold out here now. On either side of the door, sandbags were piled high\u2014rows and rows of them provided some protection from the near-constant mortar fire. Across from her, not more than eight feet away, was the door to their trailer.</p><p>\u201cBill Diehler was on Knife oh-four,\u201d Tami said solemnly.</p><p>Jolene pictured Bill: a big florid-faced \u201cold school\u201d Guard pilot out of Fort Worth. Just last week he\u2019d shown her a picture of the daughter who was waiting for him to walk her down the aisle.</p><p>She closed her eyes and immediately wished she hadn\u2019t; she saw the last few seconds again\u2014the roof sniper, the shooting. She\u2019d banked left, turned sharply away from Knife 04.</p><p>\u201cWally Toddan was the crew chief,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cHis wife just found out she\u2019s pregnant. Yesterday, he went to the Haji Mart and bought the kid a football. He hasn\u2019t even mailed it yet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jolene didn\u2019t want to think about that, a child who would never know his father.</p><p>\u201cThey were heroes,\u201d Jamie said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cHeroes,\u201d Jolene said, thinking about the word and all that it meant.</p><p>They clanked their pop cans together in a silent tribute to their fallen friends. After that, they fell silent. Finally, Tami stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. 0430 is going to come mighty fast. Jo?\u201d</p> <p>Jolene turned to Smitty and Jamie. \u201cYou guys okay?\u201d</p><p>Jamie grinned. \u201cRight as rain, Chief. I\u2019ll keep the kid out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Smitty grinned at that. \u201cHe\u2019s too old for trouble any way.\u201d</p><p>Jolene and Tami got up together, crossed the small walkway, and went into their dark, smelly trailer. Once there, Tami flicked the light on and then looked at Jolene. \u201cYou did everything you could have, you know. Nothing tonight was your fault.\u201d</p><p>Jolene had never loved her friend more. Afraid her voice would shake if she tried to speak, she nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you,\u201d Tami said, sitting down on her bed, looking up. \u201cHell, I\u2019m worried about both of us. I want to make it home.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sat down on her own bed. She saw the fear in Tami\u2019s dark eyes, and it did something to her, uncoiled something that had been tied down. \u201cMe, too,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Until tonight, Jolene would have stopped Tami right then, but now she remained silent, waiting.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t make it,\u201d Tami said softly, \u201cI am counting on you with Seth. You make sure he knows who I was.\u201d</p><p>Jolene nodded solemnly. \u201cAnd my girls will need you.\u201d</p> <p>Tami nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ll make it back,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cOf course we will.\u201d</p><p>They smiled at each other. Jolene didn\u2019t know how she looked, but she saw the fear in Tami\u2019s eyes. Neither one of them was as certain of that as they\u2019d been before.</p><p>AUGUST</p><p>How do I write about a colleague\u2019s death? How do I use words to expel the fear and confusion that\u2019s uncoiling slowly inside of me? I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to write about it. I don\u2019t want to remember the smell of smoke or the terrible sound of ripping metal or the rattle of gunfire. I don\u2019t want to think about Wally Toddan and his young widow or the baby who will never know his daddy\u2019s smile. Or the bride who will walk down a church aisle without her father.</p><p>RIP Knife 04, that\u2019s what I can say. All I can say. You were heroes and you will be missed.</p><p>Thirteen</p> <p>After a long, excruciatingly hot day of flying\u2014mostly moving people and Iraqi troops in and around Baghdad, Jolene was exhausted. While they\u2019d been gone, Balad had been attacked again, and this time there had been some serious damage. It was amazing what shrapnel did to wood and metal\u2014Humvees and buildings had been destroyed.</p><p>She walked away from the helicopter, with Tami on one side of her and Jamie on the other. No one said anything.</p><p>\u201cI need to go to the comm center,\u201d Tami said. \u201cSee if they\u2019ve gotten the Internet connection back up yet. If I don\u2019t hear from my family, I\u2019m going to lose it.\u201d</p><p>The three turned slightly, walked down the dark, dusty way between trailers.</p><p>It was past midnight, and even this late, the base was busy. At the communication\u2019s trailer, Tami said, \u201cWait here,\u201d and went inside. She was out a moment later, looking disgusted. \u201cInternet is still down. Damn it.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. They headed across the base; Jamie peeled off from them and went to the DFAC, while Tami and Jolene went into their trailer.</p><p>Too tired for conversation, each flopped onto her bed and opened her laptop. They were going to write letters tonight, which\u2014hopefully\u2014they\u2019d be able to send tomorrow.</p><p>My loves, Jolene typed.</p><p>Thank you for the care package. I can\u2019t tell you what it means to me to get mail. I can tell that Betsy picked out the shampoo\u2014love that strawberry scent\u2014and Lulu chose the sparkly barrette. It looks so pretty in my hair.</p><p>We\u2019ve been flying a lot lately. Usually I leave my trailer at 4:30 in the morning, ride my bike to the DFAC (meal trailer), and then go to the helicopter. We\u2019re lucky if we get back to base before nine p.m. We are pooped by then. But I\u2019m thinking of you all the time. Especially when my watch alarm goes off, Betsy. I hope you\u2019re thinking of me then, too.</p><p>Yesterday I tried to call home, but the phones weren\u2019t working, so I guess it\u2019s e-mail to the rescue! I bought you presents at the Haji Mart\u2014it\u2019s a kind of street fair set up inside the base. It\u2019s crazy, I can tell you. I bet you\u2019re not surprised that Tami and I have found a little time to shop. Girls will be girls, I guess.</p><p>Tomorrow we\u2019re having a party out by the burn barrel. I hear there\u2019s going to be hot dogs and baked beans, just like a beach party at home!</p><p>I know I\u2019m super far away, but I\u2019ll pretend that I\u2019m with you for Lulu\u2019s birthday party. I hope the present gets there in time! Think of Mommy when you blow out your candles, baby girl. I love you.</p><p>Well, I\u2019m sort of starting to fall asleep on my feet, so I guess I better go to bed. 4:30 will come mighty early.</p><p>Betsy, don\u2019t forget to remind Daddy about your orthodontist appointment. You need to go in next week. Lulu, can you send me a picture from your party? I have the last one up on my wall.</p><p>Her fingers lifted from the computer keys. She wanted to say something to Michael, but what? He hadn\u2019t written her once while she\u2019d been here. Reaching out to him made her feel like her mother, grasping to bring closer a man who didn\u2019t love her.</p><p>I think of you every day and I love you. To the moon and back.</p><p>Remember: Only ninety-one days till I get to see you again. Disneyland???? xxxooo</p><p>Mom</p><p>Jolene had never even imagined heat like summer in Iraq. Dust was everywhere\u2014in her hair, her eyes, her nose. Her sweat was gritty, and as soon as she showered, she started to sweat again.</p><p>From her first day in-country, she\u2019d known that every breath could be her last, and her nights were no better. She dreamed of fires and mortar and babies who forgot their mothers\u2019 faces. She\u2019d made an uneasy peace with death.</p><p>Injuries terrified her even more: the RPGs and IEDs ripped bodies apart, flung arms and legs into the sky and the dirt.</p><p>Never was her fear closer than on a day like today.</p><p>She was on a \u201chero mission,\u201d which meant that she had flown across the desert to pick up the remains of soldiers who had died.</p><p>She had been doing far too many of these lately; each time she watched the ceremony, she imagined herself or her crew lying in one of these makeshift surgical hospitals, irreparably broken, waxy faced, crying.</p><p>Now she stood back from the hospital tent\u2019s opening, among the crews that had been sent on the mission. All of them stood tall and straight, even in the pounding, pulverizing heat. Jolene and Tami, as pilots, could have stayed with their aircraft, but it never seemed right to them. So they were here, standing with their crew, to show respect.</p><p>The outlying-combat surgical hospital baked under the noonday heat.</p><p>The hospital was a row of dirty white canvas tents, connected by a network of wooden sidewalks. Inside, the floors were cement, stained with dark smears of blood. Jolene didn\u2019t go inside; she was here to wait. The hero-mission procedure was very precise.</p><p>Besides, she knew what it looked like in there: cot after cot filled with the damaged and the dying. Gruesome, devastating injuries were survivable in this modern age. The field docs were nothing short of miracle workers.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just soldiers, either. Inside lay rows of Iraqi civilians, children and women, who\u2019d been too close to an exploding IED or been hit by mortar fire. The smell was terrible, made worse by the unrelenting heat.</p><p>A doctor ducked through the tent\u2019s canvas opening and held it open behind him. Six soldiers followed him out, pushing four gurneys. On each lay the black-bagged remains of a soldier.</p><p>Jolene and Tami immediately stood at attention and saluted. The look that passed between them was as solemn as the mood: each was thinking of how it would feel if the other were in that bag. Somewhere close by a mortar round hit, exploded through concrete. No one even flinched.</p><p>The doctor looked as weary as Jolene felt. He placed a hand on each one of the bagged bodies in turn and said simply, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s throat tightened. She looked down at the gurneys, knowing that the lost soldiers deserved this last measure of respect from all of them. One of the bags was small, too small, a bad thing. It meant that pieces were missing. The result of an IED or RPG probably. Beside each body was a small clear bag containing personal effects. Even though the bag was marked with bloody fingerprints, she could see the watch and dog tags and wedding ring inside.</p><p>It made her think of Betsy, holding up Jolene\u2019s dog tags, asking if they would identify her ...</p><p>The silence stretched a second more, and then someone said \u201cCaptain Craig\u201d inside the tent, and the doctor went back inside.</p><p>Led by the gurneys and their silent watchmen, the two Black Hawk crews walked across the base to the waiting helicopters. Here again, the exact manner of transport was prescribed.</p><p>At Jolene and Tami\u2019s helicopter, Jamie and Smitty saluted the bodies again; then they loaded the fallen soldiers onto the helicopter, using exquisite care, placing them just so.</p><p>As the loading went on, soldiers came from all over, some in uniform, some in civilian clothes, and formed two straight lines out from the helicopter\u2019s open side door, saluting their fallen friends one final time.</p><p>She wondered who these fallen soldiers were. Husbands? Fathers? Mothers? Did their families know yet that their worlds had changed?</p><p>Jolene and Tami nodded to each other and climbed into the aircraft. Tami was left seat today. She leaned forward, placed the white hero-mission card in the windshield.</p><p>Jolene strapped herself into the right seat and began the preflight checklist. The helicopter doors were closed. Within moments, they were taking off amid a swirl of beige sand.</p><p>Below, the soldiers began to disperse.</p><p>On the flight to the Baghdad airport the crew was quiet, as they always were on hero missions. The deaths weighed heavily on their minds. The war had begun to heat up in the past few months. It had begun to be normal to be shot at, to be hit. Jolene heard the ping! of machine gun fire hitting a helicopter in her sleep and often woke up screaming. Last week, a bullet had gone through the window beside her head, shattering it, and bounced off her helmet. She\u2019d felt the slightest thwack to her head and kept flying. Only later did she begin to have nightmares about it, to imagine her head exploding, her body coming back to her children in a black bag that was twelve inches too short.</p><p>By the time they made it back to Balad, Jolene was beyond exhausted. She hadn\u2019t slept well in weeks, and it was beginning to take a toll on her. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time there hadn\u2019t been a middle-of-the-night mortar attack. She slept through the shelling but woke to the sound of the blaring alarm.</p><p>After the end of the mission, the maintenance crew swarmed to check out the helicopter. Jolene and her team walked away. On this dark night, there was no camaraderie, no \u201clet\u2019s go to the DFAC for pie.\u201d Each of them, like Jolene, was thinking how thin a piece of luck separated them from the bodies they\u2019d transported today. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou okay, Tami?\u201d Jolene said as they reached their trailer.</p><p>Tami stopped. \u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the trailer. Tami flipped a light switch; on came the fluorescent bulb on the ceiling. Instantly, the dark little space was illuminated. There were family photographs everywhere\u2014and a movie poster of Johnny Depp from Pirates of the Caribbean on the wall.</p><p>Tami sat down on her bed. It sagged in the middle; dust puffed up from the army-green bedding. The alarm sounded.</p> <p>Jolene heard footsteps running past her trailer. She sat down opposite Tami.</p><p>Somewhere, something exploded; the lights in the trailer flickered and remained on.</p><p>When the alarm stopped and the world stilled, Tami went on as if nothing had happened: \u201cCarl says Seth is having a hard time. Kids are making fun of him because of us. It makes me want to kick some preteen ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael just says the girls are fine.\u201d</p><p>Tami looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re telling him the truth, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hardly talking. He hasn\u2019t sent me a single e-mail.\u201d Jolene bent over, began unlacing her boots.</p><p>\u201cYou are getting a care package once a week. Who\u2019s buying all that stuff and mailing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guess? Mila. And the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you written him?\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. \u201cYou know I haven\u2019t. What would I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s thinking the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who said I wanted a separation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to play chicken with your marriage from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t start it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? Look at what we did today.\u201d She snapped her fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s how fast it happens, Jo. Dead. Alive.\u201d She snapped again. \u201cDead. This is the time to say what needs to be said, not to play games. Your parents were losers who scarred you. I get it, I really do. But you have to find the cojones to talk to your husband or you guys are going to lose everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say, Tam. Your husband loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, Jolene. None of this is easy, you know that. Michael loves you,\u201d Tami said. \u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p> <p>There it was, the question she\u2019d spent months avoiding. Leave it to Tami to throw it out like the first pitch in a baseball game. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop loving him,\u201d she answered quietly, surprising herself. \u201cIt\u2019s in my blood. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what? Isn\u2019t that your answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jolene sighed. Really, she didn\u2019t want to think about this, or talk about it. \u201cLove is only part of it. Like forgiving is only part. Even if I could forgive him, how would I forget? He stopped loving me, Tam. Just stopped. He looked me in the eyes and said he didn\u2019t love me anymore. How can I trust him again? How can I believe in our marriage, in forever together, if our love has some expiration date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t give up. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Write him a letter. Start.\u201d</p><p>Jolene knew it was good advice. She believed in fighting for love; at least she once had. Lately, she had trouble remembering what she believed and who she used to be. \u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said after a long silence.</p><p>Tami nodded. \u201cHe broke your heart.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked at her friend, sitting across from her in their dingy, smelly trailer, and she thought how lucky they were to have each other over here. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here with me, Tam. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d</p><p>Tami smiled. \u201cI love you, too, Jo.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an emergency situation that\u2019s going bad fast,\u201d the captain said. \u201cWe need to run search and rescue in a very tight spot. Reports give us a narrow weather window. We need two helicopters in the air in fifteen minutes or less.\u201d He turned to point at a map. \u201cHere. We\u2019ve got two army rangers trapped by enemy fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can be up in ten,\u201d Jolene assured him. She looked at Tami, who nodded sharply, and led the way to the tarmac. There was no conversation along the way.</p><p>As they walked across the base, a sharp wind blew up dust that bit into skin and eyes; it raked the flag overhead, whipped it into a frenzy. After a quick check of her craft, Jolene climbed into the left side of the cockpit and took her seat.</p><p>She was the first one inside, but within seconds, the crew was all in place. Jolene ran the preflight check, cleared departure with the tower, and started the engine.</p><p>The aircraft climbed slowly into the air as she worked the controls\u2014her hands and feet in constant motion. With each mile flown, the dust storm intensified. Wind smacked their windshield.</p><p>\u201cDeteriorating viz,\u201d Jolene said. She reached over, flipped a toggle switch, and glanced at her instrument readings. Wind gusted against them, pushed the Black Hawk sideways. A pothole of air sucked at the rotors; the helicopter dropped two hundred feet in a plunging, heart-stopping second. \u201cHold on, guys,\u201d Jolene said into her mouthpiece. She clung to the bucking, jerking controls and steadied the Hawk.</p><p>At the search vector, it took all of Jolene\u2019s upper-body strength to descend evenly in the maelstrom. Below them, the land was craggy, broken.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to land,\u201d Jamie called out.</p><p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d Jolene said. She worked the two foot pedals, finding the delicate balance between the tail and main rotors.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Smitty said. \u201cAt one o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Jo held the helicopter in a hover, but every second was a fight. Wind clawed at them, kept battering the aircraft. On the rugged desert floor below, she could just make out the two soldiers. They were obviously taking heavy fire. Bullets pinged off the aircraft.</p><p>Jamie shoved the door open and laid down a heavy cover of fire.</p><p>\u201cAll clear,\u201d he said after a few seconds. \u201cGood to land.\u201d</p><p>A blast of dust and wind gusted through, swinging the Hawk side to side.</p><p>\u201cLow and slow,\u201d Jolene said into her mic. She lowered the aircraft slowly to the ground. The other helicopter remained in the air, covering them.</p><p>Jolene watched her gauges closely as they rescued the two army rangers.</p><p>When the soldiers were safely loaded in the back bay, Jolene finally breathed a little easier. In seconds, they were back in the air, flying toward the base.</p><p>There, they heard about another helicopter that had gone down near Baghdad, killing the whole crew.</p><p>That night, she couldn\u2019t sleep. Everytime she closed her eyes, she saw helicopters hurtling to the ground, heard people screaming. She saw children, dressed in black, huddled around a flag-draped casket; a soldier in dress uniform walking to her front door ... Finally, she gave up trying. Turning on her small light, she reached for her journal.</p><p>AUGUST</p><p>I love flying. I\u2019ve always loved it, and I\u2019m proud to be here, doing my job, helping my country. But there\u2019s this fear in me lately, a terrible, frightening thing, like a bird flapping to get out of my chest. I have a bad feeling.</p><p>The things I\u2019ve seen stay with me. Even in sleep, I can\u2019t get rid of them\u2014arms and legs blown off, soldiers dying, pictures of children pinned to trailer walls, curling in the heat. Every time I take off, I wonder: will this be it? I imagine my family getting the worst news.</p><p>Tami keeps telling me I need to reach out to Michael. She tells me how much Carl is helping her cope with what we\u2019re facing. She says I am being stubborn and playing chicken with my marriage.</p><p>But how can I take her advice? How can I talk to Michael\u2014Michael, whom I loved from the moment he first kissed me\u2014Michael, who is my family. Or was, until he said he didn\u2019t love me anymore. I watched my mom do that, year after year, reach out for a man who\u2019d stopped loving her. It ruined her. I never thought I\u2019d be like her. Am I?</p><p>Am I losing myself out here or just falling out of love with him? Or is this just a part of war? I know that no one at home can matter too much. My friends over here are the people who have my six, the people who will save me and cover me.</p><p>It\u2019s not enough sometimes, though. Sometimes, I need ... Michael.</p><p>I need him. But I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t trust him to be there for me. Not anymore.</p><p>No wonder I feel so alone. And now my damn watch alarm is going off, reminding me ...</p><p>August passed in a blur of hot, lazy blue-skied days. Betsy and Lulu were busy almost all the time, going to day camps and spending time at the Green Thumb with Mila. Lulu\u2019s fifth birthday party had gone off without a hitch, although it had been a quieter version of earlier parties.</p><p>On this Thursday morning, the sun rose hot and bright into a cloudless blue sky. It would be a glorious summer day. At nine thirty, Michael pushed away from his home computer and went upstairs. He knocked on the girls\u2019 bedroom doors, saying, \u201cWake up, sleepyheads, Yia Yia will be here in a half an hour to pick you up.\u201d</p><p>Then he went downstairs and put breakfast on the table. French toast with fresh blackberries. \u201cCome on, girls,\u201d he yelled again.</p><p>Sipping his coffee, he turned on the TV in the family room.</p><p>\u201c... in heavy fighting last night near Baghdad. The helicopter, a Black Hawk flown by female warrant officer Sandra Patterson, of Oklahoma City, was hit by an RPG and crashed within seconds, killing everyone on board...\u201d</p><p>Pictures of bright-eyed soldiers in uniform filled the screen, one after another ...</p><p>\u201cI thought women weren\u2019t allowed in combat,\u201d Betsy said quietly behind him.</p><p>Michael thought, God help me. It was bad enough that he\u2019d just heard the report, and now he had to comfort his daughter. How could he reassure her when the truth was obvious to both of them?</p><p>What would Jolene do? What would she want him to do?</p><p>He turned slowly, saw the tears in Betsy\u2019s eyes. She looked as fragile and shaky as he felt right now.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lying to us,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cAll those letters and pictures ... they\u2019re lies.\u201d</p><p>He reached out for Betsy, took her hand, and led her over to the sofa, where they sat down together. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want us to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, into her scared eyes, and knew that she would remember what he said next. Would he tell her a lie? He knew how to bend the truth, but for once he wanted more of himself. \u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d he said at last, pulling her onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Betsy coiled her arms around his neck as if she were a little girl again, buried her face in his neck. He felt her crying\u2014the shuddering of her slim shoulders, the dampness on his skin, and he said nothing more.</p><p>When she finally drew back, shaking, her pale face streaked with tears, he felt a surge of love as powerful as any he\u2019d ever known. \u201cI love you, Betsy, and we\u2019re all going to be okay. That\u2019s what we have to believe. She\u2019ll come home to us.\u201d</p><p>Betsy nodded slowly, biting her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lulu said, coming into the room. \u201cI want a hug.\u201d</p><p>Michael opened his other arm and Lulu scampered up beside her sister. \u201cI think I should take my girls to the beach today,\u201d he said after a moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lulu drew back, her eyes big. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a workday,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked enough,\u201d Michael said. The unfamiliar words loosened something in him, made him feel buoyant. He reached for the phone on the end table and called his mom. \u201cHey, Ma, I\u2019m going to stay home with the girls today. We\u2019re going to hang out at the beach. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>His mother laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bunch of stuff to do at the store. I\u2019ll meet you there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Michael said, hanging up. Then, to his stunned daughters, he said, \u201cWhy are you sitting there? I thought we were going to the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Lulu yelped, bouncing off his lap and running upstairs.</p><p>In the garage, Michael found that Jolene had everything organized neatly\u2014folding beach chairs, marshmallow-roasting sticks, lighter fluid, coolers. He had an entire cooler packed by the time Betsy and Lulu came back downstairs, wearing their bathing suits and carrying beach towels. \u201cI got Lulu ready,\u201d Betsy said proudly.</p><p>After breakfast, Michael grabbed the cooler, directed the girls to get the buckets and shovels, and down they walked, toward the beach. At the street\u2014quiet this morning\u2014they crossed holding hands and went to their small dock.</p><p>They spent the whole day on the beach, making sand castles, looking for shells, wading in the cold blue waves. Sometime around noon, he built a fire in the round, metal, portable pit on their small deck, and in no time at all they were roasting hot dogs over an open flame.</p> <p>At about one o\u2019clock, his mom showed up and joined in the fun. For the first time in months, Betsy dropped her preteen attitude and became a kid again, and come evening, when the sky turned lavender and a ghostly moon came out to see who played on the beach below, they sat in chairs pulled close together, with blankets wrapped around them.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Lulu said, tucked in the lee of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m scared about starting school. When is next week? Can Mommy come home?\u201d</p><p>An emotion moved through him, tightened his chest. \u201cI know your mommy would love to walk you into school, but she can\u2019t. I\u2019ll be there, though. Will that be good enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you hold my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come I have to go all day? Mommy said I would be done by lunchtime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s different now, baby. You need to be in the all-day program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuz she\u2019s gone?\u201d Lulu asked sleepily, fingering the small metal wings pinned to her bathing suit.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I get scareded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always scary on the first day,\u201d Betsy said quietly. \u201cBut everyone will like you, Lulu. And you have a great teacher\u2014Ms. MacDonald. I loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lulu said, sounding unconvinced.</p><p>Michael smiled. \u201cLet me tell you what it\u2019s like...\u201d</p><p>As he talked to his youngest daughter about kindergarten and teachers and cubbies and recess, it was as if he were another man from another life. For years, he\u2019d strived to make a difference in the world, and he\u2019d worked like a dog to make that happen, and yet here he was, a man sitting on a dock with his children, and never had he felt more certain that his words mattered.</p> <p>That was what Jolene had been trying to tell him every time he missed an event. It matters, she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Daddy,\u201d Lulu said at last. \u201cI guess I can do that \u2019cause I\u2019m a big girl now. If you hold my hand. And I\u2019m taking my pink ribbon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Lulu,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p><p>Much later, when the girls had fallen asleep in their chairs, while the waves lapped along the pebbled shore and the stars shone down on them, his mother looked at him. \u201cJolene would be proud of you today,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Michael looked at her, over Lulu\u2019s dark head. \u201cI let her down,\u201d he said.</p><p>His mother nodded, smiling sadly, as if she\u2019d known this all along.</p><p>September was a bloody month in the war. It seemed that every day a helicopter came back to base shot up. Hero missions and suicide bombers were commonplace now. Jolene had begun to avoid the Haji Mart altogether; she couldn\u2019t stand thinking that the cute boy selling videos might someday have a bomb strapped to his chest. It had begun to rain in the past few days; the base had become a huge mud hole. The trailer\u2019s cement floor looked like dirt. There was no way to get the viscous red mud off your boots.</p><p>Tonight, the sky was clear and black, spangled with stars. It occurred to her that only a few months ago a sky like this had made her think of her family at home, sleeping peacefully beneath the same stars. These days, she didn\u2019t dwell on what was happening at home. She was too busy and exhausted to think about that. She was in the air constantly now, flying units into location, transporting workers to job sites, and flying Iraqi troops and civilian and military VIPs. More and more often, she flew air-assault missions, carrying troops to their mission-landing zones.</p><p>She walked beside Tami toward the trailer that housed the Charlie Company flight-planning room. They didn\u2019t bother to talk; they were both too tired to make the effort. It was 2200, and they\u2019d already flown two missions today. Yesterday had been even busier.</p><p>Jolene stepped up the muddy wooden steps and entered the trailer. The walls were covered with pieces of paper\u2014schedules, reports, flyers, calendars. Every aircraft\u2019s route was tracked from here. Computer screens sat on every desk. Here was where they stored all their machine guns and ammo and flight gear.</p><p>As she stepped into the trailer, the electricity snapped off and everything went dark. She heard someone say, \u201cShit. Again?\u201d</p><p>Jolene knew the generator would kick in soon, but she was supposed to be at the helicopter in five minutes. \u201cZarkades, sir,\u201d she said into the darkness. \u201cYou have a mission plan for Raptor eight-nine?\u201d</p><p>There was a rustle of paper, then the creaking of footsteps on the plywood floor. \u201cAir assault, Chief. You and Raptor four-two are going to Al Anbar. We have a marine unit trapped in a ditch. They\u2019re taking heavy fire.\u201d</p><p>The generator started up; the lights came on.</p><p>Captain Will \u201cCowboy\u201d Rossen was standing in front of her, holding out her orders.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>The captain nodded. \u201cBe safe.\u201d</p><p>Jolene and Tami went to the small room attached to the op center and retrieved their things. Jolene put on her heavy vest with the Kevlar plating and grabbed her flight bag. As they walked down the muddy streets, it started to rain. She looked up, saw a layer of pale gray clouds cover the stars.</p><p>\u201cShit. Viz is deteriorating,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>They increased their pace, boots sloshing through the mud. Jolene felt Jamie come up beside her, but neither of them said anything as they headed to their aircraft. Then Smitty showed up, strapping his helmet on as he walked.</p><p>\u201cYour turn in the left seat?\u201d Tami said when the bird was checked out and ready to go.</p><p>Jolene nodded and climbed into the left seat and strapped herself in. She clicked the night-vision goggles onto her helmet and pulled them into place.</p><p>In less than five minutes they were taking off, rising to just below the cloud cover.</p><p>It was a two-helicopter mission. They flew together, always in contact, across the black expanse of desert, over Baghdad to Al Anbar province, just past Fallujah.</p><p>As they came into Fallujah\u2019s airspace from the north, the first round of machine gun fire sounded. The tap-tap-tap on the fuselage was small-arms fire.</p><p>\u201cRaptor eight-nine, taking fire, seven o\u2019clock, two hundred meters,\u201d Jolene said into the comm. The other helicopter responded instantly.</p><p>\u201cRaptor four-two taking fire, nine o\u2019clock, banking right.\u201d</p><p>They flew over a small village. A machine gun was set up on a rooftop, shooting at them.</p><p>Jolene scanned the area below; her night-vision goggles revealed dozens of greenish-white dots moving through the darkness. The soldiers trapped in the ditch or insurgents looking for them? She reached forward to flip a toggle switch, and everything exploded.</p><p>An RPG hit the fuselage so hard she was thrown sideways; her right foot arced up and kicked the instrument panel.</p><p>The cockpit filled with smoke. Flames filled the back of the aircraft; she could feel the heat. Jolene called out for her crew, got no response. She clutched the cyclic and tried to keep them in the air, but they were falling\u2014plunging\u2014downward at one hundred and fifty miles an hour.</p><p>The power on engine number two went crazy; the instrument panel went dark. Nothing. Not even engine temperature.</p><p>She called out to her crew again, told them to brace for impact, and then she tried to Mayday her position, but the smoke was so intense she couldn\u2019t breathe. All she got out was \u201cMayday\u2014\u201d before they crashed.</p><p>After a long day spent taking depositions of the police officers who interrogated Keith Keller, Michael came home, dead on his feet, and made dinner for his daughters\u2014one of Jolene\u2019s chicken and rice recipes that he found in the overstuffed three-ring binder. Later, when the girls were asleep, he walked out to the empty family room, standing there alone, noticing how quiet the house was.</p><p>An unusual emotion rose up in him, so odd that it took him a moment to recognize it. Loneliness.</p><p>For so long, he\u2019d felt a kind of simmering anger at being Mr. Mom, felt emasculated by being responsible for his children and the cooking and shopping. He\u2019d blamed Jolene for leaving him adrift on a sea of responsibilities he didn\u2019t want and which he barely knew how to perform. But in the last few weeks, it had changed. He\u2019d changed. He\u2019d found a new side of himself; he loved reading to Lulu before bed, hearing her quirky questions about the stories, watching her small finger point at the pictures. He loved it when Betsy sat by him at night, watching TV and telling him stories from school. He loved how they\u2019d become a team at the grocery store, working together, how a game of Candyland could make them all laugh.</p><p>He missed Jolene. How was it he hadn\u2019t foreseen what his life would be like without her?</p><p>She was so far away, and every day she was getting shot at, dodging IEDs, changing in ways he couldn\u2019t imagine. And what had he given her to take with her? I don\u2019t love you anymore.</p><p>He walked over to the TV, turned it on. Her latest tape was in the machine, as always; the girls watched it endlessly.</p><p>He hit Play.</p><p>And there she was, Jolene in uniform, smiling at the camera, pointing out landmarks around Balad\u2014here\u2019s the place where we get that good pie ...</p><p>His wife.</p><p>The tape ended, and the last image of her froze on screen. She stood with Tami, both in uniform, their arms slung around each other. Jolene was smiling brightly, but he saw the truth in her eyes. She was scared and lonely, too.</p><p>He wanted to talk to her so much it was an ache in his chest.</p><p>There was no way to call her, though. All he could do was write her a letter.</p><p>The thing he\u2019d never done. He\u2019d started several in the past weeks, but he\u2019d deleted them all before sending. He was so ashamed of how he\u2019d acted before; how could he just drop her a letter now and pretend that everything was different? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He walked through the family room and into his office, where he sat down at the computer and booted it up.</p><p>Jolene, he typed, then stopped, deleted that, and began again.</p><p>My Jo\u2014</p><p>Do you remember when I first called you that? We were at the arboretum, in a rented rowboat, watching baby ducks float through the reeds. You said, \u201cI wonder how they find their mom,\u201d and that made me understand how hurt you\u2019d been by your childhood. It took you a long time to tell me what it had been like, and when you finally told me ... that\u2019s when I knew you loved me. I used to look in your eyes and see my own dreams. When was the last time we really looked at each other? I wonder. Anyway, back to the ducks. I said, \u201cThey just know. Like I know you\u2019re my Jo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to be yours,\u201d you said.</p><p>I loved you so much it hurt. I used to lie in bed and imagine losing you in terrible ways. Sick, huh? But I did it. I loved you so much it was as if I had to think about losing you or I would have lost myself instead. Did you love me like that?</p><p>I think you did.</p><p>So what happened? When did we stop being lovers and start being just the girls\u2019 parents, and then roommates? When did I start blaming you instead of myself? I think a lot of it started with my dad\u2019s death. I had never lost anyone before\u2014I didn\u2019t know how it felt to be ripped apart like that, and I didn\u2019t handle it well. I think I blamed you for everything that was wrong in my life.</p><p>Is it too late to go back?</p> <p>I hope not.</p><p>I thought I had it figured out, that we had run our course, but I see how wrong I was, and how I hurt you, and I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s what I know now. For so many things. I guess war doesn\u2019t only change the warriors. Those of us on the home front go through our own stuff.</p><p>I miss you.</p><p>He stared at the e-mail. It was so short. What good was I\u2019m sorry with what she was going through?</p><p>Could she forgive him? There was only one way to know.</p> <p>He hit Send.</p><p>Jolene woke up, coughing, her eyes watering, the taste of blood in her mouth. She called out for her crew again, got no answer. Tami was beside her, strapped in her seat, slumped forward, unconscious.</p><p>Jolene tried to unhook herself from the seat. On the third attempt, she saw the problem. Her right forearm was a bloody mess. She could barely lift her hand, and her fingers didn\u2019t work right. Using her left hand, she leaned forward over the scorched and blindingly hot instrument panel to do an emergency shutdown.</p><p>\u201cMayday,\u201d she said, finding it hard to talk, to concentrate. The radio wasn\u2019t working. She passed out again. When she awoke, she gave her coordinates over the radio, hoping it was working now. She needed the CSEL radio. Where was it? Think.</p><p>\u201cTami,\u201d Jolene said, trying to reach out for her best friend, but she couldn\u2019t move. She tried to unhook herself, but she couldn\u2019t; something was wrong with her. Her body wasn\u2019t responding. Something was wrong with her right foot.</p><p>Tap-tap-tap.</p><p>They were taking fire again. From a distance, she could hear the guttural sounds of men talking, their footsteps thundering forward.</p><p>I have to get out, establish a perimeter.</p> <p>Tap-tap-tap.</p><p>We\u2019re still taking fire.</p><p>She tried to unholster her weapon, but her right hand wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>Finally, she unhooked from her seat and crawled painfully through the cockpit. She grabbed Tami, unhooked her from the seat and pulled hard. Tami slid sideways, her eyes blank, her lips slack. Jolene fumbled with Tami\u2019s helmet, got it off, and saw the huge wound in her head, the blood gushing out of it.</p><p>\u201cStay with me, Tami...\u201d</p><p>She looked back into the bay. The right side of the fuselage was gone; bits of metal were melted and smoldering. The canvas straps and netting were on fire. Smitty, slumped sideways, had a black, gaping hole in his chest; it was bleeding and smoking. His eyes were flat, blank. Dead. Jamie lay crumpled in the corner. \u201cJamie! Jamie!\u201d</p><p>She had to get them all out of the helicopter.</p><p>When she moved, a wave of nausea rolled through her. The pain in her foot was staggering. Jolene threw up and tried again. She unholstered her weapon with her left hand and brought it up, shaking in her hand, and tried to see through the smoke. \u201cTami, I\u2019m going to get you out; then we need to establish a perimeter. We need the radio. Jamie, wake up. Jamie! Get Smitty out. Help me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted up on her good arm, tried to aim out the ruined fuselage. The tap-tap-tap grew louder, more insistent. She grabbed Tami, hefted her limp body on her back, and crawled slowly out of the cockpit, falling to the ground, hitting hard. Pain exploded into her thigh.</p><p>\u201cChief\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was Jamie. Or had she imagined his voice? \u201cJamie,\u201d she said, but her voice was barely a croak of sound. She lay there, breathing hard, Tami\u2019s body a deadweight on top of her. \u201cCome on, Tami, wake up, please...\u201d</p><p>She heard the alarm on her wristwatch bleat its lonely sound, but it wasn\u2019t real. She knew it wasn\u2019t real. She couldn\u2019t have heard it above all this noise\u2014the shooting, the screaming. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tam,\u201d she said, dragging her friend through the dirt. Her vision swam, blood pounded through her head.</p><p>Behind her, the helicopter exploded. She threw herself on top of Tami, covering her friend\u2019s body with her own. Something hit Jolene hard, knocked her sideways ... she lay in the dirt, stunned, staring up at the night sky, seeing burning bits of metal falling like fireworks through the blackness, raining down on her.</p><p>She heard the bleating of her watch alarm again ... or was it something else? A scream? A bomb whizzing past her? A shout? She thought, BetsyLuluMichael, and then she was falling, fading ... and there was nothing.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Michael stood at the kitchen window, staring at the coming night. It was mid-September and cool, with a whispering breeze that made the skirts of the giant cedar trees dance along the edges of the tall grass. The days of beach walking were coming to a close; autumn was drawing near, with its cold, frosty mornings and endless falling rain. He knew without looking that the plum trees had begun to lose their leaves.</p><p>In the lavender light, he stared at the white fence line that delineated their land. This is us, Jolene had said as she helped him hammer the slats in place so long ago. The Zarkades family. Everyone will see this fence and know we belong here.</p><p>Down on the bay road, a car came around the bend, its headlights bright spots against the sunset. He watched the car approach\u2014it was a boxy, official-looking vehicle. At the bend in the road, the car slowed ... at his driveway, it slowed more and turned in, then parked.</p><p>Michael\u2019s fingers curled around the smooth, cool white tile counter. Turn around, drive away ... you\u2019re in the wrong place ...</p><p>A soldier got out of the car, slammed the door shut, and turned to face the house.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>Michael closed his eyes, breathing so hard he felt light-headed.</p><p>The doorbell rang, sounding ugly and discordant.</p><p>He walked woodenly to the door, opened it. \u201cIs she dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Captain Lomand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jolene dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>Michael clutched the door frame, afraid for a moment that his knees were going to give out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for coming like this. I knew how it would look, coming up the walk, but I didn\u2019t want you to get a phone call from a stranger for ... this. May I come in?\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded numbly and stepped aside, thinking, But you are a stranger. The man walked into the house and went into the family room. He acted as if he\u2019d been here before, which probably he had, but Michael had no idea who he was.</p><p>The captain stopped by the sofa, remained standing, and removed his hat. When he looked at Michael, his eyes were compassionate. \u201cJolene\u2019s Black Hawk was shot down several hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Michael lowered himself slowly to the brick hearth. Behind him, a fire blazed. It was too close, and too hot, but he couldn\u2019t feel anything.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s being transported to Landstuhl, Germany, right now. It\u2019s the biggest American military hospital in Europe. She\u2019s in good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood hands,\u201d Michael repeated, trying to will his mind to work. \u201cBut how is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any details, sir,\u201d Lomand said.</p><p>\u201cWas Tami in the helicopter with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Captain Lomand said. \u201cBut I have no information about her condition at this time. Except that she\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do? How do I help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray, Michael. That\u2019s all we can do for her right now. As soon as we have information, a Red Cross worker will call you.\u201d</p><p>Michael stared down at his hands, saw that they were shaking. Funny things came to him, stupid things\u2014he heard his own heartbeat and the way breath escaped him, the sound of a beam settling somewhere in the house.</p><p>\u201cPeople will stop by later. To help,\u201d Lomand said.</p><p>Michael had no idea how strangers could help, but he didn\u2019t care so he said nothing. Words seemed dangerous suddenly; there was too much he didn\u2019t want to hear or think. He wanted this man gone. \u201cI need to see her.\u201d That was all he knew for sure.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Lomand stood there a moment longer, looking pained. \u201cShe\u2019s a fighter,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Michael couldn\u2019t listen anymore. \u201cThank you...\u201d He meant to say the man\u2019s name, but he\u2019d forgotten it. He got up and headed toward the door, opening it. He heard the captain behind him, heard his heavy footsteps on the wooden floor, but neither of them spoke.</p><p>At the door, the captain said, \u201cWe\u2019re all praying for her.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded. He didn\u2019t have the strength to speak, not even to say thank you. He stood there in the doorway, watching the captain walk down the driveway, his back ramrod straight, his hat fixed firmly on his head, his arms at his sides.</p><p>Time fell away from Michael. One minute he was standing there, watching a soldier walk to his car, and the next minute he was alone, standing in the cold of an open doorway, staring at a yard that was slowly growing dark.</p><p>In his career, he\u2019d heard dozens of victims and defendants say I don\u2019t remember what I did ... and I just snapped, my mind went blank.</p><p>He knew now how that felt, how a mind could simply shut down, stop working.</p><p>Slowly, he closed the door and returned to the warmth of his kitchen. All he could hear was his own heartbeat, his own breathing, and those words, over and over and over again.</p><p>Shot down.</p><p>She could be dying right now ... all alone ...</p><p>He closed his eyes, imagining it for a moment, the loss of her, the funeral, the words, the feelings. As much as it pained him, he couldn\u2019t stop. He wanted this pain; he\u2019d earned it, and how would he survive the worst if he wasn\u2019t ready?</p><p>The problem was, he didn\u2019t know the worst, couldn\u2019t identify it. There was telling the children, raising them without her, failing at it, stumbling; there was standing in front of their friends\u2014a widower who had let his wife go to war on a tide of bad words, broken promises; there was coming home without her and learning to sleep alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Missing her.</p><p>That would be the worst. How was it he hadn\u2019t thought of all of this when he\u2019d so foolishly said I don\u2019t love you anymore? Then, he\u2019d thought of the worst of who they\u2019d become. She\u2019d seemed to him to have grown so big and so small at the same time\u2014the lynchpin of his existence in an irritating way. He\u2019d resented her strength, her independence. He\u2019d wanted to be needed by her, even though he knew he was unreliable. He\u2019d blamed her for his unhappiness, when all along he had been the one to let go of what mattered.</p><p>And now maybe he would have to live without her. The idea was overwhelming. He could consider the symptoms\u2014the talks, the responsibilities, the public moments\u2014but the real truth of it, the imagining of a life going on with no heartbeat, was more than he could bear.</p><p>He stumbled over to the kitchen counter and picked up the cordless phone. It took him three tries to dial his mother\u2019s number\u2014his fingers were shaking so badly he kept hitting the wrong numbers. When his mother answered, sounding breathless and happy to hear from him, pain rushed in, tightened Michael\u2019s throat until he could hardly speak.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Michael. It\u2019s good to hear from you. I\u2019m just unpacking some boxes at the store. Are we still on for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene,\u201d he said, his eyes stinging.</p><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d his mother said slowly. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, rested his head on the kitchen wall (papered in sunny yellow, shouldn\u2019t a kitchen be sunny, Michael? It\u2019s the heart of a home). He couldn\u2019t see anything now. \u201cJo\u2019s been shot down. She\u2019s alive\u2014on her way to a hospital in Germany.\u201d</p><p>He heard his mother\u2019s indrawn breath. \u201cOh, my God. How\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I know, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, kardia mou, I am so sorry...\u201d</p><p>The endearment, spoken so softly, cracked his composure. He drew in a great, shuddering breath, and then he was crying as he\u2019d never cried before, not even at his father\u2019s death. He thought of Jolene, smiling, laughing, sweeping their daughters into her strong arms, twirling them around, and putting her arms around him, holding him close at night.</p><p>He cried until he felt empty inside, hollow, and then, slowly, he straightened, wiped his eyes. His mother was still talking, saying something ... her voice droned on, but he couldn\u2019t listen. There was nothing to comfort him now. \u201cGive me a little time, Ma. A couple of hours to tell the girls,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was still talking when he hung up.</p><p>He leaned over the kitchen sink, thinking for a second that he might vomit. He\u2019d done that before at bad news\u2014when they told him his father\u2019s cancer had metastasized. He swallowed thickly, trying to calm his heart rate by force of will. She could die. The silver drain blurred before his eyes, and fresh tears formed, burned, fell down his cheeks, splashing on the white porcelain.</p> <p>How long was he there, bent over, crying into the sink?</p><p>When he could breathe again, he dried his face and forced his spine to straighten. Moving slowly, he went through the house, up the stairs. Every riser he took was a triumph, like bicycling up the Rockies. By the time he reached Betsy\u2019s door, he was breathing hard, sweating.</p><p>He paused at the door, wishing more than anything that he didn\u2019t have to tell them this ... Then he went inside, remembering a second too late that he was supposed to knock, that adolescent girls demanded privacy.</p><p>They were on the bed together, watching the videotape of Jolene reading a bedtime story.</p><p>Michael wanted to stop right there, on the threshold to his daughter\u2019s room, and turn around. They wouldn\u2019t be the same after he gave them this news. They\u2019d know, from now on, that bad things could happen, and they could happen fast, while you weren\u2019t even paying attention. Helicopters could be shot down. Mothers could be hurt ... and worse.</p><p>He actually stumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna watch Mommy read to me, Daddy?\u201d Lulu asked.</p><p>Michael tried to move, but he just stood there, swaying slightly, holding the door frame for support. Then he lurched forward and snapped the TV off.</p> <p>Betsy frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>In the silence that followed the question, Betsy\u2019s face drained of color. \u201cIs it Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s home?\u201d Lulu said. \u201cYippeee! Where is she?\u201d</p><p>Hope, Michael thought. He had to put his own fears aside and give them hope.</p><p>But what if it turned out to be false hope? He had no idea how injured Jolene was, or even if she would survive.</p><p>Shot down.</p><p>He swallowed hard, wiped his eyes before tears formed.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Betsy said grimly. It broke his heart to see how afraid she was and how hard she was trying to be grown-up. He picked his way past the clothes heaped on the floor and climbed up onto the bed. Lulu leaped onto his chest without warning.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Daddy?\u201d Lulu asked, bouncing.</p><p>Michael sat up, stretched his legs out. \u201cCome here, Betsy,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She moved cautiously across the bed, eyeing him the whole time, her mouth trembling, although she was trying to stop it, he could see.</p><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s been in an accident,\u201d he said when he had both of his daughters in his arms. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way to a really good hospital right now. And...\u201d She\u2019ll be fixed up. He couldn\u2019t say it, couldn\u2019t make himself say the words.</p><p>Lulu pulled free, sat on his thighs, and looked at him. \u201cMommy got hurted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d Betsy asked softly.</p><p>Never in his life had Michael felt so painfully inadequate. \u201cWe have to believe she will be. We have to pray for her.\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked at him, her composure crumbling. The tears started falling; her whole body shook.</p><p>Lulu burst into tears.</p><p>Michael took them both in his arms, clinging to them, holding back his own tears.</p><p>They cried for what felt like hours. Finally, Lulu pulled back. Her black curly hair was damp and stuck to her pink cheeks. \u201cIf Mommy\u2019s hurted, will they give her ice cream? Remember how Mommy gave me ice cream when I fell down the stairs, Betsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrawberry,\u201d Betsy said and Lulu nodded.</p><p>\u201cWith sprinkles.\u201d</p><p>Betsy wiped her eyes, sniffed hard. \u201cRemember when she twisted her ankle at the beach last summer, Lulu? It got all swollen and purple and gross, and she said it didn\u2019t hurt at all. She only stopped running for, like, a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when that dog bited her at the grocery story, she was bleeding but it hardly hurted, remember? Cuz she\u2019s a soldier, that\u2019s what she said. She\u2019s army strong. Right, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>Michael could only nod. To them, these stories were a comforting way to bring Jolene home, where she belonged, but all he could think about were helicopters hurtling to the desert floor, crashing, exploding\u2014catastrophic injuries. He thought about the letters he hadn\u2019t sent to her during her deployment and the things he hadn\u2019t said and the things he had\u2014I don\u2019t love you anymore\u2014and he felt sick to his stomach.</p><p>He was grateful as hell when his mother showed up two hours later.</p><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s hurted, Yia Yia,\u201d Lulu said, starting to cry again.</p><p>His mother moved purposely forward. \u201cYour mother is a warrior, Lucy Louida, and don\u2019t you forget it. She needs our happy thoughts right now. How about if you guys get into your pajamas and I read to you a story?\u201d</p><p>Michael extricated himself from his daughters and got up. He was shaky on his feet as he moved toward his mother.</p><p>\u201cOh, Michael,\u201d she said softly as he approached, her voice wavering, her eyes filling with tears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, sidestepping her outstretched hand. He couldn\u2019t be comforted right now, not in front of his children. At his mother\u2019s touch, he might just crumble. He moved past her and kept walking out into the hallway.</p><p>He closed the door on them and went downstairs. For some time\u2014he had no idea how long\u2014he wandered around the house, just staring at things. The wedding picture in the bookcase, the end table they\u2019d refinished together, the You Are Special plate that hung on the kitchen wall.</p><p>The phone rang, and he lurched for it. \u201cMichael Zarkades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Zarkades. This is Maxine Soll, from the Red Cross.\u201d</p><p>He gripped the phone more tightly, thinking, Please God, let her be okay. \u201cHow is my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer helicopter was shot down in Al Anbar province last night. Because of heavy fighting, rescue was difficult. I don\u2019t have much in the way of details, and I can\u2019t give you information on the rest of her crew. But I do know she\u2019s alive and stable. She has been treated at Balad and is now on her way to Landstuhl, Germany.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s relief was so great he actually sank to his knees on the kitchen floor. \u201cThank God,\u201d he murmured. He heard the Red Cross worker talking about the hospital, but he was barely listening.</p><p>He hung up the phone and went outside, where a cold black night surrounded him. Jo, you\u2019ll be coming home now ... you\u2019ll be okay ...</p><p>He was so caught in his own thoughts that it took him a moment to see the man standing on the dock across the street. Although he couldn\u2019t really make out the figure\u2014could just see a silhouette in the glow from a distant streetlamp, he knew who it was.</p><p>He closed the door behind him and walked down the gravel driveway, hearing his footsteps crunch on the small gray stones. The night smelled of low tide, vaguely sulfuric.</p><p>\u201cCarl?\u201d he said, drawing near. \u201cLomand came to see you, too?\u201d</p><p>Carl nodded. \u201cI needed to get out of the house. Seth is ... I don\u2019t know what the hell to say. Tami\u2019s mom is with him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My mom is with the girls, too. How is Tami?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn military and Red Cross haven\u2019t told me shit. She\u2019s alive. In critical condition. That\u2019s what I know. Jo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive and stable. That\u2019s all I know. Nothing about the rest of the crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found a letter from Tami today. She\u2019d e-mailed it before the mission, I guess. She sounded so...\u201d Carl\u2019s tired voice trailed off for a moment. Then, quietly, he said, \u201cAfterward, I read it again and thought, are these her last words?\u201d</p><p>Michael had no idea what to say to that, so he said nothing. But he couldn\u2019t stand the silence, either. \u201cYou catching a flight tomorrow?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Michael stared out at the black water, listening to it lap at the shore. The longer he stood there, the more ill at ease he felt. Finally, he and Carl had something in common, but it didn\u2019t exactly bring them together. \u201cWell, I better get back to the girls. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Carl paused, turned. \u201cThanks for coming down here, Michael.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded and headed back up to the house, but once inside he almost wished he\u2019d stayed with Carl. Everywhere he looked, he saw Jo.</p><p>I found a letter ...</p><p>He went into his office and turned on the computer, then pulled up his e-mail.</p><p>And there it was in the in-box: Jolene\u2019s military e-mail address in bold, black type. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When had she written it? Yesterday, just before her flight?</p><p>He clicked on it.</p><p>My loves.</p><p>Thanks so much for the care packages you sent this week. I was the Queen of Dpod, I can tell you! Everyone wanted some of my tasty treats and the baklava was awesome. I took one bite and thought of all of you. Ask your Yia Yia to tell you the story of when she taught me to make it. I was not her best student, that\u2019s for sure. Not as good as Betsy.</p> <p>You know what else makes me think of home? The weather over here. It\u2019s September and that means rain, even in the desert. The base is one big mud hole. You\u2019d love it, Lulu. Splash! Splash!</p><p>Things are pretty much routine over here these days. I\u2019ve been flying a lot. Recently we flew to a place called the Green Zone and had made-to-order milkshakes. Yum!</p><p>The Black Hawk is getting to be my home away from home. It has so much equipment, the whole world is at my fingertips. Whenever I look at the GPS, I think of you guys and home and I count the days till I\u2019m back.</p><p>Until then, I know how much you both miss me, and I want you to know I miss you just as much. You are the first thing I think of every morning and the last thing I think of at night.</p><p>Lulu, I can\u2019t wait to hear every little thing about your first day of school. I know you still feel a little scared, but try to remember that everyone feels the same way. Have you made any new friends? How is your teacher? Tell me everything!</p> <p>Betsy, I know how lonely you sometimes feel these days. Middle school isn\u2019t easy for anyone, especially not for a girl who is worried about her mom and having troubles with her friends. Life is messy\u2014especially now\u2014it will help if you accept the mess and let it be. Don\u2019t be afraid to talk to Sierra about what scares you. Or Seth. Or your dad. You never know who will say just the thing you need to hear. And remember, a girlfriend can get you through the worst of times. I know because Tami is helping me every day over here.</p><p>One thing I see from here, from a distance, is how lucky we all are to have each other.</p><p>I love you both to the moon and back.</p><p>Mom</p><p>He sat back. I love you ... both.</p><p>He deserved that, of course, but still it hurt. He\u2019d thought his letter might have made a difference, but why would it? One letter\u2014coming so late\u2014could hardly undo the harm he\u2019d done.</p> <p>\u201cMichael?\u201d his mother said behind him, coming into the office.</p><p>Slowly, he turned. His chair squeaked. \u201cThere\u2019s a letter from Jo. The girls will want to read it in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He followed her out of the office and into the family room, where she sat down in the overstuffed chair by the window. He sank onto the sofa\u2019s deep cushions. Between them was an antique coffee table\u2014Jolene\u2019s first \u201cfaux finishing\u201d project\u2014pale blue and covered with the detritus of family life. A pencil, two photographs in drugstore frames, a poorly fired thumb pot from one of the girls, an unread magazine. If Jolene had been here, it would have been cleaner.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be strong for your girls,\u201d his mother said. \u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore she left,\u201d he said, knowing even as he formed the thought that he shouldn\u2019t speak it aloud\u2014it would make her ashamed of him\u2014but he couldn\u2019t help himself, \u201cbefore she left I told her I didn\u2019t want to be married to her anymore.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s face seemed to fall at that. \u201cThis is what she took away with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Michael.\u201d She sighed heavily. \u201cI wondered. Her letters...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre to the girls. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are an idiot, of course. But we\u2019ve all been idiots when it comes to love. It\u2019s not as if your father and I never had our problems. He once moved out\u2014for six months. You were young. I made excuses. I waited. It is a long story that doesn\u2019t matter anymore, except for this: he came back, and I took him in. We found a way to be happy again. So will you.\u201d She got up from her place and stepped around the coffee table. Sitting down on the sofa, she put an arm around him and pulled him against her, soothing his tattered nerves in the way that only a mother could. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the girls. You go to her, Michael.\u201d</p><p>They sat there a long time. When his mother finally fell asleep, Michael got up. He covered his mother\u2019s sleeping body with one of her own hand-knit blankets and wandered through the dark house. He checked on his daughters repeatedly, standing in the doorway and watching them sleep, hating the new life to which they would awaken. Unable to sleep, he started drinking coffee at 5:00 A.M., mostly because, although he couldn\u2019t sleep, he was so tired he kept stumbling, hitting things, knocking them over. Sometimes an image of Jolene, smiling, flashed through his mind, and it caused a kind of temporary blindness. That was when he\u2019d stumble into a chair or knock over a family photo.</p><p>He was awakened by the doorbell. At the sound, he jerked upright\u2014realizing he\u2019d fallen asleep in a wooden kitchen chair. He got unsteadily to his feet and went to the door, opening it.</p><p>Three men stood there. They introduced themselves as Jolene\u2019s fellow guardsmen and offered to do whatever they could to help out. Out on the road, he saw a car turn into Carl and Tami\u2019s driveway. No doubt there were three more soldiers in that car, ready to render aid.</p><p>Michael tried to get rid of them\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014and ended up showing them to the family room, where they stood together along the wall. They said they were prepared to do anything\u2014drive carpool, grocery shop, mow the lawn.</p><p>\u201cMa?\u201d he said, bending down to waken her.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Bleary-eyed, she sat up.</p><p>\u201cThere are some of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish, the doorbell rang again.</p><p>This time it was four wives, standing on his porch, each holding a foil-covered casserole dish and a bag full of groceries. They gave him sad, knowing smiles and hugged him\u2014all without tears\u2014and then started organizing the food they\u2019d brought. In no time the house smelled like frying bacon. They were making breakfast for the girls.</p><p>By nine o\u2019clock, the girls had walked into this quiet, crowded house of theirs. Lulu had taken one look at the commotion and crawled up into her grandmother\u2019s lap. Betsy had put in her iPod earbuds; she sat in the corner, listening to music and playing some electronic game.</p><p>Michael was about to go say something to her when the doorbell rang again.</p><p>Exhausted by the thought of more help, he went to the door and opened it.</p><p>In his rumpled state, it took him a moment to process what he was seeing. A familiar-looking woman with a pert little haircut, wearing too much makeup, stood on his porch. She was holding a microphone. \u201cI\u2019m Dianna Vigan from KOMO TV. Are you Michael Zarkades?\u201d</p><p>He nodded dully, noticing that people had begun to place bouquets along the fence line. Someone had tied a yellow ribbon around the stanchion beneath their mailbox.</p><p>\u201cYour wife flew into battle with her best friend as her copilot, Warrant Officer Tamara Flynn? I understand they met in flight school when they were still teenagers. You must be so proud of your wife. How do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d He slammed the door and stepped back, so upset that it took him a minute to notice that the room had gone quiet. The guardsmen and the wives\u2014and his family\u2014were all staring at him. He had failed in some way; that was obvious. What was it they wanted him to say? That he was proud of her? Proud that she\u2019d been shot down?</p><p>How could they expect that of him? How could he even form the word now, when his world was falling apart?</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>It was one of those foggy days in Seattle, where it seemed there was no sky at all, just layers and layers of gray. Jolene could hear the ferry\u2019s foghorn in the distance, rippling like the water it floated above; a seagull cawed.</p><p>Betsy loves feeding those gulls. How many times had they stood on the ferry deck, hand in hand, lashed by a cold wind, throwing food to the beady-eyed birds who seemed to float so effortlessly?</p><p>A car horn honked.</p><p>She frowned, confused.</p><p>The sound changed, became an insistent beep-beep-beep.</p><p>She realized suddenly that her eyes were closed. Her mouth was so dry she couldn\u2019t swallow. No. There was something in her mouth.</p><p>She came awake slowly, fought to open her eyes.</p><p>Overhead, instead of sky, was a white ceiling tracked with harsh lighting. She blinked. There were machines clustered around her, tall stands with monitor heads, like thin washed-out mourners, clucking and beeping.</p><p>The something in her mouth was a tube. Another tube went into her chest from the machine to her right.</p><p>A giant sucking sound came and went, rising and falling.</p><p>She heard footsteps, then a door opened, closed.</p><p>She needed to think. Where was she? What had happened?</p><p>A tall man in a white coat came to her bedside. He was wearing purple gloves and a white mask over his nose and mouth. He pushed back the curtains that created a semicircle of privacy.</p><p>A bed. Yes. That was it. She was in a bed.</p><p>\u201cChief,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>She tried to speak, but the tube made her gag.</p><p>Pain. She was in pain. It came to her suddenly, swallowed her; had it been there all along? Beside her, a monitor started to beep faster.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Chief,\u201d the stranger said through his mask. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in a terrible accident. Do you remember? Your helicopter was shot down.\u201d</p><p>His voice drew out the word, elongated it: ac-ci-dent.</p><p>Smoke. Burning bits of metal. Tami.</p><p>Adrenaline surged through her. Pain spiked\u2014where was it coming from? She couldn\u2019t tell, couldn\u2019t isolate it.</p><p>She wanted to ask about Tami, about her crew, but she couldn\u2019t make anything work. She stared up at the stranger, thinking please ...</p><p>She imagined herself reaching out, grabbing the man\u2019s arm, demanding to know how her crew was, but she couldn\u2019t do any of it. She thought of Tami, remembered holding her, promising her they\u2019d be okay.</p><p>Blood on her face ... everywhere.</p><p>The man did something to the bag hanging by her bed, and, slowly, the fog came back, rolled around her, softened the view until she was far away from here. She was on her own back porch, with her feet up on the railing, listening to the high squeak of Lulu\u2019s voice as she ran around the yard and to the even, reliable whooshing of the distant waves.</p><p>Pain snapped her awake.</p><p>Jolene opened her eyes, gasping, desperate to fill her lungs with air. The tube was out of her mouth now. How long had she been here, drifting in and out of consciousness?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t track the passing of time. When she woke, it was a barely there kind of waking; she was foggy, confused. A few times nurses had come into her room, and she\u2019d pleaded with them for news, but all she ever got were poor you looks of sadness and a promise to call the captain, but if he\u2019d ever came back, she\u2019d been asleep.</p><p>She was awake now, though. Her bed was angled up a little, and some of the machines were gone. The overhead lights were harsh, unforgiving. In the small window to the right she could see that it was rainy. For a muddy, drawn-out second, she thought she was home ...</p><p>She studied the room\u2014saw the small metal chair positioned by the window, and a TV tucked up in the corner between the wall and the ceiling, and gray-painted walls. Then she slowly looked down. Her right arm was in a white plaster cast from elbow to wrist. But that wasn\u2019t what got her attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her right leg hardly looked like a leg at all. It was positioned on top of the crisp white covers, bent just a little at the knee. From midthigh down it was a swollen, blackened, festering mess; it looked like an overcooked sausage against the snowy sheets. Four big metal screws held it together, kept it a leg at all. A hose connected the leg to a vacuum of some kind that sucked fluids from the wound, collected them in a plastic bag. At the ankle, splinters of bone jutted out. And the smell ... it was terrible, part burn, part rot.</p><p>She gagged at the sight of it, clamped a hand over her mouth; bile pushed up her throat. \u201cOh, my God...\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her door opened, and a tall man in a white coat walked into the room. \u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he said, pulling a mask up over his mouth and nose.</p><p>He came up to the other side of the bed, stood beside her. \u201cI\u2019m Captain Sands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cH-how\u2019s my crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChief, you need to stay calm.\u201d</p><p>Jolene struggled to move, but she had no strength in her upper body. The meager effort left her breathing hard, sweating. \u201cMy crew ... and Tami,\u201d she asked quietly, looking up. \u201cChief Flynn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChief Flynn is upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive,\u201d Jolene said, slumping back into the pillows. \u201cThank God. Can I talk to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet, Chief. She suffered a traumatic brain injury. We\u2019re monitoring her very closely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSergeant Hix is here, too. He took some shrapnel to his thigh, but he\u2019s healing quickly. Your other gunner, Owen Smith, didn\u2019t survive the crash. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d Smitty. She remembered his bright smile ... and the gaping hole in his chest. I\u2019m holding this space for you, Chief. I\u2019d want to talk to my mom.</p><p>\u201cNow, Chief, can we talk about you?\u201d the doctor asked gently.</p><p>She looked up at him blearily, hating the pity she saw in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m dying. Is that what you\u2019re going to tell me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were seriously injured, Jolene. I won\u2019t lie to you about that. Infection is the biggest concern in blast injuries like yours. Everything gets embedded\u2014dirt, glass, bits of metal. We\u2019re worried about gangrene in your leg. We\u2019re debriding it every day. And you lost so much blood, we\u2019re concerned about your liver and kidney function. You\u2019re also scheduled for surgery today on your right hand. Shrapnel damaged a nerve in your wrist. We\u2019re hopeful you\u2019ll regain some use of it, though.\u201d</p><p>Some use of it.</p><p>\u201cThe wounds on your face should heal in time, but we\u2019re watching them closely. Again, it\u2019s the blast injuries.\u201d</p><p>She fought the urge to touch her cheeks. My face.</p><p>She closed her eyes so that he wouldn\u2019t see how scared she was, but it was a mistake. In the darkness of her fear, she saw her children standing together, crying out for her, begging her to come home. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, hating the tremble in her voice. She was a soldier, for God\u2019s sake, and she couldn\u2019t make herself look this man in the eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t die. I have children, Captain. Please.\u201d</p><p>He touched her left hand. She felt the cool rubber of his glove on her skin\u2014no human contact; but what difference would it have made? What good was a stranger\u2019s touch when everything she was hung in such precarious balance?</p><p>She needed Michael here now. He would take care of her.</p><p>Michael, whose love had saved her once before. In the back of her mind, she knew there was a problem with Michael, something that had gone wrong, but then the morphine kicked in and began soothing her, and she was with her husband again, holding his hand, walking along the beach with the man she loved ...</p> <p>At two o\u2019clock, on the day CNN announced Jolene\u2019s accident to the world, Michael and Carl boarded a plane bound for Germany.</p><p>They landed in Frankfurt on a cold black night, where rain drizzled anemically on the endless concrete buildings and runways of the airport.</p><p>When they finally emerged from customs, carrying their suitcases, Michael looked around. \u201cThey said they\u2019d send someone to meet us,\u201d he said to Carl. Moments later, a young uniformed man approached them. \u201cMr. Zarkades? Mr. Flynn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us,\u201d Carl said. \u201cI\u2019m Flynn.\u201d</p><p>The young soldier handed Michael a small clear plastic bag. In it were Jolene\u2019s wedding ring and her dog tags and her old watch, its face cracked. He stared down at them. In twelve years, he\u2019d never seen Jolene without her wedding ring. This is real, he thought. He was going to see his wife who\u2019d been wounded in war. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>The soldier led them through the airport and into a waiting car. A short drive took them to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.</p><p>Rain blew in windy sheets across the entrance. Inside the neon brightness of the lobby, Michael and Carl were immediately sucked into a whirlwind of military protocol\u2014there were doctors, nurses, chaplains, and liaison officers waiting to greet them. Everyone stood tall and straight and unsmiling, wearing purple rubber gloves. More than once, Michael demanded to be taken to see his wife, but there was always a reason to wait.</p><p>He began to pace, then to get angry. \u201cDamn military,\u201d he muttered, moving up and down the busy aisle. When a neurosurgeon came to take Carl away, Michael had had it.</p><p>He marched up to the nurse\u2019s station again. \u201cI\u2019m Michael Zarkades. I\u2019ve flown halfway around the world to see my wife, Jolene Zarkades. She\u2019s a warrant officer, if that matters. I\u2019m sick to death of waiting. Just tell me where her damn room is.\u201d</p><p>The nurse glanced up from a file. \u201cCaptain Sands has asked you to wait. He wants to brief you himself. I\u2019m sorry, sir\u2014\u201d</p><p>Behind them, pandemonium broke out. Michael turned just in time to see a stream of soldiers on gurneys coming through the front doors. Doctors and nurses appeared instantly; a priest came, took one soldier\u2019s hand in his own, made the sign of the cross.</p><p>Michael leaned over the counter, saw Jolene\u2019s room number on her file, and headed for the elevators.</p><p>\u201cMAYDAY!\u201d Jolene screamed, waking up from a nightmare. She jackknifed to a sit, and at the movement pain exploded on her right side. Gasping, she slumped back into the pillows.</p><p>As usual, the first thing she noticed when she opened her eyes was her horrible, stinking excuse for a leg. The whoosh-thunk of the wound vacuum was so loud it drowned out everything else, even the pounding of her heart. The pain was excruciating, overwhelming.</p><p>But more than her own pain, she thought about Tami: Tami and Smitty and Jamie.</p><p>All her life she\u2019d been an optimist, forced herself to be. That shiny hope was gone now. What if Tami didn\u2019t survive? And what in the hell would she say to Smitty\u2019s mother? He showed me your picture about a dozen times ... that one where you were playing tennis ...</p><p>It was her fault. All of it. How would she live with this guilt? Did she even want to?</p><p>She reached for the morphine-drip button, thinking that she could sleep through this horror.</p><p>Then, through a break in the curtains around her bed, she saw him.</p><p>Michael.</p><p>Michael argued with the nurse and lost.</p><p>\u201cYou should wait for Doctor Sands. But either way, you are not going in there without a mask and gloves,\u201d the woman said firmly.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He snatched the mask and gloves and walked away. Putting them on, he paused outside his wife\u2019s door, took a deep breath, and went inside.</p><p>It occurred to him suddenly, sharply, that maybe he shouldn\u2019t have come rushing in like this, maybe he should have waited to hear about Jolene\u2019s prognosis ...</p><p>There was a curtain around half of her bed; he couldn\u2019t see her from here. \u201cJolene?\u201d</p><p>He closed the door behind him. The first thing he noticed was the smell. There was a putrid stench in the air that made him almost sick to his stomach. Bile rose up in his throat, choked him.</p><p>He wet his lips nervously and moved forward, opening the curtain.</p><p>He hardly recognized his wife. The right side of her face was scored with bloody, oozing sores, and the left side was bruised and swollen. A deep gash along her jaw had been stitched. Her lips were dry and cracked. Lank hair hung lifelessly from a side part.</p><p>But it was the leg that startled him. If you could even call it a leg. Blackened, peeling, bent, and broken, it was twice its normal size; huge metal screws held it in place at the knee and ankle. A pale bone jutted out from blue-black flesh. And the smell ...</p><p>For a terrible, humiliating second, he thought he was going to be sick.</p><p>He breathed shallowly, and only through his mouth, through the mask, but still the smell was there. He knew he needed to be stronger right now, to think of her, but it felt as if he were drowning. He couldn\u2019t catch his breath, get steady.</p><p>\u201cJo,\u201d he said softly, his voice creaky, his breathing accelerated. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said finally\u2014finally\u2014finding the strength to look at her. He knew pity and horror were in his eyes; there was nothing he could do about it. He shouldn\u2019t have come in here, not so unprepared. She needed him to be strong and certain now, and he couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk to the doctor ... I didn\u2019t know. I should have waited...\u201d He started to reach for her hand and saw the bruising, then drew back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that,\u201d she said quietly, tears glittering in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned her bloody, swollen face away from him. \u201cTami was wrong,\u201d she said softly, more to herself than to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What about Tami?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for us, Michael. You were right about that.\u201d Her voice broke on the sentence, made him feel even worse. She reached out and pushed the morphine button, and in no time, she was asleep.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>He\u2019d let her down, again. He\u2019d seen her injured leg and panicked, just panicked. Why had no one warned him? If he\u2019d known, maybe he would have been able to mask his initial reaction.</p><p>Maybe. But honestly, he doubted it. Her injuries had overwhelmed him. How was he supposed to help her?</p><p>\u201cMr. Zarkades?\u201d</p><p>He turned, saw a tall, gray-haired man in a white coat walk into the room. Above a surgical mask, his gray eyes were serious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the delay, Mr. Zarkades. Emergencies happen fast around here. I\u2019m Captain Sands. Jim. I wanted to talk to you before you saw her.\u201d</p><p>Michael felt a rush of shame again, then anger\u2014at himself, at the military, at this man who hadn\u2019t shown up in time, at God. \u201cThat would have been nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Sands said, leading him out into the busy hallway. There were nurses everywhere out here, running from room to room.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you can tell,\u201d Sands said as Jolene\u2019s door clicked shut. \u201cYour wife has sustained some serious injuries. There are a lot of concerns now but the biggest is infection. Blast wounds, such as hers, are particularly dangerous. You can\u2019t imagine what finds its way into the wound. Bacteria is rampant. We\u2019re debriding the leg daily\u2014taking her into surgery and cleaning it\u2014but to be honest, I\u2019m not hopeful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean, not hopeful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chance she\u2019ll lose her leg. We don\u2019t know about her right hand yet, whether she\u2019ll regain use of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can. The injuries to her face will heal quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Michael thanked the doctor and went back to stand by Jolene\u2019s bed. He was there for hours, staring down at her, waiting for her to waken. He felt sick with the need to apologize to her, to recast his reaction. To be a better man. He\u2019d grown so much in her absence, and then, at the first chance to show her those changes, he had failed. Utterly.</p><p>Finally, exhausted, he left her room and headed out of the hospital. But as he approached the elevators, he thought of Carl and Tami. He asked a nurse where the ICU was and then took the elevator up one floor to Tami\u2019s room.</p><p>Through the window, he saw Carl standing at his wife\u2019s bedside, his head bent forward, tears running down his cheeks. Michael was about to leave, but Carl looked up and saw him. Wiping his eyes, straightening, Carl walked away from the bed, came to the door, opened it.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>\u201cTraumatic brain injury.\u201d Carl shrugged. \u201cIt means she may wake up and she may not. She may be perfectly fine and she may not. They took out a piece of her skull because her brain is swelling. How\u2019s Jo?\u201d</p> <p>Michael was surprised at the tears that stung his eyes. He didn\u2019t bother wiping them away. \u201cShe may lose her leg, and her right hand is useless for now.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. It should have been comforting, but it wasn\u2019t. Michael couldn\u2019t stand here with this man he hardly knew, trading fear back and forth. \u201cWell. I\u2019m heading to the Landstuhl House,\u201d he said. It was a place built by some American philanthropist to house the families of wounded soldiers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep here tonight. I had them bring me a bed.\u201d</p><p>Michael should have thought of that. He mumbled something about seeing Carl tomorrow and headed out of the hospital. Less than thirty minutes later, he was settled into a small, well-appointed room with a bathroom en suite and a double bed in the Landstuhl House.</p><p>As he sat on his uncomfortable bed, staring at nothing and remembering everything, he tried to figure out a way to undo the mistake he\u2019d made today. How would he convince Jolene that he\u2019d changed when he\u2019d acted exactly as she must have expected him to?</p><p>At the time they\u2019d agreed upon, he called home. Betsy answered. In the middle of his hello, she said, \u201cHow\u2019s Mom?\u201d</p> <p>What should he say? The truth would probably give her nightmares, but she needed to be prepared for the worst, didn\u2019t she? He might have handled it better if he\u2019d been prepared. He leaned back against the cheap, wobbly headboard. \u201cShe says she\u2019s feeling a little better and she can\u2019t wait to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>He paused. Now was the time to say something, the right thing, to calm his daughter\u2019s fears and allow her to hope. He turned through the choices\u2014lies or the truth\u2014and came up with half-truths. \u201cHer right hand and ankle are ... hurt. They\u2019re working to fix them up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s left-handed, so that\u2019s good,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cDad? What aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cNothing, Betsy. We don\u2019t know everything yet, that\u2019s all. They\u2019re still running some tests. I\u2019m sure that soon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a baby. Lulu!\u201d she yelled, \u201cDad\u2019s on the phone. He wants to tell you that Mom got shot down but she\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetsy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d Lulu squeaked. \u201cMommy\u2019s all better? Did they give her ice cream?\u201d He ran a hand through his hair and sighed. He talked to Lulu for a few minutes, although, honestly, he had no idea what either one of them said, and then his mother was on the phone.</p><p>\u201cHow is she, Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let her down, Ma,\u201d he said softly, more to himself than to her. He knew instantly that it was a mistake, not the sort of thing he should have said to his mother, but he needed advice right now, and what good was advice based on bad information?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll let you know what she needs, Michael. Just listen to her.\u201d</p><p>They talked for a few more moments. After he hung up, he closed his eyes, thinking that he would never be able to sleep, but, before he knew it, sunlight was streaming into the room, and he was blinking awake.</p><p>The bedside clock said seven fifteen.</p><p>He got out of bed, feeling old and tired. By the time he\u2019d showered and shaved and dressed for the day, he felt a little better.</p><p>Until he stood at Jolene\u2019s bedside, and it all came rushing back\u2014the fear, the guilt, the anger. He was afraid she would lose her right leg and use of her hand, and in losing them become someone else. He couldn\u2019t imagine how it would feel to be so wounded, to lose so much. How could she get back to who she had been?</p><p>He felt guilty that he worried about her limbs when her life hung in the balance, and he was pissed off that she\u2019d put herself in harm\u2019s way and been wounded and now neither one of them would be the same.</p><p>He hated his own weakness, felt as if he were stewing in this pot of his own worst traits. He wanted to be the kind of man who just wanted her to live, in any condition\u2014and he did, he was that man\u2014but he was the other man, too, the one that couldn\u2019t imagine looking at her in the same way if she lost her leg and couldn\u2019t use her hand.</p><p>He moved in closer, careful not to disturb the tubes coming out of her.</p><p>Her face looked flushed; beneath the yellow and purple bruising, her skin had a reddish cast, and she was sweating profusely, breathing shallowly. Dirty, greasy hair flanked her injured face. Her lips were chapped and cracked and peeling, colorless. It made him think that he should have ChapStick with him. The smell was worse today, like garbage left out on a hot day. He fought the urge to gag.</p><p>He glanced down the blanket. Her right leg, on top of the blanket, was still swollen and awkward looking, the foot turned almost unnaturally to the right. That vacuum sucked and wheezed, drawing viscous yellow liquid from the wound.</p><p>He heard her come awake, heard the catch in her breathing.</p><p>\u201cMi ... chael,\u201d she said, her head lolling sideways to look at him. Her gaze was glassy, unfocused. \u201cYou\u2019re ... here ... thass nice...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was here before, remember?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, licked her lips. \u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo?\u201d He had so much to say to her, but where should he start? It was hard enough to undo damage done in a marriage without all of this. He brushed the hair from her face and felt her forehead.</p><p>She was burning up.</p><p>\u201cWait...\u201d she said, drawing the word out. \u201cYou doan love me...\u201d</p><p>Michael hit the nurse\u2019s button. When a woman came in, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s burning up.\u201d</p><p>The nurse pushed him aside so hard he stumbled back. Within seconds, the room was full of people, taking Jolene\u2019s temperature, pulling back the covers. A nurse unwrapped the gauze on her leg.</p><p>The smell almost made him sick.</p><p>\u201cGet her to the OR, stat.\u201d This was Dr. Sands. When had he come in?</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Michael said, surging toward her, bending down. \u201cI love you, Jolene ... I do.\u201d</p><p>It was too late; she was unconscious. He stood there while they wheeled her away.</p><p>She is crawling through the thick, sucking mud, carrying her best friend. \u201cHang on, Tami ... don\u2019t you die ... I\u2019ll get us there...\u201d</p><p>But where are they going, where is she taking Tami?</p><p>Somewhere close by a bomb hits. The sky is full of fire and bullets and burning bits of steel. A helicopter hits the ground and bursts into flames.</p><p>She throws her body over Tami\u2019s, trying to protect her, but when the night stills and she draws back, Tami is shriveling up in front of her, bleeding through her nose ... her mouth ... her eyes. There\u2019s blood everywhere, and smoke. Jolene screams, \u201cNOOOOO!\u201d</p><p>She came awake, still screaming.</p><p>It took her a second to remember where she was: in a hospital. In Germany.</p><p>She moved with extreme caution, lifting her head off the pillow. She felt woozy and unfocused, a little sick to her stomach. Through slitted lids, she saw the machines around her. That whooshing, sucking vacuum was gone. So was the smell of rotting flesh. Now she smelled antiseptic and plastic.</p><p>She tried to rise on one elbow, but the effort winded her. Breathing hard, dizzy, she stared down at her legs.</p><p>Leg.</p><p>From about the knee down, the right side of her bed was a flat expanse of white blankets. She had a distant, watery memory of recovery, of seeing nurses and doctors come and go, monitoring her progress.</p><p>They had amputated her leg. Cut it off at the knee.</p><p>She grabbed a pillow and covered her mouth and howled in grief and pain; she screamed until her throat was parched and her eyes were stinging and her chest ached. She imagined her new life, off-balance, differently abled, broken, and each image was a scab she had to pick\u2014no more flying Black Hawks or running along the beach or picking up her children and twirling them around on a summer\u2019s day.</p><p>Finally, exhausted, she slumped back into the pillows and closed her eyes. The grief gave way to a yawning sense of despair. Here she was, her leg cut off, lying in a hospital bed far from home, without a best friend to talk to or a husband to hold her.</p><p>Michael.</p><p>She released a heavy breath at the thought of him.</p><p>He would stay with her now; that was who he was. Michael Zarkades had a strong sense of duty. He would see that she was broken, and he would step back into the marriage where he belonged. Pity would bring him back to her; duty would make him stay. That was why he was here, after all. The dutiful husband standing by his broken wife.</p><p>Someone touched her face gently. She opened her eyes slowly, worked to focus. The meds were still in her system, making her unsteady.</p><p>Michael smiled tiredly down at her. The shirt he wore, an expensive black turtleneck, hung strangely, as if he\u2019d been pulling on the fabric at his throat, stretching it out. Of course he touched her gently. She was damaged now, crippled; he would be afraid to touch her, afraid that what was left of her would break. \u201cHey, sleepyhead,\u201d he said, \u201cwelcome back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d she said, feeling inestimably sad. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d She had to concentrate to make her voice work. She felt so groggy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed; her throat was dry. Her thoughts jangled around her head. \u201cYou wanted a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo, I\u2019ve been trying to tell you since I got here: I love you. I was an idiot. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>It was what she\u2019d waited months to hear, dreamed of almost every night in the desert, ached for, and now ... she didn\u2019t care. His words were meaningless. She pushed her morphine pump and prayed for the drug to work quickly.</p><p>\u201cGive us a chance, Jo. You need me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never needed anyone.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd thank God for that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJo, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to help me, Michael? Go home. Get the house ready for a cripple. Get my girls ready. It won\u2019t be easy for them to see me like this. They\u2019ll need to be prepared.\u201d She closed her eyes, feeling useless tears again. Thankfully, the morphine kicked in, and slowly, slowly, she felt herself drifting away.</p><p>Michael leaned down and kissed her cheek. The soft, familiar feel of his lips on her skin nearly did her in. She almost reached for him, almost told him how scared she was and how much she needed him.</p><p>Instead, she said, \u201cGo ... way...\u201d She refused to need him anymore.</p> <p>As if from far away, she heard his footsteps as he walked away, heard the door swoosh open and click shut. At the last minute, she thought: Come back. But it was too late. He was gone, and she was falling asleep.</p><p>Her last conscious thought was a list of what she\u2019d lost: Running. Flying. Being beautiful and whole. Being strong. Picking up her children.</p><p>Michael.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Twenty-four hours after they cut off Jolene\u2019s leg, they wanted her to get out of bed. At first she fought with the nurses who came to put her in a wheelchair, and then she realized the opportunity it presented: she could see Tami.</p> <p>Now she was out of bed and in a wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cAre you comfortable, ma\u2019am?\u201d the young nurse asked, helping Jolene settle into the chair.</p><p>How many days had passed since she\u2019d climbed into the pilot\u2019s seat of a Black Hawk helicopter? Now she needed assistance just to sit in a vinyl chair. Her gauze-wrapped stump stuck out in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you. I\u2019m going to see Chief Tami Flynn. In ICU.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll push you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even do that by herself because of her bum right hand. The nurse positioned herself behind the wheelchair and rolled Jolene out of the room.</p><p>The ortho ward was full of patients like her\u2014their limbs shattered or broken or gone. Most of them were men, and so young. Just boys, by the looks of them; one even wore braces.</p> <p>That made her think of Smitty.</p><p>Smitty, with his bright smile and gawky walk and horsey laugh; Smitty, who drank Mountain Dews one after another and swore that girls were dying to get into his pants. Smitty, who had been so excited to go to Iraq.</p><p>We\u2019re going to kick some ass over there, Chief. Aren\u2019t we?</p><p>Too young to have a beer but old enough to keep his head calm in battle and die for his country.</p><p>In the elevator, she had nowhere to look except down\u2014at the part of her that jutted out, bandaged white, useless.</p><p>Stump.</p><p>She looked away quickly, feeling sick. And ashamed. How could you live when you didn\u2019t have the courage to look at your own body? The doctors and nurses seemed unconcerned with her cowardice. Repeatedly they\u2019d told her it was normal to be squeamish and afraid, that it was normal to grieve for a lost limb. They assured her that someday she would be her old self again.</p><p>Liars.</p> <p>On the third floor, they rolled out of the elevator and headed through the busy ICU hallway. Here, as before, the personnel were in constant motion.</p><p>The nurse stopped outside a closed door. On the metal surface, someone had taped up the soldier\u2019s creed. Not someone. Carl. He had put up these words for his wife, because he understood her so well. He knew what Tami would want everyone coming into her room to know: a soldier lay in this bed.</p><p>Jolene hadn\u2019t read these words in years.</p><p>I am an American Soldier.</p><p>I am a warrior and a member of a team.</p><p>I serve the people of the United States, and live the Army Values.</p><p>I will always place the mission first.</p><p>I will never accept defeat. (This had been underlined.)</p><p>I will never quit.</p><p>I will never leave a fallen comrade.</p><p>I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my warrior task and drills.</p><p>I always maintain my arms, my equipment and myself.</p><p>I am an expert and I am a professional.</p><p>I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy the enemies of the United States of America in close combat.</p><p>I am a guardian of freedom and the American way of life.</p><p>I am an American Soldier.</p><p>Jolene swallowed hard.</p><p>The nurse opened the door and wheeled her into the small high-tech room. Carl sat by the bed, his hands in his lap.</p><p>\u201cJolene,\u201d Carl said, getting to his feet. She could tell by the way he moved that he\u2019d been sitting a long time. \u201cI\u2019ll take her from here,\u201d Carl said to the nurse, who placed a hand on Jolene\u2019s shoulder, left it there long enough to make a point, then left the room.</p><p>Carl bent down and lightly kissed Jolene\u2019s bruised cheek. She reached up with her good hand and held his hand. \u201cHow is she, Carl?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cApparently no one can say anything for certain when it comes to brain injuries. She\u2019s in a coma. We\u2019ll know more when she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>He wheeled her to the bedside. Jolene hated how low she was, like a kid looking up. Already she\u2019d learned how different the world looked from a seated position. Still, she saw Tami\u2019s profile. Her friend\u2019s face was black and blue and misshapen. She looked like she\u2019d gone twelve rounds with Mike Tyson. A gash split her swollen upper lip. Bandages covered her head, the gauze darkened here and there by blood soaking through. \u201cHelp me stand,\u201d Jolene said quietly.</p><p>Carl helped her out of the chair, positioned himself beside her, holding her upright.</p><p>\u201cHey, flygirl,\u201d Jolene said. She wanted to touch Tami\u2019s hand, but it took all her strength and concentration to hold herself upright. She clutched the bedrail with her one good hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe would be pissed to hear you say that,\u201d Carl said quietly.</p><p>Jolene nodded. It was true. Tami would have hated to hear that Jolene felt guilty about the crash, but how could she not? \u201cI wonder if she knows we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows.\u201d</p><p>Jolene wanted to believe that. She felt a sudden rush of loss, of grief. They had been best friends for more than twenty years. Tami was as rooted in Jolene\u2019s soul as Michael and the girls. The thought of losing her ...</p><p>No. She wouldn\u2019t think that way. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back to us, Tam. I know you will. You\u2019re probably just doing this for attention.\u201d</p><p>She told Tami about her own injury, and about Smitty, and about Jamie, who was recovering in a room just one floor down, and who asked about Tami every day. She talked about home, and the beach, and the summer they would spend collecting sand dollars and flying kites.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll run along the beach again, both of us.\u201d She heard her own words and lost steam. Tears scalded her eyes, fell, and all she could do was plead. \u201cCome back, Tam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s not going to die,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou hear me, flygirl? No dying allowed. If I have to live with one leg and one arm, I will need you.\u201d At that, she realized the gravity of it all, the looming loss, and she closed her eyes, thinking, come back.</p><p>She held on to the slick metal rail. Her leg was starting to ache, but she didn\u2019t move. She wanted to stand here until Tami woke up.</p><p>She stared down at her best friend, seeing the whole of their lives in a second\u2014the girls they\u2019d been together, in uniforms, in cockpits, wanting so desperately to prove themselves ... and the women they\u2019d become and the battles they\u2019d weathered together, the jokes they\u2019d shared. They\u2019d been together forever, side by side, listening to everything from Madonna to Tim McGraw, keeping each other strong. Army strong.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re sending me home soon,\u201d she said to Carl.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jolene looked at him. The thought of going home, of leaving Tami behind, was more than she could bear. \u201cHow can I leave her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d he said gently. \u201cShe would want you to. Go home to your kids, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>How long did she spend with Tami and Carl? Minutes? Hours? She didn\u2019t know. As she stayed with her friend, time lost all meaning, even the pain in her leg was put aside. She kept trying to find the right words to say to Carl, a perfect way to package hope and hand it over, but as the minutes passed, she faded. There was no other word for it. Finally, they ended up sitting in a painful silence, and Jolene called the nurse and asked to be taken back to her room.</p><p>In her own bed, she closed her eyes and tried not to think about the worst things\u2014about Tami not waking up and Smitty never coming home.</p><p>She was vaguely aware of people coming and going, checking on her, adjusting her medications and tending to her residual leg\u2014lifting, wrapping, cleaning. Hours passing. She tried to keep her eyes closed and ignore it all.</p><p>\u201cJo?\u201d</p><p>She heard Michael\u2019s voice and felt a wave of exhaustion. \u201cI thought I asked you to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean it. I\u2019ve been trying to tell you I love you, Jo. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t care. Not anymore. What good was an unreliable love? Slowly she turned her head, looked up into his eyes. \u201cGo home and take care of our children, Michael. Please.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cPlease. They\u2019ll need you. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. \u201cGo, Michael. I\u2019ll be home in a few days. They\u2019re getting ready to release me. You know that. You can\u2019t fly home with me anyway. Go. Take care of our children. That\u2019s how you can help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said slowly, as if maybe he knew it was the wrong thing to do, but he was glad to get the chance to do it. \u201cI\u2019ll go. But I\u2019ll be home, waiting for you, when you get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d she murmured, closing her eyes.</p><p>On the long flight home, Michael told himself he was doing what Jolene had asked of him, and there were moments when he believed it. But most of the time, he knew the truth: he was running away, just as he\u2019d done when his father was dying. It was a failing in him, bruiselike, purplish and ugly. He couldn\u2019t stand seeing people he loved in pain.</p><p>Worse than the shame was the guilt. He kept thinking that he\u2019d caused all of this. He\u2019d broken Jolene\u2019s heart with careless words and then sent her off to war while he simmered in righteous anger and blamed her for making a dangerous choice.</p><p>He would give anything to take back that one night when he\u2019d ruined everything. If he\u2019d sent her off to war with love, would she have come back to him whole? Would she have been stronger then? Would she have turned her helicopter a split second faster?</p><p>He knew the answer to that question was no. Jolene was an outstanding pilot, and if she had one great skill from her screwed-up childhood, it was the ability to compartmentalize pain and keep going.</p><p>Now he was almost home. When the ferry docked on Bainbridge Island, he drove off the boat and over the Agate Pass Bridge, past the fireworks stands\u2014empty now until Christmas, when they would become tree lots\u2014and through the postcard-perfect town of Poulsbo.</p><p>On the bookstore marquee, he saw the first sign: JOLENE ZARKADES AND TAMI FLYNN, YOU ARE IN OUR PRAYERS. COME HOME SAFELY.</p><p>There were similar signs everywhere, and big yellow ribbons decorated telephone poles and porch rails and fence posts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On the way out of town, the yellow ribbons continued\u2014on mailboxes and front doors and autumn-leaved apple trees.</p><p>As he approached the house, he could see that the fence line was decorated with more yellow ribbons. The flag on their porch hung slack on this windless night. Bouquets lay on the ground beneath one of the posts, like a grave site, their petals dying and turning brown.</p><p>He pulled into the garage and sat there, alone, in the dark. Sighing, he finally went into the house.</p><p>His mother was seated on the hearth, in front of a bright fire. At his entrance, she peered up at him from above the jewel-encrusted reading glasses she bought in a six-pack from Costco. Putting down her book, she stood, opening her arms.</p> <p>He walked into her embrace, not realizing how much he needed a hug until her arms were around him.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything,\u201d she said, leading him to the sofa.</p><p>He started with: \u201cI should have waited for the doctor, but you know how impatient I am,\u201d and he told her everything, ending with, \u201cShe asked me to come back here and get the house\u2014and the girls\u2014ready for her homecoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have left her,\u201d his mother said.</p><p>\u201cYou told me to listen to her, that she\u2019d tell me what she needed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMichael,\u201d his mother said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He raked a hand through his hair, sighing. \u201cShe threw me out.\u201d</p><p>His mother made the tsking sound he knew so well. \u201cMen are stupid. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s true. Please leave doesn\u2019t mean she wanted you to actually do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a mind reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have this conversation. I feel shitty enough. I don\u2019t need you making it worse.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him. \u201cYour wife is in Germany, wounded and afraid, and you left her there alone, grieving for her lost crewman and worried about her best friend. Do you really think it can get worse, Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, Ma. I\u2019ve never been good at this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what you do, Michael. You go upstairs and tell your children about their mother. Then you hold them when they cry and you get your family\u2014and this house\u2014ready for your wife\u2019s return. You don\u2019t make the same mistake again. Next time, you look at Jolene\u2014all of her, Michael, even what\u2019s missing\u2014and you tell her you love her. You do love her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But she won\u2019t believe me. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would? You have been foolish. You will have to swallow your pride and convince her ... and yourself, perhaps. It will not be easy, nor should it.\u201d She patted his thigh. \u201cAnd now, you will go up and tell your daughters that their mother is coming home from war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed at that, feeling instantly tired, weighed down by this new burden that seemed to be his alone to carry. He leaned sideways, kissed his mom\u2019s cheek, and headed for the stairs.</p> <p>Outside Betsy\u2019s room, he paused, gathering up his courage. He knocked on the door and went into the room. The girls were on the floor, playing some board game.</p><p>Michael knelt between them. Lulu immediately climbed onto his bent knees and looped her arms around his neck, leaning back like a pair\u2019s ice-skater in a twirl. \u201cHi, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Betsy asked warily.</p><p>Lulu bounced on his lap. \u201cYou wanna play Candyland, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Betsy said. \u201cHow is Mom?\u201d</p><p>He drew in a deep breath. \u201cShe lost her leg.\u201d</p><p>Lulu stilled. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey cut it off, stupid,\u201d Betsy said, scrambling backward, getting to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lulu shrieked.</p><p>\u201cBetsy,\u201d Michael snapped, \u201cdon\u2019t scare your sister. Lulu, Mommy\u2019s going to be fine, she just lost part of her leg. But she\u2019ll still be able to walk and everything. She\u2019ll need our help for a while, though. She\u2019s coming home in three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom lost her leg and Tami is in a coma, but everyone is going to be fine. We\u2019re all going to be fine, just like we were.\u201d Betsy\u2019s voice broke, and she ran to the door, yanking it open. \u201cYou and Mom are both liars,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes. Then she walked out of the room and slammed the door shut behind her.</p><p>\u201cBut where\u2019s her leg, Daddy?\u201d Lulu said, starting to cry.</p><p>\u201cJo?\u201d</p><p>She heard Jamie\u2019s voice and opened her eyes.</p><p>Jamie stood in the doorway, dressed in his ACUs.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She smiled at him, tried to look strong. She had no courage these days, it seemed, no inner strength. It was just so damned good to see him up and walking, even if it was with a limp. He\u2019d visited her yesterday, too.</p><p>Closing the door behind him, he walked into the room. The look in his eyes was so compassionate she almost started to cry again. He knew what she was feeling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Jo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSmitty\u2019s gone. Tami\u2019s in a coma. I was flying the aircraft,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cYou carried her out of the helicopter, Jo. You.\u201d He looked down at her amputated leg. \u201cOn that. You carried your best friend. I saw you, as I was scrambling, trying like hell to get Smitty out. I got him out, but it was too late.\u201d</p><p>She saw the guilt Jamie carried.</p><p>\u201cI saw him, Jamie. He was already gone.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you give up,\u201d he said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be this woman.\u201d She indicated her ruined body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a soldier, Jo. That\u2019s inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ordered back to Iraq,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>She nodded, a lump in her throat. It occurred to her that she had just been more honest with this man than she\u2019d ever been with her husband. \u201cBe safe, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her a long time. \u201cYou\u2019re my hero, Chief. I want you to know that. And I\u2019ll miss you up there in the sky.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone and she was alone.</p><p>SEPT.</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to be glad I write with my left hand. I hear that a lot. But how can I be happy about anything?</p><p>I\u2019m going home tomorrow and Tami still hasn\u2019t woken up. Carl says the doctors have started to shake their heads and \u201cprepare\u201d him for her death. How can we prepare to lose her?</p><p>Tami, who sings off-key and loves mai tais and never knows when to quit. My best friend. She won\u2019t quit now. That\u2019s for sure.</p><p>Carl came to say good-bye to me this morning and the fear in his eyes was enough to make me sick to my stomach. He said, \u201cHer heart stopped today. They got it going again, but...\u201d and by then we were both crying. He doesn\u2019t know what Tami thinks of \u201cheroic measures,\u201d and I told him she was a hero herself and you never stop trying. Never.</p><p>Jolene came awake with a start. She had a perfect instant in which she forgot where she was\u2014then the truth muscled its way in. Tami lay in a bed down the hall, and Michael was gone, and she was getting ready to go home.</p><p>Home.</p><p>She opened her eyes and saw a female soldier in dress uniform standing at the end of her bed reading the latest issue of Stars and Stripes. Jolene hit the button beside her bed, which slowly angled her up until she was looking at the marine.</p><p>\u201cHello, Chief,\u201d the woman said, putting the newspaper down on the flat blankets at the foot of the bed. Not quite where Jolene\u2019s leg should be, but close.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m Leah Sykes. From North Carolina,\u201d she said in a pretty, rollingly accented voice.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been back to Landstuhl in more than nine months. Some things take a while to confront.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a morale officer?\u201d</p><p>Leah laughed. \u201cHardly. My husband would certainly tell you that I\u2019m far from an inspiring kind of woman. But you. I hear you are a helicopter pilot.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked down at the place where her leg should be. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude, Leah, but I\u2019m tired\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever hear of the Lioness Program?\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started a while ago, a few years, I think. I\u2019m no historian. The point is, when the marines did their ground searches, they encountered real resistance from the Iraqi women, who refused to be searched by men. Women soldiers were needed, so they asked for volunteers. A bunch of us who were tired of supply work and such signed up. I was one of the first.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked at the woman more closely. She looked like a sorority girl, with her dyed-blond french braid and mascaraed eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cWe were attached to marine combat units and sent out. We got some special training\u2014not enough, really, a week\u2014but we went. I liked it. Combat, I mean. Who would have thought? Not my cheerleading coach, that\u2019s for sure. But you know.\u201d Leah moved away from the end of the bed. Her movements were awkward. She had a strange, hitching way of walking, and as she did her pretty face grimaced.</p><p>Then Jolene saw her legs: two steel rods that ended in hiking boots.</p><p>Jolene felt ashamed of herself for complaining. She still had one leg left. \u201cYou lost both legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIED. I\u2019m not going to lie to you, ma\u2019am. You have a hard road in front of you. I was a bitch like nobody\u2019s business. I don\u2019t know how my husband stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I fly helicopters?\u201d</p><p>Leah\u2019s sad look was worse than an answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. But you\u2019ll be you again. In time.\u201d</p><p>It should have meant something to her, seeing this woman\u2019s courage in the face of such adversity. It would have once, in a time that already felt long ago. Now all she wanted was to be left alone. She wanted to snuggle back into the warm, dark waters of self-pity, and so she did; she closed her eyes.</p><p>Every time she woke up, Leah was still there, standing beside her.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>A Soldier\u2019s Heart</p><p>We don\u2019t receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us.</p><p>\u2014MARCEL PROUST</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Michael and the girls had spent all day at the mall. They\u2019d been like search-and-rescue dogs sniffing out the things on their list with relentless purpose. A new bed, new sheets and bedding, lots of pillows. Acrylic paint, a roll of butcher paper, a set of multicolored markers, both fine-tipped and fat.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d had lunch at the Red Robin and piled back into the car, the trunk full of their purchases, Lulu was skating on the narrow edge of an adrenaline high. She was talking so much and so fast it was impossible to keep up. Michael had stopped even trying to answer her questions. Each one started with, \u201cWhen Mommy comes home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014We\u2019ll sing her favorite song. What\u2019s her favorite song, Betsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014We\u2019ll yell SURPRISE!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014We\u2019ll dance. She loves dancing. Oh, she losted her leg. What can we do instead of dancing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2014We\u2019ll give her ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Even Betsy couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><p>Back in Poulsbo, they picked up his mother from the Green Thumb. She brought dozens of flowering plants with her\u2014roses and orchids and bright yellow mums. She wanted to fill Jolene\u2019s room with flowers.</p><p>\u201cWe got everything, Yia Yia!\u201d Lulu squealed as Mila slid into the passenger seat and slammed the door shut. \u201cMommy is going to be SO happy.\u201d</p> <p>His mother smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be so happy just to see her girls again.\u201d</p><p>Lulu started talking again\u2014something about painting this time\u2014and they were off. Michael drove through town, quiet again in the off-season, and turned onto the bay road. It was late afternoon, and sunlight gilded the Sound.</p><p>Once at home, they dove into preparations. Betsy unfurled the butcher paper on the kitchen floor and knelt in front of it. Carefully organizing her acrylic paints, she began work on the WELCOME HOME, MOMMY sign that had required so much discussion. Lulu had demanded that there be suns all over the paper, and pink hearts; Betsy wanted rainbows and American flags. By the time they were done, there was barely a square inch of paper left to be seen.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Dad?\u201d Betsy said at last, frowning, sitting on her knees and studying the banner. \u201cWill she like it?\u201d</p><p>It was a burst of images and color and love. Best of all was the painting in the corner\u2014a man and woman holding hands, with two frizzy-haired stick-daughters beside them. The four figures were inside of a huge pink heart.</p> <p>Is that who\u2019ll we\u2019ll be again, Jo? he thought, trying to hold on to his smile. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we need to make the cake,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cLemon is her favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get to help!\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>Betsy gave Michael an irritated look. \u201cAll she does is lick the spoon, Dad. And she sticks her fingers in the frosting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two can work together,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big day. The biggest day. Your mom is coming home from war, and we need to let her know that she\u2019s the most important person in the world to us.\u201d</p><p>Betsy got to her feet and walked over to Michael. \u201cIs she excited to come back to us, Dad?\u201d</p> <p>It surprised Michael to hear his own worry voiced aloud by his daughter. \u201cWhy would you ask that, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t very nice to her sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I know the feeling. \u201cShe understands that. She knows how hard it was for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been writing us many letters lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been so busy. The war really heated up in September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked up at him, her gaze sharp and assessing. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because of that fight you had. When you said you didn\u2019t love her anymore.\u201d</p> <p>He flinched. So, Betsy remembered that; maybe she would remember it her whole life, no matter what happened from here on. Had she been worried about it all this time? And what should he say? \u201cGrown-ups fight; I told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never wrote to her. And she didn\u2019t write to you. I\u2019m not stupid, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>Michael had worried about that, too. He smiled down at his daughter, hoping it looked more genuine than it felt. \u201cYour mom is excited to come home, Betsy. Don\u2019t you worry about anything. We just have to show her how much we missed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did miss her, too. I can\u2019t wait to give her a huge hug. And to hear her tell me she loves me to the moon and back.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into a hug. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be happy again, Betsy,\u201d he said, his voice as strong as he could make it. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Starting tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Nine days ago Jolene had walked across the base with her best friend, complaining about the weather, saying, It\u2019s hard as hell to walk in this mud. She\u2019d grabbed the rim of the Black Hawk cockpit door and climbed easily aboard, putting her feet to the pedals. She had known irrevocably and completely who she was.</p><p>Now she was in the air again, but everything about her world had changed. She was in a transport plane, flying home with six other wounded soldiers, as well as some medical staff and a few civilians. The patients were in the front of the plane, in beds bolted to the aircraft\u2019s interior walls. A pale, flimsy curtain separated them from the other passengers. In the old days, Jolene would have found a way to smile through the pain and loss; she would have worked to make sure than everyone else was comfortable. Those days were gone. She lay in the bed, gritting her teeth against a phantom pain that made her missing foot throb.</p><p>When the plane landed in Seattle, the nurse seated beside her said, \u201cYou\u2019re almost home, Chief. That must feel good.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head away and said nothing. The nurse was right; it should have felt good, coming home. For months she had dreamed of this moment, of seeing her daughters again. Of course, she\u2019d imagined herself walking through her own front door, dropping to her knees, and opening her arms for an endless hug.</p><p>What was wrong with her?</p><p>She should be glad she was coming home at all. What would Smitty give to trade places with her? Or Tami? The thought made her feel guilty and small. But what could she do about her feelings? They were inside of her, uncontrollable now, festering.</p><p>She simply couldn\u2019t look the other way this time or pretend everything was fine. She had a numbness inside of her that was new and frightening. Maybe she was afraid to feel too much, afraid that if she let her emotions go, she would start screaming and never be able to stop.</p><p>The plane touched down, taxied. The nurse said, \u201cWelcome to Boeing Field, Chief. We\u2019ll be transporting you to an ambulance, which will take you to the rehab center.\u201d</p><p>Jolene wanted to say thank you but her heart was beating so fast she felt dizzy. She wasn\u2019t ready for this. She was actually afraid to see her children. What in the hell was wrong with her?</p><p>A major appeared beside her, in full uniform, and pinned a medal to her tee shirt. He talked down at her, said words she barely heard. Medals shouldn\u2019t be given to a woman who\u2019d gotten her aircraft shot down and a young man killed.</p><p>Still, she didn\u2019t bother saying anything, not even, \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>They rolled her on the gurney from the belly of the plane, down a bumpy ramp and onto Boeing Field, where a row of ambulances waited to take the patients to different hospitals and rehab facilities. Rain fell on her face, the first real reminder that she was back in the Northwest. She stared up at the swollen gray sky, and then she was in an ambulance, lying next to an earnest young paramedic, who thanked her for her service to the country.</p><p>On the way north, she must have fallen asleep, because when she awakened again, they were stopped. This time, the paramedics lifted her as if she were a child and carried her over to a waiting wheelchair. They positioned her carefully in the chair, draped her lap and legs in a blanket.</p><p>Her family stood clustered in front of the rehab center\u2019s entrance. Michael and Mila were holding flowers. Even from here, she could see how Lulu was bouncing on her feet, grinning. The girls were holding up a WE MISSED YOU sign painted in drippy blue acrylic, with glitter sprayed in rainbow colors above.</p><p>She loved her daughters with every ounce of her soul; she knew that, knew it, but somehow she couldn\u2019t feel it, and that inability scared her more than anything ever had.</p><p>\u201cMOMMY!\u201d Lulu screamed, running toward her, leading the charge. Betsy was right behind her.</p><p>Betsy rammed into Jolene\u2019s residual leg.</p><p>Pain sliced through the limb. Jolene said, \u201cDamn it, Betsy, be careful!\u201d before she could help herself.</p><p>Betsy stepped back, her eyes glittering with tears.</p><p>Jolene gritted her teeth, breathed shallowly until the pain subsided. \u201cSorry, Betsy,\u201d she said, trying unsuccessfully to smile.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Betsy mumbled, looking hurt and angry.</p><p>Lulu was on the verge of tears. \u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>Jolene felt a wave of exhaustion. She didn\u2019t know how to rewind the past minutes and start over, how to be her old smiling self, and her leg throbbed in pain now.</p><p>Michael moved in beside her, taking control of the wheelchair. \u201cMa, take the girls into Jolene\u2019s room. We\u2019ll check in and be there in a second.\u201d</p><p>Mila herded the confused-looking girls into the building.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been really excited to see you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Michael wheeled her into a brightly lit lobby and up to a receptionist desk. There, he introduced Jolene, who smiled woodenly, and he signed a few papers. Then he wheeled her down a hallway and into a small room with a giant WELCOME HOME, MOMMY banner strung across one wall. There were enough bouquets to stock a flower shop, and family photographs covered every surface. Again, her daughters and Mila stood by the window, but this time their smiles were hesitant, uncertain.</p><p>Jolene wanted to reassure them, but when she saw the triangular-shaped trapeze thingy that hung from her bed, she thought, That\u2019s my reality now. I need help to sit up, and the numbness was back and spreading ...</p><p>Come on, Jo, smile, pretend to be who you used to be ... a smile is just a frown turned upside down. You can do it.</p><p>Michael rolled her close to the bed and then stopped so suddenly she lurched forward. He stared down at her stump, covered by the blanket. \u201cCan you get into bed?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, there was a knock at the open door. Jolene turned to look as a big black man with gray dreadlocks walked into the room. Dressed in pink scrubs, he smiled like a lottery winner as he sidestepped past Michael. With exquisite gentleness, the man lifted Jolene out of the chair and placed her in bed. He removed her slipper, set it aside, and then covered her with the bright purple blanket on her bed. When he was done, he leaned down and said softly, \u201cJust breathe, Jolene. You\u2019ll get through it. I hear you\u2019re tough as nails.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him in surprise. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m your physical therapist, Conny. I\u2019ll see you tonight at six for your orientation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a Conny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I been hearing that all my life.\u201d Still smiling, he introduced himself to the family, shook Michael\u2019s hand, and left the room.</p><p>And then she was alone with her family.</p><p>Jolene looked at her loved ones. She wanted\u2014desperately\u2014to feel joy, but she didn\u2019t, and the absence both terrified and depressed her. She felt nothing.</p><p>Lulu broke free of the pack and walked over to the bed. She looked at the flat place on the blanket where Jolene\u2019s leg should be. Frowning, Lulu leaned over her, patted the empty spot. \u201cYep, it\u2019s gone. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot there, Lulu. My leg got really hurt and they fixed me right up. I\u2019m perfect now.\u201d Jolene\u2019s voice caught on the lie.</p><p>Lulu got up on her tiptoes and peered at Jolene\u2019s casted arm, with its swollen, pale, useless fingers sticking out. \u201cBut you still got two hands,\u201d she said, turning to Betsy. \u201cShe gots two hands, Bets. So we can still play patty-cake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Betsy didn\u2019t respond. She just stood there, staring at Jolene, her eyes wide with hurt. She was scared, too. And why wouldn\u2019t she be? Her mother had come home missing a piece of her body. It didn\u2019t exactly paint a comforting picture for the future. And the first words her mother had said to her had been in anger.</p><p>Jolene knew this was the time to set the tone, to say hey, I\u2019m missing a leg, but who needs two, anyway and make them all feel better, but she couldn\u2019t do it. She just couldn\u2019t. She hadn\u2019t found the courage to even look at her leg. How could she act like it didn\u2019t matter?</p><p>Mila came up behind Betsy, put a hand on her shoulder, and pushed her forward. \u201cYour girls were so excited to see you again. They hardly slept a wink.\u201d</p><p>Jolene heard the hesitancy in her mother-in-law\u2019s voice, and the subtle rebuke. Jolene should be handling this differently.</p> <p>\u201cYou will be yourself again,\u201d Mila said after an uncomfortable silence in which Betsy stared down at the floor and gnawed on her thumbnail.</p><p>Jolene nodded. She wanted to believe that. \u201cOf course I will. It\u2019s just been a long flight, and my leg hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will just take time.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. Hopefully it looked like a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mila said, \u201cwe should get home and let your mom rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Betsy said too quickly.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Mommy!\u201d Lulu said, opening her arms for a hug.</p><p>Michael picked her up and Lulu leaned forward, throwing her arms around Jolene\u2019s neck and burrowing into her neck like a little bunny. \u201cI love you, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>And there it was. The love. It filled Jolene\u2019s heart to overflowing. She didn\u2019t even realize she\u2019d started to cry. She held on to her daughter so tightly neither one of them could breathe. \u201cI love you, too, Kitten. And I love you, Betsy and Mila. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so tired. It\u2019s been a long flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe understand, don\u2019t we, girls?\u201d Mila said, patting Betsy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBetsy?\u201d Jolene said. \u201cDo you want a kiss good-bye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Betsy said, sounding sullen.</p><p>\u201cBetsy,\u201d Mila said warningly.</p><p>Betsy walked woodenly forward and leaned down to kiss Jolene\u2019s cheek. It was lightning fast, that kiss, over before it began, and then Betsy was edging away from the bed.</p><p>Jolene waved good-bye with her left hand and watched them walk away. Only Betsy didn\u2019t pause at the door, didn\u2019t look back and smile.</p><p>Michael stayed at her bedside.</p><p>\u201cThe house is almost ready,\u201d he said. \u201cYour friends from the Guard helped me build a ramp. We turned my office into a bedroom. No stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe separation you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that, Jo. Please. I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p> <p>And really, Michael, it\u2019s about you. She sighed, too tired suddenly to do anything\u2014to fight, to pretend, to feel. This day had gone from bad to worse and there was no end in sight. She\u2019d thought the worst of her injuries was her amputated leg, but there was something else wrong; this numbness inside of her. She wanted to do the whole reunion over and be a better mother this time. \u201cGood-bye, Michael,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou keep pushing me away.\u201d</p><p>She laughed bitterly; it turned into a sob. Throwing back the covers, she showed him her half leg, swollen to twice its size, cut off above the knee, and wrapped in gauze and elastic bandages. \u201cLook at it, Michael. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>The pity and sadness in his eyes was her undoing. \u201cJo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out, Michael. Please. Please. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom read me the riot act for leaving you in Germany. Apparently when a woman says go, it means stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this woman. Go means go.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to cross her arms and sigh dramatically, but of course she only had one good arm. She used that hand to pull the covers up, and she closed her eyes.</p><p>She heard him move toward her, felt his breath on her cheek as he leaned forward and kissed her temple. The gentleness of it made her want to cry. She swallowed hard and said nothing.</p><p>Finally, he left her, and she was alone again.</p><p>It was a long time before she fell asleep.</p><p>Jo! Don\u2019t leave me\u2014</p><p>Tami is screaming, crying ... blood is spurting from her nose and her mouth ... her eyes. Jolene is trying to get to her, trying to reach out, but a bomb falls ... exploding. The black night is full of fire and falling shrapnel, and now she can\u2019t find Tami. Somewhere, Smitty is yelling out for her, saying he\u2019s trapped. Jolene is yelling for them, coughing through the smoke, dragging herself through the dirt, looking ...</p><p>Jolene woke up, gasping in pain. It felt as if someone was twisting her foot in the wrong direction, as if the bones were snapping in protest.</p><p>She grabbed the overhead bar in her one good arm and hauled her body upward until she was sitting up. Breathing hard, she stared down at the flat blanket. \u201cYou\u2019re not there,\u201d she screamed. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>She flopped back onto the bed, staring up at the speckled white acoustical tile ceiling, gritting her teeth. Tears burned her eyes. She wanted to give into them, maybe cry so hard she washed away on a river of tears and disappeared. But what was the point of crying? Sooner or later she\u2019d wipe her eyes and look down and her leg would still be gone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s common, you know.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, she turned her head. Through the billowy wave of her pillow, she saw the black man standing in her doorway and knew why he was here. To help.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Conny,\u201d she said.</p><p>He came into the room anyway.</p><p>As he moved, he took something out of his pocket\u2014a rubber band, maybe\u2014and pulled his gray dreads into a ponytail. Diamond earrings glinted in his dark ears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not every man who can wear pink scrubs,\u201d she observed wryly.</p><p>\u201cNot every woman can fly a helicopter.\u201d He stopped at her bedside. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp you to sit up,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>She swallowed hard and met his gaze. The compassion in his black eyes hurt as much as the phantom pain in her leg. \u201cGo away.\u201d The words were a croak of sound.</p><p>\u201cYou just gonna lay here and feel sorry for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. That was exactly what she wanted now\u2014to be left alone. She\u2019d spent a lifetime being Pollyanna, believing in the power of positive thinking, and where had it gotten her? Tami was hurt, her marriage was broken, and she couldn\u2019t even get out of bed on her own.</p><p>He put an arm around her and eased her upright, positioning the pillows as a comfortable backrest.</p><p>She fought him weakly, too depressed to even care, really, then she gave up.</p><p>When she was upright, he stepped back just enough to be polite, but not enough so that she owned her space. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s common.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk, but she was pretty certain that a mulish silence wouldn\u2019t work with this man. She\u2019d lay odds that he had the patience of a sniper.</p><p>\u201cFine. What\u2019s common?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pain in your lost leg. It\u2019s weird, I hear. Feels like it\u2019s actually in the foot.\u201d</p><p>That got her attention. \u201cYeah. How am I supposed to forget about it if it keeps hurting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to forget about it anytime soon, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the cut nerves. They\u2019re just as confused down there as you are. Nothing feels right to them; they\u2019re looking for that foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you deal with the pain until the nerves heal completely. Teach you some basic relaxation techniques. Exercise and a nice hot bath can help, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe morphine worked.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cSoldier girl, we aren\u2019t giving you any more morphine. You can\u2019t just sleep through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you have a better idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do indeed. What physical therapy did they start with you in Germany?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her casted right arm. \u201cWhat do you think? It\u2019s not like I can use crutches.\u201d</p><p>He frowned thoughtfully. \u201cGee, you\u2019re right. I guess I won\u2019t start you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Conny, as much fun as it is to have you stalking me, I\u2019m tired. I didn\u2019t sleep well last night, and I\u2019m exhausted. Why don\u2019t you come back later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to leave. Telling you to, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Are you confused, soldier girl? You think we\u2019re in some big-ass helicopter and I\u2019m your crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Con\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you look. As my grandbaby says, you aren\u2019t the boss of me. I\u2019m the boss of you. Your family is paying plenty for you to get rehabilitated, and that is exactly what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t move. Get it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWell, I know that. I\u2019ve got your chart. And then there\u2019s the flat blanket and the busted-up arm. I\u2019m not asking you to move. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you asking of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to start. I thought you wanted to fly helicopters again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to grow back my leg like one of those sea-monkey kits we had as kids?\u201d</p><p>That made him laugh. \u201cI have to say, they told me you were nicer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. I lost a part of me. Nice went with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to start real easy, with something you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopscotch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you how to wrap your bandages. The pressure of a good, tight wrap helps with the pain. Think of it like swaddling one of your baby girls.\u201d</p><p>She tried to scramble away from him but there was nowhere to go. \u201cNo. Go away.\u201d</p><p>He put a hand on the headboard and leaned toward her. His lopsided ponytail fell to one side. \u201cIt\u2019s normal, not wanting to look, but it\u2019s part of you, Jolene, part of your body. You have to learn how to take care of yourself. I\u2019ll go slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to look. Go away,\u201d she said, quietly now. She was having trouble breathing. Panic had a good, strong hold on her.</p><p>He let go of the headboard and moved down toward her legs, peeling back the blanket as he went.</p><p>She reached for the blanket, grabbed it, tried to hang on; he pulled it free.</p><p>She saw her lower half\u2014the blue pajama bottoms on one leg, with its perfect pale foot at the end, and the other, jutting out beneath the fabric that had been cut away with scissors and now was fraying.</p><p>It was grossly swollen, huge, rounded at the end, wrapped in white.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI ... can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Jolene,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her one good hand curled into a fist. She tried to catch her breath and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cJust look at me.\u201d</p><p>As he said it, his hands moved to what was left of her leg\u2014her residual leg, they called it. Wouldn\u2019t want to say stump; that was an ugly word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You\u2019ve got this, Jo, she thought desperately. You can handle anything. Just don\u2019t look away. The first time is the hardest. But that was the old Jo talking, and her voice was quiet, easy to ignore.</p><p>He unwrapped the elastic bandage slowly, so slowly she knew he was giving her the time to readjust with every motion. He lifted her leg a little, unwrapping the back, then moving across the front.</p><p>She thought she was going to be sick. Hold on, Jo. Hold on. Her fingernails bit hard into her palm. She felt herself starting to sweat.</p><p>He pulled the last of the bandages away, set them on the sheet beside her good leg. All that was left was a soft, gauzy dressing. Through it, she could see the discoloration of her swollen, bruised skin. She closed her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cJo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep breathing. Just listen to my voice. I\u2019m going to massage your leg, okay? It\u2019s good for circulation. When you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll teach you how to do it.\u201d</p><p>When his hands touched her skin, she flinched, felt a ripple of revulsion. She couldn\u2019t help herself; she made a little whimper of sound.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, soldier girl.\u201d</p> <p>She let out a heavy breath.</p><p>Slowly, she felt his fingers moving, massaging, releasing the clenched muscles, and it was a kind of magic. She felt her shoulders let go, her fists open. Her head lolled forward the slightest bit.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d he said at last, and she had almost fallen asleep. \u201cYou can open your eyes now, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it covered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re covered.\u201d</p><p>She heard the slight emphasis he put on the word, and she lifted her head slowly, opened her eyes.</p> <p>The elastic bandage was back in place, wrapped more tightly now, the tiny silver closures angled in a pair, almost like officers\u2019 bars.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cThat helped with the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will get better, Jolene. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t used to be such a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He came back up to the head of the bed, stood beside her. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bitch. You\u2019re just scared. My wife, now she\u2019s a bitch.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd I love her like a crazy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t used to be scared, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were lying to yourself. We\u2019re all scared sometimes.\u201d</p><p>To that, she had no answer. She had lied to herself about a lot of things over the years, lied or looked away. It had been the only way she knew how to survive. And she\u2019d been right to do it\u2014this fear was unbearable. It unwrapped who she was, as neatly as he\u2019d unwound her bandage, leaving too much pain and ugliness exposed.</p> <p>Nerve endings; he\u2019d said they were the problem. Things that got cut off, that ended abruptly or died\u2014like parents and marriages\u2014kept hurting forever.</p><p>She knew he expected her to be stronger, to try harder, to believe she could get better. But she didn\u2019t want better. She wanted her old life back, her old self back, and both were gone, amputated as cleanly as her leg.</p><p>\u201cJust try. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d</p><p>Try. It was another word for believe, and she was done with that.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Conny,\u201d she said, sighing, closing her eyes.</p><p>OCT.</p><p>It\u2019s raining outside my window. All I can see is tears. There\u2019s something seriously wrong with me, and it\u2019s not a missing leg.</p><p>I\u2019m being weak, falling into this pit of self-pity, and it embarrasses me, but I can\u2019t help myself. Conny comes into my room, wearing this big-ass smile, and he says all I have to do is try. He shows me pictures of women playing tennis on artificial legs, and I get the point, really I do. I just can\u2019t seem to make myself care. What right do I have to walk when Tami is lying in a bed, fighting for her life, and Smitty is buried in some box deep in the earth, never to smile again, never to say, Heya, Chief, you wanna play cards?</p><p>I\u2019ve been here eight days, and Michael has visited almost every day. I pretend to be asleep when he comes. I lay there, listening to him breathing beside my bed, and I keep my eyes closed. What a coward I\u2019ve become. He hasn\u2019t brought the girls to see me again. I know why. They\u2019re afraid. They see me and they know I\u2019ve changed and it makes them wonder if their world will ever be the same. I yelled at Betsy when she hit my leg. I didn\u2019t mean to, but what could I do to change it? I know it\u2019s my job to comfort them, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just not in me. Every time I think of them I want to cry.</p><p>Maybe if I could sleep, I\u2019d be okay. Or better, anyway. But my nights are full of nightmares. I hear my crew screaming for me, over and over and over. I see Tami reaching for me. It\u2019s getting so bad I\u2019m trying not to close my eyes.</p><p>Michael sat in the plush leather chair in his office, staring out the window at a bleak October day. It was 10:42 in the morning, nine days after his wife\u2019s return.</p><p>She would be in physical therapy now, trying to learn how to do things she used to take for granted.</p><p>His intercom buzzed. \u201cMichael. Dr. Cornflower is here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him in,\u201d he said, rising.</p><p>Chris walked into the office.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d Michael said, trying to get his mind back in the game. \u201cHello. Thank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>Chris tucked a straggly strand of hair back into his messy ponytail. Today he was wearing a black tee shirt, a fringed suede vest, baggy cargo pants, and black plastic clogs. An expensive leather messenger bag hung across his body. He took it off and burrowed through it, pulling out a green folder, which he set on the desk. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that Keith is suffering from an extreme case of post-traumatic stress disorder and probably was in a disassociative state when he killed his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll testify to that in court?\u201d</p><p>Chris sat down, crossed one leg over the other. \u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a suit?\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how well I clean up, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. So tell me what I need to know,\u201d Michael said, sitting down behind his desk again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve included a detailed report that you can study, so I\u2019ll just go with the highlights here. First let me explain how we diagnose. We start with questions designed to determine whether the patient witnessed or experienced an event involving serious injury or death. Some of the events in combat most likely to lead to PTSD are being attacked or ambushed, receiving incoming rocket or mortar fire, being shot at, being responsible for the death of a civilian or an enemy combatant, and seeing or handling seriously injured Americans or their remains. Obviously, many of these are heightened when one is talking about seeing a buddy die or get hurt. As you know, Keith\u2019s unit saw some of the worst fighting in the war. The insurgent gunfire and mortar fire was almost nonstop. Sixty-four soldiers from his brigade died in his first year\u2019s tour. What you don\u2019t know is that Keith was often on \u2018bagging\u2019 duty, which means he was charged with picking up body parts. Friends\u2019 body parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Michael murmured.</p><p>\u201cI think the trip to the public market triggered him. The crowds and the movement made him hypervigilant, put him in attack mode. He started drinking to calm himself, but it didn\u2019t work. When the homeless man approached, Keith reacted as he\u2019d been trained. He attacked. He has no substantive memory of what happened at home, but I theorize that another trigger\u2014a loud sound, a flash of light, something like that\u2014caused him to flash back to the war. In this dissociative state, he reacted as he\u2019d been trained\u2014he defended himself and killed his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a dissociative state of this kind, can a person think rationally at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me if one can form intent, my answer is no. Further, it is my professional opinion that Keith Keller specifically was incapable of forming the intent to kill.\u201d</p><p>Michael sat back, thinking.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man, Michael, a man who saw and experienced things his mind simply couldn\u2019t handle. It would be a tragedy to compound his\u2014and his family\u2019s\u2014tragedy by locking him away for life. He needs residential treatment.\u201d</p><p>Michael opened his own file. \u201cYou know the Department of Veterans Affairs deemed that he had a \u2018slight anxiety disorder.\u2019 They did not diagnose PTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe VA,\u201d Chris said, shaking his head. \u201cDon\u2019t get me started on the government and its failings with regard to our soldiers. It\u2019s criminal. The military tends to equate PTSD with weakness or cowardice. But they\u2019re going to have to get on board, especially because troops are doing multiple tours. We need to make the VA and the government start addressing the needs of its soldiers at home. We need to shine a light on this and erase the stigma. This case is important, Michael. Maybe you can help another broken soldier and save some lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t found a case to date where PTSD was argued successfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a first time.\u201d Chris smiled.</p><p>Michael nodded, looked out the window, where a steady rain was falling, in threads so thin they were like gray silk, blurring the sharp steel edges of the buildings. Like tears.</p><p>He understood suddenly what this case meant to him, why it mattered so much. \u201cMy wife,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cShe lost a leg over there. One of her crew was killed. Her best friend is still in a coma. Anyway, Jolene just got home and she\u2019s different. She was reserved with our kids\u2014angry and edgy, really\u2014and she adores them. I want to help her, but I don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause; in the silence, Michael could feel Chris studying him. \u201cShe\u2019s an army helicopter pilot, right?\u201d Chris finally said.</p><p>Michael turned to the doctor. \u201cYes. Does that mean something significant?\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re such a civilian. It means your wife is tough, Michael. She\u2019s a strong woman who has spent a lifetime getting what she wants from a system that really doesn\u2019t want to give it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman like her won\u2019t ask for help easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe keeps pushing me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she does. That\u2019s the army way, the military mentality. Be strong, do it all yourself, finish the mission. Don\u2019t let her push you away. She needs you now, even if she doesn\u2019t know it. And watch out for PTSD symptoms. Nightmares, lack of sleep, hypervigilance, sudden bouts of anger or depression or apparent numbness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Chris,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>This time, the doctor stood. They shook hands.</p><p>The doctor walked over to the door, opened it, and looked back. \u201cPolyester or corduroy, by the way?\u2019</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHugo Boss it is,\u201d Chris said, grinning as he left the office.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>The next day, Michael woke early, exhausted after another sleepless night. He stumbled out of bed and tried to reanimate his sluggish body with a hot shower, which only made him more tired. He dressed for work in the clothes from yesterday, which he\u2019d left lying over the back of a chair. It was easier than going into his closet and starting fresh. As usual these days, his clothes were strewn everywhere, hanging on chairs, folded in heaps on the floor, draped over the bench at the end of their bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He walked down to Betsy\u2019s bedroom door, knocked, and opened it just wide enough to say, \u201cGet dressed, Betsy. Breakfast in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Then he shut the door and went down to Lulu\u2019s room. Inside, it looked like some kind of toy-and-clothes bomb had detonated. Probably, he should make her pick her stuff up, but, honestly, it seemed easier to do it himself. Then again, that was what he thought every morning, and he had yet to do it. Thank God a cleaning woman came in once a week to help; otherwise, they\u2019d be living in a dump.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lulu,\u201d he said, leaning down to kiss her cheek.</p><p>He picked her up and carried her to the bathroom, standing beside her for the endless amount of time it took her to brush her tiny teeth. When she was done, she smiled at him triumphantly. \u201cI\u2019m a big girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want to wear to school?\u201d he said. He\u2019d learned in the past few months that telling a girl what to wear\u2014even one the size of a golf club\u2014was a bad idea. Histrionics often followed.</p><p>She went back to her room, stood in the pile of stuff with her hands on her hips, studying the disarray.</p><p>He counted silently to ten.</p><p>Finally, she chose a pair of pink pants decorated with daisy appliqu\u00e9s and a blue Toy Story tee shirt. The green striped socks added a clownlike touch, but what did he care? Together they walked down the stairs. In the kitchen, Michael checked Jolene\u2019s meal board\u2014another thing he\u2019d learned made life easier. While he got out the ingredients for french toast, Lulu started setting the table. They worked in a companionable silence that was broken only by the tinkling of silverware.</p><p>He was pouring himself a second cup of coffee when Betsy walked into the room, saying, \u201cThat TV lady is talking about Mom and Tami again.\u201d</p> <p>Michael wasn\u2019t surprised. In the last week, the local news had been in a frenzy over the female helicopter pilots and best friends who were shot down together. \u201cSit down for breakfast\u201d was all he said.</p><p>While the girls ate french toast and he drank coffee, he thought about all the things he had to do today. Discovery on the Keller case was in full swing, and he was gearing up for the start of the trial. His mind ought to be teeming with questions and strategies.</p><p>And all he could think about was Jolene. He was failing her. Maybe they all were. Since Jolene\u2019s return, Betsy had become sullen, silent. She was certain that her mother was damaged in some essential, life-changing way, and, worse, she was angry at Jo. Angry that she\u2019d gone to war, angry that she\u2019d been wounded, angry that she\u2019d come home changed.</p><p>By 8:20, both kids were on the bus and on their way to school. Michael drove down to the ferry and rode it across; in Seattle, he headed north.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, he pulled up in front of the rehab center. Pausing just long enough to take off his coat and sling it over his arm, he headed inside.</p><p>\u201cMr. Zarkades?\u201d</p> <p>He saw the physical therapist coming his way. As usual, Conny was dressed in baggy pink scrubs and his gray dreadlocks swung with every step, sort of like the alien in Predator.</p><p>\u201cHello, Conny,\u201d Michael said. \u201cHow\u2019s Jolene doing? I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s keeping you busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t get out of bed except to go to the bathroom\u2014and she hates that because she needs help. She refuses to learn how to care for her residual limb. She won\u2019t even look at it. That\u2019s not unusual, of course. Acceptance can take years. But she won\u2019t even try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene won\u2019t try?\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hurting,\u201d Conny said, \u201cand not in her missing leg. I get it, but it\u2019s been ten days. She needs to get started on her PT.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded. Turning away, he walked down the long, bright hallway to Jolene\u2019s room. There, he knocked once and opened the door.</p> <p>She sat up in bed, staring blankly at the TV screen. Her long blond hair was tangled, uncared for, dark at the roots. He saw how pale she looked, how thin. Weight loss had sharpened her cheekbones until they looked like knife blades, and her full lips were colorless and chapped. The violet shadows beneath her eyes attested to sleepless nights. He didn\u2019t even notice the flat place in the blanket. He looked at her, his wife.</p><p>She was scared; he saw that now. And depressed.</p><p>\u201cConny tells me you won\u2019t start physical therapy,\u201d he said, closing the door behind him and moving toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t give up, Jo.\u201d</p><p>She threw back the covers, exposing her bandaged half leg. It was still huge and swollen. \u201cI do now.\u201d</p><p>He heard the tremor in her voice and felt so sorry for her it was an ache in his heart. He wanted to tell her that, make her understand how deeply he felt her pain, but they\u2019d grown so far apart. She wouldn\u2019t even hear him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I can\u2019t see the pity in your eyes right now?\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re standing here because you have to? I\u2019ve become your duty.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. He had earned this anger, and he would have to take it. For now, there was something more important than their broken marriage to think about.</p><p>Don\u2019t let her push you away.</p><p>Cornflower was right. If Michael wanted his wife back\u2014and he did\u2014he was going to have to fight for her. And it wouldn\u2019t be pretty.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about you. This is our life. You\u2019re being selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you say that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just lie here and grieve for what\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been cut off, you mean. Say it. Look at it, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to fly. You, Jo. You wanted combat and war and to be all that you could be. Well, you got it, and this is who you are now.\u201d</p><p>She paled. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember all your boot camp stories and your flight school stories. And how about all those times men climbed into your Black Hawk, saw your ponytail, and got out, saying they wouldn\u2019t fly with a woman. You told me you made them eat their words. You said you were tough.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the blue plastic water pitcher by the bed and threw it at him. It missed his head by inches and cracked against the wall, splashing water all over him. \u201cGet the hell out of my room. You\u2019re the last person on earth who can help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? So you can go back to wallowing in self-pity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019m feeling, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you back, Jo. And if that doesn\u2019t matter, think about this: your girls need you.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of their daughters, she slumped forward. He wanted to say more, push harder, but at the sight of her, looking so defeated, he couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>With a sigh, he left the room and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Conny was waiting for him. The big man was leaning against the wall, with his dark, beefy arms crossed in front of him. \u201cShe\u2019s a spitfire, our soldier girl. How did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jolene the boss of who comes into her room?\u201d Conny asked thoughtfully. \u201cI mean, the woman can\u2019t get out of bed. And she needs some motivation, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Michael looked at the therapist. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose she\u2019d throw anything at her children.\u201d</p><p>Conny grinned. \u201cNope. I don\u2019t suppose she would.\u201d</p><p>On Saturday, Jolene sat in bed, watching visitors stream past her open door, holding balloons and carrying flowers, talking animatedly to the family members they\u2019d come to visit.</p><p>She had thrown Conny out of her room and then tried to read a book. But she kept forgetting the sentence she\u2019d just read. Finally, she gave up and closed her eyes.</p><p>In that split second, she was in the Black Hawk again, going down.</p><p>We\u2019ve been hit. Tami\u2014</p><p>She opened her eyes. God, she was tired of this, tired of the pain, tired of the nightmares ... just tired.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>She turned slightly, saw Conny at the door. Before she could tell him to get the hell out of her room, Michael walked in, ushering the girls in with him. They moved all together; he had a hand on each girl\u2019s shoulder. Lulu was wearing the small camouflage fatigues that Jolene had made for her last year, with the wings pin on her collar. Her long black hair was a bird\u2019s nest of tangles that framed her small face. Her socks didn\u2019t match.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mommy!\u201d Lulu said, beaming. She walked right up to the bed, grabbed the metal rails, and rattled them. \u201cDaddy said we needed to be good little soldiers to help you get better. I\u2019m all ready. See?\u201d She twirled around to show off her outfit.</p><p>Michael patted Betsy, gave her a little push. She stumbled forward. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t look at Jolene, kept tilting her head forward so that hair fell across her face.</p><p>Jolene stared into Betsy\u2019s wounded, angry eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you the other day,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Betsy shrugged and looked away. Obviously, she didn\u2019t know where to look\u2014not at Jolene\u2019s face, which was still scraped up and bruised, or at the missing leg. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>Jolene didn\u2019t know how to fix what she\u2019d done. The silence in the room expanded. Then Michael said, \u201cConny said you needed some motivation to get started on your PT. I knew you wouldn\u2019t let the girls down. They know it will be hard work\u2014and scary\u2014and they want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanna help! Like when you help us when we have nightmares,\u201d Lulu said, eager to show off her understanding of the plan.</p><p>Jolene could picture what had happened last night. Michael had gathered the girls close and told them their mom was hurt and scared and that they needed to help her.</p><p>She looked at her children and it hurt so much she couldn\u2019t breathe. She knew what Michael was counting on; he expected her to be the woman she\u2019d been before all this. That woman was gone; she\u2019d been shot down and died in the desert.</p><p>Lulu pulled off her Dora the Explorer backpack. Burrowing through it she pulled out her yellow blanket\u2014the special one she used to stroke as she sucked her thumb. \u201cHere, Mommy,\u201d she said solemnly, coming up to the bed. \u201cYou can have my blankee.\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s heart seemed to break open at that. For a second, she felt it, all the love that used to fill her up. She took the sad, worn yellow blanket, remembering how pretty it had once looked in Lulu\u2019s white spindle crib. And she wanted it back, all of it, her life, her ability to love, her sense of motherhood. \u201cThank you, Lucy. I\u2019ll be careful with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I get it back when you\u2019re more better, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>They stared at her expectantly.</p><p>Come on, Jo. Fake it.</p><p>She finally managed a smile. She refused to let her children down. \u201cOkay, Conny. What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the answer to that, Jolene. You\u2019re going to learn how to wrap your leg.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, hating the sick feeling that clutched her stomach. \u201cOkay. But the kids don\u2019t need to be here for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Michael said, coming to the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t see this,\u201d she told him, her eyes pleading. She could see that he was afraid, too.</p><p>\u201cThis? You mean you, Jo? We talked about it,\u201d he said, nodding down at the girls. \u201cIt\u2019s you, and we love you, and you\u2019re hurt. We\u2019re not afraid. We\u2019re more afraid of what we can\u2019t see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike nightmares and monsters in the closet,\u201d Lulu said. \u201cWhen you turn on the light, poof! They\u2019re gone and you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Jolene stared at Michael, mouthed please.</p><p>We\u2019re staying, he mouthed back.</p><p>Conny moved down to the center of the bed, opposite her family, and pulled back the covers. Jolene saw Betsy flinch at the sight. Her daughter edged toward the door.</p><p>Jolene gritted her teeth as long, dark fingers began slowly unwrapping the elastic bandage. \u201cIt\u2019s in a figure-eight pattern, see? That\u2019s how you wrap it back up, keeping it tight to help with the swelling.\u201d</p> <p>Then the bandage was off; beneath was a soft white gauze.</p><p>She clutched at the blanket in her left hand, squeezed the fabric in her fist. Michael put his hand over hers, held it.</p><p>She saw her half leg for the first time, and it made her sick to her stomach. It was huge and swollen. Ugly. Tears flooded her eyes, and she fought to hold them back.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to the bathroom,\u201d Betsy said, grunted really, and ran out of the room, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a football,\u201d Lulu said, frowning curiously.</p><p>Michael looked at Jolene; she saw her own emotions mirrored in his eyes: fear, loss, sadness, pity.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Jolene,\u201d Conny said.</p><p>She drew in a shaky breath and slowly, slowly bent forward, picking up the new gauze Conny had put beside her.</p><p>\u201cCarefully,\u201d Conny said, putting his hands over hers, showing her how to bandage it.</p><p>Her skin was taut and sensitive; swollen; not hers, somehow. Bile rose in her throat; she swallowed and forced herself to keep going.</p><p>For Betsy and Lulu, she thought, over and over. Act like it\u2019s nothing, like it doesn\u2019t hurt and make you sick. Be their mom again.</p><p>She wrapped her leg back up tightly, placed the small silver hooks in place, and then sat back, her eyes stinging as she yanked the blanket back up.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful job,\u201d Conny said. \u201cPractically perfect.\u201d He looked down at Lulu. \u201cYou and your mom are so brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re soldiers,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m just pretend.\u201d</p> <p>Conny smiled. \u201cThat explains it. And now, young lady, I need to get some things to help your mom exercise. You want to help me get them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I, Daddy?\u201d Lulu asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>When they were gone, Jolene flopped back into her mound of pillows, exhausted.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Michael asked, leaning over her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the strength to deal with him right now. She felt so weak and vulnerable, and in that split second when their gazes had met, she\u2019d imagined love. Nothing could scare her more. She\u2019d given him her heart long ago, and for so many years, and then he\u2019d crushed it. With her body so broken, she couldn\u2019t let anything else be hurt. \u201cWhy are you even here, Michael? You know we\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to sit back up, hating how she looked doing something so simple, all off-balance and breathing hard. She threw back the covers. \u201cIs this what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a sharp breath. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying. I learned a lot while you were gone, Jolene. About you ... about me ... about us. I was an idiot to tell you I didn\u2019t love you. How could I not love you?\u201d</p><p>She wanted it to be true, wanted it so badly she felt sick with longing. But she was broken now, and Michael had always had a keen sense of duty. It was one of the things they\u2019d shared. He wouldn\u2019t let himself walk away from his wounded wife, no matter how much he wanted to.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back, Mommy,\u201d Lulu said, coming back into the room with Conny. \u201cAnd Conny says we get to play catch!\u201d</p><p>Jolene drew in a tired breath. She wanted to say, Really? With one hand? Won\u2019t it be more like fetch? but she didn\u2019t. Keeping silent felt like a minor triumph. She managed a small, hopeful smile. \u201cOkay, Lulu,\u201d she said. \u201cI love playing catch. So let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>Michael stood by Jolene\u2019s bedside.</p><p>She had fallen asleep almost immediately after her PT session. He was hardly surprised. She must be exhausted. Today he\u2019d seen the woman who flew helicopters. The warrior.</p><p>He stared down at her scabby, bruised face. Always, from the beginning even, when she\u2019d come into his office that first day, he\u2019d seen Jolene as a powerhouse, a woman with steel in her spine.</p><p>He saw her vulnerability now. Maybe for the first time ever she needed him. It surprised him how much that meant to him, how much he wanted to be there for her.</p><p>He touched her face gently. \u201cHave I lost you, Jo?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He heard Lulu\u2019s helium-high voice in the hallway, and he turned, realizing too late that he had tears in his eyes. He wiped them away as Lulu said, \u201cLook, Daddy, we have ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Smiling as best he could, he turned again to his wife, kissed her cheek, and lingered there just a second. Then he straightened and walked away, leading his girls toward the car. All the way home\u2014on the long ferry wait and crossing\u2014Lulu chattered. She wanted a wheelchair of her own.</p><p>As they turned onto the bay road, Lulu started singing and clapping her hands together; then she started pretending she was playing patty-cake with her mother. \u201cHelp me make one up, Betsy, like Mommy does. Patty-cake, patty-cake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe only has one good hand now,\u201d Betsy snapped. \u201cHow do you think she\u2019s going to play patty-cake with you?\u201d</p><p>Lulu gasped. \u201cIs that true, Daddy? Tell her to shut up. They\u2019ll take off the cast and Mommy will be fine, right?\u201d</p><p>Michael pulled the car into the garage and parked next to Jolene\u2019s SUV. \u201cLeave each other alone.\u201d</p><p>Lulu wailed.</p><p>Betsy bolted from the car and ran out of the garage, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Michael unhooked Lulu from her car seat and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>In the house, she immediately wiggled out of his grasp and ran upstairs, probably to torment her sister.</p><p>Michael went to the kitchen, poured himself a drink, and stood by the counter, drinking it, gathering strength for what was to come. When he finished the drink, he set down the glass and headed upstairs.</p><p>He knocked on Betsy\u2019s door. \u201cBetsy, it\u2019s Dad. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>She waited almost too long, then muttered, \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>A phrase he\u2019d come to loathe.</p><p>Inside the room, Betsy stood with her back to him, at her window, woodenly rearranging her plastic horses. He didn\u2019t need Cornflower to tell him that it was a desperate attempt to create order from chaos.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in pain, Betsy,\u201d he said.</p><p>She went still. Her hand hovered above a black-and-white pinto, her fingers trembling. \u201cShe\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>He went to her, took her hand, and led her to the bed, where they sat side by side. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s her fault. She picked the army\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy, honey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra\u2019s dad says it\u2019s Mom\u2019s fault. He says women shouldn\u2019t be flying helicopters in wartime anyway. If she hadn\u2019t been flying, none of this would have happened. I told her I wouldn\u2019t forgive her ... and I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Michael sighed. \u201cSierra\u2019s dad is a dick who doesn\u2019t know shit. And you can tell him I said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, putting an arm around her. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Then the door burst open and Lulu stood there, frowning furiously. \u201cThere you are. Were you hiding from me?\u201d</p><p>Betsy turned, sniffling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was mean to you, Lulu.\u201d</p><p>Lulu grinned, showing off her tiny teeth and bright pink gums. \u201cI know, silly,\u201d she said. \u201cCan we play patty-cake now?\u201d</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>Yesterday, Jolene had worked harder than she\u2019d ever worked in her life\u2014army-ranger training hard\u2014and for what? So that she could sit upright in a chair, to stretch a leg that wasn\u2019t there, to hold a rubber ball with fingers that barely worked.</p><p>Now, she lay in bed, too exhausted and depressed to reach for the trapeze and pull herself to a sit. How pathetic was that? She called Carl at the hospital in Germany, but he didn\u2019t answer the phone. She left a message and hung up.</p><p>Tami, girl, where are you? Why aren\u2019t we going through this shit together?</p><p>There was a knock at her door, and she knew who it was. Conny the dreadlocked torturer. She didn\u2019t open her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know you aren\u2019t sleeping,\u201d he said, coming into the room.</p><p>She rolled away from him. Even that was hard to do with only one good leg. The motion was pathetic and lurching. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>He came over to the bedside. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide from this, soldier girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rolled over. Why don\u2019t you give me a treat and we\u2019ll call it a day?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. It was a bold, rich, velvety sound that clawed at her already-frayed nerves. \u201cI can just pick you up and haul your scrawny white ass outta that bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the woman who made it through boot camp and flight school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer leg is in Germany and she needs it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not getting it back.\u201d</p><p>Jolene glared at him. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to go, Jo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, almost cried it.</p><p>\u201cThen get out of this bed and start working with me. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, knowing there was fear in her gaze and unable to mask it. \u201cThis is killing me, Conny.\u201d</p><p>He brushed the hair from her eyes with a gentleness that brought tears to her eyes. \u201cI know that, soldier girl. I been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain\u2019s pain. I have had my share\u2014more than my share, really. My son died. Elijah. I\u2019ll tell you about him someday. He was a beautiful boy, had a smile that could light up the room. After he passed, I was full of anger. Darkness. Started drinking and yelling. Well, I imagine that\u2019s all you need to know. Took me a long time\u2014and a hell of a wife\u2014to find my way back. I know about hurting all the way to your bones. And I know about giving up. It ain\u2019t the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to be the kind of woman who never gave up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be her again.\u201d</p><p>Jolene turned away from the compassion and understanding in his dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jolene,\u201d Conny said, reaching for her. She didn\u2019t pull away but let him lift her out of the bed and into the wheelchair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The physical therapy room was a huge bright space with four broad, vinyl-covered beds along one wall and windows along another. There were two sets of silver parallel bars anchored to the linoleum floor. Scattered throughout the rest of the area were a variety of steps with and without handrails attached to them, yoga-type mats, physio balls in all sizes and colors, stacks of hand weights, Thera-Bands, and a collection of walkers and crutches.</p><p>First, Conny had Jolene warm up. She rolled onto her side on one of the bright blue yoga mats on the floor, and stretched out as far as she could, imagining her foot still there, pressing out, reaching for the end of the mat.</p><p>With each movement, Conny charted her range of motion and encouraged her to do better.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible,\u201d she said, breathing hard.</p> <p>\u201cOh. It is. Stretch farther.\u201d</p><p>Jolene gritted her teeth and kept at it, stretching her stump until pain made her scream out. Sweat dripped into her eyes and off her face, making the mat beneath her slippery.</p><p>\u201cOne more inch,\u201d Conny said.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she said, trying to give him what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d He patted her shoulder. \u201cNow let me see some sit-ups.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are worse than any drill sergeant I ever had. You know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI aim to please.\u201d While she did her sit-ups, he went to get her wheelchair and rolled it toward her. \u201cOkay. That\u2019s enough. Get in.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the chair, hating it. Sweat dripped down from her hair. She wiped her hands on her tee shirt, leaving damp streaks behind.</p><p>Conny lifted her onto the workout bench, got her seated, then rolled the wheelchair closer. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how to get into your chair. Here, make sure this brake is set. Wipe your hand so you don\u2019t slip, and remember, don\u2019t put any weight on your right hand. Just use it for balance. Let me help you, Jolene...\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips nervously. \u201cWho would have thought it took all this work to sit down. I used to run marathons. I tell you that? One time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stalling.\u201d</p> <p>She steeled herself again and began the work it took just to get from the bench into a wheelchair. Groaning at the exertion, she angled herself forward, stood slowly on her good leg. Balancing, she waited until she felt steady, holding the chair in her good hand. Already she was breathing hard again, sweating. And afraid she would fall. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time.</p><p>Before, she could have lifted one leg and balanced with ease. Now her equilibrium was as shaky as her sense of herself.</p><p>With exaggerated care, she turned on her good foot and sat down in the chair; her bandaged residual limb stuck out like a bowsprit.</p><p>\u201cYou did it,\u201d Conny said, smiling brightly.</p><p>He gave her about ten seconds to revel in her triumph, and then he had her back at the yoga mat, working again. She didn\u2019t have the core strength to lower herself to the mat on her one good leg, so Conny helped her. \u201cMore sit-ups,\u201d he said when she was ready. \u201cTwo hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred? Are you mental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you you\u2019d hate me. Quit whining and start.\u201d</p><p>She lay down, wishboned her arms behind her and pulled upward. \u201cOne ... two ... three...\u201d</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t noticed before how your feet anchored you for sit-ups. Now, she was constantly moving, sliding, feeling unsteady on the ground as she went up, down, up, down.</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred, Jolene,\u201d Conny said. \u201cDon\u2019t slow down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew ... you,\u201d she said in between breaths. She wanted to give up, wanted it badly, but every time she considered quitting, she thought about her children, and her family, and how much she wanted to be herself again, and she kept trying.</p><p>When she finished, Conny wheeled her back to her room. \u201cI\u2019ll send an aide to help you shower,\u201d he said, positioning her wheelchair by the window.</p><p>\u201cConny?\u201d she said, looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your son.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a slow, sad smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your leg, soldier girl.\u201d</p><p>For the next week, Jolene spent her nights battered by memories, and her days pretending she was getting better. She called her daughters every evening and let them tell her about their day; at night, she called Germany and talked to Carl about Tami. Most of all, she kept working. Every morning, when she woke, her first thought\u2014in the split second when she hadn\u2019t yet remembered the truth\u2014was I wonder if it\u2019s too cold to run.</p><p>By the time she opened her eyes, that question was gone, tossed onto the pile of lost chances that made up Before.</p><p>Now, her room was dark; the door was closed. She turned her head just enough to see out the small window. Beyond the glass, she saw a bare tree, its spindly limbs sporting puffs of green moss and a few tenacious, multicolored leaves.</p><p>She grabbed the trapeze and pulled herself to a sit. By the time she was upright, she was breathing hard. Tired again. She couldn\u2019t believe how much muscle mass she\u2019d lost in such a short period of time.</p><p>Today she would get fitted for her temporary prosthesis. Her new leg. She wanted to be excited about it, but the truth was that she was scared. The new leg meant that she would be up and around, that she would be walking, that she would go home, to her ruined marriage and her frightened children and a life that had no foundation. She wasn\u2019t a pilot anymore, wasn\u2019t a soldier, wasn\u2019t really a wife. Who was she?</p><p>She wanted to talk to someone about her fears, but it had never been her way, and God knew it wasn\u2019t the military way. Whatever new fears and ragged nerves and residual images she\u2019d carried home from Iraq, she was expected to deal with them herself. Besides, she\u2019d learned as a kid how futile words could be. With Michael she\u2019d always held back, even in the best of times, afraid to let him see how damaged she was beneath the bold surface. It was a trick she\u2019d learned young, in that house full of alcoholics. Say nothing.</p><p>Only with Tami had she ever been truly honest.</p><p>She lay back down and closed her eyes, thinking, Tami.</p><p>How are you, flygirl? Do you need me as much as I need you? You thought I was screwed up before\u2014you should see me now. I can\u2019t even trust my own mind and I can\u2019t sleep without nightmares ... God, I miss you ... wake up ...</p><p>Jolene sighed. As she lay there, feeling scared and (admit it, Jo) sorry for herself, she heard the sounds of the rehab center waking up. In no time at all, an aide had come with her breakfast, and another had helped her into the bathroom and in and out of the shower.</p><p>At nine o\u2019clock, Michael showed up. He walked into her room without knocking.</p><p>She was almost afraid to look at him; she felt so vulnerable right now. \u201cI thought you had a deposition today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be alone for this.\u201d</p><p>The easy way he said it was an arrow to the heart, as if they were Michael-and-Jolene again. Don\u2019t believe it. \u201cThanks,\u201d was all she could say.</p><p>Conny rapped sharply on the door and walked into the room. If he noticed the silence between them, he made no sign of it. \u201cGood. You\u2019re here, Michael. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Jolene felt uncomfortable getting into her chair in front of Michael\u2014it was all so pathetically difficult for her\u2014but it quickly became apparent that Conny had no intention of helping her. So she grabbed the bar and hauled herself upright with her left hand, then scooted over to the side of the bed and swung her legs over.</p><p>It was still a shock to land on one foot, but she concentrated on keeping her balance. Michael started to roll the wheelchair into range; she shook her head and hopped one step, then grabbed the rubberized handles and sat down with a sigh. She could feel how red her cheeks were from the exertion, and she was breathing hard\u2014again\u2014but she had done it herself, and there was some small satisfaction in that.</p><p>Conny smiled at her, then took his place behind the chair. The three of them set off down the hallway. For the first time, she saw how big this place was. Finally, they rolled up at a door marked Prosthetics.</p><p>Inside, it looked like Frankenstein\u2019s laboratory. There were plastic hands and feet and arms and legs hanging from the ceilings and the walls, in every size and color and composition.</p><p>A small Asian woman with huge glasses came out from the back room. \u201cYou must be Mrs. Zarkades,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCall me Jolene. This is my husband, Michael.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded crisply. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, the woman worked in concentrated silence. She measured Jolene\u2019s residual leg and made a plaster cast of it.</p><p>While the plaster was drying, Michael asked questions. \u201cWhy can\u2019t she get fitted for her permanent leg now? Why a temporary?\u201d</p><p>The Asian woman blinked through the saucer-sized glasses. \u201cHer stump will continue to shrink, which means that the socket will have to be changed often. It saves time and money this way, and it has the added benefit of letting her learn to be mobile while her leg shrinks. Bearing weight on it actually helps speed recovery. It will also help with desensitization.\u201d She carefully removed the plaster mold, which Jolene had trouble looking at, and took it into the back room.</p><p>Afterward, they headed back to Jolene\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be walking in no time,\u201d Conny said as he wheeled her up to the bed.</p><p>She maneuvered herself onto the mattress and remained sitting up, covering her legs with the blanket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back at noon for PT,\u201d Conny said.</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>Conny\u2019s laughter boomed and then faded as he walked away. Then she and Michael were alone.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cI need to sleep before Genghis Khan throws me to the mat again and tells me to give him two hundred sit-ups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever he asks.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked up at him, remembering how much his support had once meant to her. She wanted to tell him how scared she was to come home, how uncertain she felt about everything, how terrible her nightmares were. \u201cThanks for coming today, Michael. You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve let you down a lot in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cLet me make it up to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She thought about that, about opening herself back up to him, expecting something, and the idea was terrifying. He\u2019d already broken her heart. How could she trust him again? Especially now.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>He waited a long time, staring down at her. Then, with a quiet sigh, he left the room and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Jolene counted the days until her temporary prosthesis was ready. When it was, Conny strode into her room with a bright smile on his face. \u201cYou ready to get a move on, soldier girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.</p><p>He rolled the chair up to the bed, and she got into it with less effort than before.</p><p>All the way down the hallway toward the physical therapy room, she tried to prepare herself, both for triumph and failure. She didn\u2019t want failure to suck her under again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the PT room, Conny wheeled her over to a set of parallel bars.</p><p>She\u2019d never noticed how intimidating this piece of equipment could be. As she stared at the shiny bars, an aide came up and stood beside her, holding the prosthetic leg.</p><p>It looked like a tree trunk with a foot.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Jolene,\u201d Conny said, squatting down so that he was eye level with her in the chair. \u201cToday isn\u2019t about walking. Your right hand isn\u2019t ready to really support your weight yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt may never be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take one problem at a time.\u201d He reached for a thing that looked like a big sock and put it on her residual leg. Then he looked up at her. \u201cToday, you\u2019re going to stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and helped her to her feet. She hopped, holding on to him, and positioned herself inside the parallel bars.</p><p>The woman with the prosthetic leg kneeled in front of Jolene and fit the residual leg into the plastic cuplike top of the prosthesis. It felt snug, maybe even tight.</p> <p>The woman said, \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d and backed away.</p><p>Conny tightened his hold on Jolene. \u201cYou okay? I\u2019m going to put you down now. Just try to stand.\u201d</p><p>Jolene clutched the left bar in her good hand. With her right, she couldn\u2019t really grab hold, but she put her fingers on the metal for balance.</p><p>She took a deep breath, trying to calm her runaway nerves. This meant everything. If she could stand, she could walk, and if she could walk, she could run. Maybe she could even learn to fly again. Just do it, Jo. Stand.</p><p>\u201cJolene?\u201d</p><p>Her heart was beating so hard it took her a moment to hear his voice.</p> <p>He was standing at the end of the bars, smiling at her.</p><p>He\u2019d let her go. When?</p><p>Slowly, she looked down.</p><p>She was standing. Standing.</p><p>She could hardly believe it. She looked up at Conny through a blur of tears.</p><p>\u201cI know, soldier girl.\u201d</p><p>She stood there for a long time, working on her balance. She practiced lifting her hands from the bars. It hurt, putting all her weight on the prosthesis, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She gripped the bar again in her good hand and moved her right leg one step forward.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going too fast, Jo, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She ignored him. It felt good, making her own choice, pushing on. She had to drag her bad foot. It felt so heavy, unwieldy, but she did it. She walked.</p><p>She took another step forward. It felt like there were teeth in the socket, chewing her flesh, shredding it. She winced every time she put her weight on it, and by the time she reached the middle of the bar, she was sweating so hard her hands slipped. \u201cI need gloves,\u201d she said between breaths.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough for today, Jo.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, she gripped the bar in her good hand, stood on her good leg, and forced another awkward step.</p><p>Pain pushed back.</p><p>Focus, Jo.</p><p>She loosened her grip on the bar until she had let go completely. She put all her weight on the prosthesis, ignored the pain that shot up her thigh and lodged in her hip like a hot knife blade, and took another step. It took forever but she walked all by herself to the end of the bars. When she finally looked up, sweating and red-faced and breathing hard, she saw Conny smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cYou know what this means, soldier girl?\u201d</p><p>She wiped the sweat from her eyes, still breathing hard. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means she\u2019s going home soon,\u201d Michael answered.</p><p>Jolene glanced to the left and saw her husband standing by the wall, smiling. That was all it took, a look, a tiny adjustment to her balance, and she stumbled. Pain exploded up her right side.</p><p>Conny was beside her instantly, catching her before she hit the ground. She bit her tongue so hard she tasted blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. Can I go back to my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Connie started to reach for the wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Jolene, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll walk,\u201d Michael said, coming up beside her. His gaze was steady on her face. \u201cShe can lean on me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her one of his old smiles, and she was surprised by how deeply it affected her. She realized all at once how much she\u2019d missed it, missed him.</p><p>He moved in beside her, slipped an arm around her waist. His hand pressed against her hip bone, holding her steady. She felt his breath against her lips, her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me fall,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and took a deep breath. Staring at the open door, she gritted her teeth and began to move like Quasimodo: step, limp, drag; step, limp, drag.</p><p>She made it one step at a time, to the door, through the door, down the hall. By the time she reached her room, the pain in her leg was unbearable.</p><p>She was so tired, she let Michael help her into bed. Neither one of them knew how to remove the prosthesis, so they just covered it with the blanket. She was pretty sure blisters were forming down there, bubbling up and oozing, and she felt no rush to look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>She\u2019d been thinking about the pain of her forming blisters so deeply she\u2019d almost forgotten he was there. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack there, I saw the woman who could run a marathon on a high-tech leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman is gone, Michael,\u201d she said.</p><p>The look in his eyes was sad. It spoke volumes about who they\u2019d been and who\u2019d they\u2019d become. \u201cI should have told her I loved her, before she went off to war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cThat would have been nice.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>Jolene woke up screaming, drenched in sweat, shaking hard.</p><p>Falling back into the pillows, she worked to slow her breathing. They were killing her, these nightmares. She tried not to fall asleep anymore, but sooner or later, it crept up on her, and the nightmares were always there, waiting for her in the dark. Every morning she woke up feeling drained, already exhausted. Her first thought was always Tami.</p><p>She stared out her one small window; that was her view now. Her world had shrunk to a single room and a three-by-three-foot sheet of glass that looked out on a tree that was losing its leaves.</p><p>From her cockpit, she had seen forever ... and now she needed help to go to the bathroom.</p><p>It was demoralizing. As hard as she tried to be positive, she was irritated and shrewish when the aide finally came in to help her.</p><p>\u201cI hear it\u2019s a big day for you today,\u201d the woman\u2014Gloria\u2014said, pushing a wheelchair into the room.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jolene said, unsmiling. \u201cI\u2019m getting my cast off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going home.\u201d</p><p>Jolene thought again: What\u2019s wrong with me? \u201cOh. That, too.\u201d</p><p>Gloria helped Jolene out of bed and into the wheelchair. Talking all the while about something\u2014Jolene couldn\u2019t concentrate on the words\u2014the woman wheeled her into the bathroom, helped her pull her pants down and sit on the toilet seat.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help wiping?\u201d Gloria asked in the same voice you\u2019d say, Would you like fries with that? Perky. Cheerful.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m left-handed. Thanks. Maybe a few minutes of privacy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Gloria left the bathroom and closed the door behind her, but not all the way. A slice of air showed through.</p><p>It took Jolene a long time to empty her bladder\u2014nothing seemed to work as well these days. When she was finished, she was actually winded. And she still had dressing and hair combing and teeth brushing to accomplish. It tired her out just thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cAre we done?\u201d Gloria asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d Jolene said, striving not to sound irritated.</p><p>She was getting upset. It didn\u2019t take Sigmund Freud to guess why.</p><p>She was scared to have her cast removed.</p><p>With the cast on her arm, there was hope. She could look down at it and think that within that plaster casing, the nerves in her hand were mending, growing strong. But today she would know for sure. Was she a woman with two good hands or just one?</p><p>She let Gloria help her back into the wheelchair, as humiliating as it was.</p><p>\u201cConny will be here in a few minutes to take you to get that cast off. Do you want to get back in bed to wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you roll me to the window? I\u2019d like to look out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Gloria rolled Jolene to the window. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a beautiful fall day.\u201d She patted Jolene\u2019s shoulder and left. At the door, she paused and turned back. \u201cOh, I almost forgot. Maudeen Wachsmith in accounting wanted to ask you what you wanted us to do with your mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have mail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. Bring it to me.\u201d She turned back to the window.</p><p>Outside, the autumn sky was a pale sage green with wispy clouds. Beyond the parking lot, giant cedar trees screened whatever lay beyond. Up close, an aged cherry tree clung stubbornly to a handful of blackened leaves. As she watched, one lost its grip and tumbled downward.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, soldier girl. Nice to see you doing something besides sitting in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about trying a cartwheel.\u201d</p><p>Conny laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a firecracker, Jolene, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>He came around behind her and wheeled her out of the room. All the way through the hallways, he made small talk: his wife\u2019s new hairdo, his daughter\u2019s promotion, the way his back ached when he first got out of bed in the morning.</p><p>\u201cWell, here we are.\u201d</p><p>Jolene checked in and was wheeled into an examination room. Moments later came a knock at her door. In walked a stick-thin man in a white coat with messy salt-and-pepper hair and a nose like a portobello mushroom. She could tell instantly that bedside manner would not be his strength.</p><p>He came into the room, mumbling an introduction while he glanced at her chart. Then he set the file aside and looked at her. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re anxious to see how your hand works.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to find her voice.</p><p>He pulled up a chair and sat in front of her. Within moments, the cast was off, broken into pieces.</p><p>She looked down at her right forearm, shocked to see how thin it was, how pale. An angry red scar ran up from the back of her hand.</p><p>The doctor touched her palm very gently. \u201cCan you feel that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cTry to make a fist.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at her hand, thinking, come on, come on, and please, and then slowly, slowly, she watched her fingers curl into a feeble fist.</p><p>Jolene let out a sigh of pure relief.</p><p>The doctor smiled. \u201cExcellent. Can you lift your arm?\u201d</p><p>She could.</p><p>She could.</p><p>By the time she\u2019d finished the range of motion tests, she was smiling. At the end of the appointment, she wheeled herself out of the room. It took real effort to make her right hand contribute, but she did it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good, soldier girl,\u201d Conny said, getting up from his chair in the waiting room.</p><p>He rolled her back to her room and positioned her by the window again. \u201cPT in one hour. We need to start working on your grip now, too,\u201d Conny said. \u201cAnd you can start on crutches.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to go home, Conny. We should postpone until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil when?\u201d</p><p>She saw the understanding in his eyes. It shamed her to show such weakness to him. \u201cUntil I\u2019m ready,\u201d she finished lamely.</p><p>\u201cToday,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>After he left, she sat there, staring out at the sunshiny day, squeezing the ball he\u2019d left with her. I did it, Tami.</p><p>Yes, you did, flygirl.</p><p>Jolene would have sworn she heard the words, but no one was there. She looked out the window. Was that you, Tam? She wanted to believe in it, believe in the idea of her best friend finding a way to communicate across all these miles. Maybe it meant Tami had awakened ...</p><p>\u201cMrs. Zarkades?\u201d</p><p>She looked behind her. An orderly stood at the door, holding a few envelopes rubber-banded together.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He came into the room and put a pair of letters on the table beside her. She stared down at them, surprised. Finally, she picked up the packet and pulled out the top letter. It was from someone in Kansas.</p><p>Dear Jolene Zarkades:</p><p>I read about your story in the Topeka Gazette. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing to you\u2014a stranger\u2014but my heart won\u2019t let me say nothing.</p><p>I close my eyes and I think of you because I know how you\u2019re feeling.</p> <p>I was fourteen years old when I lost my leg. Just an ordinary girl from a small town, worrying about getting pimples and passing tests, and wondering when I would need a bra. Not a helicopter pilot or nothing cool like that.</p><p>Then I heard the word: cancer.</p><p>My mom cried more than I did. I was more worried about being different. I know you\u2019re probably strong, because you\u2019re in the army and all, but I wanted to make sure someone told you to be gentle with yourself. I wish I\u2019d known that. It took me a long time. You think life will never be normal again, but it will. You and your daughters will be fighting again in no time\u2014and about her chores or her choices. It won\u2019t be about your leg at all!</p><p>God bless. I have lit a candle for you and your family in my church. Our prayers go to you.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Mavis Sue Cochran</p><p>Topeka, KS</p><p>Jolene wiped her eyes and put the letter back in its envelope, then opened the second one.</p> <p>Chief,</p><p>I\u2019m PFC Sarah Merrin. I\u2019m at Walter Reed, after six months in-country.</p><p>I don\u2019t really know what to say or even why I\u2019m writing to you. I guess because it\u2019s quiet here now. And you\u2019re a woman.</p><p>I lost my leg last week. Now they\u2019re afraid I\u2019m going to lose the other leg. Infection in blast injuries is bad, but I guess you know that. I\u2019m going to be here a long time.</p><p>How do you do it? I guess that\u2019s what I want to know. They tell me I\u2019ll be able to walk again\u2014even run\u2014but it hardly seems likely and when I look down at what\u2019s left of me, it isn\u2019t pretty. Can\u2019t see my husband sticking around after I take my clothes off.</p><p>Any words of wisdom you got would sure be helpful.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Sarah Merrin</p><p>Jolene put the letter back in the envelope and stared down at it. She knew how Sarah felt, lying in her hospital bed, so far from home, wondering what part of herself she\u2019d get back and what she\u2019d lost forever.</p><p>But wisdom? Jolene had none to offer.</p><p>She would just add Sarah Merrin to the list of people she couldn\u2019t help, the people she\u2019d let down.</p><p>That night, after a long, grueling day at work, Michael left the office and drove to the rehab center. As he drove through the stop-and-go rush-hour traffic, he thought about the jury consultant he\u2019d met with today. They\u2019d begun voir dire proceedings\u2014jury selection\u2014in the Keller case. As every criminal defense attorney knew, cases could be won or lost before the trial even began. Jurors were crucial. He would need to find compassionate, liberal-minded people who believed that a good man\u2019s mind could be broken by war. The prosecution would be looking for hard-liners who thought psychiatric disorders were just excuses for criminality.</p><p>It was dark by the time he reached the rehab center. He parked close to the entrance and went inside. The minute the bright lights enveloped him, he let go of the Keller case and thought about his wife.</p><p>She was coming home tonight. Finally.</p><p>He hoped that now they could begin to really heal. Last night, he and the girls and his mother had spent hours readying the house for her return. They\u2019d placed flowers on every surface and filled the fridge with her favorite foods. His mother had spent all day in the kitchen with the girls, making baklava and moussaka; they\u2019d frosted a lemon cake and decorated it with fresh orchids. They\u2019d hung a banner across the front porch that read: WELCOME HOME TO OUR HERO! and moved the WELCOME HOME, MOMMY banner to the kitchen.</p><p>Betsy had spent hours decorating Jolene\u2019s new downstairs bedroom. There was a new bed and a bright new comforter and literally dozens of pillows to help her position her leg while she slept.</p><p>Everything was perfect.</p><p>At the rehab center, he walked down the brightly lit hallway to her room and found her sitting in her wheelchair, looking out the window.</p><p>She was as beautiful as ever in profile. The scrapes and bruises on her face were almost healed. The only scar remaining was a small pink slash along her jawline. She was frowning slightly, chewing on her thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cYou look nervous,\u201d he said, coming into the room.</p><p>She turned, saw him, and didn\u2019t smile. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>It was a surprise, that answer. Jolene had never shown fear or anxiety, not when her parents died, not when she gave birth, not even when she went off to war. All of that she\u2019d handled with the stoicism and courage that was as much a part of her as the green of her eyes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t really want to go home; he could see it in her eyes. It made him wonder sharply if he\u2019d lost her.</p><p>He wanted to say something real, but she looked so distant\u2014as if her composure were the thinnest of shells\u2014that he didn\u2019t dare. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d she said, turning the word into something foreign, a little frightening. \u201cMy things are in that duffle bag.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the big army-green duffle bag, carried it out to the car, and was back to get her in no time. Taking control of the chair, he wheeled her out of the rehab center. In the parking lot, he opened the car door and then turned to her.</p><p>Her pant leg fell away from the amputated leg like a flag in no wind. He stared down at it, wondering how he was supposed to lift her. Conny had never shown him. Could he touch her leg or would it hurt her?</p><p>For hours, Jolene had been imagining her homecoming. In her mind, she pictured it unfolding perfectly\u2014the girls laughing, her crying, Mila making them all some food. She\u2019d spent the last hour sitting in her chair, in the shadows of her room, telling herself she could do it, she could go home and be the woman she used to be.</p><p>Then, at the Lexus, she saw Michael hesitate. He couldn\u2019t even look at her leg, let alone touch it.</p><p>She gripped the chair\u2019s metal wheels and rolled past him, determined to climb into the passenger seat herself.</p><p>\u201cJolene, wait\u2014\u201d Michael said.</p><p>She ignored him, set the brake, and reached up for the side of the car. What should she hold on to? What would steady her the best? She hadn\u2019t practiced this with Conny.</p><p>\u201cLooks like soldier girl is trying to do everything all by herself. I thought we talked about that.\u201d</p><p>Conny crossed the parking lot and came toward them, his dreadlocks swinging. As he moved, he retied them in a ponytail.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jolene said when he stopped beside her.</p><p>\u201cYou sneaking out on me? I stayed late to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good-bye.\u201d She looked up, afraid suddenly to leave him, afraid to go home, where everything that she\u2019d lost would be so apparent. With Conny, effort was enough; at home, the expectations would be higher.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you three days a week.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, tilting her chin up. He knew how badly she wanted to be the mother she\u2019d once been, the woman she\u2019d once been\u2014and he knew, too, how scared she was that she would fail. They had talked and talked about it. Or rather, he had talked and she had listened.</p><p>He squatted down beside her, his knees popping in protest at the movement. \u201cEveryone is scared to go home,\u201d he said softly, so that Michael couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cIt\u2019s safe here.\u201d</p><p>He reached out for her left hand, held it in his dark baseball mitt of a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not tough enough for what comes next, soldier girl, \u2019cause I know better. It\u2019s a new beginning, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>It was true. She was tough enough. She always had been, from the moment she\u2019d realized that her parents were unreliable. She\u2019d learned to take care of herself. If she could survive her parents\u2019 deaths and Michael falling out of love with her and losing her leg and Smitty dying, she could handle going home ... she could love her babies again and be a new version of herself.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cBy this time next week I\u2019ll be playing lacrosse.\u201d</p><p>Conny grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d He patted her hand and stood up. \u201cTen o\u2019clock tomorrow. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d Conny said. \u201cHere\u2019s how you help our girl get into the car.\u201d</p><p>Jolene let Conny help her to a stand and then she pivoted on her foot and backed into the passenger seat with Conny\u2019s hand steadying her. She couldn\u2019t help noticing how her half leg stuck forward when she was seated.</p><p>Conny patted her shoulder one last time and closed the door.</p><p>Then it was just she and Michael, sitting in a car together. She didn\u2019t want to remember the look on his face in the parking lot, when it had been time to touch her, but what else could she think of?</p><p>He made small talk all the way home. She nodded and made listening sounds and stared out the window.</p><p>The familiarity of the landscape sucked her in, reminded her of the life they\u2019d shared in the shadow of these magnificent mountains; when they turned into their driveway and the headlights shone on their white fence, she thought: I\u2019m home, and for a split second the joy of that was pure and sweet and intoxicating. She forgot about her leg and her husband and her lost crewman and comatose best friend; she thought how lucky she was to be here at all. She still had what mattered most to her in the world: her daughters. And now, finally, she would be Mommy again.</p><p>There, just next door, was Tami\u2019s house. You should be there, Tam, she thought sadly.</p><p>As they drove up to the garage, the security light came on in a burst of brightness\u2014</p><p>And she was in the helicopter suddenly, turning back around to look at Smitty. All she could see was the gaping, smoking hole in his chest and the flatness of death in his eyes ...</p><p>\u201cJo? Jo?\u201d</p><p>She snapped back to the moment and found that she was shaking. Swallowing hard, she clasped her hands together to still them. A banner hung across the front door\u2014WELCOME HOME TO OUR HERO!</p><p>Hero. Heroes brought their people home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew then she was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cJo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said woodenly. \u201cThe banner is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey worked really hard on it.\u201d</p> <p>Michael pulled into the garage and parked; the overhead light came on. He went to the trunk of the car and wrestled her wheelchair to the ground and brought it to her side, then opened the door.</p><p>He looked at her and frowned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>No, she wanted to say, but she didn\u2019t know how, and she wouldn\u2019t have said it to him anyway. She gripped the car frame and pivoted on her butt, so that her legs were facing out. Michael moved in awkwardly, looked at her, and then slid his hand beneath her, anchoring her, helping her into the wheelchair. For that moment when he was in control of her body, she felt unsteady, but she made it.</p><p>He wheeled her into the house.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s home!\u201d Lulu shrieked, running down the stairs. Mila and Betsy came down behind her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, you\u2019re here!\u201d Lulu said, dancing. \u201cDid you see the stuff we made for you? Betsy? Let\u2019s show her the stuff we made for her. Are you hungry, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>Jolene gripped the rubberized handles of the wheelchair, tried to slow her racing heart. What was wrong with her? She wanted to be here, wanted it with every molecule in her body, and yet ...</p><p>\u201cShe looks weird,\u201d Betsy said, crossing her arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>Lulu walked up to her, cocking her head. \u201cYou care about all the stuff we did, don\u2019t you, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>Jolene forced a smile. \u201cOf course, Lulu. I can\u2019t wait to see everything. It\u2019s just...\u201d She looked around, saw the evidence of her former life, everything that had once mattered to her, and she couldn\u2019t make herself care about it. She felt numb and distant, a woman wrapped in gauze and peering out through the pale, sheer fabric, a ghost moving among the living.</p><p>Mila came over to her, bent down so they were eye to eye. She reached out, squeezed Jolene\u2019s hand, and said simply, \u201cYou\u2019re home.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene\u2019s eyes stung. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be here,\u201d she said in a tight voice.</p><p>\u201cRemember, your mom gets tired quickly,\u201d Michael said, coming up beside her.</p><p>\u201cIn ten minutes?\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>Jolene could feel the homecoming fraying around her. She\u2019d disappointed them instantly, despite her best intentions. Focus, Jo. Be the mom they expect. How would she have acted before? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wheel me around, Betsy and Lulu? Show me what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you aren\u2019t walking on your fake leg?\u201d Betsy asked.</p><p>\u201cConny thinks I should wait a while. Our floors might be uneven. I\u2019ll need to start slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Betsy sounded disappointed at that. No doubt because she wanted a mother who looked normal, at least. Betsy positioned herself behind the wheelchair; Lulu tucked herself against its side. For the next hour, they rolled her through the house, showing her the changes they\u2019d made for her\u2014the food in the fridge, the cake on the counter, the banner on the wall, and a new bedroom in what had once been Michael\u2019s office. All through dinner, Lulu never stopped talking.</p><p>By eight o\u2019clock, Jolene could barely keep her eyes open. She had a pounding headache, and her stump hurt so badly she had trouble concentrating. Twice Betsy had accidently banged her into the door frame.</p> <p>\u201cQuit sleeping, Mommy,\u201d Lulu demanded. \u201cI\u2019m showing you your new nightgown. See?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like that\u2019s important,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care about any of it.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I do care. I\u2019m a little tired.\u201d</p><p>Mila stood up from the sofa. \u201cCome on, girls, upstairs. Time to get ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mommy,\u201d Lulu said. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how I brush my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls,\u201d Michael said. \u201cYour mom has had a long day. Just kiss her good night.\u201d</p><p>Lulu looked like she was about to cry. \u201cIsn\u2019t she coming up to read us a story?\u201d</p><p>Betsy rolled her eyes. \u201cWheelchair, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lulu pouted. \u201cI am not liking any of this.\u201d</p><p>Jolene opened her arms. \u201cCome here, Lucy Lou.\u201d</p><p>Her youngest daughter scrambled up into her lap; it hurt. Jolene gritted her teeth and hoped her grimace looked like a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to go upstairs someday. Just not yet, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-kay,\u201d Lulu said, drawing the word out to show her displeasure. Betsy mumbled good night and left the room. Mila took Lulu\u2019s hand and led her up the stairs.</p><p>Jolene let out her breath. She was in the open doorway to her new bedroom. All that was left of the previous d\u00e9cor was Michael\u2019s old college desk, tucked in beneath the window, with his computer on it. The door to the en suite bathroom had been widened; the molding hadn\u2019t yet been replaced, so it was bracketed by raw wood.</p><p>An antique queen-sized bed filled the center of the room. Bright pink and yellow Hawaiian bedding attested to the girls\u2019 shopping trip. There were several down pillows scattered about and a thick white blanket lay folded at the foot.</p><p>She could see how hard they\u2019d worked to welcome her home, and she wanted to be moved by it, but, honestly, all she felt was tired. It had only been a few hours and already she\u2019d disappointed them.</p><p>She heard Michael come up beside her. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let the girls badger you so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were so excited to have you home.\u201d</p><p>Jolene could barely say, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d All she wanted now was to be left alone. She had failed tonight. Failed.</p><p>\u201cI added a bunch of handicapped stuff to the bathroom in there\u2014railings and handles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her half leg, sticking out there, ending in a flap of fallen material and then looked quickly away. \u201cIf you need help...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Michael. Your duty ends at the bedroom door. I can handle myself from here,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair?\u201d That pissed her off. \u201cNone of this is fair, Michael.\u201d She gripped the wheelchair and rolled away from him. She was almost to the bathroom door when he said her name. She stopped, looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to sleep with you? In case you need something?\u201d</p><p>In case I need something. How romantic. \u201cNo, Michael. I\u2019d rather be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t say that right. Maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Michael,\u201d she said firmly, rolling into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.</p><p>She told herself she wasn\u2019t disappointed as she set the brake and stood up, gripping the tile counter for support.</p><p>It took forever to brush her teeth and wash her face. She was so tired, she kept losing her concentration and her balance. Once she almost fell over. When she looked at the toilet, she felt a wave of exhaustion. Gritting her teeth, she hopped over to it, grateful for the side rails Michael had installed. She gripped it in her one good hand and lowered herself to the seat, realizing too late that she still had her pants on. She sat there a minute, too tired to move, then slowly she stood. It was harder than she\u2019d anticipated to unzip her pants and pull them down without falling, but she did it, finally.</p><p>Who would have thought it was so damned hard to go to the bathroom? Welcome home, Jo.</p><p>While she was seated, she pulled off her top and bra and slipped into the floor-length flannel nightgown the girls had bought for her. After that, she got carefully to her feet.</p><p>Foot. Unsteady, she grabbed the counter again and caught sight of her reflection in the mirror above the sink. Cautiously, she turned to look.</p><p>Her face was disturbingly thin, her cheekbones high and sharp. The bruises and scrapes had healed; the only sign of her accident was the small pink scar along her jaw.</p><p>Her accident.</p><p>Would she think or it every time she looked in the mirror? And why shouldn\u2019t she? With a sigh, she turned away. She didn\u2019t know the woman in that mirror anymore.</p><p>It took another decade to get out of the bathroom, and when she wheeled back into the room, she saw Michael standing at the door, looking worried.</p><p>Before she could even try to do it herself, he was beside her, helping her into the bed. The minute she lay down, she felt the starch drain out of her. She sank into the softness with a sigh. He helped her position pillows around her residual leg.</p><p>\u201cYour sleeping and pain pills are right there, on the nightstand. And your water. And a sandwich, in case you get hungry.\u201d</p><p>He brushed the hair out of her eyes.</p><p>She hated how her body reacted to his touch. It had always been that way for her, from the beginning. Even now, as tired as she was, she found herself being drawn to him.</p><p>Dangerous, Jo.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to talk about us, you know,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about, Michael. You said it all before I left. Now let me sleep, I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her so long she thought he was going to say something else. But in the end, he left her alone in the room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>As tired as she was, Jolene couldn\u2019t fall asleep. She felt as if she\u2019d drunk a carafe of espresso; her whole body was taut, her nerves jangling. It was so quiet here\u2014too quiet. No mortars falling, exploding; no alarms blaring or helicopters taking off or men talking. It scared her, all this quiet, and that was wrong. She was home. She shouldn\u2019t even be thinking about Iraq anymore.</p><p>She lay in the new bed, on the new sheets, in her new room, and all she felt was achingly, frighteningly out of place. Every noise in the house upset her fragile equilibrium. At every sound, she jackknifed up, her heart pounding, listening.</p><p>The last time she looked at the clock, it was three thirty. When she finally fell asleep, the nightmare was waiting for her.</p><p>Tami! We\u2019ve got to establish a perimeter ... Smitty ... Jamie, help Smitty ...</p><p>She woke up, heart pounding, sweating. A bleary-eyed glance at the clock showed it to be five thirty. She threw the covers back and started to get out of bed.</p><p>And remembered: she\u2019d lost her leg. She stared down at it, still swollen and wrapped in gauze and bandages. Closing her eyes, she flopped back into the mound of pillows and sighed. Somewhere, on the other side of the world, her best friend lay in a bed, too ...</p><p>Outside, not far away, a coyote howled. Upstairs, the floorboards creaked, then a toilet flushed. She wasn\u2019t the only one awake.</p><p>As she lay in bed alone, she tried to draw strength from what she had left. She was home; she was a mother. For the first time in months, she could focus on her children and be the mother she\u2019d once been to them, the mother they needed. Tami would kick her ass for giving up.</p><p>She could do it. She could. Today was the day she would reclaim her life and herself.</p><p>She imagined herself making them breakfast, getting them off to school, kissing them good-bye for the day.</p><p>That was her last conscious thought. The next thing she knew, she was waking up again, and beyond her window, the world was pale and gray, rainy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first day of her new life. She sat up in bed, looking longingly at the crutches leaning against the wall. She wished she was ready to use them, but Conny had been adamant that she wasn\u2019t ready for them in the house yet. Too many hidden dangers. She maneuvered into her wheelchair and rolled into the bathroom. Again, it was a struggle. She balanced on one foot and brushed her teeth and washed her face, then hopped over to the toilet. By the time she was dressed and ready for the day, she was tired. Settling into her wheelchair, she rolled out into the family room and found the remote.</p><p>She turned on the TV and flipped to CNN, waiting for any news on the troops.</p><p>Michael came downstairs, carrying Lulu, who was chatting animatedly about something.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re up,\u201d Michael said. He was already dressed for work.</p> <p>\u201cPut me down!\u201d Lulu squealed, wiggling in his arms. As soon as she hit the ground, she ran over to Jolene, accidentally bumping into her residual leg. It hurt so bad Jolene cursed before she could stop herself.</p><p>Lulu stopped dead, her eyes widening. \u201cYou said a bad word, Mommy. Daddy! Mommy said a bad word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jolene said grimly.</p><p>\u201cWhat does everyone want for breakfast?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>Jolene looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll make them breakfast and get them off to school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s too much work for you, Jo. Take it easy. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, hearing the pleading tone in her voice and unable to temper it. \u201cI need this, Michael. I have to get into my life again. I can handle making my two girls breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He eyed her as if she were a bomb that might go off. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure about what?\u201d Betsy said, coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYour mom is going to make you girls breakfast and help you get ready for school,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>\u201cShe is?\u201d Betsy said, clearly suspicious of Jolene\u2019s ability.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s definitely special,\u201d Lulu said, eyeing Jolene as if she were unsure about this whole turn of events. \u201cCap\u2019n Crunch.\u201d</p><p>Betsy groaned.</p><p>\u201cYou sure, Jo? Because I can do it.\u201d Michael asked again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girls catch the bus these days. They know the times,\u201d he said.</p><p>Another change. It was just as well. Jolene could hardly drive carpool.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I have voir dire today, so I\u2019ll be in court most of the day. Mom is going to pick you up for PT in an hour. I\u2019ll be home no later than six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never get home by six.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople change, Jo,\u201d he said, giving her a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cKiss Mommy good-bye,\u201d Lulu said when he picked up his coat.</p><p>Michael and Jolene looked at each other. Then he moved toward her, leaned down slowly.</p><p>The kiss he gave her was butterfly light. The kind of kiss a man would give an old woman, or a dying one.</p><p>From her chair, she watched him leave the house. When she heard his car start up, she snapped out of it. \u201cOkay, girls, go get dressed for school. I\u2019ll have breakfast ready in no time.\u201d</p><p>She rolled into the kitchen, surprised to realize how small it was from chair level. There was barely room for her to maneuver, and the counters were too high; she couldn\u2019t reach them easily.</p><p>She was still trying to figure out the logistics when the girls returned to the kitchen and sat down at the table. Jolene glanced at her calendar, the one she\u2019d left for Michael. Today was oatmeal and wheat toast with sliced bananas.</p><p>She climbed out of the chair and clung to the counter with one hand while she tried to dig through the cabinet for a pan. The clanging of metal got on her nerves, made her think of gunfire and cement cracking ...</p><p>\u201cYou want help, Mom?\u201d Betsy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cI can make a damn pot of oatmeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, excuse me,\u201d Betsy said, stung.</p><p>\u201cMommy said a bad word again,\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>Jolene found the pot, grabbed it, and looked over at the sink. There was no more than ten feet between her and the faucet, but the distance seemed to swell before her eyes. God, how she wanted to just walk over there like she used to, laughing with her girls as she cooked.</p><p>Instead, she gritted her teeth, lowered herself to the chair and wheeled herself to the sink. There, she climbed to her feet again, turned on the water, and held the pot under the faucet.</p><p>Blood spurted out, poured down the soldier\u2019s face. Jolene yelled, \u201cSmitty, get the medic, this man isn\u2019t going to make it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s seven fifty-seven,\u201d Betsy said sharply.</p><p>Jolene came back to the present. She wasn\u2019t in Iraq, flying a medevac mission. She was in her kitchen. She looked down; the pot was overflowing with water.</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jolene said. She turned off the water and set the pot on the counter. Pivoting on her foot, she repositioned the wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cDad has oatmeal ready by now,\u201d Betsy added.</p><p>Jolene grabbed for the pot without thinking, using her right hand. It happened in an instant, her losing her grip, but she saw it in slow motion: the grab, the turn, the fingers failing her, opening, the pot falling ...</p><p>It hit with a clang.</p><p>\u201cYou got water all over me!\u201d Betsy screamed, scrambling back from the table. \u201cOh my God. I have to change\u2014\u201d She ran out of the room.</p><p>Jolene slumped into her chair.</p><p>\u201cYou made a mess, Mommy,\u201d Lulu said, frowning. \u201cThe floor looks like a lake.\u201d</p><p>Jolene just sat there, stunned.</p><p>\u201cMommy? You made a mess,\u201d Lulu said again, sounding scared. \u201cI want my daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gives a shit?\u201d Jolene snapped.</p><p>Lulu started to cry. \u201cI want my daddy NOW!\u201d</p><p>Betsy came back downstairs, dressed now in jeans and a white hoodie. She picked Lulu up. They stared down at Jolene.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Betsy said to her mother.</p><p>\u201cWell what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Jolene felt bitterness well up. She wanted to hold it back, be a good mother, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself. The anger and edginess overtook her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d She held back from screaming do you not see?</p><p>Outside, the school bus chugged up to the driveway, gearing down to a stop.</p><p>Betsy screamed and dropped Lulu, who hit the ground hard and started to cry. \u201cShe hurt me! She hurt me!\u201d</p><p>Betsy ran to the kitchen door and flung it open. \u201cWait! Wait!\u201d</p><p>But it was too late. Jolene heard the bus driving away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d Betsy shrieked, stomping over to her. \u201cNow I\u2019ll have to walk into first period late. Everyone will stare at me.\u201d</p><p>Lulu wailed. \u201cI\u2019m hungry. I want my daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Betsy demanded. \u201cAre you just going to sit there?\u201d</p><p>That did it. Jolene grabbed the chair\u2019s wheels and spun around. \u201cWhat the hell did you say to me? Believe me, being late to school is not a tragedy, Betsy.\u201d She lifted her residual leg up. It twitched upward; the empty pant leg did a little dance. \u201cThis is a tragedy. Make your sister breakfast. Yia Yia will be here in a little while. She can take you to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d be fine,\u201d Betsy yelled, her cheeks pink. \u201cBut you\u2019re not. You can\u2019t even take care of us. Why did you even come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a spoiled brat.\u201d Jolene gripped the wheels and rolled away from them. As soon as she was in the office, she slammed the door shut. Getting up, she hopped over to the bed and fell into it with a groan.</p><p>She wanted to call her best friend, say I just yelled at my daughter and she yelled at me. Tell me I\u2019m not a bitch ... tell me she is ... tell me I\u2019m going to be okay ...</p><p>Through the closed door, she could hear Lulu\u2019s crying. Betsy was trying to soothe her. They were probably huddled together, looking at the closed door, wondering who in the hell the woman behind it was. They knew their mom hadn\u2019t come home from war. Not really. The woman who\u2019d come home was a stranger to all of them, herself most of all.</p><p>I want my daddy.</p><p>When had Lulu ever wanted comfort from Michael?</p><p>It was yet another change. While Jolene had been gone, the heart of her family had shifted. She\u2019d become marginalized, unimportant. Michael was the parent who comforted and cared for them now. The parent they trusted.</p><p>She heard a knock at the door and ignored it.</p><p>The door opened. Mila came into the room. She was dressed for work in jeans and an oversized denim shirt and the green canvas apron. Her black hair was hidden beneath a blue and white bandanna. She walked toward the bed, sat down on its edge. Leaning forward, she brushed the tangled hair from Jolene\u2019s eyes. \u201cA warrior doesn\u2019t run to her bedroom and hide out after one lost battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a warrior anymore, Mila. Or a wife, or a mother. In fact, who the hell am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been so hard on yourself, Jolene. So you\u2019re having a hard time and you dropped a pan of water and you yelled at your daughters. Big deal. I yelled at Michael all the time when he was a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t used to yell at them,\u201d Jolene said quietly, feeling a tightening in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI know. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re scared of me now,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cI\u2019m scared of me.\u201d</p><p>Mila gave her a knowing smile. \u201cWe all knew it would be hard to have you gone, but no one told us how hard it would be when you came back. We\u2019ll have to adjust. All of us. And you\u2019ll have to cut yourself some slack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been good at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. Now, get up and get dressed. We\u2019re leaving for PT in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going today. I don\u2019t feel well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going,\u201d Mila said simply.</p><p>Jolene thought about making a scene, getting angry, but she was too worn-out and depressed to do anything but comply.</p><p>Michael spent most of the day in court, questioning potential jurors. Of one person after another he asked probing questions, trying to get to the heart of bias. When court was adjourned for the day, he returned to his office and worked for an hour or so on his opening statement.</p><p>He knew the prosecutor\u2019s opening in the Keller trial would be matter-of-fact. Brad would begin with the damning facts of the murder, repeating often how Emily had trusted her husband and loved him and how Keith had shot her in the head. He\u2019d hammer home that Keith had never denied shooting his wife. He\u2019d lay out the forensics of the case, layer fact upon fact until the jury would more than halfway believe that there was no reason for them to be there. They would be told that Keith\u2019s memory loss was \u201cconvenient\u201d and no doubt a bald-faced lie. He\u2019d probably close with something along the lines of: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to forget that he\u2019d shot his young wife in the head? Well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I\u2019ll tell you who won\u2019t forget.\u201d Then he\u2019d turn to Emily\u2019s weeping parents. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell them their daughter\u2019s murderer will go free. Do you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Usually, Michael would refute every piece of evidence in the opening, try to plant doubt about the case both in its specifics and in its entirety.</p><p>In this case, however, Michael was going to take a calculated risk. He wouldn\u2019t refute that Keith had killed his wife. What he wanted the jury to understand was why. In Washington State, it fell to the state to prove each element of the crime, including intent. Put simply, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Keith had intended to kill his wife.</p><p>Intent.</p><p>That was the crux of it.</p> <p>He was still mulling it over at five thirty, as he drove off the ferry and headed toward home. As he turned into his driveway, he wondered how Jolene\u2019s day had gone. For once, Mila wouldn\u2019t be here, taking care of the girls after school. They were with Jolene again for the first time.</p><p>Pandemonium greeted him.</p><p>Every light in the place was on, the TV was blaring some movie with teenyboppers dancing together, and the girls were fighting. He could tell by the wild look in Lulu\u2019s eyes that she was seconds away from a screaming fit, and Betsy looked pissed.</p><p>At his entrance, they stopped shrieking at each other and started screaming at him.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d he said, raising his hands. \u201cSlow down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMommy doesn\u2019t like us anymore,\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>\u201cShe was a bitch, Dad. I know that\u2019s a bad word, but it\u2019s true,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cAnd now she\u2019s in her room and she won\u2019t come out. When I went in, she said, \u2018Not now, Betsy.\u2019 She hasn\u2019t even apologized for this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning? What happened this morning?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe were late to school. We missed the bus,\u201d Betsy said, her voice shrill with the remembered horror of it.</p><p>\u201cShe dropped the water for oatmeal and said a bad word,\u201d Lulu added solemnly, her mouth trembling. She was seconds away from crying.</p><p>\u201cNow, girls, you remember we talked about this. It isn\u2019t going to be an easy transition. We\u2019ve talked about being patient, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, you should have talked to her about it. I even offered to help with breakfast and everything,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with her, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Through the blustery anger, he heard his daughter\u2019s fear, and he understood it. Jolene wasn\u2019t the same woman she\u2019d been before, and none of them knew quite how to deal with her. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Dad? I\u2019m sick of hearing that. It\u2019s a big fat lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s different,\u201d Lulu whispered, crying now. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even talk to us after school.\u201d</p><p>Michael knelt down and opened his arms. The girls ran at him, throwing themselves into his embrace. He held them tightly.</p><p>When they finally drew back, Michael saw the tears in Betsy\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Betsy. I know she hurt your feelings\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too!\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>\u201cBoth of your feelings,\u201d he corrected. \u201cBut just think of how bad it feels when you get a cut or a bruise. She lost her leg. It\u2019s going to take a while for everything to get back to normal. I should have prepared you for that. Hell, I should have prepared myself for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said a bad word,\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Word Police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she never gets better?\u201d Betsy asked.</p><p>\u201cShe will,\u201d he promised. Then he kissed each daughter\u2019s cheek. \u201cNow, go order a pizza, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might as well still be gone,\u201d Betsy mumbled, walking away.</p><p>Michael went over to the office. Knocking softly, he waited for an answer. Not getting one, he opened the door just a crack.</p><p>The room was dark. Pale gold light from the eaves outside provided an ambient glow, illuminating the sharpness of her cheekbone. Beside the bed, the silver handles of the wheelchair glinted like strands of mercury. On the nightstand was an opened bottle of wine and an empty glass.</p><p>Frowning, he went to her bedside, stood beside her. In all their years together, he\u2019d never seen her take more than a sip of wine. He picked up the bottle\u2014it was half empty, at least.</p><p>He wanted to wake her up, talk to her about what had happened today\u2014why she was drinking wine\u2014but he knew how precious sleep was to her.</p><p>And would she talk to him about it, anyway? Even before the deployment, back when their marriage had been intact, Jolene wasn\u2019t one to talk about bad days or failures or disappointments. With the exception of love, which she showed exuberantly, she kept her emotions to herself.</p><p>It was part of why they\u2019d gone so wrong. She\u2019d never needed him.</p><p>He closed the door and left her alone.</p><p>He spent the evening with his daughters, eating dinner with them, playing a game, watching a Discovery Channel special on dolphins. They were still hurt and angry and confused when he put them to bed.</p><p>When the house was quiet again, he put on some sweats and went back to work on the Keller opening. The trial was set to start soon, and he still hadn\u2019t figured out how to make the jurors really understand PTSD, how to put them in Keith\u2019s shoes. He was making a note about that when a bloodcurdling scream echoed through the house.</p><p>He threw the papers aside and ran out of his room. Another scream rose up from downstairs, swelling, spiking.</p><p>He ran down the stairs and pushed open the office door.</p><p>Jolene was screaming in her sleep, writhing so much the sheets and blankets had come free of their moorings and were twisted around her. Pillows lay scattered on the floor.</p><p>She screamed, \u201cMayday! Tami\u2014I can\u2019t lift you. Damn it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a perimeter,\u201d she yelled, crawling across the bed toward the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cJo!\u201d He grabbed her by the hand and she elbowed him hard in the gut. His breath rushed out and he let go for a second. She kept moving, toward the edge of the bed.</p><p>He lunged at her so she wouldn\u2019t fall off, put his arms around her. She punched him in the eye so hard he lost his balance, and they fell to the floor together, landing with a thud.</p><p>She came awake with a gasp, frowned in confusion. \u201cMichael?\u201d</p><p>Betsy and Lulu stood in the doorway, looking terrified.</p><p>\u201cWHAT\u2019S WRONG WITH HER?\u201d Betsy shrieked.</p><p>Jolene was shaking; he could feel her trembling.</p><p>\u201cYour mom had a nightmare, girls. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare?\u201d Betsy shook her head. \u201cDo we look stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs,\u201d Michael said, helping Jolene stand. She was breathing like a freight train beside him. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I sleep with you?\u201d Lulu asked her sister. There was a tremble in her voice.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Betsy took Lulu\u2019s hand and led her away.</p><p>Jolene climbed into bed and leaned back against the headboard so hard it banged against the wall. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d she said shakily.</p><p>He sat down beside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having ... trouble, Michael,\u201d she said, swallowing hard.</p><p>It was the closest Jolene could come to asking for help. \u201cI know, Jo. We\u2019ll get you some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they safe with me?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to say yes, sure, of course they are, but he was sitting here, his eye throbbing from a punch she probably didn\u2019t remember throwing, feeling his wife tremble beside him. And the truth was, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>The next morning, Jolene was up before Michael.</p><p>He found her in the family room. She had a mirror set up at one end, and she was walking in front of it, studying her gait, trying to walk as naturally as she had before.</p><p>As he watched from the doorway, she tripped, fell hard, and cursed.</p><p>He went to her side, reaching out. \u201cJo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to do this myself,\u201d she said through gritted teeth, shoving his hand aside. \u201cI have to be me again.\u201d</p><p>He heard the desperation in her voice and saw the fear in her eyes, and he drew back. It actually hurt to watch her climb to a stand and waver, grab the back of the chair for support.</p><p>She fell three more times while he stood there. Each time, she curled her good hand into a fist, breathed hard, and got back to her feet. She didn\u2019t curse again, didn\u2019t say a thing about her pain. And he knew it had to hurt like hell; Conny had told him she\u2019d been working so hard she had blisters on her stump.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d he said when she made a good pass and an apparently easy turn.</p><p>She smiled at him, but he saw past her can-do attitude and was startled by the sadness in her eyes. He saw what it cost her to fall, to trip, to need help with the simplest things. She frowned. \u201cYou have a black eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery Jack Sparrow, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose, Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said tiredly.</p><p>He saw how fragile she was, how scared by the idea that she had hurt him\u2014and that she didn\u2019t remember doing it. He wanted to talk to her about the nightmares, but she\u2019d just put up one of her walls, and how could he scale it? He had no idea what she\u2019d been through in Iraq. What would he even ask?</p><p>The girls came running down the stairs. At the sight of Jolene, they stopped so fast Betsy shoved Lulu forward.</p><p>\u201cGirls,\u201d Jolene said, looking as sad as he\u2019d ever seen her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about last night. It was just a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare that gave Dad a black eye,\u201d Betsy said tightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Honest. I just need to try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Lulu said. \u201cDaddy, are you going to make us breakfast this morning?\u201d</p><p>Michael saw Jolene\u2019s reaction to that. She looked disappointed; her shoulders slumped. She turned and limped away, walking resolutely toward the mirror again.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Michael said, \u201clet\u2019s get breakfast going.\u201d He ushered the girls into the kitchen, made them breakfast, and then followed them upstairs, where they got ready for school. \u201cTell your mom good-bye,\u201d he said as they headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cBye, Mom,\u201d they said dutifully together. They didn\u2019t look at Jolene, and she kept walking toward the mirror, gauging her gait. Michael walked them both to the end of the driveway and stayed until the buses came to take them away. Then he returned to the house. When he approached Jolene, he saw the sadness in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, touching her arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nice to me this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>And there it was: the reminder of how far apart they\u2019d drifted. She didn\u2019t want to be comforted by him, even now when she was terrified and depressed and her heart was breaking.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jo, it\u2019s time to leave for rehab\u201d was what he ended up saying. It was all he could think of.</p><p>On the ferry, she didn\u2019t want to leave the car. So they sat there in silence until Michael looked at her. \u201cIt must have been terrible over there,\u201d he said tentatively, feeling like a fraud. He had no idea, and both of them knew it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTerrible? Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you scared all the time?\u201d</p><p>She stared out the car window. \u201cNot all the time. I don\u2019t want to talk about this, Michael. It doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home, Jo,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She nodded but didn\u2019t look at him. Neither did she speak again on the drive through Seattle. She just stared out the car window and shrugged in answer to his questions.</p><p>When he dropped her off, he said, \u201cJo? We need to really talk about all this, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI know.\u201d She sounded exhausted by the very idea of it.</p><p>He watched her limp into the rehab center and then he drove away. Instead of going straight to his office, he turned onto Aurora and drove to Cornflower\u2019s office.</p><p>There, he walked up to the desk, saw the girl with the hardware all over her face and the purple hair. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t call. But I\u2019d like to see Chris, if that\u2019s possible. I\u2019m Michael Zarkades.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, \u201cjust a sec.\u201d She got up and walked down the hall. A minute or two later, she was back. \u201cHe\u2019ll see you in the sunroom. It\u2019s that way.\u201d</p><p>Michael followed the hallway out to a pretty little glass-walled sunroom decorated in 1950s rattan furniture and overflowing with greenery and flowers. It reminded him a little of his parents\u2019 living room, with its wide-plank wooden floors and floral cushioned furniture. A framed, yellowed poster of \u201cDesiderata\u201d hung on the only solid wall. Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. He couldn\u2019t help smiling. His mother had once had the very same poster on her bedroom wall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have long, Michael,\u201d Chris said, closing the door behind him. \u201cA patient will be here in ten minutes. Is it Keith? Are the nightmares getting worse?\u201d</p><p>Michael sat down in one of the floral cushioned chairs. \u201cIt\u2019s my wife, Chris. She\u2019s ... different. Last night she drank a few glasses of wine\u2014I know that doesn\u2019t sound like much, but her parents were alcoholics. I\u2019ve never seen Jolene have more than a few sips of alcohol. And she woke up screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe give you that shiner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always had a hell of an arm. You should see her pitch.\u201d</p> <p>Chris smiled and sat down. \u201cObviously, we need more than ten minutes for this discussion. I\u2019d be happy to talk to Jolene if she\u2019d do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a big talker in that way, but she did say she was in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a soldier, Michael, which means she won\u2019t want to appear weak, and it will be difficult for her to admit that she\u2019s having trouble adjusting. As you know, nightmares and trouble sleeping are common symptoms of PTSD, but they\u2019re also a normal reaction to having been at war. In most cases, these nightmares will diminish over time. We really need to worry if she\u2019s still experiencing acute symptoms in three months. But she\u2019s going through a lot of emotions right now\u2014she\u2019s probably grieving over her lost crewman and her comatose friend; she\u2019s probably feeling some guilt\u2014misplaced\u2014that it\u2019s her fault the bird went down; she\u2019s probably afraid that your family is irrevocably broken and that she doesn\u2019t have the strength to hold you all together again. Add to that the fact that she\u2019s lost her leg and most likely her career, and you have a woman in crisis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how do I help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe feels like she\u2019s coming apart,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou think you\u2019re one person, and then suddenly you\u2019re not. You don\u2019t know who you are. And the nightmares can be absolutely terrifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure there are no weapons in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd watch her drinking very carefully. That can really exacerbate the problems she\u2019s having. Mostly, Michael, get her to talk to you. Listen without being judgmental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo and I have never been particularly good at talking.\u201d</p><p>Chris gave him an understanding nod. \u201cThis would be a good time to change that, Michael.\u201d</p><p>On the ride home from rehab, Jolene wanted to talk to Mila, but she couldn\u2019t form the words. She kept reliving last night, when she\u2019d woken from her nightmare, on the floor, screaming, with her children staring down at her in fear. It was eating her up inside; it had been all day. She\u2019d barely been able to concentrate in PT.</p><p>What in the hell was wrong with her? She needed Tami more than ever. The thought of that only made her feel worse.</p><p>As they pulled up to the house, Mila turned to her. \u201cAre you okay, Jolene? You\u2019re awful quiet.\u201d</p><p>She imagined herself saying I\u2019m afraid, Mila, something\u2019s wrong with me, but she couldn\u2019t do it. She was terrified of opening the floodgates, of revealing the depth of her fear. For the first time in her life, she was really, truly afraid. More afraid than she\u2019d been in Iraq.</p><p>\u201cRehab was a bearcat today. The blisters are killing me.\u201d She smiled tightly, hating the lie.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay with you until the girls come home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m getting better. Honestly. I\u2019ll take a nap and then I\u2019ll be stronger. I\u2019ll have snacks ready for them when they get home from school. Maybe we\u2019ll play a board game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mila said hesitantly.</p><p>Jolene managed a smile. Giving her mother-in-law a quick kiss, she got out of the car and went into the house. When the door closed behind her, she sagged forward on her crutches, and finally released the breath she\u2019d been holding.</p><p>She needed a glass of wine. That would calm her jagged nerves, still the trembling in her hands. Just one glass. There was nothing wrong with that.</p><p>Her hands were shaking again. She went to the refrigerator, poured herself a glass of wine, and sat down. By the time she\u2019d drunk two glasses, she felt slightly better. The wired feeling had dissipated somewhat. But the fear remained.</p><p>She needed help.</p><p>There. She\u2019d thought it. Nothing mattered more than her children, and she was losing them, pushing them away, frightening them. She\u2019d punched her husband in the face and didn\u2019t remember doing it. What could she do to her children? She went to the phone. After a quick look in the phone book, she dialed the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p>\u201cI think I need to talk to someone,\u201d she blurted out when the receptionist answered.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an OIF vet. Injured. I need to talk to someone about the nightmares I\u2019m having.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a sec.\u201d</p><p>Breathe, Jolene. Don\u2019t hang up.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d a man said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes. I hope so. I\u2019m a returning Operation Iraqi Freedom vet, and I\u2019m having some trouble sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking of hurting yourself or others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? On purpose? No. No, of course not, but I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make you an appointment with a counselor.\u201d</p><p>She sighed in relief. \u201cThat would be great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is December fifteenth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did you say December fifteenth? It\u2019s October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s how long the wait is. We\u2019re backlogged. A lot of returning soldiers need help. If you\u2019re thinking of hurting yourself, however...\u201d</p><p>She knew what would happen if she answered in the affirmative. They\u2019d stamp whacko on her file. \u201cNo. Thank you. I don\u2019t need the December appointment. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine by then.\u201d She hung up the phone and sat there.</p><p>Her phantom pain was back, twisting her ankle hard.</p><p>She made her way to the family room and collapsed on the sofa, trying to gut it out. Sweat itched across her scalp. She closed her eyes and concentrated on breathing through the pain.</p><p>Later, a knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. She came awake sharply. How long had she been asleep? Were the girls home already? She glanced at the clock. It was only three. She got up, retrieved her crutches, and limped slowly to the front door, opening it.</p><p>Ben Lomand stood on her porch, holding a bouquet of flowers.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d she said, smiling for the first time in days. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you, come in.\u201d She led the way back into the family room and sat down on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI came to see how you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said, sitting beside her. \u201cMichael said you\u2019d be home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting better every day,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>She steeled herself. \u201cHave you spoken to Smitty\u2019s parents?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAt the funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they blame me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Jolene. They know their son was a hero and that he died serving his country. They\u2019re proud of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to get to him.\u201d</p><p>They fell silent, each knowing there was nothing to say.</p><p>\u201cJolene,\u201d the captain said at last, a pained look on his face. \u201cI\u2019ve got some news for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your physical profile from Captain Sands in Landstuhl. It assesses your FFD.\u201d</p><p>FFD. Fitness for duty.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said softly. With all that had happened in the past weeks, she\u2019d forgotten about her career. About flying.</p><p>How could she have forgotten? \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pilot,\u201d he said, his eyes filled with compassion. Maybe some soldiers could fulfill their job assignments with one leg. Not a pilot.</p><p>He was going to say she could never fly again. She closed her eyes for just a moment, feeling as great a pain as her missing leg. \u201cI don\u2019t meet the retention criteria,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t. I only have one leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could appeal. Go on probation, see if you could meet the criteria for duty after rehab.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cThey won\u2019t let me fly again, though, will they?\u201d</p><p>The answer was in his eyes. \u201cNo. No flight status. But you could stay in the Guard maybe. Or if you retire, you\u2019ll have full benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenefits,\u201d she said softly, trying to imagine her life without the military, without her friends, without flying ... but she was a pilot. A pilot. How could she be in the Guard and not fly?</p><p>What was left to her now?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jo.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, looked away before he could see the sadness in her eyes. \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d she said in a thick voice.</p><p>After he left, she grabbed the bottle of wine and went into her bedroom.</p><p>The ferry was docking on Bainbridge Island when Michael\u2019s cell phone rang. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Zarkades? This is Principal Warner, from the middle school. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s been an incident with Betsy.\u201d</p><p>The ferry banged into the dock; stilled. He started up his car. \u201cWhat? An incident, did you say? What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy was in a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a fistfight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he said, hanging up. He followed the line of cars off the boat and across the ramp and up onto the road. Out on the highway, he hit the gas.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, he pulled up in front of the middle school and parked. Inside, the bright white walls were decorated with dozens of Science Fair and History Day banners. In the principal\u2019s office, he found Betsy in the waiting room, her arms crossed tightly, her mouth pressed in a flat line. At his appearance, she looked up, her eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave her the Hand and kept walking. At the front desk, he introduced himself and was led into the principal\u2019s office.</p> <p>Principal Warner, a petite, pretty woman with kind eyes, noticed his black eye and frowned.</p><p>\u201cI fell off my bike,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>She smiled, but only a little. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we had to call you. We\u2019re all aware of the struggles your family is currently facing. Please, sit.\u201d</p><p>He sat down. \u201cShe got in a fight? With whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra Phillips and Zoe Wimerann. From what I hear, they were teasing her about her mother. It seems Sierra\u2019s dad made some comments about women\u2019s ability to fly helicopters, and Zoe responded by laughing. Betsy swung the first punch.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed. No wonder Seth called them the bitchwolves. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of water under the bridge with these girls. Beyond that, Betsy\u2019s having some issues dealing with her mother\u2019s return. It hasn\u2019t gone as smoothly as we\u2019d expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer teachers tell me she\u2019s been acting out in the past few days. Snapping at friends and not turning in her homework. We have an excellent school counselor, if you\u2019d like her to see someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Principal Warner. I\u2019ll let you know if that becomes necessary. And now, I\u2019d like to speak to my daughter, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cCertainly. And ... how is Jolene?\u201d</p><p>Michael didn\u2019t know how to answer that. He was getting sick and tired of pretending that everything was fine. \u201cShe\u2019s not good. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she needs some time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI hear that a lot.\u201d</p><p>Principal Warner walked him out of her office, led him to where Betsy sat, looking mulish now, both scared and angry.</p><p>\u201cBetsy,\u201d the principal said, \u201cI\u2019m going to let your father handle this for now, but if you\u2019re caught fighting again, I\u2019ll suspend you from school. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Betsy nodded glumly. She followed Michael out to the car without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cIs this the whole frenemies thing?\u201d he said, opening his door. \u201cBecause I thought Sierra was your BFF.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to sound cool, Dad. It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese girls are not worth your friendship, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cI\u2019m done with them.\u201d</p> <p>Michael got into the car. \u201cWhat happened, Betsy?\u201d</p><p>She got into the passenger seat and looked at him. Her face was flushed. \u201cI just lost it, Dad. I don\u2019t even know what happened. But it wasn\u2019t my fault. Zoe totally started it. She hit me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why did Zoe hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called her a bitch. But she is, Dad. She really is. You always say truth is a defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try. Look, Bets, I know you\u2019re upset with your mom, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything is about her, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is. You punched a girl for saying something mean about her. But, you know, Betsy, you\u2019ve been a little mean to her yourself. Maybe you feel bad about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were mean to her before she left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was. And I feel bad about that. But I don\u2019t go around punching people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe barely looks at me. Mom, I mean. I don\u2019t think she even likes me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Michael sighed. And there it was. The real problem. \u201cI know, baby. Your mom is different, and it hurts all our feelings, so you\u2019re acting out. I get it, I do. But you can\u2019t go around hitting people.\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m scared, Dad,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all are.\u201d</p><p>Jolene heard the door open, heard footsteps coming toward her bed. She knew it was Michael.</p><p>She pretended to be asleep. The three glasses of wine she\u2019d drunk had sedated her, given her solace from the grief and fear and anger. She couldn\u2019t face the family who wanted her back. And Michael would be the last person on earth she could talk to about her lost career anyway; he\u2019d always hated her service. He\u2019d probably say, good, and let it go at that. He couldn\u2019t possibly understand how it felt to know that she\u2019d never fly a Black Hawk again.</p><p>Even as she had the thought, she hated herself for it. Smitty was dead, for God\u2019s sake, and Tami lay in a hospital bed far away, fighting for her life. What right did Jolene have to bemoan a lost career?</p><p>\u201cJolene, I know you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>She lay perfectly still, trying to slow her breathing. She didn\u2019t dare look at him, not tonight, when her sense of loss was as deep as a mountain cavern, bottomless.</p><p>She kept her eyes closed until finally\u2014finally\u2014he left her alone.</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>For the next week, Jolene hid from her family. It was surprisingly easy to do. She spent days at the rehab center, working hard, becoming increasingly self-sufficient, and then she came home, begged Mila for help, and disappeared into her bedroom. Wine and sleeping pills dulled her pain enough that she could sleep. Night after night, she heard her family beyond the door\u2014talking, laughing, watching TV. They were going on with life, living it without her, and at each bit of laughter, she felt herself fall deeper into this sweaty darkness, until she began to have trouble even imagining a way to crawl out.</p><p>She lay in her solitary bed, cut off from everyone and everything, knowing she was giving up, giving in, but unable to change. What could she reach for? Who would help her to stand in her newly precarious position? Her children were afraid of her, and she was afraid of herself, afraid of her own crumbling, unreliable mind. Tami was too sick to offer help, and that was another of Jolene\u2019s sins. No matter how often she told herself the crash wasn\u2019t her fault, guilt was always there with her at night, a vulture waiting to pick at her bones. She called Germany often, talked to Carl, but they both knew his wasn\u2019t the voice she wanted so desperately to hear. Their conversations had become stilted lately; hope had worn thin.</p><p>Michael scared her, too, perhaps most of all. He kept saying the right things, words she\u2019d longed to hear, but he didn\u2019t really love her. How could he? He had stopped loving her when she was at her best; how could he possibly love her now, at her worst?</p><p>She was terrified that if she let herself believe him in a moment of weakness, it would ruin what small bit of pride was left to her.</p><p>Every morning, she vowed to do better, but each night found her back in her room, taking sleeping pills to help her sleep. And still she had the nightmares.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to court with me today,\u201d Michael said one morning in mid-October, coming into her bedroom without even knocking.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>He walked over to the nightstand and picked up the empty wine bottle. \u201cYou can walk or I\u2019ll carry you.\u201d</p><p>She sat up in bed. \u201cI haven\u2019t come to court with you in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will today. Mom said she\u2019ll handle the girls. We\u2019ll need to be on the seven fifty boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Conny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas agreed.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cFine,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>It took her a long time to get ready\u2014naturally\u2014and when she was done, she returned to her bedroom and looked at herself in the full-length mirror.</p><p>From a distance, she would probably draw no attention. It wasn\u2019t until you came near or saw her walk that you noticed the ugly plastic prosthetic foot.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Michael said from the doorway.</p><p>She pivoted awkwardly on her good foot.</p><p>His gaze swept her from head to toe, taking in the hair that fell free to well past her shoulders, the green boatneck sweater that showed off just a little skin, and the black pants that covered the part of her that was gone.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not ready to go out in public,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready. Conny says so.\u201d He offered his arm. She clung to him, let him steady her as she made her slow, hitching way into the family room, where the girls and Mila were waiting. It broke her heart all over again to see how warily her children stared at her.</p><p>Mila rose at her entrance. \u201cYou have her pills, Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have everything,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mila came forward. Jolene couldn\u2019t help noticing that the girls hung back.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this,\u201d Mila said.</p><p>Jolene felt a rush of remembrance at that, a sweet longing for her life before. How many times had Mila encouraged her over the years, and then stayed by her side? It had been Mila who had told Jolene, over and over again, in the barren years after Betsy, keep trying, there\u2019s always hope. You\u2019ll have another baby, I know it. An old, ragged desire to make her mother-in-law proud rose up in Jolene; it was tattered and torn, but there, and it felt good. \u201cThanks, Mila,\u201d Jolene said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>And then they were moving, she and Michael, making their way through the family room and the mudroom and into the garage. Jolene got into the car with some effort\u2014her damned temporary leg was unwieldy and heavy.</p><p>She wanted to take off the prosthesis and massage her leg in the car, but she didn\u2019t have the room. On the ferry, they stayed in the car. Jolene sat there quietly, staring out at the island\u2019s coastline while Michael read his notes.</p><p>When the ferry rounded the bend, Seattle was in front of them, a steel and gemstone tiara set above the waters of Elliott Bay. The sky on this early morning was rose-colored, tinged in aqua blue at the horizon. Mount Rainier rose elegantly above the city, deigning on this day to be visible.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten how beautiful it all was and how big. From here, she could see the stream of headlights snaking along Alaskan Way, zipping over the antiquated concrete viaduct.</p><p>Please be strong enough for this, she thought, realizing suddenly that she\u2019d be moving in a crowd\u2014could get jostled and bumped.</p><p>On Third Avenue, Michael pulled into a parking place right in front of the courthouse. She knew he\u2019d have to have an associate move the car later, but she was glad he understood that the shortest distance was best for her.</p><p>He came around to her side and opened the car door.</p><p>She panicked.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d he said evenly, reaching for her hand. She clung to him, stepped out onto the sidewalk. As she stood, clouds wafted overhead, blocking out the ineffectual sun, sending a smattering of rain to the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cCan you carry my crutches?\u201d she asked. \u201cI might need them later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She began the long, slow walk to the courthouse. In no time, she was breathing hard, sweating. She concentrated on each step, ignoring the pain caused by her blisters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was slow, and none too pretty in her movements, but she was doing it: walking by herself to the courthouse. Michael\u2019s hold on her arm was only a balance point.</p><p>At the start of the stone steps, she paused, winded, and looked up. The concrete stairs rose like Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 into the gray sky. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be late\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll wait for me,\u201d Michael answered easily.</p><p>This time she held his arm and let him steady her as she slowly, slowly climbed upward. Step. Lift. Swing. Plant.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know how long it actually took\u2014minutes probably\u2014but it felt like hours. Finally, though, they were in the courtroom. Michael guided Jolene to a seat behind the defense table.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled down at her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>And then he was moving away from her, joining the eager young associates gathering at the table.</p><p>The courtroom filled up around her. She saw reporters milling about outside, microphones at the ready. It must be a big case. She should have asked him about it.</p> <p>At the same time the bailiff entered the courtroom, so did four marines in dress uniforms. They moved in unison, sat down shoulder to shoulder beside Jolene, their backs straight, their faces grim. Before she could wonder about it, really, the defendant came into the room.</p><p>He was just a kid, probably no more than twenty-five. But she knew by looking at him that he was a vet. She could see it in his eyes.</p><p>The judge entered the courtroom, banged his gavel, and began the proceedings. The prosecutor stood and began to tell the state\u2019s side\u2014a story of bloodlust and anger, of a love gone tragically wrong, of a girl shot in the head by the man who had vowed to love her. For a simple story, it went on for more than an hour, so long Jolene\u2019s leg started to ache. Pain pulsed in her missing foot.</p><p>Finally, it was Michael\u2019s turn. He stood and addressed the jury. Unlike the prosecutor, Michael was relaxed with them, almost friendly. \u201cKeith Keller is no monster. That would be easy, a monster. We could put a monster away and feel good about ourselves. Keith is something scarier. Keith is us. He is your brother, your son, your next-door neighbor.\u201d He looked at the jurors one by one. \u201cHe was a popular kid at Wenatchee High, a star football player. After a year of college, he married the girl of his dreams, Emily Plotner, and found a full-time job at a local feed store. His employers and fellow workers will tell you what a great guy he is. Keith thought his life was going along on a pretty good track. He and Emily had begun to talk about children.</p><p>\u201cThen came September Eleventh. I\u2019m sure you each can remember where you were when you heard about the attacks. Keith was at work. He learned almost immediately that his best friend had been on Flight Ninety-three.\u201d</p><p>Jolene found herself leaning forward.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us wanted to do something. Keith actually did. He joined the marines and went to fight terrorism in Iraq, where he saw some of the worst fighting of the war. Every day he saw friends killed or maimed; every day he wondered if the next step he took would be his last. He saw children and women smile at him and then blow up. He picked up the pieces of his best friend after a roadside bomb blew the young man apart.</p><p>\u201cKeith is a soldier. I didn\u2019t used to know what that meant, but I should have, because my wife is a soldier, too. I sent her off to war without a clue as to what that meant.\u201d Michael turned, looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m proud of her service.\u201d</p><p>Jolene caught her breath. He was talking to her. That was why he\u2019d wanted her here today. So that she would listen.</p><p>\u201cHeroes,\u201d Michael said softly. The world seemed to fall away until it was only them, looking at each other across a crowded courtroom. \u201cThey are heroes, our soldiers, the men and women who go into harm\u2019s way to protect us, our way of life. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think of the war, you have to be grateful to the warriors, of whom we ask so much. To whom we sometimes give too little.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he turned back to the jury.</p><p>How long had it been, when he\u2019d been talking to her, only her? A few seconds? A moment? It felt like forever. How long had she waited to hear that from him\u2014I\u2019m proud of you? Tears stung her eyes; she wiped them impatiently away.</p><p>\u201cA soldier is taught to be strong and brave,\u201d Michael said in a voice in which only she would hear the hoarseness, the emotion. \u201cNot to need anyone. But Keith Keller did need help. He came home damaged beyond repair, suffering from nightmares.\u201d Here, Michael looked at Jolene again, and there was an understanding in his eyes she\u2019d never seen before, a compassion that had nothing to do with pity. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let anyone help him, although his wife tried. But how do you help someone deal with horrors you can\u2019t imagine? And how does a soldier come home from war, really? As a nation, these are questions we need to ask ourselves. In the case of Keith Keller, he might be sitting right there in front of you, but in a very real way he never came home from Iraq...\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, Michael went through the facts of the case from the defense\u2019s perspective, outlining PTSD and the failure to help him and the escalating anger and fear Keith had felt. \u201cKeith\u2019s friends and family will testify that he came home from the war changed, mentally broken. He tried to get help from the VA but he couldn\u2019t, as so many other returning soldiers have discovered. He suffered terribly\u2014nightmares, insomnia, flashbacks. He drank too much to mask these symptoms, and unfortunately alcohol only exacerbated the condition. It\u2019s called post-traumatic stress and it is a recognized psychiatric disorder. It was around long before we had such a serious-sounding clinical name for it. In the Civil War, it was called a \u2018soldier\u2019s heart,\u2019 which I think is the most accurate of the descriptions; in World War One, it was \u2018shell shock,\u2019 and during World War Two, \u2018battle fatigue.\u2019 In other words, war changes every soldier, but it has always profoundly damaged some of them.</p> <p>\u201cLike so many other soldiers before him, Keith came home jumpy, prone to violence, hyperalert, and angry. The facts will show that on the terrible day when he took his wife to the Pike Place Market, events occurred which reminded him of the war. Too much. In a single, tragic second, he forgot where he was, who he was, and he reacted on pure adrenaline and warrior training. In this fuguelike state, he shot his wife. Why? We don\u2019t know because Keith doesn\u2019t know, but expert witnesses will help us understand.\u201d</p><p>Michael finished with: \u201cKeith Keller didn\u2019t have the ability in that moment to decide to kill his wife. In his mind, he was in Iraq, doing what he was trained to do. He never intended to kill Emily. Keith doesn\u2019t need to go to prison, he needs help. This man who went to war to defend us needs our help now. How can we turn our back on him? What happened in his house on that terrible, terrible day was a tragedy, certainly, but it wasn\u2019t murder. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jolene finally released a breath. She had been mesmerized by her husband, transported, and she could tell that the jury felt the same way. It was obvious in the way they watched him, didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>When he sat back down, Jolene felt the spell break, and she leaned back against the hard wooden seat. His words\u2014his understanding\u2014surprised and moved her. Deeply. She had spent all of her adult life in the service, and yet never had she been able to share that world with her husband. It had been the start of her loneliness, that separation, the start of their marriage\u2019s fall.</p><p>The prosecution called its first witness, and for the next hour, Jolene forgot about herself and Michael and listened to the testimony on the stand.</p><p>At noon, the judge released them, and Jolene stood, remembering a second too late that she was on her prosthesis. The marine beside her steadied her.</p><p>Their gazes caught. He looked down.</p><p>\u201cAl Anbar,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded and reached for her crutches, handing them to her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. Positioning her crutches, she stood in the row, letting people sidle past her. She needed something to steady her in this crowd.</p><p>The courtroom was practically empty when Michael touched her arm. She looked up at him. In that instant, all the love and passion she\u2019d once felt for him came rushing back; she could no more hold it back than she could stem the tide. \u201cWhen did you learn all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife went off to war,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while she was gone, I remembered her. I\u2019m sorry I let you go on ... those words. There are so many things I should have said. I understand why you didn\u2019t answer my letter, but I want another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour letter? What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give me another chance, Jo?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. She couldn\u2019t have found her voice even if she had known what to say.</p><p>An associate came up to Michael, whispered something in his ear.</p><p>Michael nodded. To Jolene, he said, \u201cKeith would like to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve mentioned you to him. I guess he has something he\u2019d like to say.\u201d He led her through the courthouse to a room in the back, where Keith sat in front of a scarred wooden desk, his ankles and wrists shackled. At her entrance, he stood up; the chains rattled.</p><p>He was so damned young, and the pain in his eyes drew Jolene forward. She set her crutches against the wall and walked the last ten feet to the desk, where she sat down across from him. When she took the weight off her prosthesis, she felt instant relief.</p><p>\u201cChief,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCall me Jolene.\u201d She reached across the desk to shake his hand. He hesitated, then brought his manacled hand forward, shook hers.</p><p>\u201cRamadi,\u201d he said. \u201cMostly.\u201d</p><p>That was all he had to say. She knew what it had been like for him, how he\u2019d served his country. He\u2019d patrolled streets lined with IEDs, day after day, watching people\u2014friends\u2014blow up. He\u2019d been on bag duty. How many hero missions had she flown for his buddies?</p><p>\u201cIs there something I can do to help you?\u201d she asked gently, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself, Chief. That\u2019s what I wanted to tell you. We both know what\u2019s in our heads, how hard it is to think sometimes, how bad the nights can be. I should have told Emily everything and held on to her. Instead, I pretended I was okay. I could handle it. I\u2019m a marine. And here I am ... and there she is.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cYou have kids, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, sitting back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be who you needed to be over there. Come home to the people who love you. I wish to hell I\u2019d figured out a way to do that.\u201d He leaned forward, lowered his voice. \u201cTalk to Michael. He\u2019s a good man. He wants to understand.\u201d</p><p>There was so much she could say to this wounded young man, but in a way, he\u2019d said it all in those few sad words. He understood her: her pain, her fear, her reluctance to show weakness. He\u2019d been there, and because of that, he was here.</p><p>A soldier\u2019s heart.</p><p>No wonder they\u2019d called PTSD that in days gone by. It was true. We can come home broken, she thought. No matter how strong we are ... The military should have prepared her for it. There was so much training before one goes to war, and so little for one\u2019s return. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keith rose. Staring down at her, he bent his arm in a salute. To her horror, she felt the sting of tears. She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not a soldier anymore.\u201d</p><p>Keith\u2019s smile was heartbreaking. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be soldiers, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>When they got home, the house was empty. Mila had taken the girls out for dinner and left a back by 8 note on the kitchen table.</p><p>Jolene limped into her bedroom and sat down on the edge of the bed. Although she was in considerable pain, she felt jittery, edgy. Michael\u2019s opening statement had been seductive, romantic, and it scared the hell out of her to believe\u2014even a little\u2014that he\u2019d changed. On the long ride home from court, she and Michael had made small talk. She listened to his questions and formulated answers, but both of them heard the echo of all their unspoken words.</p> <p>Michael knocked at her bedroom door, walked into the room.</p><p>She stared up at him. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me,\u201d she said quietly. Her heartbeat kicked up. \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d It was as honest as she knew how to be, as honest with him as she\u2019d ever been. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m like Keith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He walked toward her, came to her side. Taking her hand in his, he pulled her to a stand. His gaze was steady, and in the darkness of his eyes, she saw the shadowy reflection of their whole lives, the good and the bad. He leaned slowly, slowly forward, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you, Jolene...\u201d</p> <p>She knew he was giving her a chance to stop him, and there was a part of her that wanted to push him away and run and protect what was left of her heart. But she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>His kiss was everything she remembered, everything she\u2019d ever wanted. Her body responded to him in the way it always had, wholly and completely.</p><p>When he drew back, she could see that he was as shaken by the kiss as she had been. His breathing was ragged.</p><p>\u201cTell me it\u2019s not too late for us,\u201d he said. She heard the desperate plea in his voice and knew she\u2019d never heard it before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late,\u201d she said, trying to catch her breath. \u201cBut I\u2019m not ready...\u201d</p><p>He smiled at last, and it was his smile, the one that had swept her away all those years ago. How long had it been since she\u2019d seen it? He walked over to the nightstand by the bed, opened the drawer, and took out a small plastic bag.</p> <p>She heard the jangle of metal as he opened the baggie, and she knew what was inside of it. Why hadn\u2019t she thought about it before? Her belongings. They\u2019d given her jewelry to him in Germany\u2014her dog tags, her watch, her wedding ring. He took something out of the bag before putting it back in the drawer, closing it with a click.</p><p>She drew in a shaky breath.</p><p>He moved toward her, reached for her left hand. Without looking away, he slipped the wedding ring back onto her finger. \u201cYou will be,\u201d he said, and the certainty in his voice struck a chord deep within her.</p><p>She watched him walk away, close the door behind him. Twice, she almost called him back, almost said, I was wrong, I am ready, but she was too afraid.</p><p>She hobbled into the bathroom and got ready for bed. Climbing under the thick comforter, she positioned the pillows around her residual leg and closed her eyes. The simple golden band added a forgotten weight to her hand. For the first time in weeks, she went to sleep without a glass of wine or a sleeping pill. Keith was right. She would take his advice. She would come home to the people who loved her\u2014her husband, her family. She had to be able to do it. She\u2019d gone to Iraq, for God\u2019s sake, she\u2019d flown helicopters in combat. How could it be harder to come home than to go to war?</p><p>Her last thought, as she drifted off to sleep was, Tomorrow I\u2019ll start over, Tami. I\u2019ll be Mommy again. I\u2019ll come home at last.</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>Jolene woke to watery yellow sunshine pouring through her window. It illuminated everything in the room\u2014including the empty wineglass on her nightstand and the collection of orange pill bottles.</p> <p>Today was the day she would give all that up. No more sleeping pills, no more wine to calm her jangling nerves. She closed her eyes and imagined it in detail\u2014she would rise confidently and go into the kitchen and make breakfast for her girls. Then she would take them aside and talk to them openly, tell them that the war had hurt her mind for a while and sucked out some of her spirit but that she could handle it now. She was ready to be Mom again, and that she\u2019d always, always loved them, even when the numbness was at its very worst. They wouldn\u2019t understand, perhaps, wouldn\u2019t believe her completely, but it would be a start. From there, she would prove it to them by improving every day, by getting strong and showing her love more freely. She wouldn\u2019t be afraid anymore.</p><p>She got out of bed and grabbed her crutches, hop-swinging into the bathroom. Emerging only ten minutes later, dressed for rehab, with her prosthesis on, she limped out into the kitchen and started breakfast. Pancakes today\u2014like the old days. She got some blueberries out of the freezer and started the batter. Every now and again she caught sight of her wedding ring and it made her smile. Hope felt as close as it ever had.</p><p>As she poured the batter in dollops on the hot griddle, she heard Michael come up behind her. He moved in close, leaned over her shoulder. \u201cPancakes, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA peace offering. I could have learned quantum physics in the time they took to make.\u201d She smiled at him, and for a second they were Michael-and-Jo again, and she thought: We can do it.</p><p>\u201cJo\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wanted to know what he was going to say, leaned closer to hear the words, but the phone rang. Michael went to answer it. \u201cHello?\u201d It was obviously the office; he frowned, sat down, and lowered his voice to say, \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>The girls came thundering into the room.</p><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s making pancakes!\u201d Lulu said, her frown turning into a smile when she saw that the pancakes looked ordinary.</p><p>Jolene turned slightly, saw Betsy\u2019s narrowed gaze. \u201cThe griddle\u2019s too hot,\u201d her daughter said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Michael said, hanging up the phone.</p><p>Jolene smiled. \u201cMichael, Betsy thinks the griddle is too hot. Will you tell her I was making pancakes before she was born?\u201d</p><p>Michael stared at her, unsmiling. \u201cMaybe you should sit down, Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down? Why? My leg feels great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy, finish the pancakes,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Betsy whined. \u201cWhy do I always have to do everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy,\u201d he said so sharply Jolene frowned.</p><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>He took Jolene by the arm and led her through the house, toward the bedroom. When she sat down on the bed, she looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tami,\u201d he said quietly, sitting beside her. \u201cShe died last night.\u201d</p><p>Jolene couldn\u2019t breathe. As if from a distance, she saw Michael holding her, soothing her, rubbing his hand up and down her back, but none of it reached her.</p><p>For more than twenty years, Tami had been there for her, keeping her strong when she felt weak. I\u2019ve got your six, flygirl.</p><p>And Seth ... he would grow up without a mom ...</p><p>She made a great gasping sound and started to cry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jo,\u201d Michael said, stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She felt wild suddenly, feral. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay. My best friend died and it\u2019s my fault. Mine. She died and then I left her behind...\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cI\u2019m never supposed to leave anyone behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of people telling me it will be okay. It won\u2019t be okay. It\u2019ll never be okay.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take this pain. It was consuming her, devouring her. She stumbled to the nightstand and grabbed her sleeping pills. Opening the container, she spilled three into her shaking palm. \u201cA nap will help,\u201d she said, her voice shrill. \u201cI\u2019ll feel better after a little nap.\u201d</p><p>It was a lie. She wouldn\u2019t feel better, but she needed to close her eyes and get away from this grief. She couldn\u2019t bear it. Not anymore; she wasn\u2019t strong enough. Her heart might just stop ... and would she care?</p><p>She swallowed the pills, dry, and sank to the bed, hanging her head, willing them to work.</p><p>Michael moved closer, took her in his arms again. She knew he was judging her for taking the pills, thinking that she was pathetic and damaged, but she didn\u2019t care. It was the truth anyway; she\u2019d been snapped in half and her courage was gone.</p><p>She looked at him through her tears. \u201cWe were supposed to grow old together. We were going to be old women, sitting on our deck in rocking chairs, remembering each other\u2019s lives...\u201d</p><p>On the day of Tami\u2019s funeral, Jolene couldn\u2019t get out of bed.</p><p>As soon as she woke up, she poured herself a glass of wine. Downing it quickly, she poured and drank another. But there was no help in the bottle today.</p><p>She heard the shower start upstairs. Michael was up.</p><p>Throwing the covers back, she got out of bed, put on her prosthetic leg, and made her way across the family room slowly; aware of every step, every bump and line and scar on the wood floor. In the past few weeks, she\u2019d made excellent progress with her prosthesis, she was able to wear it almost all the time now, and her movements were getting stronger every day.</p><p>At the rag rug, she positioned her fake foot carefully so she wouldn\u2019t slip and then kept going. Up the stairs. Grab, lift, thrust, place, step. Each riser took phenomenal concentration and resolve. By the time she got to the master bedroom, she was sweating.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be up here. It was off-limits, really, this second floor. No one trusted her to use the stairs. No one trusted her to do much of anything, really. She could hardly blame them.</p><p>She limped over to the closet and opened the louvered doors. Her clothes were all still there, neatly aligned.</p><p>The first thing she saw were her ACUs, the combat fatigues, with the black beret pinned to the chest. She and Tami had worn that uniform almost every day in Iraq ...</p><p>Beyond it were her class As\u2014dress uniform: a jacket, knee-length skirt, and white blouse. She pulled it out, stared down at the jacket with its gold detailing, surprised by the emotion that washed over her.</p><p>\u201cJo?\u201d Michael said, coming into the room. He was bare-chested, wearing a towel wrapped low on his hips; his hair was still wet. \u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>He came over, took the uniform from her. \u201cLet me help you get downstairs. Mom should be here by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was steady, warm. \u201cYou can.\u201d He held on to her arm, steadied her as she moved through the bedroom and went down the stairs, where Mila was waiting at the kitchen table, sipping coffee.</p><p>\u201cI came to help you get ready,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>Jolene felt as empty as corn husk, hollow, dried-out. She was shaking when her mother-in-law took her by the elbow.</p><p>Mila helped her into the shower. When Jolene was done, and wrapped in a big, thick towel, Mila positioned her on the toilet, then brushed and dried her hair. Her residual leg stuck out like a baseball bat, still swollen and decorated with bright-pink stitch marks. Mila wrapped it expertly in the elastic bandage and then covered it with the gel sock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA little makeup would be nice today, don\u2019t you think? You\u2019re pale and you\u2019ve lost so much weight...\u201d</p><p>Jolene nodded but didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cSit up straight and close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Jolene closed her eyes when asked, opened them when prompted, and pursed her lips. She couldn\u2019t have cared less how she looked, but neither did she have the strength to protest.</p> <p>\u201cThere. All done. Let\u2019s get you dressed. Here.\u201d Mila knelt in front of her, holding the waistband of the skirt open.</p><p>Jolene lifted her left foot and guided it through the opening, gritting her teeth when her mother-in-law slipped the skirt over her stump. Then she stood dutifully and sat again, zipping her skirt before she opened her arms for the blouse, fixing the smart dark neck tab at her collar.</p><p>Mila talked the whole time, about gardening and recipes she\u2019d tried and the weather. Anything except the thing they were getting ready for. \u201cOkay. All done. How did I do?\u201d</p><p>Jolene lifted the skirt and put her prosthetic limb on. Grabbing the handrail by the toilet, she got to her feet. Turning with care, she faced the mirror on the back of the door.</p><p>In her crisp white shirt, dark neck tab, and jacket decorated with honors and trimmed in gold, she was a soldier again.</p> <p>We\u2019re graduating, flygirl, stand up straight ...</p><p>Mila took Jolene in her arms, holding her tightly.</p><p>Jolene drew back. She couldn\u2019t be touched right now; she was like fine antique china. The smallest pressure in the wrong place and she\u2019d crack. She limped out into the family room, where Betsy and Lulu and Michael were waiting, all of them dressed in black.</p><p>When she looked at them, the membrane between what had happened and what could have seemed as fragile as a spider\u2019s web. She was lucky to be here. It could easily have been her funeral that had made them wear black. They were thinking the same thing; she could see it in their eyes.</p><p>She managed a smile, wan though it must be, because it was expected of her.</p><p>Her family came forward, bookended her. She knew that Michael had already loaded her crutches and wheelchair into the SUV. He also knew how much she wanted to walk on her own today.</p> <p>Perhaps he thought she wanted to look whole, unharmed, soldierlike. But the truth was that it hurt her to walk still, and she wanted that pain today, welcomed it. It was proof in some sick way that she\u2019d given her best that night, that she had barely survived.</p><p>She walked\u2014limped, really; she\u2019d gotten new blisters on her trip to the courthouse\u2014out to the garage.</p><p>She climbed awkwardly into the passenger seat of her SUV and forced her prosthesis to bend at the knee. The ugly ankle boot on the clunky foot hit the car\u2019s rubber floor mat and stuck there.</p><p>She knew she should say something to her family now. They needed her to put them at ease and let them know she was okay.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t okay and they knew it. They were afraid of her now, afraid she\u2019d blow up or start crying or yelling or maybe even that she\u2019d hit someone.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even care. The numbness was back, and this time, she was grateful for it.</p><p>Michael started the engine and opened the garage door. It clattered up behind them.</p><p>Outside, rain fell in broken threads, strands so slim and pale you only knew it was raining because you could hear it pattering the roof. Michael didn\u2019t even bother to turn on the wipers.</p> <p>The radio came on. \u201cPurple Rain\u201d blared through the speakers.</p><p>Jolene glanced to her left, and for a split second Tami was there, moving side to side, tapping her fingers on the steering wheel, singing pur-ple rain ... puur-urr-ple rain ... at the top of her lungs.</p><p>Michael leaned forward and clicked off the radio. It wasn\u2019t until he looked at her, laid his hand on her thigh, and squeezed gently that she realized she was crying.</p><p>She looked at him, thought, How am I going to get through this?</p><p>Michael squeezed her leg again.</p><p>She turned away from him, looked out the window. They were still on the bay road, and the water was calm today, as shiny and silver as a new nickel. By the time they turned onto Front Street, the sky had cleared. A pale sun pushed its way through the layer of cottony gray clouds, limning them with lemony light. In an instant, colors burst to life: the green trees on either side of the road seemed to swallow the sun and glow from within.</p><p>In town, there was bumper-to-bumper traffic.</p><p>\u201cThey all have their lights on,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not night,\u201d Lulu said from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Tami,\u201d Mila said quietly.</p><p>Jolene climbed out of the darkness of her own grief and looked around. The hearse was about three cars in front of them, crawling forward. There had to be a hundred cars behind them.</p><p>They were going through town now. On either side of the street, people stood in front of the shops, gathered in clusters, waving at the passing hearse.</p><p>There were flags everywhere\u2014on posts and poles and streetlamps. Yellow ribbons fluttered in the breeze\u2014from doorknobs and flower boxes and car antennae. A sign in the window of Liberty Bay Books read: GOODBYE TAMI FLYNN. SAFE JOURNEY HOME.</p><p>By the time they made it to the end of town\u2014only a few blocks later\u2014there were hundreds of people waving at the hearse as it passed.</p><p>Then the honking started. It sounded like a symphony as the snake of cars turned up toward the cemetery. Once there, on the crest of the hill above Liberty Bay, you could see forever\u2014the Sound, the town, and the jagged, snow-covered Olympic Mountains.</p><p>After they parked, Jolene sat there long enough that her family started to worry. They threw questions at her like tiny darts until she said, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d and sighed and got out of the car.</p><p>The family merged into the crowd of mourners, many of whom were in uniform.</p><p>Behind them, Jolene heard the throaty roar of Harley-Davidson motorcycles.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have turned, but she did. The cars were still streaming in, lights on. There, in the middle of traffic, were about thirty motorcycles, moving in formation; huge flags flapped out behind the riders\u2014Guard, army, American. They created a blur of flying colors. She could see from here that the riders were of all ages and most were in uniforms.</p><p>Patriot riders.</p><p>Jolene stumbled; Michael caught her, steadied her. Giving him a tight smile, she squared her shoulders and kept walking.</p><p>As they rounded the bend, she saw their destination. Perched out on a lip of land that overlooked the Sound was a peaked green tent roof supported by four glinting silver poles. Beneath it was a casket draped in an American flag.</p><p>Already there were hundreds of mourners standing around. Behind them stood a row of flags\u2014the Guard, the United States, the army. Last was the Raptor flag.</p><p>She wanted to lean into Michael and feel him take her in his arms, but she stood tall, lifted her chin just the slightest amount. This might be the last moment she would ever be Chief Warrant Officer Zarkades, and she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d disgrace the uniform.</p><p>At the side of the casket, she saw Carl and Seth, both dressed in black, looking blank and confused. Beside them was Tami\u2019s weeping mother.</p><p>She went up to Seth, put her arms around him. She saw the tears glaze his eyes, and it took every ounce of willpower she had not to cry. She concentrated on each breath, remaining composed by sheer force of will.</p><p>And then it was beginning. Michael led her to one of the folding chairs reserved for the family. It hurt to look at Seth and Carl as they took their seats beside her, but she did it, wanting desperately to say I\u2019m sorry to each of them. Amazingly, they looked at her with sadness, but not blame. That only made her feel worse.</p><p>Somewhere a bagpipe started to play.</p><p>This time Jolene closed her eyes. She heard the high, mournful notes of the instrument, heard the muffled sound of boots marching along behind, and knew the soldiers were making their way down the hill, toward the casket.</p><p>\u201cWe are here to say good-bye to a special woman. Chief Warrant Officer Tamara Margaret Flynn...\u201d</p><p>Jolene dared to open her eyes.</p><p>The minister from Tami\u2019s church stood by the casket. He had no microphone\u2014no one had expected such a crowd\u2014but the people quieted instantly, until all you could hear was the wind fluttering the flags out front. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t Tamara to us, was she? She was just Tami, the girl who used to climb trees with the boys and run wild along the beach. I remember when her mother despaired that she would ever slow down enough to find a career.\u201d He looked up the hill.</p><p>Jolene knew what he was seeing\u2014hundreds of people, and more than half of them in uniform. \u201cShe did find that career, though, and I have to say, I wasn\u2019t surprised that she found her passion in the sky. She loved flying. She once told me that it was as close to God as she could imagine being.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his hands, then up at the crowd again. \u201cWe lost her, and that is a wound that won\u2019t heal. We lost her in a faraway land, doing something that most of us can\u2019t begin to understand. We ask how we could have lost her in such a way. But then we know: that was Tami. If someone needed help, she was the first to show up. Of course she put herself in harm\u2019s way. That\u2019s who our Tami was.\u201d</p><p>Jolene heard Seth make a sound beside her. She reached for his hand, took it. He held on tightly.</p><p>\u201cWe thank Tami for her service today, as friends and as Americans. She gave the full measure to protect, and she is a hero. But we knew that, didn\u2019t we? We knew she was a hero long before today. To Seth and Carl, whom she loved with a fierceness that was matched only by her courage, I say, remember her, all of her. And when you look at the sky, think of her up there, in her beloved blue, with our Lord beside her. She would not want you to mourn.\u201d He looked up at the sky and said quietly, \u201cGood-bye, Tami. Peace be with you.\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside and one of the uniformed soldiers marched up to the casket. The soldier removed the flag from the casket, and, along with another soldier, carefully folded it into a near triangle. Then he offered it to Captain Ben Lomand, who stood nearby. The soldier saluted and handed Ben the flag. Ben turned crisply on his heel, pivoted, and brought the flag to Carl.</p><p>Jolene saw that Carl\u2019s hands were shaking as he reached out.</p><p>On the ground, two rows of soldiers pointed their guns skyward and shots rang out. A twenty-one-gun salute. Carl stood, walked toward the casket. He stood there a long time, his head bowed; then he placed a red rose on the gleaming mahogany top. Seth followed. The rose he placed on the casket slipped off, and he bent to retrieve it, placing it next to his father\u2019s. One by one Tami\u2019s relatives came up to say their last good-bye and put a rose on the casket.</p><p>When it was Jolene\u2019s turn, she stood slowly. She felt awkward, uncertain that her legs would hold her up.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>She moved cautiously forward. At the flower-strewn coffin, she stopped, and put her hands out, touching the smooth wood. The rose she held bit her with its thorn. Good-bye, flygirl. I\u2019ll miss you ...</p><p>She put her rose with the others and then joined the five soldiers who\u2019d gathered at the casket. The bagpipes started to play again, and Jolene watched as the soldiers\u2014her friends from the Guard\u2014picked up the casket. The soldiers carried it down the grass toward its final resting place. Jolene limped beside them, an honorary pallbearer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears glazed her eyes, and she couldn\u2019t see well, but she kept moving, gritting her teeth against the pain. The uneven grass threatened to break her stride at every step, but she kept going. Finally, they came to the grave site.</p><p>The bagpipes wound down, their music fading away. In the sudden silence, three helicopters roared into the airspace, rotors whirring, engines purring, and hung there.</p><p>Good-bye, Tam. Fly safe ...</p><p>And it was over.</p> <p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>For the next week, Jolene hung on by the thinnest imaginable thread. The grief was so overwhelming she forced herself to ignore it completely. With a combination of wine and sleeping pills, she found numbness. She went to rehab three days a week and tried to concentrate on her recovery, but to be honest she barely cared. At home, she drank two or three glasses of wine and crawled into her bed, pulling the covers up to her chin. When she was lucky, she slept at night. Other times, she lay awake in the darkness, acutely alone, remembering her best friend. She knew how her family felt about her lethargy\u2014Betsy was pissed, Michael was saddened, and Lulu was confused.</p><p>She knew she was letting them down again, and sometimes she found the energy to care. Mostly, she just ... looked away. Even on Halloween, she\u2019d been unable to rouse herself. She\u2019d waved good-bye to her princess and her gypsy and watched them leave with Mila and Michael for trick-or-treating.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Jolene,\u201d Michael said one morning in early November. He came into her bedroom and flung back the curtains, letting light steamroll over her.</p><p>She had a pounding headache. Had she had an extra glass of wine last night? \u201cGo away, Michael. It\u2019s Saturday. I\u2019m not going to rehab.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, blinking wearily. \u201cWhere is it you think I\u2019m going?\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside. Seth walked into the bedroom. He was dressed all in black\u2014wrinkled black corduroy pants and an oversized black short-sleeved shirt with an envelope stuck in the breast pocket\u2014and his hair pulled back in a samurai topknot that only Johnny Depp could pull off. My kid\u2019s a fashion disaster, what can I say? She heard Tami\u2019s voice so loudly, so clearly, that Jolene caught her breath. For a split second, she thought she saw her friend standing in the corner, her arms crossed, her face lit by a smile.</p><p>\u201cMiz Z,\u201d Seth said, coming forward.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d she whispered, feeling a stab of guilt. \u201cI should have come over to see you. I\u2019ve just been...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene wanted to fill the sudden painful silence, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHer locker,\u201d Seth said at last.</p><p>Jolene knew what he was going to ask of her, and she couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cThey want us to clean it out. Dad doesn\u2019t even know where it is. Will you take me to the post, help me get her things?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say no. Instead, she nodded, her eyes stinging again, and said, \u201cOf course, Seth. Maybe next week\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all go.\u201d He came to the bed, held out his hand.</p><p>She stared at it, afraid to let him touch her. She felt so breakable right now. But Tami had asked this of her\u2014take care of Seth\u2014and she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d let her best friend down. In an act of will, she took Michael\u2019s hand, let him help her to her feet. She stared into his eyes for a moment, seeing the strength that was offered there, unable to take it for her own. \u201cI\u2019ll get ready.\u201d She gave Seth a weak smile.</p><p>In the bathroom, she stared at herself in the mirror. Her face was healed now, but even so, it was different. Sharper. Harder. Her cheekbones were bony ridges above hollow cheeks; her lips were chapped and pale. And there was that slightest pink scar along her jaw. \u201cYou can do this.\u201d</p> <p>Of course you can.</p><p>It was Tami\u2019s voice again, so close, Jolene turned sharply, looked behind her. There was no one there.</p><p>She limped toward the shower. When she was done, she dried her hair, coiled it in a bun, and went to her closet.</p><p>Her ACUs were right there in front. Michael must have brought them down. But she wasn\u2019t a soldier anymore.</p><p>The thought came to her before she could guard against it.</p><p>She gritted her teeth and dressed in a pair of black pants and a gray turtleneck. When she went out into the living room, Betsy and Lulu were standing by Michael. Seth stood off by himself, his arms crossed tightly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She limped into the garage and opened the passenger door of her SUV. She opened it and hoisted herself up into the plush seat.</p><p>In no time, the kids were in back: Seth and Betsy were sitting together, with Lulu on the left side of them. In the rearview mirror, Jolene saw Betsy poke Seth\u2019s upper arm. He blinked in surprise and pulled the earbuds from his ears. Betsy leaned closer to him, whispered something. He looked at her, his eyes widening at her smile.</p><p>Jolene turned away, looked out the window, watching the gray landscape blur past her. Now and then Michael tried to begin a conversation, but she didn\u2019t bother to answer, and soon he gave up.</p><p>All she could think about was Tami. Her friend should be in the car now, cranking the music up, saying, Hey, flygirl, Prince or Madonna today?</p><p>When they drove up to the guard post, Jolene felt a sharp stab of emotion\u2014longing, disappointment, loss.</p><p>So much of her life had been spent here. With Tami beside her, always.</p><p>They parked in front of the hangar. Jolene steeled herself. It would be a tough day\u2014and not just because hours on the temporary prosthesis came at a price. She climbed out of the SUV and stood there, both feet firmly planted, waiting for Seth.</p><p>Michael said, \u201cLulu has to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Jolene nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s in that building right there. First door on the left. We\u2019ll meet you back at the car. It ... won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>Michael leaned forward, kissed her lightly on the cheek, whispered, \u201cYou got this, Jo.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the touch of his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with Mom and Seth,\u201d Betsy said quietly.</p><p>Seth looked at her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shy smile. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Jolene moved closer to Seth, placed a hand on his thin shoulder. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well that makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>Jolene led the way to the hangar. The last time she\u2019d been here, she\u2019d been deploying ...</p><p>As they crossed the threshold, moving into the giant space full of helicopters and cargo planes and people in uniform moving from place to place, Jolene stopped.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mean to. She just saw the Black Hawk and couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>My turn to fly. It\u2019s right seat for you today, no arguing.</p><p>\u201cJolene?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the boy beside her, seeing how pale and sad he looked, and she forgot about her own loss for a minute. You make sure he knows who I was. \u201cShe loved to fly,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cShe would want you to know that. She loved to fly, but ... you ... you were her whole life, Seth. She would have done anything she could to get back to you.\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cAnd she sang off-key. Did you know that? I swear, dogs joined in when she sang.\u201d</p><p>Tears brightened his eyes.</p><p>Jolene stared up at the helicopter, with its open door and back bay cluttered with straps and metal boxes. She let go of Seth\u2019s hand and walked forward. She didn\u2019t mean to, didn\u2019t really think about it; she just moved forward and stared up at the cockpit.</p><p>Her residual limb ached, as if in reminder.</p><p>\u201cCan you still fly?\u201d Seth asked, coming up beside her.</p><p>\u201cNot a Black Hawk,\u201d she said, and for a split second, she remembered all of it\u2014flight school, Tami, flying into the blue, looking down on the trees in bloom. \u201cI loved it, though,\u201d she said, more to herself than to Seth.</p><p>How long did she stand there, staring up at her past, grieving for both the loss of her leg and the loss of her friend and the end of an era?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to fly again?\u201d Betsy asked, sounding surprised.</p><p>Jolene couldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cMy mom would say you can do anything,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>Jolene nodded. Those few words brought Tami into the hangar so clearly she could practically smell her gardenia shampoo. \u201cYes, she would. And she\u2019d kick my ass if she saw us standing here with tears in our eyes.\u201d</p><p>He wiped his eyes. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, guys.\u201d She led him through the building to the locker room. Betsy followed a pace behind.</p><p>Jolene limped through the narrow area, lined with metal lockers. At number 702, she stopped.</p><p>\u201cIs that my mom\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Jolene nodded, feeling Betsy come up beside her. Jolene hesitated a second, and then spun the lock into its combination. It clicked open.</p><p>At the bottom of the locker were a pair of sand-colored boots, a green tee shirt, a helmet, and a silver water bottle. A picture of Seth and Carl, its edges curled up, was taped to the inside wall. Jolene reached in and took the items out, setting them aside. She handed Seth the picture.</p><p>That was when she saw the envelope. There was just one\u2014a long, business-sized white envelope with one word written across it: Jolene.</p><p>\u201cI knew she\u2019d write you one,\u201d Seth said. His hand made its way to his pocket; he fingered the envelope that stuck up. \u201cIt\u2019s her \u2018in case I die\u2019 letter.\u201d</p><p>Jolene couldn\u2019t reach for it.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she knew?\u201d he asked, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jolene said thickly. \u201cShe thought she\u2019d come home. She wanted to, so much. For you and your dad.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI know I\u2019m not her, Seth, but I will be here for you your whole life. If you need anything\u2014advice with girls, driving lessons, anything. You come to me. We can talk about anything. When you\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll talk about your mom and how much she loved you, and what her dreams for you were. I\u2019ll show you some pictures and tell you some stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m ready?\u201d</p><p>Jolene knew what he meant. She wasn\u2019t ready yet, either. She couldn\u2019t read Tami\u2019s letter until she was stronger, until she was sure the good-bye wouldn\u2019t break her. Hell, maybe she\u2019d never be able to read it.</p><p>The Keller trial ended amid a flurry of icy rain in downtown Seattle. Michael fought for the jury instructions he wanted, and he got them. The prosecution had amended the charges to include both murder in the second degree and manslaughter to the charges\u2014a good sign for the defense. For weeks, Michael had put on witnesses and offered evidence about PTSD. He\u2019d argued fervently that Keith had been incapable of forming the specific intent necessary to commit the crime of murder in the first degree. One witness after another had confirmed Keith\u2019s deep and abiding love for his wife. Even Emily\u2019s mother had tearfully confessed that she had known something was wrong with Keith, that he\u2019d come home \u201cmessed up in his head somehow,\u201d and that the killing was terrible and tragic but that she didn\u2019t see how prison would help. \u201cWe just have to live with it,\u201d she\u2019d concluded, dabbing at her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keith\u2019s own testimony had been the defense\u2019s best weapon. It had been a big gamble to put him on the stand, but Michael had known by then that the jury would only believe Keith if they heard the story firsthand.</p><p>With Keith, there were no previous crimes, no barroom fights or petty shoplifting charges in his youth, nothing that his testimony would open the door to. He had been a good kid who had grown into a fine man who had been broken by war. He testified about trying to get help from Veterans Affairs and the helplessness he felt. He cried when he talked about his wife, although he seemed to be unaware of his tears. When he said, \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gone to Iraq, maybe I\u2019d still be working at the feed store and we\u2019d have a baby by now. Theresa. That was the name Emily picked for our daughter. It haunts me, thinking stuff like that,\u201d several of the jurors had shiny eyes.</p><p>Michael had hoped\u2014as all defense attorneys did\u2014for either a lightning-fast verdict or a very slow one.</p><p>This time, he got his wish. The jury\u2019s deliberation went on and on. For six days, Michael went into the city, sat at his desk. He read reports and conducted depositions and drafted pleadings, but all the while he was waiting. The worst part of it was that he needed to be at home, and yet here he was.</p> <p>Since Tami\u2019s funeral, Jolene had fallen into a despair he couldn\u2019t imagine, gone to a dark place he couldn\u2019t follow. The tiny footprints of their reconciliation\u2014that one kiss\u2014had been lost in the rubble of her grief. She drank too much and took sleeping pills and slept the days and nights away. She woke screaming at night but wouldn\u2019t let herself be comforted. When he tried, she pushed him away, looking at him through eyes that were wide with pain. The girls steered clear of her. Lulu cried herself to sleep, wondering what had happened to her mommy.</p><p>Michael was literally at the end of his rope. He was trying to give Jolene space and let her grieve, but she was pulling them all under water, drowning them, and he didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>His intercom buzzed. \u201cMichael? The jury\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>Michael thanked his secretary and grabbed his coat. Within minutes, he was walking up Second Avenue in the spitting cold rain. Damp bits of paper and black leaves skidded along the wet streets, plastering themselves to windows and bus stops and windshields.</p><p>Inside the courthouse, he stomped his feet on the stone floor and shook the rain from his hair.</p> <p>Not far away, a knot of reporters had gathered. More would probably follow. In the past week, both CNN and Fox News had done stories on the case.</p><p>\u201cMichael!\u201d</p><p>They called out to him, waved him over.</p><p>He paused just long enough to say, \u201cNo comment yet, guys,\u201d and then walked into the courtroom, where he took a seat at the defendant\u2019s table.</p><p>The Kellers had been staying in a local hotel, waiting, and they arrived a few minutes later.</p><p>Every seat was taken by the time a guard led Keith into the courtroom. He looked pale and drawn after his months in jail. He was allowed to hug his parents\u2014briefly\u2014and then took his place beside Michael.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>Keith shrugged. For once the marine posture was gone; Keith was just a kid now, facing life in prison and worse\u2014life in the prison of what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cAll rise.\u201d The judge took his seat at the bench.</p><p>The jury filled in. Michael tried to see the answer in their eyes, but they wouldn\u2019t look at him\u2014not a good sign.</p><p>\u201cHave you reached a verdict in the matter of the State of Washington v. Keller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have,\u201d said the jury foreman.</p><p>\u201cWhat say you?\u201d</p><p>At first there was the legalese of case and crime, and then: \u201cOn the count of murder in the first degree, we, the jury, find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p> <p>Michael released a breath. He heard a rustle of noise behind him. People were whispering among themselves.</p><p>\u201cOn the charge of second degree murder, we find the defendant guilty.\u201d</p><p>The gallery erupted. Once again the judge tried to take control. Michael heard Mrs. Keller cry out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll appeal, Keith,\u201d Michael said quickly.</p><p>Keith looked at him, and for once he looked old. \u201cNo, we won\u2019t. I deserve this, Michael. And it\u2019s not murder one. You did a good job. They know I didn\u2019t mean to kill her. That matters to me.\u201d He turned away, was enfolded in his parents\u2019 arms.</p><p>The associates who\u2019d worked on the case surged around Michael, congratulating him on beating murder one. He knew this case would set precedent here in Washington and carry weight nationwide. It was a statement about the jury\u2019s belief in PTSD. They believed Keith didn\u2019t intentionally kill his wife. For the young lawyers, who hadn\u2019t yet learned the chasm that sometimes existed between justice and the law, this would be cause for much celebrating. For them, it was simply a win, a victory against formidable odds. They wouldn\u2019t think about this case again, except in technical terms. They wouldn\u2019t think of Keith sitting behind bars, suffering through nightmares.</p><p>\u201cI deserve to go to prison,\u201d Keith said to him. \u201cI said that from the beginning. Maybe you\u2019re right and the war messed me up, but Emily is dead and I killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not intentions that matter. It\u2019s actions. My drill instructor used to say that all the time. We are what we do and say, not what we intend to. I meant to tell Emily a thousand times that I was in trouble, but I never did. If only I\u2019d told her the truth, maybe we would have had a chance. Thank you, Michael. Really.\u201d</p><p>Then the bailiff came and took Keith away.</p><p>Michael stood there until everyone else was gone and the courtroom was empty. The Kellers thanked him, as did the Plotners, and he didn\u2019t know what to say in response. He had done his best for their son, and it had been almost enough. He remembered his father saying once that ghosts were the curse of the criminal defense attorney, and he knew that this case would haunt him. He would wonder forever if he could have done something more, if he shouldn\u2019t have put Keith on the stand.</p><p>All the way home, he replayed the trial in his mind, tried to follow the threads of different choices, wondering if any one of them would have changed the outcome. Then he began to construct his argument for the next phase of the trial, how he would ask for mercy in the form of a lesser sentence ...</p><p>When he walked into his house, though, all of that fled. He could tell instantly that Betsy and Lulu had been fighting. Lulu\u2019s eyes were red and puffy, and Betsy was shrieking at her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s NOT the boss of me,\u201d Lulu wailed at him, running, throwing herself into his arms.</p><p>Betsy rolled her eyes and stomped off.</p><p>Michael couldn\u2019t handle this tonight. Not tonight. \u201cWhere\u2019s your mom?\u201d he said more sharply than he intended.</p><p>Lulu looked at him through her tears. \u201cIn her bedroom. She hates us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to her.\u201d He tried to put Lulu down, but she clung to him like a burr on wool, crying harder.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lulu...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou s-said a b-bad word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Sorry.\u201d He kissed her damp cheek and forced her to stand on her own. \u201cStay here,\u201d he said, leaving the room. He went to Jolene\u2019s room, knocked, and opened the door.</p><p>She was sitting up in bed, her hair a mess, holding Tami\u2019s unopened letter, staring down at it.</p><p>\u201cRead it,\u201d he said harshly.</p><p>She ignored him.</p><p>He saw the open wine bottle on the nightstand. Without thinking, he walked over to her, grabbed the bottle, saying, \u201cEnough, Jo.\u201d</p><p>She reached out. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d he yelled at her. \u201cDon\u2019t love you anymore? Don\u2019t want you? Don\u2019t care if you drink yourself into a coma?\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the obvious reminder of Tami.</p><p>He saw her eyes go blank again. She was retreating, pulling her pain into that dark place inside of her, the place to which he\u2019d never been granted access. \u201cEnough,\u201d he said again, yelling it. \u201cI was an asshole before you left. I admit it. I was an asshole and I broke your heart and I might have ruined us. Maybe I did ruin us. But I\u2019ve changed, Jo. I\u2019ve changed and you don\u2019t seem to care. I\u2019m sick of throwing myself against the concrete wall of your defenses. You\u2019re giving me nothing. You\u2019re giving your children nothing. Nothing. And you know what that\u2019s like, don\u2019t you, Jo, getting nothing from your parents. If we\u2019re broken now and this family is ruined, it\u2019s on you. On you. I can\u2019t try any harder.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him through tears. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me something,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. Her tears brought it all home to him, pulled the fire from his anger and left him shaken, cold. \u201cReach out, Jo. Talk to me. Be my wife again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re done ... after all this...\u201d</p><p>She rolled away from him, pulled the covers up around her.</p><p>He stood there, uncertain, feeling as lost and alone as ever in his life. It was worse even than standing at his father\u2019s graveside. Jolene, he realized right then, realized it to the marrow in his bones, was his life.</p><p>Behind him, there was a knock at the door. He said nothing, but the door opened. Lulu stood there, her face wet with tears. \u201cI\u2019m scared, Daddy,\u201d she said.</p><p>With a sigh, he went to her, took her in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Lulu,\u201d he lied, leaving Jolene\u2019s room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p><p>The next day was Carl\u2019s \u201ccelebration of Tami\u2019s life\u201d for friends and family.</p><p>All day, Jolene had been shaky, angry. She\u2019d snapped at her children and cried at the drop of a hat. The fight with Michael had pushed her to the very edge of control. She kept her emotions in check with the fiercest grip of her life. A headache throbbed behind her eyes. She drank two glasses of wine, but it didn\u2019t still the trembling in her hands. She should have been at Tami\u2019s house at three o\u2019clock, setting out food and plates and utensils, making sure that everything was ready. It was a best friend\u2019s job to help out the husband at a time like this.</p><p>Jolene had nothing to give. She was so empty inside she was surprised every time she looked in the mirror\u2014how could her veins not be showing through her pale skin, how could her bones not be visible?</p><p>At seven, Michael knocked on her bedroom door and came inside, closing the door behind him.</p><p>She sat on the bed, dressed in jeans and a white blouse, her hair still damp. She knew by the look on his face that her eyes were red-rimmed and bloodshot.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this if you can\u2019t,\u201d he said tiredly, but he wouldn\u2019t meet her eyes. She saw how much she\u2019d wounded him, hurt him, and it shamed her. She thought of the letter she\u2019d written to Michael before she left for Iraq. I loved you, beginning to end.</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d She got unsteadily to her feet.</p><p>He was there in an instant, holding her arm. At his touch, she felt a surge of loss. Had it only been a few weeks ago that he\u2019d kissed her? That she\u2019d thought maybe? and began to fall in love with him again? It all felt so far away now, like memories held under water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kept hold of her arm as they went into the family room, where Mila and the girls were waiting. Mila and Betsy both held foil-wrapped casserole dishes, and Jolene thought, I should have cooked.</p><p>Tami\u2019s seven-layer dip. She loved it ...</p><p>She almost stumbled; Michael held her steady. They walked out of the house and across the yard. On this cold November evening, it was already darkening. Soon, there would be frost on the fence posts and across the green surface of the grass.</p><p>Michael opened the gate. They walked through the opening and over the hump of grass and up the Flynns\u2019 gravel driveway. At the house, there were dozens of cars and trucks parked out front. Lights blazed from the windows.</p> <p>I love a party.</p><p>She heard Tami\u2019s voice, her throaty laugh ... or was that the wind through the cedar boughs?</p><p>Seth welcomed them into the house; he looked as dazed and shaky as Jolene felt. She saw the envelope sticking out of his pocket. It was a reminder of her own last letter from Tami, which lay hidden in a drawer in her nightstand, still unopened. He wore his mother\u2019s dog tags around his neck.</p><p>\u201cStay with your mom,\u201d Michael said to Betsy. He and Mila worked their way through the crowd, taking the food to the table.</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d Betsy muttered under her breath.</p> <p>Jolene barely heard. She remained by the door. She heard talking, even laughing, but it made no sense to her. Tami should be here. It was her house ...</p><p>The narrow manufactured home was too full of people; food covered every surface in the kitchen and dining room. Most of their Guard unit was here. Oh, God, there were Smitty\u2019s parents, their faces different now, lined by the kind of grief that constricted blood flow and tightened skin. What would she say to them? What would they say to her?</p><p>An easel in the center of the room held a poster-sized picture of Tami in her ACUs, smiling brightly for the camera, waving to the folks back home. Jolene had taken that picture only a few weeks before the crash ... Give me your real smile, Tam, come on ...</p><p>She closed her eyes, trying not to remember. Count to ten. Breathe. She needed to go talk to Smitty\u2019s parents, to tell them how sorry she was for their loss and how brave their son had been. He didn\u2019t suffer. Was that what they would want to hear? Or that he\u2019d been courageous or funny or thoughtful?</p><p>Behind her, a door slammed shut. Bam! Jolene screamed. In an instant, she was in Balad again, and the base was under attack, and a rocket whizzed by her head. She reached for Tami, told her to take cover, and threw herself to the ground.</p><p>She hit so hard it knocked the breath from her lungs, made her dizzy.</p> <p>When she opened her eyes, she saw a pale white patch of linoleum and a sea of feet. Not boots ... not sand. Nothing smelled like smoke or mortar fire.</p><p>Feeling sick with shame, Jolene realized that she was on the floor of Tami\u2019s house.</p><p>Her family and friends\u2014and the soldiers from her unit\u2014stood around her, beers in their hands, smiles faded, peering down at her with concern. They were talking. Was it to her or themselves? She couldn\u2019t tell; their voices were a chain-saw buzz of sound. Michael was in the kitchen, standing beside Carl. A song\u2014\u201cCrazy for You\u201d\u2014blared through old speakers in a distant room.</p><p>\u201cOh, my GOD,\u201d Betsy yelled, distancing herself from Jolene. \u201cWhat\u2019s WRONG with you?\u201d</p><p>Jolene saw how mortified her daughter was. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Betsy,\u201d she whispered, crawling slowly to a stand. She was shaking now; she couldn\u2019t breathe. She hated the pity she saw in the eyes around her.</p><p>She knew she should say something, make some pathetic excuse, but what was there? She could see by the way her friends were looking at her that they knew, all of them; they knew she was damaged now, broken. Crazy.</p><p>She limped for the front door, pushing through it, going out into the night.</p><p>\u201cJolene, wait,\u201d she heard Michael yell from inside the house.</p> <p>She slammed the door shut behind her and kept going, limping down the gravel driveway and across the grass field that separated their properties.</p><p>She was almost home when Michael caught up with her. He took her by the arm, tried to stop her.</p><p>She pushed him away. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d she hissed. She was losing herself as she stood here, falling apart by degree. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p><p>She pushed past him and went into the house, then limped into her bedroom. She turned to slam the door shut and stepped wrong, came down hard on her blisters, and a rage exploded inside of her, made her shake it was so powerful. Suddenly she wanted the prosthesis off\u2014off\u2014she couldn\u2019t stand looking at it. She leaned against the dresser and took it off, screaming as she threw it across the room. The ugly plastic leg hit a vase Mila had given them last Christmas, and the pretty blue and white Chinese porcelain cracked into pieces.</p><p>She started to laugh even though it wasn\u2019t funny, was the opposite of funny, but she kept laughing. Look, Tam\u2014no leg!</p><p>She wanted to sink to her knees, but she couldn\u2019t do it. One of the many things she couldn\u2019t do anymore. It took everything she had just to stand here, storklike, swaying.</p><p>She laughed harder at that. Then she realized she had to go to the bathroom and she\u2019d thrown her leg and the wheelchair wasn\u2019t here and her crutches were in the mudroom.</p><p>Cursing, she hopped awkwardly forward, balancing on the furniture. In the bathroom, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror and looked away. Her hands were shaking as she unbuttoned her jeans and shoved them down to her ankles. She realized too late that she wasn\u2019t close enough to the toilet.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>She hopped closer, stepped down on one pant leg, and lost her balance; her ankle twisted. Falling sideways, she grabbed the towel rack. It ripped out of the wall, and she crashed to the floor, hitting her shoulder on the edge of the sink hard enough to make her cry out.</p><p>She lay there for a moment, dazed, her shoulder and ankle throbbing, and suddenly she was screaming in frustration.</p><p>The bathroom door banged open. \u201cJolene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>Michael knelt beside her, touched her face. \u201cBaby,\u201d he said softly, in the voice she had once loved\u2014still loved\u2014and it made her feel so lonely and lost she couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he said again, and suddenly she was crying. Sobbing. She tried to stop, to hold back these useless, useless tears and be strong.</p><p>Michael took her in his arms and held her tightly, stroking her hair.</p><p>Once she\u2019d started to cry, she couldn\u2019t stop. Great, gulping sobs wracked her body, shook her like a rag doll until her nose was running and she couldn\u2019t breathe. She cried first for Tami, but then it was for everything she\u2019d lost, all the way back to her parents, and even before that, for the family she\u2019d longed for as a child and never had. She cried for Smitty, and her lost career and her missing leg and her best friend and her marriage.</p><p>When she finally came back to herself, she felt weak, shaky. She drew back and saw that Michael was crying, too.</p><p>He gave her an unsteady smile and she needed it\u2014needed him. Telling herself anything else was a lie. \u201cI take it you need to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>It made her laugh. Only she could have the breakdown of her life on the bathroom floor, with her jeans down around her ankles. Ankle. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He got up and picked her up as if she weighed nothing and set her on the toilet, then he reached over and unspooled a wad of toilet paper, handing it to her like a perfect white rose.</p><p>She\u2019d peed in front of him a thousand times in their marriage, but now the act felt painfully intimate. She thought about asking him to leave and changed her mind. Whatever was happening now between them, she didn\u2019t want to ruin it.</p><p>She flushed the toilet when she was done.</p><p>He knelt in front of her, helped her pull her panties back up.</p><p>She saw him look at her gel-socked stump and felt sick to her stomach. He would look away now ...</p><p>Instead, he slowly peeled off the gel sock, and there it was\u2014the ugly, rounded stub of her once-beautiful leg. He leaned forward and kissed the bright pink scar.</p><p>When he looked up, she saw the love in his eyes\u2014there was no denying it anymore. Impossible as it seemed, he\u2019d fallen in love with her again. She\u2019d known on that day in the courtroom, hadn\u2019t she? Known it and feared it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo arguments,\u201d he whispered, then he picked her up and carried her out of the bathroom. She expected him to set her down on her bed, but he kept walking, out of her room and up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur bed,\u201d he said, climbing the stairs with her in his arms.</p><p>She clung to him. All the way up the stairs she thought of why it was a bad idea for them to make love. The doctors had told her she could \u201cresume sexual activity\u201d when she felt ready, but what would it be like?</p><p>She wanted to say stop, I\u2019m not ready, but even as she had the thought, pushed up by a lifelong fear, she knew it was a lie. She had been ready to love this man from the moment she first saw him. In all these years, that had never changed. They\u2019d hurt each other, let each other down, and yet, here they were after everything, together. She needed him now, needed him to remind her that she was alive, that she wasn\u2019t alone, that she hadn\u2019t lost everything.</p><p>She had to believe in him again; it was their only chance. Her only chance. There was no protection from being hurt except to stop loving all together, and she couldn\u2019t do it. She\u2019d tried. She wanted love\u2014reckless, unpredictable, dangerous. Even with her damaged body and her even more damaged heart. She wanted it. Wanted him.</p><p>He shoved the bedroom door open and then kicked it shut behind him. At the bed, he stopped, breathing a little hard from the exertion of carrying her up the stairs. In his eyes, she saw the same intense passion that had jolted her body at his touch, brought her back to life, but she saw fear, too, and worry. They lay down together.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jo,\u201d he said simply, although they both knew there was nothing simple about such a declaration.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Michael,\u201d she said brokenly. \u201cI always have.\u201d</p><p>He took her in his arms and kissed her. Her body came alive at his touch, opened to him, and she moaned his name, pressed against him. She drew him close, wanting him more than she ever had.</p><p>His hand slid under her shirt, unhooked her bra.</p><p>She took a deep breath, trying to gather her courage. She wanted him, wanted this to happen, but it frightened her, too. What would love be like with this new body of hers? Would he really still want her?</p><p>Moonlight came through the window, illuminating her pale legs. Her thighs were the same size\u2014the swelling had gone down\u2014one tapered to a knee and a shapely calf and a foot. The other ...</p><p>She so rarely let herself really look at it. Now she did, and she knew Michael was looking, too, at the amputated leg, with its rounded end and Frankenstein stitches, still an angry pink. Lulu had been right: it kind of looked like a football. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe might have to be ... innovative,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI love innovative,\u201d he whispered, letting his hand move across her jutting hip bone and along her thigh. His touch electrified her. She pulled off her blouse and undressed him and lay against him, every part of her needing to be touched by him. She ran her bare hand along his chest, feeling him, remembering. Their kiss turned desperate. Her fingers slipped beneath the waistband of his boxers.</p><p>Had she ever felt this sharp, aching need before? She couldn\u2019t remember, but it was in her now, fueling her, straining to be released.</p><p>He knew her body as well as he knew his own, knew when to touch her and where, knew how to bring her to this edge that was both pleasure and pain. It didn\u2019t matter at all that they had to do things a little differently than before, that she sometimes needed to position herself with pillows. Lying on her side, she clung to him, her breath coming fast and hard, feeling him inside her again, filling her; she arched up, kissed him, and their cheeks were wet with each other\u2019s tears. Her release was so powerful she cried out; it felt as if her entire body were being lifted up, carried on some dark wind, and then floated back to the softness of the bed she\u2019d shared with this man for so much of her life. In the aftermath, she curled against him, her body sweaty, spent, and as he stroked her arm, she lay there, her cheek against his chest, remembering the feel of his tears on her face, the salty taste of his kiss.</p> <p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d he said afterward, as they lay together, still breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you never answered my letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one I sent you in Iraq, a few days before your crash.\u201d</p> <p>She frowned. \u201cI never got a letter from you over there. We were crazy that last week, missions constantly, and the Internet was always going down. I opened my e-mail once after I got home; there were hundreds of condolence messages about my leg. I couldn\u2019t stand reading them. I haven\u2019t gone to the computer in forever. What did it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I wanted another chance.\u201d</p><p>She tried to imagine what that would have meant to her then, when she was so far from home. Would she have believed him? \u201cHow did it happen, you falling in love with me while I was away?\u201d she asked, her body tucked up against his, her chin resting on his shoulder.</p><p>He slid his arm beneath her, pulled her closer. \u201cAfter Dad\u2019s death, I was depressed, and you were always so damn cheerful. You gave me the kind of advice I couldn\u2019t follow\u2014like think \u2018good thoughts, remember his smile.\u2019 Honestly, I hated that shit.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cI was unhappy, and it was easy to blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you could will grief away. That\u2019s what I did with my parents. At least that\u2019s what I thought I did. The truth is, I knew loss. I didn\u2019t know grief. Now, I do.\u201d She tilted her chin to look up at him. \u201cI let you down.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead slowly, lovingly. \u201cAnd I let you down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need to talk more this time,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cReally talk.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI want to know about Iraq. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Her instinct was to say no, you don\u2019t want to know and protect him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I can do. You can read my journal,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I need to talk to that doctor of yours, too. I need help with this, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make it through, Jo. You\u2019re the strongest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Betsy? How will I convince her to forgive me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou flew helicopters in combat. You can handle one angry twelve-year-old girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take combat anytime.\u201d</p><p>They were laughing when someone knocked on their door. Pounded, actually.</p> <p>Michael got out of bed, snagged his pants and stepped into them. He was buttoning the fly as he opened the door. \u201cMa,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Betsy,\u201d Mila said. She was holding Lulu, whose head rested on her shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s gone. We can\u2019t find her anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Michael said, picking a tee shirt up from the floor, pulling it over his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s in the backyard or somewhere close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Jolene sat up, clutching the sheet to her bare breasts. She didn\u2019t know how Michael could sound so calm.</p><p>Mila glanced sympathetically at Jolene. \u201cAfter the ... incident at Tami\u2019s, there was a lot of talk. People are worried about you, Jo. Anyway, I was soothing Lulu, who kept wanting to know why you\u2019d thrown yourself to the ground, and when I got her settled, I looked for Betsy. It took a long time to work the room. The point is, she and Seth are gone. We\u2019ve looked everywhere. Carl is frantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check the house,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>He rushed out of the room. Jolene got out of bed and went to her dresser. Finding jeans and a white sweater, she dressed as quickly as she could. Michael returned with her prosthesis, and they went down the stairs. Hold-limp-step. Hold-limp-step. Never had the unwieldiness of her fake leg bothered her more.</p><p>Carl was waiting for them in the family room, looking harried. Mila was beside him, holding Lulu in her arms.</p><p>\u201cThey ran away,\u201d Carl said to Jo. \u201cI heard them talking, and I thought, \u2018Good, they\u2019re friends again,\u2019 and I went for another beer. I don\u2019t know how long it was before I went looking for him again. It wasn\u2019t until people started to leave that we noticed. I should have noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Harrisons\u2019 tree,\u201d Michael said. \u201cRemember the last time Betsy ran away? Seth found her at the tree by the Harrisons\u2019 dock.\u201d</p><p>Jolene stared at her husband. \u201cThe last time she ran away?\u201d</p><p>Michael barely responded. Carl nodded and the two men set off. Jolene followed them as far as the porch.</p><p>Out there, it was cold and black. No stars shone through. She stood at the railing, trying to will herself to see through the darkness. Mila came up beside her, carrying Lulu. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her, Jolene,\u201d she said. \u201cTeenagers do this sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>This sort of thing; running away in the dark, where God only knew what waited. If Jolene had been a better mother in the past weeks, they wouldn\u2019t be here, staring out at the cold night, praying. She heard Lulu\u2019s small sob, and she turned.</p><p>\u201cShe ranned away again,\u201d Lulu wailed.</p><p>Opening her arms, Jolene whispered, \u201cCome to me, baby. Let Mommy hold you.\u201d</p><p>Lulu\u2019s teary eyes widened. \u201cReally, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Lulu hurled herself forward so hard Mila stumbled sideways. Jolene caught Lulu in her arms and held on tightly, breathing in the familiar little-girl smell of Johnson\u2019s Baby Shampoo and Ivory soap.</p><p>She felt Lulu\u2019s sobs, and all she could do to help was hold on tightly, to tell Lulu over and over again that she was safe in Mommy\u2019s arms. Finally, Lulu drew back. Her dark eyes were swimming in tears, and her cheeks were glassy-looking with moisture. \u201cYou scared us, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Jolene smoothed the damp hair from Lulu\u2019s face. \u201cI know, Kitten. The war made your mommy a little crazy. I\u2019m going to get better, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>The trust in Lulu\u2019s eyes was a balm to Jolene\u2019s battered spirit. She wanted to say I promise. That was what she would have done in the old days; deflect and pretend. But promises were fragile things, and the future even more so. \u201cI promise I\u2019m going to do everything I can to be the mommy I used to be. But I might need your help. Sometimes if I\u2019m ... you know, crazy, you\u2019ll have to just raise your hands and shrug your shoulders and go, \u2018That\u2019s my mom.\u2019 Do you think you could do that?\u201d</p><p>Lulu raised her small pink palms and shrugged and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Jolene said, her smile unsteady.</p><p>Then Carl and Michael emerged from the darkness across the street and appeared in the driveway, walking slowly toward them. Betsy and Seth weren\u2019t with them.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Lulu said.</p><p>Jolene\u2019s fear kicked up a notch, edged toward panic. She kissed Lulu and handed her back to Mila, \u201cWill you put her to bed, Mila? Please?\u201d</p><p>Mila nodded. Taking Lulu, she carried the little girl back into the house. The screen door banged shut behind her.</p><p>Jolene met the men at the end of the porch.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t there,\u201d Carl said. \u201cThere was no sign that they\u2019d been there, either.\u201d He looked down at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s ten o\u2019clock. Should we call the police?\u201d</p><p>Jolene felt a chill go through her. Betsy was out there, somewhere, in the night, running away from a family that made no sense to her anymore, from a mother who could no longer be trusted. She went to the railing, stared down toward the road. Come back, Betsy. I will explain it all to you, please ...</p><p>Michael came up beside her, put an arm around her shoulders. She couldn\u2019t help thinking that before all of this, she would have shrugged his comfort away, would have been pacing now, trying to control a situation that wasn\u2019t hers to control. Now, she leaned against him.</p><p>How long did they stand there? Long enough for Michael and Carl to call everyone they knew, long enough for Mila to put Lulu to bed and come out to the porch, wrapped in a purple and pink afghan. Long enough to see their friends and family walk over from Carl\u2019s house and stand clustered along the fence line. Long enough to see the red and yellow flash of police lights coming their way.</p><p>Jolene saw the bursting bits of color, and she tightened her hold on the railing, freezing cold now, shivering. She was reminded of another night like this, long ago. She\u2019d stood on another porch, all alone, watching her parents drive away. She\u2019d never seen either one of them again.</p><p>Tami, bring her back to me.</p><p>The police cruiser pulled into the driveway and stopped. The colorful lights snapped off, leaving darkness behind.</p><p>Two uniformed officers got out of the car.</p><p>Michael tightened his hold on Jolene\u2019s waist. Was he thinking about the night he\u2019d been told about her accident? Hadn\u2019t Ben Lomand come up at night with the news?</p><p>The older of the two officers opened a pad of paper. \u201cWe\u2019re here about the missing children?\u201d</p><p>Missing children.</p><p>Jolene gripped the railing so tightly her hands went numb. Think, Jolene. You know Betsy. Where would she be?</p><p>She heard the questions being asked and answered beside her; descriptions, names, favorite places, reasons they might have run away. She heard the pause after that question, and then Carl\u2019s halting answer.</p><p>\u201cWe were having a memorial for Seth\u2019s mom tonight. She was killed in Iraq. Jolene had an ... um ... flashback and threw herself to the floor. It caused some ... I don\u2019t know ... upset to the kids, I think. Later, I heard Seth say to Betsy, \u2018That picture doesn\u2019t even look like my mom.\u2019 That\u2019s the last time I remember seeing them. It was, maybe, eight thirty or nine. I can\u2019t be sure. There was so much going on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jolene looked up sharply. \u201cWhat did you say, Carl? What did Seth say about Tami?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was mad at me for using the picture from Iraq. He yelled, \u2018That\u2019s not my mom. It\u2019s not even her real smile.\u2019 I should have listened to him, and then Betsy said, \u2018My mom hasn\u2019t smiled since she got back.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where they might be,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Carl asked.</p> <p>\u201cThey want the last pictures of us,\u201d she said, her throat tight. \u201cThe last time they saw their moms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Crab Pot,\u201d Michael and Carl said together.</p><p>\u201cYou go,\u201d Carl said to Michael. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here in case you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Jolene and Michael were already moving, going into the house, grabbing the car keys. In no time, they were in the car, backing down the driveway and turning onto the bay road. Neither spoke as they drove along the water. At some point, Jolene reached out and put her hand on his thigh, needing to touch him. \u201cIf anything happens to them...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, Jo,\u201d he pleaded.</p> <p>They pulled up into the Crab Pot parking lot, which was empty. Two solitary streetlamps threw spots of light down on the asphalt.</p><p>Michael ran and Jolene limped as fast as she could to the front door, which was ajar. The window beside it was broken. Shards of glass lay on the weathered silver boards at their feet.</p><p>A pinprick of light shone in the shadowy interior.</p><p>Michael opened the door slowly; it creaked in protest.</p><p>Seth and Betsy were huddled together at the wall, holding Polaroid pictures in the beam of a flashlight.</p><p>Jolene heard Seth say quietly, \u201cSee her smile, Betsy? That\u2019s her.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene\u2019s relief was profound, but short-lived. She should have been truthful with her children from the beginning. She should have warned them that war could hurt her, change her, change them. Protecting them from the inevitable had only increased their pain and confusion and caused all this collateral damage.</p><p>\u201cHey, Betsy,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Betsy saw her and grimaced. \u201cWe\u2019ll pay for the window. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t worried about the window,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>\u201cI had to get out of there,\u201d Seth said, tears filling his eyes. \u201cThey were all telling these stories about her in the Guard. And I missed her so much I couldn\u2019t stand it. I wanted to see her the way I remembered her. Betsy was the only one who understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good friend is like that,\u201d Jolene said quietly.</p><p>Betsy swallowed hard, staring at her. She held out the Polaroid picture of their family; it shook slightly in her grasp. \u201cShe never came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, Betsy,\u201d Jolene said.</p> <p>Betsy looked terrified by the request. She clung to Seth\u2019s hand as if she thought she might be yanked into a whirlwind if she let go. After all that had happened in this year, that was smart thinking on her part. They\u2019d all become Dorothys, hurtling through a tornado. Who knew where they would land?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d Jolene said at last. \u201cWe\u2019ll take Seth home, and then you and I will talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to lie to me and tell me everything is fine?\u201d Betsy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jolene said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you anymore.\u201d</p><p>It took them almost an hour to get everything settled down and taken care of back at the house. All the while, Jolene thought about the advice young Keith Keller had given her: Come home to the people who love you. It was time, finally, for Jolene to do that, and, to be honest, she was more than a little afraid.</p><p>When Carl and Seth and the police finally left, Jolene looked at Betsy, who was standing on the end of the porch, wrapped in a big blanket.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk now?\u201d Jolene asked quietly.</p><p>Betsy nodded, although she didn\u2019t look happy about it.</p><p>Jolene took her daughter by the hand and led her into the family room. At the sofa, Betsy tugged her hand free and hung back while Jolene sat down. Michael kissed them both and went upstairs.</p><p>She heard his footsteps on the stairs, then creaking on the second floor.</p><p>They were alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d Betsy said, standing back. Her cheeks were still red with cold and her eyes were wary. For the first time, Jolene noticed the small pink pearl earrings.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAre your ears pierced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered when you were going to notice. I guess you have to look at me to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t here. And I\u2019m practically thirteen.\u201d</p><p>It was a sharp reminder of all the time Jolene had lost with her daughter, and of the problems that lay between them now. In Jolene\u2019s absence, life had gone on; Michael had stepped up to the plate and guided their family, and he\u2019d made decisions along the way. Jolene had never wanted to leave her children for any reason, and yet she had; she\u2019d abandoned them in a way, and Betsy couldn\u2019t forgive her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jolene said slowly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry about that, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. What is?\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked away. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby,\u201d Jolene said gently.</p><p>Betsy moved forward woodenly.</p><p>\u201cCloser,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>Betsy shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad at me for leaving ... and for getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>Betsy shrugged, said, \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Jolene didn\u2019t look away, even though the pain in her daughter\u2019s eyes was a terrible thing to see. \u201cI know I\u2019m not the mom you remember, the mom you want. I know you\u2019re mad at me. And I deserve it, Betsy. Not for going to war. I had to do that. But for who I\u2019ve been since I got home.\u201d She got up, trying not to limp, and reached out, taking hold of Betsy\u2019s warm, soft hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you. Or embarrassed you.\u201d</p><p>Betsy\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cI read Tami\u2019s last letter to Seth. Did you write me one?\u201d</p><p>Jolene wanted to lie, to say no, of course not, I knew I\u2019d never leave you alone, but she was done with wrapping her life in pretty paper and pretending. \u201cI did. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, thinking about leaving you and Lulu and your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a lot of words and stories and advice, I guess. I tried to tell you everything you would need to know without me. I told you about my life, my parents, the kind of childhood I\u2019d had, and how love\u2014and motherhood\u2014had changed me. I told you I was afraid to leave you. Things I should have told you before I left.\u201d She looked at Betsy. \u201cIt said I love you in a thousand different ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still?\u201d</p><p>Jolene felt tears come to her eyes. She couldn\u2019t help wondering how long it would wound her, the memory of this question. \u201cI will love you forever, Elizabeth Andrea Zarkades. I might screw up, I might embarrass you, I might yell at you, but I will never, ever stop loving you. You\u2019re my firstborn. The first time I held you...\u201d Her voice broke on that; the tears started to fall. \u201cI fell in love so hard it cracked my bones.\u201d</p><p>The hug came so fast, Jolene stumbled sideways, almost lost her balance, but she clung to her daughter until they steadied. She held her daughter tightly, breathing in the familiar, girly scent of her corkscrewed blond hair, feeling Betsy\u2019s sobs.</p><p>Jolene knew there would be more fights, probably lots of them, and screaming and hurt feelings and wrong things said, but there would be this, too.</p><p>Finally, Betsy drew back and looked up. Her beautiful, heart-shaped face glistened with tears. \u201cI love you, Mom. To the moon and back. I should have said it when you left.\u201d</p><p>Jolene didn\u2019t know it until right then, this second, but those were the words she\u2019d been waiting to hear. \u201cI knew, baby,\u201d she said, holding her close again. \u201cI always knew...\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>The psychiatrist\u2019s office was a boxy little midcentury house that backed up to the fury of Aurora Avenue. Michael pulled up out front and parked next to an electric car. \u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? No.\u201d</p><p>Michael smiled in encouragement. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the right answer.\u201d</p><p>Jolene got out of the car. In the week since Tami\u2019s memorial service, she had relaxed a lot. The talk with Betsy, the reunion with Michael, the return of Lulu\u2019s laughter\u2014all of it had combined to restore Jolene\u2019s sense of self. She\u2019d poured her wine down the drain and put her sleeping pills away. But she still had a long way to go. Even in Michael\u2019s arms, she sometimes woke screaming for the crew that had been lost, for the helicopter that had crashed. Sometimes she still found herself standing somewhere\u2014in the kitchen, in the bathroom, on her own back porch\u2014and loss would overwhelm her. Maybe that sadness would be a part of her now, a weave in the fabric of her soul; or maybe it had been there all along and she\u2019d never let herself see it. All she knew was that it was time to dig deeply into her own psyche, to figure out how to come home from war figuratively as well as literally, how to forge a new life after a sharp bend in the road. Since she\u2019d given up drinking, it was easier to see the path of her own life more clearly.</p><p>An older man greeted them in the main room of the house. He was tall and gangly-looking, with long, unkempt gray hair and an angular face. He was wearing baggy black pants, orange clogs, and a Grateful Dead tee shirt. \u201cHello, Jolene,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>This was her doctor? \u201cOh,\u201d was all she could think of to say.</p><p>He smiled broadly. \u201cI\u2019m Chris Cornflower. I see Michael didn\u2019t prepare you.\u201d</p><p>Michael laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s no preparing someone to meet you for the first time, Chris. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me you were a Vietnam vet,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am. A POW, too.\u201d He reached out and shook her hand. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to meet you, Chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that woman anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s our job, Jolene, to find out who you are now. Would you like to come back to my office?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, looked back at Michael, who smiled and nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>She followed Chris into a small, nicely decorated room in the back. She was glad to see that there was no couch. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how to do this,\u201d she said, taking a seat in the comfortable chair positioned near his desk.</p><p>\u201cI have some experience,\u201d he said, giving her a smile. \u201cWe could start so many places. Your childhood, your experiences in Iraq, your best friend, your civilian future. Whatever you want to talk about first.\u201d</p><p>She laughed nervously. \u201cWhen you put it like that, it makes me think we\u2019ll be doing this for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly as long as you want to, Jolene. You\u2019re the chief here; I\u2019m the private. You lead, I follow.\u201d</p><p>She was afraid to dive into this conversation. They both knew it. But she\u2019d already let fear guide her before, and that hadn\u2019t worked. \u201cPeople see my lost leg and they think that\u2019s the problem. But I lost more than that. Sometimes I have no clue who I\u2019m supposed to be or what my life will look like from here on. I was good at being a soldier. I like answers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did you join the military, Jolene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was eighteen and alone in the world with no money. It gave me a place to belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said after a pause.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s an easy family to belong to, isn\u2019t it? Rules guide every situation and behavior. There are no hurt feelings or broken hearts in that family. You always know who you are and what your job is. When you\u2019re in trouble, your unit is always there for you. You know you\u2019ll never be left behind.\u201d</p><p>Jolene felt herself relax a little. He understood. Maybe finally\u2014finally\u2014she could talk honestly about the pain in her past, and maybe if she could tell him, she could tell Michael, and she could begin to heal. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a POW. So, you endured a lot. How did you know when you were out of the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent question. There were a lot of angry years after I got home. Lost years. I guess I knew I had begun to heal when I was ready to help someone else.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene knew how that could happen, how you could sink into a pool of anger or grief or sadness or guilt and simply drown. She thought about the letters she\u2019d received in rehab, especially the one from the young marine, Sarah, who\u2019d lost her leg. She\u2019d ignored the young woman\u2019s plea for help. \u201cI used to be the kind of woman who helped people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be that woman again, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI want to start with the nightmares...\u201d</p><p>On the second Friday in December, Lulu woke early and went straight to her bedroom window, pressing her nose to the glass. \u201cNo snow,\u201d she whined.</p><p>\u201cMaybe God\u2019s waiting \u2019til Christmas Eve,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cA white Christmas would be great, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Lulu\u2019s little shoulders slumped as she turned away from the window. \u201cI was hoping for no school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Lulu, you love kindergarten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said miserably. \u201cBut I wanted to go with you today.\u201d</p><p>Jolene pulled her youngest into her arms and kissed her cheek, then patted her butt. \u201cGet dressed, Kitten. You\u2019ll just have to wait to see my new pretty leg. Surprises are good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Lulu said, although clearly she didn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s go wake up your sister. You know how cranky she gets if we\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>Jolene and Lulu walked down the hall and awakened Betsy, and then the three of them went downstairs.</p><p>Today was supposed to be oatmeal.</p><p>\u201cCap\u2019n Crunch,\u201d Lulu said, climbing onto her chair. \u201cCuz it\u2019s a special day.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene smiled at her daughters. \u201cYou know what, Lulu, it is a special day.\u201d</p><p>Michael stumbled into the kitchen after the girls, looking tousled and a little bleary-eyed. A five o\u2019clock shadow chiseled his jaw, gave him that rock star look she loved.</p><p>She handed him a cup of coffee.</p><p>He took it gratefully. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Jolene said, pressing against him. He leaned back against the counter, and put the cup down so he could grab her by her butt and pull her against him.</p><p>\u201cI am tired,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m not getting much sleep lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d Betsy said from the table.</p><p>Lulu sat up, looked around. \u201cWhat\u2019s gross?\u201d</p><p>Jolene laughed and pulled free, executing a pretty decent twirl on her clunky fake foot. She poured the girls some orange juice, then started packing lunches.</p><p>Michael kissed the girls good-bye and went upstairs to take a shower. Jolene moved through the morning routine with an ease that belied her inner excitement.</p><p>All week, she had tried to tamp down her expectations for this day. Repeatedly, she\u2019d warned herself not to want too much, not to let hope run away with her, and honestly, until this morning, she\u2019d done pretty well.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Mommy,\u201d both girls said, one after another, as they left the warm house and ran down the wet driveway to the yellow school buses that pulled up out front. Jolene stood on the porch for each, waving until the bus was gone around the bend.</p><p>She felt Michael come up behind her. \u201cHey, you,\u201d he said, holding her shoulders, kissing the back of her neck. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he said from behind her.</p><p>She turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They got into the car and drove away. All the way to the rehab center, Jolene stared out the window at the falling rain. Hope was an elevator right now, broken from its cables. She could feel herself plunging with it.</p><p>At the center, she and Michael met Conny in the lobby.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, look how good you\u2019re walking on that ugly clunker of a leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it wasn\u2019t so bad,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>The three of them walked down the wide white hallway to the prosthetic center.</p><p>Jolene smelled plastic. Artificial arms and legs and hands and feet hung on the walls and around her.</p><p>\u201cJolene Zarkades is here,\u201d Conny yelled toward the back room.</p><p>A moment later, the Asian woman came into the front area, holding an artificial leg.</p><p>Jolene stared at it in awe. It was shapely, almost pretty, with a foot that could be adjusted for heels.</p><p>Conny took the limb from the woman and knelt before Jolene. He took off the heavy, unwieldy temporary leg and tossed it aside. Because her limb had shrunk so much in the last few months, she\u2019d needed more and more gel socks to keep the fit tight in her prosthesis. Conny peeled the socks away, dropped them in a pile, until there was only one left, which he smoothed carefully to remove any wrinkles. Then he fitted her into the new prosthesis.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said, shaking her head. It didn\u2019t look exactly real, of course, but it was close enough. She took a step forward, amazed at its lightness, its ease of movement. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like having my leg back,\u201d she said, looking at Michael, her eyes shining. \u201cI could dance on this leg.\u201d She turned to Conny. \u201cCan I run?\u201d</p><p>Conny said gently, \u201cOne mountain at a time, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, she worked in the PT room with Conny, while Michael made notes on a deposition.</p><p>Jolene discovered that she could skip. She hadn\u2019t skipped since childhood; now she couldn\u2019t stop. She laughed so much and so often the other patients probably thought she was loony tunes, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jolene,\u201d Conny said at the end of the day. \u201cIt\u2019s been good knowing you.\u201d</p><p>Jolene felt a tightening in her throat. How could she ever thank this man, who had been there for her every step of the way? She walked to him, barely limping at all, feeling no pain in her stump. \u201cYou saved me, Conny. Without you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was always you, soldier girl. You have the heart of a champion.\u201d He leaned over and kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too, but don\u2019t make a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never used to be a scene-making gal,\u201d Jolene said, her eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cLife changes us, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Jolene stared at him a moment longer, thinking that he was like the men and women in her unit. The job was what mattered, not the thanks. She nodded one last time, letting her gaze say it all, then she took Michael\u2019s hand and they walked outside.</p><p>Rain engulfed them, splashing beneath their steps. Jolene amazed herself\u2014she ducked her head, held on to Michael\u2019s hand, and ran for the car.</p><p>Ran.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t perfect, of course, her leg didn\u2019t bend like it should, but she did it. Her hair was dripping wet by the time she got into the car.</p><p>\u201cThat was a pretty sexy bit of running on your new leg, Mrs. Zarkades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s going to want one, I can tell you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help looking at her new leg; she kept lifting her pant leg and staring at it. It was almost impossible to stop smiling.</p><p>He stopped at the mailbox, picked up the mail, and drove up the driveway. When they pulled into the garage, she turned to her husband. \u201cYou\u2019ll be home for dinner?\u201d</p><p>He handed her the mail. \u201cBefore that, even. As soon as the Byer dep is done, I\u2019m coming home. How about dinner at the restaurant above the marina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She leaned over and kissed him, then got out of the car and practically skipped into the house.</p><p>Inside, it was quiet. Jolene made herself a cup of hot tea and went through the mail.</p><p>There was another letter from Sarah Merrin, the young marine who had lost her leg in Iraq.</p><p>Jolene sat down at the kitchen table and opened the letter.</p><p>Chief,</p><p>I understand why you haven\u2019t written to me. You probably feel as crappy as I do. I guess I\u2019m just hoping there\u2019s a silver lining out there. Ha.</p><p>I\u2019m still at Walter Reed. I\u2019m thinking of painting the walls, that\u2019s how long I\u2019m going to be here. They had to amputate the other leg. Infection.</p><p>Honest to God, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you all this.</p><p>How do you do it? I guess that\u2019s all I really want to know. They tell me I\u2019ll be able to walk again\u2014even skate\u2014but I think they\u2019re full of shit. And my husband couldn\u2019t get out of here fast enough.</p><p>Again, any words of wisdom you got would sure be helpful.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Sarah Merrin</p><p>Jolene sat there a long time, staring down at the words.</p><p>On a cold, rainy mid-December day, Jolene and Michael boarded an airplane for Washington, D.C., and took their seats in the third row.</p><p>Michael settled back into the comfortable blue leather and buckled his seat belt.</p><p>Jolene was turned away from him, looking out the small oval window, watching the ground crew do its job. He could see by the tightening of her mouth that she was missing her old life now: the military, flying, the woman she\u2019d been before the war.</p><p>He reached over, took her hand in his. It was rare these days for her to be sad, but at times like this, when the melancholy seized hold, she gave in to it, let it be. The watch he\u2019d given her for her birthday encircled her small wrist, the faceted face glinting in the light. It was an odd contrast with the plainness of her gold wedding band. When he\u2019d first seen her wearing it, he\u2019d been embarrassed. He\u2019d offered to replace it. I shouldn\u2019t have bought it for you, he\u2019d said, that was when I was different. I should have gone with you to the damn party.</p><p>Old news, she\u2019d said with a smile. We\u2019re both different now, and thank God.</p><p>It was true. They had all been changed in the past year.</p><p>Jolene most of all. She\u2019d learned in the last few weeks\u2014they all had\u2014not to gloss over sadness. She squeezed Michael\u2019s hand.</p><p>The plane\u2019s engines started up, rattling the seats slightly. She was probably remembering how it felt to climb into the pilot\u2019s seat, to put on a helmet, to go through the preflight check.</p><p>The plane backed away from the Jetway and rolled across the airport to the runway. It picked up speed, rocketed forward, rose up ... up ... up into the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blue sky filled the windows.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you about the plum trees?\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe used to see them when we took off from the post.

After a moment he said, \u201cI want to take the girls to my dad\u2019s grave.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve never gone there, not since the funeral.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m not the only one in this family who has trouble letting go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI still haven\u2019t read Tami\u2019s letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, I talked to Ben Lomand last week,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She turned. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to save it for Christmas, but here we are, up where you belong ... so, I talked to him about you flying again. He doesn\u2019t see any reason why you couldn\u2019t do it on your snazzy new leg. He said something about a smaller chopper\u2014there were a bunch of weird words and letters, and, well, he lost me. But he\u2019s willing to work with you. When you\u2019re ready. Maybe you could fly a news helicopter someday. Who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows indeed?\u201d She smiled. \u201cI love you, Michael Zarkades.\u201d</p><p>In the abstract, Jolene had known that Washington, D.C., was a city of monuments. She\u2019d read about the various places dedicated to the country\u2019s history, but until she stepped out onto the busy streets, she didn\u2019t quite understand how they all joined one to the other and told a story. Everywhere she looked\u2014on tiny slivers of snowy ground, on plaques on park benches, on white marble statues\u2014there was a memory, a reminder. The scale of the city surprised her, too. She\u2019d imagined a New York\u2013type city, full of thrusting skyscrapers. But this city felt grounded in a way she hadn\u2019t expected; there were no high-rises, no canyons of concrete that made passersby feel small.</p><p>New York was a city that showed off its greatness, sought to make tourists look at man\u2019s accomplishments with awe. D.C. knew that man\u2019s greatness lay not in stone and steel, but rather in ideas and decisions.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Michael asked.</p> <p>She turned away from the hotel room window, which overlooked a quiet street covered in snow.</p><p>Behind Michael, a gilt-framed mirror hung on the wall above a sleek French reproduction dresser. In it, Jolene saw herself from the waist up.</p><p>A soldier again\u2014if just for this moment\u2014in her class A dress uniform, with her hair pulled back and a black beret positioned with care. Medals and insignia decorated her chest, reminding her of who she used to be. This was probably the last time she would wear this uniform. She was in the process of taking a medical retirement from the military. Soon, this uniform would be like her wedding dress, a memory hanging in plastic in the back of a closet.</p><p>That part of her life had ended. The future lay cloudy in front of her, full of possibilities.</p><p>\u201cJo?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Michael. It\u2019s just weird, that\u2019s all.\u201d She slipped into the coat he offered her.</p><p>She held Michael\u2019s hand as they walked to Constitution Avenue. The whole city was gray and white, with slashes of black, a moody chiaroscuro. They walked through the Constitution Gardens; snow glazed the tree branches and benches.</p><p>They strolled past one last bare tree, and there it was: the Wall. Even on this frigid, snowy day the black granite seemed alive, reflecting the images of those few visitors who had ventured out in today\u2019s cold; an endless expanse of glossy black stone engraved with the names of soldiers who\u2019d died in Vietnam. She reached out with her gloved hand, let her fingers trace the names in front of her. Dotted along the wall were mementos and flowers and gifts left by loved ones.</p> <p>There were more than 58,000 names.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she was crying until Michael put his arms around her. She leaned against him, barely noticing the snowflakes falling on her cheeks and eyelashes.</p><p>They stood there until Jolene was shaking with cold, and still she hated to leave. \u201cI want to bring the girls here in the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer is a great idea,\u201d Michael said, \u201cbut now, let\u2019s go. I can\u2019t feel my hands.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and let him lead her away. In front of them, distant, the Lincoln Memorial rose up through the gloom and snow, pearlescent, lit by beams of golden light. A house, divided against itself, cannot stand.</p><p>Michael flagged down a cab, and they climbed in. \u201cWalter Reed,\u201d he said, clapping his gloved hands together.</p><p>Jolene settled into the seat and stared out the window at the white-coated city blurring past. By the time they pulled up to the imposing medical center entrance, it was snowing so hard she could barely see.</p><p>When she stepped into the busy hospital, she had a sharp, sudden memory: she was on her back, strapped to a gurney, staring at hot lights, trying not to cry or scream, asking, How is my crew? until she lost consciousness. The pain was overwhelming. It was all in her head in a second.</p><p>Michael squeezed her hand, reminding her with his touch that she was here, standing; the worst was behind them. She took off her heavy woolen coat and handed it to her husband.</p><p>For a moment, as she stood there in her dress uniform, decorated with the medals she\u2019d earned and the patches that had defined so many years of her life, she felt tall again, steady. It didn\u2019t matter that the skirt revealed what she\u2019d lost; the uniform revealed who she had been for more than twenty years. She wore it with pride.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She let go of his hand and went to the desk, where the nurse on duty gave her the information she needed.</p><p>\u201cAre you family?\u201d the nurse asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she expecting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My visit is a surprise. But I\u2019ve cleared it with the hospital.\u201d</p><p>The nurse studied her for a moment, then nodded. \u201cRoom 326. You\u2019re lucky. She\u2019s leaving in two days.\u201d</p><p>Thanking her, Jolene headed down to room 326, in the orthotics wing.</p><p>The door was open.</p><p>Jolene moved through the buzz of medical staff with the ease of someone who had learned the routine of a place like this.</p><p>She paused at the open door and knocked.</p><p>Inside the room, a woman lay in a hospital bed, angled up. Jolene recognized the look in the woman\u2019s eyes: a combination of fear, anger, and loneliness. There were few lonelier places in the world than a hospital room. Even with loved ones beside you, there was no escaping the frightening, isolating truth that neither love alone nor family could make you whole.</p><p>She went to the end of the bed and stood there. \u201cSarah Merrin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s left of me is.\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s heart ached for this woman\u2014this girl, almost; she couldn\u2019t be more than twenty years old. She saw the empty blanket where Sarah\u2019s legs had been. \u201cYou\u2019re still Sarah, even though it doesn\u2019t feel like it. It feels like you left her somewhere, over there, right?\u201d</p><p>Sarah looked up.</p><p>God, she was so young.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>Jolene moved slowly away from the end of the bed. As she walked, with only the slightest hitch in her gait, she felt herself gliding back in time, and for a second she was the woman in the hospital bed again, and a young marine named Leah Sykes was coming up to her bed, smiling, offering hope in the fact of her stance. Jolene hadn\u2019t appreciated it enough then\u2014she\u2019d been so broken\u2014but she had learned, over time, how much that support had meant.</p><p>She moved to the side of Sarah\u2019s bed.</p><p>Sarah looked down at Jolene\u2019s prosthesis, then up at her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jolene Zarkades. You wrote me a letter. Two, actually. I\u2019m sorry it took me so long to get here. I was ... depressed and pissed off for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Jolene these days. Hi, Sarah,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a runner,\u201d Jolene said softly. \u201cIt took a while, but I\u2019ll be a runner again. I ordered a tricked-out new metal prosthesis. It\u2019s called a blade. Supposedly, I\u2019ll be able to run like the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I hear a lot of shit like that. People actually say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just your legs, thank God it wasn\u2019t worse.\u2019 They wouldn\u2019t say that if they had a stump. Or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll lose things, I won\u2019t lie. But you\u2019ll find things, too.\u201d</p><p>Sarah lay back in her pillows, sighing. \u201cTeddy\u2019s coming back today. He\u2019s just finishing his tour, and I\u2019m what\u2019s waiting for him. Lucky guy. I don\u2019t know what to say to him. Last time ... well, he had trouble looking at me, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Jolene knew better than to hand out some shiny bit of optimism. She understood now that some things had to be fought for to mean anything. There were journeys in life no one could take for you. She couldn\u2019t tell this girl, this soldier, how to handle her life or her injury or her marriage. All she could do was be here, standing as tall as she knew how, and hope that down the road, this would be remembered, as she remembered the woman who had stood by her bedside in Germany, all those months ago. \u201cI\u2019m just going to stand here, okay?\u201d she said to Sarah. \u201cBe here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been alone,\u201d Sarah said, sounding young, almost childlike.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not alone now.\u201d Jolene stood a few inches away from the wall, listening as Sarah talked about her childhood in West Virginia and the man she\u2019d loved since ninth grade and the fear that she would be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life.</p><p>Jolene said very little. She listened and nodded and stood there. Not once did she sit down, even though her hip started to ache.</p><p>As night fell, she saw Michael come up to the open door.</p><p>He saw her standing there by Sarah\u2019s bed, and he smiled. She thought about the letter she\u2019d written him all those months ago, those few simple words: I loved you beginning to end. No wonder she hadn\u2019t been able to say anything more. What else was there?</p><p>She\u2019d had to go to war and lose almost everything to find what really mattered.</p><p>I\u2019m so proud of you, he mouthed. At that, she felt something open up inside of her, in the deepest, most untouched part of her heart that for years and years had been hers alone.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes, blurred her vision until he was the only solid and true thing in this bright, unfocused world. She could feel her tears, streaking down her cheeks, taking years of hurt with them. She wiped them with the back of her hand until her tears were gone, a memory.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Summer comes, as it always does, in a wash of light and expectation. One day it is cool, wet spring, and then, as if at the turn of a switch, the sun returns. Long, hot days bake the pebbled shores of Liberty Bay, turn the already-weathered dock into brittle, silvery slats of wood trimmed in dune grass. Shorebirds call out to one another, swooping and flapping above the peaked blue waves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jolene sits in the Adirondack chair on her small deck, watching Michael and Carl teaching Lulu how to fly a kite. Betsy and Seth run along behind, laughing, waving their hands in the air. Mila is their adoring, cheering audience. The day smells of kelp steaming on the rocks and charcoal burning down to ash in the barbecue pit.</p><p>Every few seconds, someone yells: \u201cLook, Mom!\u201d and she looks up, smiling and waving. It isn\u2019t that she can\u2019t walk along the beach. In her new prosthesis, she can do almost anything\u2014she runs, she skips, she chases after her five-year-old. She even wears shorts and rarely feels self-conscious.</p><p>She is here, separate from them, because she has something to do ... something she\u2019s been putting off. She can\u2019t do it with them, but neither can she quite do it without them.</p><p>Lulu\u2019s giggle floats on the air.</p> <p>Jolene reaches down for the letter in her lap. Her hand shakes as she picks it up and sees her name in her best friend\u2019s handwriting.</p><p>At last. After months of therapy, she is past the time when words can break her. Or, she hopes she is.</p><p>She eases the seal open, feels it resist for a second and then give. The letter is written on plain copier paper. She can imagine Tami on that last day before they left, with her clothes piled in a heap on her bed and her duffle bag by the floor. She would have rushed around, looking for something to write on, and probably curse that she\u2019d forgotten to buy stationery. Tami was like that; she remembered all of life\u2019s big things, but the little details had often passed her by.</p><p>Jo</p><p>If you\u2019re reading this, it didn\u2019t go the way I wanted over there. It\u2019s funny, I never thought I\u2019d die. I pictured you and me lasting forever, sitting on your deck, watching our kids grow up while we managed to stay young. I hope that\u2019s where you are now. In a deck chair, with a fire going in the pit. I hope Michael and Carl are down with the kids on the beach. Is my chair empty beside you?</p> <p>Jolene looks up, into the clear blue sky. An eagle flies past, dives deeply into the blue water, and comes up with a bright silver salmon in its beak, dripping water on Jolene as it soars to the top of an evergreen.</p><p>Don\u2019t be whining about how much you miss me. Of course you miss me. Wherever I am, I miss you, too. But you know all that. From the time we met, we knew everything that mattered about each other, didn\u2019t we? We just knew. I guess that\u2019s what best friends are: parts of each other. So you\u2019ll have that with you, have me with you.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to get maudlin. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve cried enough tears for me to fill the bay. I know I would cry for you.</p><p>God, Jo, we had it all, didn\u2019t we? That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about now, on a sunny day when I\u2019ve been asked to think about my death.</p><p>Here\u2019s what matters: take care of my baby. My Seth. It\u2019s hard to even write his name. My damn pen is shaking. Make sure he knows me. Me. There are bits of me that only you can share. Tell him about my dorky sense of humor, how I used to cry when he hit a baseball in Little League, what dreams I had for him. Make him know that I was more than his mother; I was his champion. Tell him that sometimes when I laugh too hard, I sound like a seal. Help him remember me. That\u2019s my last request of you.</p><p>And that you take care of yourself. That, too. Michael loves you and you love him. I hope to shit you haven\u2019t blown that. If you have, I will definitely haunt you.</p> <p>I know that sadness has stalked you in your life, Jo, from early on. I saw you fight it and win. You always won. But maybe now it\u2019s harder. Maybe you should give in to it just enough. We\u2019re all sad sometimes. I\u2019m sad right now, thinking of you reading this letter. But I want to look down (God\u2014I hope it\u2019s down and not up) and see you flying, running, laughing, living your life to the fullest.</p><p>Play without a net, flygirl. Because even from here, I\u2019ve got your six.</p><p>Always.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>T</p><p>Jolene folds the letter into thirds and slips it back into the envelope. She knows she will read it a hundred more times in her life. Whenever she needs to remember.</p><p>For a brief, beautiful second, she looks in the chair beside her and sees Tami there, her head thrown back, laughing, saying something Jolene can\u2019t quite hear.</p><p>\u201cLook, Mom!\u201d Betsy says running up to her. \u201cWe found a yellow ribbon on the beach.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene smiles and rises to her feet. She takes the ribbon in her hand, feeling its satiny softness between her fingers. She can\u2019t help thinking of Tami\u2019s ribbons. Of Smitty\u2019s ribbons. Of yellow ribbons on trees all across the country. To her, yellow will always be the color of good-bye.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Betsy says, looking up at her. \u201cAre you ready to come to the beach yet? We\u2019re waiting.\u201d</p><p>Jolene holds up the ribbon, watches it flutter in the breeze; then she loosens her hold on it, lets it fly up into the blue, blue sky. Sunlight blinds her for a moment, swallows the strip of fabric, and takes it away. Good-bye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she says quietly, taking her daughter\u2019s hand.</p><p>Smiling, she walks down to the beach to join her family. </p> </body></html>"]
