That\u2019s it. I go to school, come home, read, and then fall asleep in the silence of my house while feeling the lingering sensation of death omens that I\u2019ve felt that day. When I shut my eyes, I see the faces of the dead I saw\u2014my curse, my weakness, my torture.</p><p>Today was a rough day because I saw Asher, or so I thought, but when I went up to him, it was just a guy with black hair who looked like him. When I stopped the guy, shouting out Asher\u2019s name, he looked at me like I was a lunatic, especially when he realized I was Ember Rose Edwards, town weirdo that everyone believes is a murderer.</p><p>I ended up leaving school early and going home to read, like I do every day, hoping I can find something that will give me a clue as to what the hell my purpose is. What I face in the future if I become the last Grim Angel standing. How I will know when I am the last one standing. Or, better yet, how I can get rid of the Anamotti, a secret society group of Reapers who banded together to eliminate the Grim Angels one by one, including me.</p> <p>I\u2019ve become a huge target with them lately and fighting the insanity by myself, well, it\u2019s getting harder. I feel my mind bending in ways I haven\u2019t thought were possible. I black out sometimes. Hear voices. See death. And the worst part is, I have no one.</p><p>I stop writing as the painful truth throbs in my chest. I stare down at the page I just filled up with pretty much the same words as the day before. \u201cGod, I\u2019m becoming so repetitive.\u201d Deciding I need a break from writing, I close my journal and exchange it for a book; the one Raven gave me about Grim Reapers and Angels of Death during the Halloween dance about a month ago. I recline against the headboard of my bed, propping my knees up and putting the book on my lap. Then I find the spot where I left off last night, where the topic shifts from how a Reaper removes a soul to some sort of hidden realm.</p><p>There is a place between life and death where souls that carry the blood of the Reapers can roam freely. It\u2019s known as the shadow realm, a barrier between life and death. The area allows Reapers to see into the world yet stay undetected, hidden in a shadow which cannot be seen by anyone that doesn\u2019t possess Reaper blood. This allows them to wreak havoc on unsuspecting victims...</p><p>Shadow realm? Is that how Reapers stay so well hidden? How they can appear out of nowhere?</p><p>In the warped and twisted part of my mind, I wonder if I can see this shadow realm since I have Reaper blood inside me. I wonder if I could enter it. I wonder what this means about me. How much evil thrives inside me, how much of my Reaper blood owns me?</p> <p>I decide to add the shadow realm information to the list on the wall of stuff I\u2019ve discovered about Grim Angels over the last few weeks, which isn\u2019t a hell of a lot, but it\u2019s better than nothing. I grab a marker from my nightstand and move to the Angel painted on my wall that Raven drew. Below the feet, I\u2019ve started a list of things I\u2019ve discovered about Grim Angels:</p><p>1) Grim Angels can see death.</p><p>2) They experience blackouts, lose track of time, and sometimes hear voices.</p><p>3) They were created because there was a battle over the control of human\u2019s souls between the Angels of Death and Grim Reapers.</p><p>4) Angel and Reaper blood runs through Grim Angel veins to create a balance between the species so neither of them can steal souls.</p><p>5) They\u2019re what binds Angels and Reapers to earth as a punishment for getting in the battle to begin with, which makes them a target of torture even though they\u2019re supposed to remain untouched. Reapers have broken the rules, though, and try to drive Grim Angels into insanity or to give into their evil blood.</p> <p>The problem with number five is that the only person who can punish the Reapers and Angels for breaking the rules is their leader, and Asher told me his leader, Michael, won\u2019t do that. Then there\u2019s the fact that, of course, the Reaper\u2019s leader doesn\u2019t give a shit. It\u2019s a weeding out process for them to get to the last Grim Angel because the last one standing has to make a choice; if good or bad will rule over all souls. If the Reapers or Angels will win. There\u2019s more to it than that, though. One of Asher\u2019s last words was that I needed to find out what happened to the last Grim Angel, but I have yet to discover anything about that.</p><p>This\u2019s all I\u2019ve really discovered so far and it\u2019s frustrating.</p><p>I sigh and pen another fact below the list:</p><p>6) Shadow Realm\u2014those with Reaper blood in them can hide in this place between life and death, go around unnoticed, torturing their victims.</p><p>After I\u2019m finished, I put the pen down and go back to reading, hoping for more answers.</p><p>Since Grim Reapers walk around without their victims knowing they exist, they have easy access into their thoughts and the way they make decisions. It allows them to torture in the most maddening ways. Most of the Reapers have spent time in the realm, enjoying their true nature of observing humans before they take their souls.</p><p>I shudder, thinking of how Cameron has spied on me many times and how I always wondered how he did it.</p><p>However, the Grim Reapers are more known for watching Grim Angels behind the veil than anything. Although many believe that Grim Reapers simply want to torture Grim Angels in order to win the battle and win souls, there are some that believe there is a deeper reason for the madness. There have been several reports made over the centuries of Reapers taking the souls of the Grim Angels and collecting them for purposes unknown. There have also been many speculations of these purposes ranging from gaining power to achieving the ultimate immortality.</p> <p>It was once believed that Grim Angels\u2019 souls were untouchable because they neither belong to the Angels, the Reapers or the humans, since they\u2019re a balance of all three. And there are many that still believe that to be true, however the facts show that Grim Reapers have found ways around these rules and there have been reports of them not only being able to steal innocent souls even after the battle, but have also stolen Grim Angel souls, which hold more power than any other soul, since they\u2019re connected to all three worlds. But for a very long time the question still remained: how were they doing it?</p><p>After multiple counts of research, I\u2019ve been led to believe that it is possible through the et furabatur de Anima tenebroso. The process of the et furabatur de Anima tenebroso could quite possibly remove the soul of a Grim Angel. Depending on how it is looked at, there is a benefit that could come with removal of a soul with the et furabatur de Anima tenebroso because a Grim Angel\u2019s soul contains a lot of power. In fact it has enough power to free pure souls trapped by Reaper possession.</p><p>As the page ends, my heart knocks in my chest at what I just read. I hurry and turn it, eager to read more while also afraid of where this might be going. Afraid that I might read something that could possibly tempt me to give up my own soul to free the people I care about.</p><p>Anima tenebroso est fere impossibile furari, non tamen est possibile. Sed determinatio temporis et magnis. De contritione et magnis triste minantes Angeli.</p><p>\u201cNo... no... no. No.\u201d I quickly fan through the next couple of pages, but have no such luck finding anything I can read. \u201cIt\u2019s all written in Latin.\u201d</p><p>I comb through the pages for a little bit longer, as though it will somehow miraculously turn the words into English again. But it doesn\u2019t, so I put it aside on my nightstand and go downstairs to get my laptop, hoping I can translate some of the words online.</p><p>I turn on the living room light, letting the pale light fill up the room, and put some brightness into the depression of the emptiness. The silence of the house is depressingly familiar, but it\u2019s how it\u2019s been for weeks. My mom is still gone, getting treatment for her drug addiction and my brother, Ian, has barely been around since I questioned him about the photo I found of Alyssa. He\u2019s either avoiding me or plotting my death; I can never be too sure anymore who plays on what side.</p><p>I collect my laptop from the coffee table and turn for the stairway with it tucked under my arm. As I reach the doorway, I get the strangest feeling that someone is watching me, but I try my best to shake it off, figuring I\u2019m probably extra jumpy because of what I just read... Still, I can\u2019t help noting all the shadows in the room as well as on the walls, moving with the branches outside. None of them seem to move towards me, so I go back upstairs, desperate to figure out how exactly Grim Reapers steal Grim Angels\u2019 souls and what happens to people possessed by them.</p><p>As I\u2019m passing by my mom\u2019s room, I try not to look inside, but I can\u2019t help it when the door\u2019s agape. My blood still stains the carpet from when she stabbed me before I took her life so I wouldn\u2019t die. She still blames me for it. The few times I\u2019ve talked to her, she reminded me that I\u2019m a killer, just like my father. That I killed my grandmother and tried to kill her. That she doesn\u2019t want me. Sometimes I wonder if she\u2019s possessed, too, if I\u2019ve lost her to the Reapers yet, but I haven\u2019t seen her in person for weeks, so it\u2019s hard to be certain.</p><p>Finally, I rip my gaze off the blood on the carpet and go back into my room. I sit down on my bed, open up the laptop, and wait for it to boot up. My room has gotten noticeably colder and, if it\u2019s even possible, the house seems quieter. I glance over my shoulder, noticing that my window is cracked open. I try to remember if I had it open before, yet that is ridiculous since it\u2019s the end of November and freezing. No, someone\u2019s been in my room.</p><p>I set the computer aside and stand up. \u201cIs someone in here?\u201d</p><p>I scan the room for where I left my knife when I notice the nightstand is empty and my heart stops. The book. It\u2019s gone. \u201cShit,\u201d I curse, rushing over to the window. I open it wider and peer down at the ground below. There\u2019s nothing but shadows below the light of the moon and I can\u2019t see a damn thing in order to tell if someone\u2019s down there, running away, or watching me.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d Letting out a frustrated sigh, I lean back in, shut the window and lock it.</p><p>Irritation soars through me. That book was the only thing that had information about Grim Angels and now it\u2019s gone, right when I was getting to something that could perhaps explain how to free pure souls. What\u2019s even worse are the possibilities of who took it. The Anamotti. Cameron. Another Reaper. Raven. One of the walking dead.</p><p>I start to sink down on the bed, aggravated beyond words, when a shadow forms on the wall. At first I think it\u2019s from the moving branches outside my window, but then it takes the shape of a tall figure that moves whimsically. My heart slams in my chest as I jump to my feet, debating whether to run or chase the damn thing down because I\u2019m guessing it took the book.</p><p>It turns around when I reach the middle of my room and starts to circle around me with its eyes glowing black like cinders. I back away but end up walking right through it as it darts behind me. I stumble and fall as a cold chill spirals through my body. My legs give out on me and I land on my bed, instantly covering my face as the shadow dives for me, aiming straight for my mouth. I shut my eyes, feeling it entering me by the cold that seeps into my body and spreads. My pulse slows while my breathing decreases, and for a moment, I think I\u2019m going to die again. But then, everything gets extremely quiet as I wait for it kill me, steal my soul. Instead, the cold starts to evaporate from my body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a minute or two goes by, I dare to open my eyes and can\u2019t see it anywhere. I check over my body, which seems fine. When I sit up, the shadow is gone and my room empty. And I\u2019m left wondering if something hiding in the Shadow Realm\u2014something that\u2019s been watching me\u2014swept out and took the book because it didn\u2019t want me to find out what was on those pages.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>I\u2019ve gone crazy. Mad. I\u2019ve fallen off the deep end. Crash. Burn. Ember is no more. In her place is this weak girl who\u2019s swiftly sinking into the darkness. My mind doesn\u2019t belong to me anymore. No matter which way I express it, it sounds equally as bad. But it\u2019s the truth. Day after day, I roam around alone, unable to trust anyone as I search for answers that will lead me to the truth.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen the shadow since it showed up that night about a couple of weeks ago, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it and how it swept out of nowhere and took the book right at the moment when I was about to find out about freeing people from possession. I wonder if it was a Reaper in the shadow realm. I wonder if it was Cameron.</p> <p>I wonder a lot of things. The biggest one, though, is that I think I\u2019m going crazy. That maybe I didn\u2019t see the shadow at all. I\u2019m always drifting further and further towards where the Anamotti want me.</p><p>I\u2019m also really lonely. I can\u2019t get enough control of my mind to see passed the loneliness, so I just wander.</p><p>Aimlessly.</p><p>Every day.</p><p>To places I don\u2019t want to go, doing things that I don\u2019t want to do. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me.</p> <p>Those were the words I wrote just before I headed out tonight, despite the fact that there\u2019s a town curfew in place due to the frequent deaths and disappearances that have happened over the weeks.</p><p>I took the back way out of my house to avoid the police, who have been watching me since Asher left me. Two detectives park out front of my home every night and sometimes during the day. They\u2019re watching me and the street I live on because they think I had something to do with McKenzie\u2019s death and the other girls who have turned up missing or dead over the last few weeks in Hollows Grove. I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s causing it all, whether it\u2019s the Reapers or someone else, but I do know who killed McKenzie\u2014her dad, who is sort of an important figure in town since he\u2019s rich.</p><p>My initial plan when I left the house was to go to the cemetery. It\u2019s the last place I saw Asher, and for some reason, it always gives me comfort; like I didn\u2019t imagine him, even though I\u2019m starting to believe that I did. That he is just a ghost or a fading memory created from insanity. However somehow I find myself making a detour for reasons unknown.</p><p>I end up heading towards the outskirts of the town, taking the longest route possible as I hike along the path next to the river. I pass by a few people, but pay no attention to them because they seem out of place just lingering near the riverbed, which probably means they\u2019re dead. It\u2019s become a daily thing for me. The dead. Everywhere. They\u2019re as common as living people now.</p><p>It\u2019s chillier than it normally is in Hollows Grove and I\u2019m trembling uncontrollably, even with my leather jacket on. I want to go home, back to the warmth and safety of my room, yet I can\u2019t stop moving forward passed the rustic metal warehouses nestled in the dark crevasses of the town. My feet move impulsively with each step and when I finally stop walking, I\u2019m standing in front of the entrance to an underground club located at the edge of town; one I didn\u2019t even know existed. It\u2019s a short, metal building that has a single door, which is open with music blasting inside. I show the bouncer my ID and even though I\u2019m only nineteen, he lets me through with zero hesitation.</p><p>When I enter, sweat, mustiness and flashing lights immediately surround me. I move with hesitation passed the people, down the stairs and to the dance floor in the center of the room. I don\u2019t know why I go there, since I hate touching people, yet I push my way to the middle of the sweaty bodies because it\u2019s what the voice inside my head tells me to do.</p> <p>Once there, I start to dance, waiting for whatever comes next, and moments later, I feel it; why I\u2019m here. That I\u2019m searching for death, but not just any death; a specific one full of feathers and capes\u2014Reapers and Angels. In fact, it\u2019s begging me to find it; find the Reaper, find the Angel. Pick. Choose. Life. Death. I want to run, but the unseen force is compelling me to stay put. Let loose. Dance. So I do.</p><p>Sweat drenches my skin and the heat of the stuffy room sears through my veins like liquid fire. I can barely breathe through my leather corset, black pants and lace-up boots while the lacy choker on my neck is binding. The music is so deafening it pulsates through my body, pounds at my eardrums and vibrates up and down my legs.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m melting, drowning in hot wax, as the deaths of the people around me drench my body. Blood. Agony. Can\u2019t breathe. Silence. Peace. Metal crunching, buckling, bending. Suffocating. Blood. Death. Blood. Death.</p><p>God, I miss Asher\u2019s quiet.</p><p>I force my brain to function passed the pain and horror as I hunt for a death, hoping that when I find it, I\u2019ll be free from what\u2019s drawing me to this place and maybe, just maybe, I can finally get some answers to what\u2019s causing this. Is it something to do with my Grim Angel blood or is it the Anamotti? Cameron? What is it?</p><p>As the song switches to one with deep bass, I\u2019m jerked from my thoughts. I put my hands up in the air and shut my eyes, allowing myself to drown painfully in the deaths of others around me while my black hair falls out of its ties and sticks to the back of my neck and shoulders. The stench of alcohol and sweat engulfs me and, with every contact of skin, I see omens. Falling. Helpless. Disease. Knife. Blood. Stab. Blood. Full moon. Night sky. Gravel. Building. Blood on the ground, on hands. Capes. Feathers.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to say it aloud, but it really doesn\u2019t matter since the music is so deafening that the sound of my voice gets lost in the rhythm. My hands fall to my sides as I open my eyes and hunt my surroundings for the person\u2019s death I felt, but all I can see are people grinding up against each other with their heads tipped back as they veer towards ecstasy.</p><p>I whirl around to skim the thick crowd behind me, however they cram tighter together as the tempo of the music picks up and everyone goes wild; hands flailing in the air, elbows and knees bumping me from every direction. Shoving my way out, I make my way towards the back of the room to the elongated bar packed with people ordering drinks and flirting with each other. By the time I approach the edge of the dance floor, I\u2019m panting from the intoxication of death, losing control over my curse and my body. My mind. I try to fight it, knowing I don\u2019t want to be here\u2014knowing I didn\u2019t come here on my own\u2014yet I can\u2019t seem to escape.</p> <p>\u201cI need to get out of here,\u201d I mutter in panic as I fan my hand in front of my damp face.</p><p>I\u2019m about ready to sprint for the grated stairway that will take me outside, when I spot a lofty figure with a dark hood pulled over their head, looming near the door. The green glow of the exit sign shines down on their face as fear races through my veins, more potent than the adrenaline I felt on the dance floor I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Cameron or some other Reaper, but it\u2019s what I was looking for tonight\u2014I can feel it in my bones and my thoughts: Go to him. Choose Death.</p><p>I shove my fears aside and lightly brush my fingers along the pocketknife in the back pocket of my jeans. Then I push through the people and stride towards the Reaper. The music gets rowdier and the floor vibrates beneath my shoes as I trot up the stairs. The closer I get, the fiercer my heart knocks against my chest, and by the time I take a step onto the final stairs, I\u2019m lightheaded from the rush, gripping onto the railing for support.</p><p>I pause at the top, staring at the Reaper near the doorway while wondering who\u2019s behind the cape. No one else seems to notice it, which is typical since most people don\u2019t see Death walking around. The Reaper seems oblivious of me, though, its soulless eyes focused on the crowd below.</p><p>I want to turn away\u2014run\u2014but I can\u2019t deny the invisible pull I feel towards it, so I gradually make my way across the slender balcony, one foot in front of the other. When I\u2019m about within arm\u2019s reach, the Reaper suddenly turns, whipping its cape around, and the fabric grazes my cheek. I trip back, stumbling over my boots and blinking my eyes against the sting. When my vision focuses again, it\u2019s gone and the door is slamming shut.</p><p>Run after him.</p><p>I chase after it, my legs and hands moving on their own as I retrieve the knife and burst through the door to the outside and into the cold breeze. It\u2019s nearing wintertime and the ground is glazed with ice; the moon massive in the starry sky. The buildings that enclose the alley are vacant, boarded up, closed down. The only signs of life are coming from a burning barrel down the alley to my right with a few homeless people standing around it, talking and drinking what looks like a bottle of whiskey.</p><p>I don\u2019t see the Reaper anywhere, but I hear the flap of a cape to my left, so I dash off into that direction.</p><p>Hurry, faster.</p><p>My legs and fingers tremble as I chase death, even though I don\u2019t want to. At all. Reapers only have one purpose with me and that\u2019s to fuck with my mind and try to drive me to the point of insanity. What if it\u2019s Cameron? What if I get lost in him like I did in the cemetery? What if he tries to take over my body again?</p><p>Stop thinking so much and just go to him.</p><p>I round the corner of the small building the club\u2019s hidden beneath, slamming to a stop in the dark alley. There\u2019s nothing at the end other than a chain link fence and shadows. Everywhere. Dancing all around me. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s causing them, although some of them move like the one that was in my room.</p><p>Wanting to get the hell out of there while, at the same time, feeling the connection of whatever made me come here breaking, I spin back around to leave. Mid-turn, I hear someone walk up behind me and a soft flap of a cape.</p><p>Kill them.</p><p>My muscles tighten as I turn on my heels with the knife aimed out. Seconds later, the tip of it knocks against something solid and I end up slashing it straight across their chest. Deep, too. I horridly feel the sensation of the knife enter the fabric then the muscles, nicking a bone. Then blood gushes out as the knife snags their skin and tears it open. As the warm blood splatters over my skin, hair and clothes, I realize that the Reaper is no longer wearing a cape but a jacket, jeans and a torn T-shirt.</p><p>Because the Reaper\u2019s not a Reaper, it\u2019s a human.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I drop the knife to the ground. I just stabbed someone.</p><p>I stare at the person I just stabbed in horror as they clutch their chest and collapse to the asphalt, our gazes locking as he fights to breathe and keep his heart beating.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014what did I...\u201d I drop to my knees beside the guy, the wound still spurting out blood. He looks around my age, blood soaking his hair and clothes, fear in his eyes, like he can see his death, see what\u2019s coming for him. \u201cShit....\u201d Shock waves through me. I have to do something. Stop this! Help him!</p><p>I glance around the empty alleyway and then press my hand down on his chest to attempt to stop the bleeding. As blood soaks against my hand, his death omen soaks my mind. Knife. Stab. Blood on hands and ground. Me, kneeling over him as he takes his last breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh my God!</p><p>What should I do? Run? Call the police? Finish him off?</p><p>I shove the last thought from my head and put more pressure on the guy\u2019s chest as it unstably rises and descends. \u201cJust hang on,\u201d I beg, reaching for my phone in my back pocket, knowing that whatever happens, it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p><p>He continues to look at me, gasping for air, his lips parting. \u201cI know where your father...\u201d he gasps, choking on a mouthful of blood.</p> <p>Every muscle in my body winds tightly into knots. \u201cWhat about my father?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, blood trickling from his lips and down his chin \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d he gasps again then the movement of his chest stills and his head slumps to the side.</p><p>Terror courses through me as I realize what this means.</p><p>That I\u2019ve just committed murder.</p><p>Chapter 2</p> <p>Murder. The word weighs heavily in my mind. I\u2019ve been called a murderer many times since my father disappeared, but there\u2019s never been any real truth behind it.</p><p>Yet now there is.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper, panicking, my hands trembling against his unmoving chest. I straighten my legs and drag my bloody hand through my hair as I stagger back. \u201cNo... no... no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter how many times you say it, he\u2019s still going to be dead.\u201d The sound of the voice sends a shiver of fear and anger through me. When his breath then caresses the back of my neck, my hairs stand on end. I know I should run, but I\u2019m bound in place, my feet no longer under my control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, princess,\u201d Cameron whispers against my ear then nibbles on my earlobe.</p><p>The slight sting of his teeth grazing my skin snaps me out of my trance enough that I\u2019m able to turn around and face him. Through the dark, he still looks as hauntingly beautiful as he did the last time I saw him. His long, black cape flows to the ground with the hood drawn down so I can see his perfectly carved facial features. His eyes blend in with the night, his hair pale as the moonlight, his skin like porcelain and his long, lean arms are outstretched towards me, begging me to come closer.</p> <p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d I manage to say, however I\u2019m unable to back away from him; my arms remain at my sides and my feet are frozen in place. \u201cYou have to go... I don\u2019t want you here and if I tell you to leave then you have to.\u201d</p><p>He mockingly waves his finger at me, tsking. \u201cNow, Ember, be careful what you ask. I just might do what you tell me to do.\u201d His gaze skims to the dead guy on the ground just behind me, \u201cand then you\u2019ll be left by yourself to clean up the mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your help,\u201d I hiss. \u201cNow leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he questions with mockery in his tone. \u201cAre you sure you want me to leave you to clean up this mess alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d I stammer, my confidence draining from me as I stare down at the dead body just behind me and the pool of blood on the ground around him.</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow at me as I return my attention to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound so sure.\u201d He reaches forward and brushes a finger just underneath my chin, shutting his eyes as the moonlight highlights the blissfulness in his expression. \u201cGod, how I\u2019ve missed the feel of your skin... so soft.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I get swept away by the sound of his voice, but then Asher\u2019s face flashes through my mind and I fling Cameron\u2019s hand off me and stumble back. \u201cHow can you miss something you barely touched?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou only touched me a few times and only because you took away my willpower.\u201d</p><p>His arm falls to his side and a hint of anger flickers in his eyes. \u201cIs that what you tell yourself to make yourself feel better about everything you did with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did nothing with you,\u201d I protest. \u201cNothing I wanted to do, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He steps forward, reducing the space between us. \u201cAre you absolutely certain about that? That you felt no connection at all with me? That I didn\u2019t make your body feel things it never has before.\u201d His voice drops to a husky tone as his fingers graze my hips. \u201cThat it was all mind control? That your mind is so weak that I can make it do whatever I want just by whispering to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I open my mouth to argue, but the words are thick in my throat and I realize something. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who compelled me here, aren\u2019t you? Like how you made me stay at the cemetery with you\u2014confused me and made my body immobile?\u201d I ask. His silence and condescending expression says it all. \u201cDo you know something about this?\u201d I gesture at the body, remembering what he said just before he died. \u201cThe guy said he knew something about my father.... Do you know what he\u2019s talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you feel better about all of this if it was me compelling you here? That I have that much power over you? That I affect you that much?\u201d he asks, avoiding my last question about my dad. \u201cOr worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d I feel incredibly confused.</p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d Cameron says haughtily. \u201cI think you secretly like me and you won\u2019t admit it.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at him. \u201cI...\u201d The words won\u2019t leave my mouth. What is wrong with me? Is it me or Cameron making it impossible for me to deny that I have feelings for him?</p><p>The longer the silence drifts between us, the smugger Cameron looks until his ego is so swollen that I seriously want to smack him upside the head. Instead, I reach up and touch his face. His skin is unshaven and rough against my fingers. He lets me feel his face as his eyes stay unreadable. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m doing it; why I\u2019m touching him. Whether it\u2019s him possessing my mind or that the time I\u2019ve spent away from him has made me realize... something. Everything is so vague, so unknown. All I know is that I can\u2019t control myself.</p><p>Finally, he breaks the connection by leaning to the side and glancing at the ground behind me. \u201cThat was quite the brutal slaying. I didn\u2019t know you had it in you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my God. How have I forgotten in just a few moments that I\u2019ve killed someone? Reality slaps me in the face, hard and cold and sharp.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d I stammer, my expression falling at the sight of the body and vomit threatens to rise up my throat. \u201cI thought it was you.\u201d I look back at Cameron who\u2019s watching me intently. \u201cAnd I...\u201d</p><p>A wicked smile spreads across his face. \u201cSo you were trying to kill me?\u201d he asks amusedly.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what I was trying to do... maybe you should tell me since you seem to have so much control over what I do.\u201d</p><p>He assesses me closely, just a few steps away from me. \u201cWell, you missed, if I was the initial target.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem that upset,\u201d he speculates as I rub my hands up and down my arms from the shivers of the cold or perhaps shock, I\u2019m not sure which one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel anything,\u201d I admit, noting the sudden lack of feeling in my body. \u201cWhy is that...?\u201d I abruptly shove him back, but he barely budges. \u201cWait, are you doing it to me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs nonchalantly while staring at me stoically. \u201cMaybe. If I was, would you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate, afraid of feeling the pain that comes with taking a life. How bad will it hurt? As bad or as worse as when I lost my father? \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d I struggle with what\u2019s right and wrong, ultimately I nod. \u201cI want to feel it... feel what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He stares at me and seconds later I\u2019m blasted with emotions so powerful that it feels like I\u2019m going to split open from the pressure. \u201cAre you still sure you want to feel it?\u201d he asks, observing me like I\u2019m the most fascinating thing that\u2019s ever existed. \u201cBecause I can numb your body. It\u2019s one of my many talents.\u201d He says it with pride.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be numb.\u201d I wrap my arms around myself, piercing my fingernails into my skin as I collapse to the ground on my knees. It feels like thousands of needles have lodged into my skin, tearing at me as they fill me with remorse and guilt, fear and confusion. My head is pounding, my heart racing. I feel like I\u2019m going to explode. Or die myself. It\u2019s unbearable. Aching. Noisy</p><p>Then it abruptly gets quiet and still.</p><p>I angle my chin up at Cameron. \u201cI said I want to feel.\u201d</p><p>Cameron rolls his eyes and then bends his knees and crouches down in front of me. \u201cQuit being a drama queen over nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver nothing?\u201d I question through gritted teeth. \u201cI just killed... I just killed someone.\u201d I nearly choke on the words. \u201cSomeone who might have known something about my father, unless you put those words in his mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I can fix it,\u201d he says simply, avoid the questioning about my father again. \u201cAll you need to do is ask me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s indecipherable, untrustworthy. He\u2019s death in its evilest form, yet I find myself saying, \u201cThen do it.\u201d I hate to go to a place where I might owe him, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to be responsible for a murder, especially when he said something about my father. \u201cIf you can, then prove it to me. Bring him back.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, tucking strands of my hair behind my ear. \u201cNot without a price, princess. You should know that already.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes. \u201cNo way. I refuse to make bargains with you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs again, then straightens his legs and rises to his feet. \u201cWell, then I guess I\u2019ll just take his soul and get going.\u201d</p><p>He starts to wind around me, however I jump to my feet, sidestepping him and barricading his path with my hands out to the sides of me. Our bodies are flush against one another, our heat mixing and stifling even though cold air circulates around me</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d I say, my voice unsteady. \u201cI won\u2019t let you take his soul.\u201d</p><p>He cups my chin with a wicked glint in his eyes. \u201cYou know as well as I do that you have no control over this situation.\u201d Then he lets me go and nudges me out of the way, heading for the guy on the ground. He starts to bend down towards him.</p><p>\u201cWait. \u201c I race after him, and without even thinking, I throw myself on his back, wrapping my arms and legs around him. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, just don\u2019t take his soul. Let him live... please, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder at me. \u201cYou want me to bring him back?\u201d he asks, his eyes darkening with desire.</p><p>I unenthusiastically nod. \u201cYes, please... I never meant to kill him and I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t want to be responsible for that.\u201d I slide off his back and plant my feet back onto the ground, releasing a breath as Cameron turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cAnd who says I have the ability to do that?\u201d he questions. His voice comes off a little shaky and high-pitched, like he\u2019s gotten really nervous, which is strange. The Cameron I know is cocky and arrogant all the damn time. I must have struck a nerve or something. \u201cWho says that I can raise the dead?\u201d His forced laughter rings around us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me, Cameron.\u201d I poke him in his solid chest with my finger, pretending to be more confident than I really am. \u201cI know you can\u2014you just said you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said I could fix this,\u201d he states condescendingly, attempting to mess with my head. He deliberates something for a moment and then his mouth curves upward into a sly grin. \u201cWhat if I said I could do it?\u201d He strolls around me at nearly an inhumane speed, swishing his cape, ending up behind me and leaning right over my shoulder. \u201cWhat would you give me to use this gift?\u201d His voice touches my ear, causing me to shudder.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I already have a speculation of what he wants from me and that thought only grows when his finger drifts up my spine.</p><p>\u201cI think you already know,\u201d he whispers, nuzzling his cheek against mine as he grinds his hips against my backside.</p> <p>My muscles ravel and I feel like fleeing, but I force myself to stand motionless. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore specific than this.\u201d His fingers roam from my back to my hips then his palms flatten and glide up my sides and along the curves of my breasts. I cringe, vomit burning at the back of my throat as a shiver coils through my body. I don\u2019t know what I want. I\u2019m conflicted. Lost. Probably because he\u2019s fucking with my head and not letting me feel my true emotions.</p><p>I open my mouth to tell him to stop, but then he gropes my breast, his fingers drifting underneath the top of the corset and to my nipples. \u201cSay yes; you\u2019ll give me whatever I want,\u201d he whispers in my ear, his voice somewhere between a demand and a pleading groan. His hips writhe forward again, his hardness pressing against my ass. \u201cSay yes, and I\u2019ll bring him back to life. You won\u2019t have to have his blood on your hands.\u201d</p><p>I want to scream no! That he is probably the one who brought me here to begin with and that he probably made me do this only so I would owe him. That nothing is worth something that involves me owing him, yet as I stare down at the guy\u2019s lifeless body, thinking about his family and friends and how much it\u2019ll hurt when they find out he\u2019s gone, I know that I\u2019ll do anything to spare them the pain I know all too well.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I choke. \u201cBring him back to life and I\u2019ll give you what you want.\u201d</p> <p>He lets out a growl and then rubs his hips one more time against me before his fingers leave my corset. \u201cI\u2019m slightly disappointed you gave in so easily.\u201d He backs away from me and hunches over the body. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be a little more difficult to break down.\u201d He glances at me as I press my hand to my aching chest, realizing what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>It feels like I\u2019ve handed my soul over to him on a silver platter. My thoughts drift back to the poem I wrote on my wall this morning as I try to figure out my true feelings about this situation.</p><p>Light and darkness</p><p>Death and life</p><p>Wrong and right</p><p>Need and want</p> <p>So far apart.</p><p>Yet so closely connected.</p><p>I blink my focus back to Cameron, sinking to my knees on the asphalt as he lifts up his cape, shielding my view from whatever he\u2019s doing. I hear the sound of wind, although I can\u2019t feel it. I can hear my heart beating, but again, I can\u2019t feel it. Then I feel and hear nothing except silence.</p><p>Moments later, Cameron lowers his cape back down and steps back as the guy pushes to his feet, bloody, with his shirt torn, but the slash in his chest is mended and he\u2019s breathing. As he turns around towards me, the guy looks straight through me. It makes me wonder if he\u2019s under some sort of Reaper possession.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say about my father?\u201d I ask, stepping towards him. \u201cRight before I...\u201d I trail off as he starts to turn towards the alleyway, ready to leave. But I lunge forward and snag the sleeve of his shirt. \u201cYou said you know where he is.\u201d</p><p>The guy shakes his head without looking at me. \u201cI know nothing.\u201d</p><p>I clutch onto his shirt. \u201cYes, you do. Please, just tell me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head again, so I jerk on his arm, acting more violent than I normally do. \u201cJust tell me,\u201d I growl, enraged.</p> <p>Arms abruptly slip around my waist and draw me back. My fingers slip from the guy\u2019s sleeve and I let out a growl, fighting against Cameron\u2014kicking, screaming, shouting\u2014solely focused on the fact that he\u2019s keeping me away from someone who may know something about my father.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Cameron!\u201d I cry, writhing my body.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say a word as he holds me back, acting as though my kicking and screaming is nothing to him. Then, without saying anything, the guy rounds the corner of the building and disappears into the night, taking the information about my father with him.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s grip on me loosens, and I instantly spin around to shove him back. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d I ask. \u201cHe acted like he didn\u2019t even know what I was talking about... but I heard him say it before he died; he knew something about my dad.\u201d I turn to chase the guy down. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to find out what.\u201d</p><p>Cameron captures my arm, stopping me again. \u201cEmber, relax. He doesn\u2019t know anything about your father. I just put that in his head and made him say it.\u201d</p><p>My heart withers as I slowly turn to face him. \u201cWhy would you do that? Just to mess with my head?\u201d</p><p>His expression is stoic as he continues to hold onto my arm. \u201cWho said I was messing with you? Maybe I know something about your father.\u201d</p><p>I want to shove him back and run; to get away from him because he has to be lying. Deep down, though\u2014in the bottom of my soul\u2014I wish that he wasn\u2019t and that\u2019s why I stay. \u201cDo you know something?\u201d</p><p>He crosses his arms. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you until you pay me back for bringing back that guy.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI know I should be saying thank you, but for some reason I have a feeling I\u2019m going to be thanking you without words.\u201d I force myself to look up at him and immediately wish I didn\u2019t because the hunger in his eyes both terrifies me and excites me.</p><p>A smile creeps up on his face as he extends his hand to me. Begrudgingly, I slip my fingers through his. Then he jerks me against his body, our chests colliding.</p><p>\u201cYou can pretend you don\u2019t want this,\u201d he says, stroking a finger along my collarbone, \u201cbut we both know you do.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, unable to speak. \u201cJust get it over with. Whatever you\u2019re going to do to me. Then I\u2019m going to ask you questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do to you, it\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do to me,\u201d he says with a dark smile.</p><p>I swallow hard as my stomach lurches. \u201cFine, let me get it over with.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a low chuckle as he draws a line with his fingertip across the base of my neck to the other side of my collarbone. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Forcing air into my lungs, I obey, feeling the power he has over me. I hold my breath when I feel him shift and then his lips are hovering over mine. He takes my hands and places them on top of his chest where his heart is; that is, if he has a heart.</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d he whispers. \u201cTake the life inside of me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snap open and I try to retreat, but he holds me securely in place. \u201cWhat? No way.\u201d I shake my head swiftly.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you\u2019d do anything for me,\u201d he says, his voice gravelly as he presses on my lower back, forcing me to stay close to him. \u201cAnd this is what I want you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Besides, you\u2019re already dead. You don\u2019t even have life inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really believe that, then why are you so afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I trail off, feeling a sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach, like I just walked into a trap. Was any of this real? The club? The guy I stabbed? None of it really happen, did it?</p><p>\u201cFeel it,\u201d Cameron commands, ignoring me as he lowers his forehead against mine. \u201cTake my life from me, princess. I\u2019m asking you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I manage to say, but it\u2019s hard to speak because I feel the spark of life within him\u2014breathing, beating, fully alive and awake\u2014waiting for me to take it away, blow it out and make it mine. \u201cWhy do you want me to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says softly, his voice brimming with elation. \u201cWhat does matter is that you said you would and that deep down, in that place you won\u2019t admit exists, you know you want to feel it... the taste of a life from another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d I say, but it\u2019s a lie because, now that he\u2019s said it, I want to taste it. I feel myself falling towards him, like my body is sinking into his, but I\u2019m not the one moving. He is. Sinking into me, his life spilling into my veins, like smoldering flames that simmer out as soon as they touch me...</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d I try to pull away, but it\u2019s too late. His life engulfs me, hot and blazing, burning and breathing.</p><p>Moments later, the fire starts to fizzle and becomes heavy and thick, like tar running through my veins. I can taste the foulness of it, but at the same time\u2014within the distorted place I don\u2019t want to admit exists, the one created by the Reaper blood inside me\u2014I want it.</p><p>I want more.</p><p>When I push my hands forward, crushing them against Cameron\u2019s chest, he lets out a painful yet blissful moan as his head slants back and more life and sparks burst into me until his life is consuming every inch of my body. Heavy and weightless at the same time\u2014and somewhere between it all\u2014I get lost. I float away into the darkness. And in the midst of it, I swear I feel feathers touching me, but before I can figure out why, I collapse to the ground and drift off... somewhere...</p><p>You\u2019ll understand soon. What I want.</p><p>I try to make sense of the voice, but moments later, drift off into the blackness with feathers surrounding me. Then for the briefest moment, it feels like they\u2019re falling off me.</p><p>But I know that can\u2019t be right.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>I wake up screaming with my lungs heaving, terrified of what I\u2019ve just done. Murder. Death. Reapers. Evil. All of it connects with me and I half expect to burst into flames as I bolt upright. Yet, as my heart settles\u2014as I realize where I am\u2014I start to relax. I\u2019m not in the alleyway, but in my bed, surrounded by black and red walls that are sketched with mythical drawings and depressing poetry. A thin, black curtain hangs across the closet doorway that\u2019s decorated with photos of dead poets and authors along with a poem Cameron wrote a few weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a dream.\u201d I press my hand to my chest, relief washing over me as I realize the full extent of what this means. That I didn\u2019t kill someone and take some of Cameron\u2019s life, that Cameron didn\u2019t tell me he knows something about my father. It was just a dream and I\u2019m back to square one where I have nothing more than emptiness to accumulate my life.</p><p>I tell myself to calm down as I keep my eyes on the door, wondering if my brother, Ian, heard me scream when I woke up. Even if he did\u2014even if he is here\u2014I doubt he\u2019ll check in on me. That\u2019s how things have been ever since I found Ian passed out in his bed with that photo of Alyssa, his deceased girlfriend, with the words, Death made me do it, Alyssa, and I\u2019m sorry. But now I have to move on to the next angel written on it. I asked him about it the next day and he denied the photo ever existed along with the painting in the attic of Raven lying in the snow, wearing a cloak and holding an hourglass. Somehow, it disappeared and there\u2019s no evidence that any of these things existed. For all I know, everything I\u2019ve seen is nothing more than an illusion created by the Reapers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then there\u2019s my best friend, Raven, who I wouldn\u2019t put it passed to be part of the murders also, at least her possessed, alter ego side. She\u2019s actually been ignoring me, which I both like and hate because she\u2019s evil at the moment, yet I miss my friend. We pass by each other in the college hallways like ghosts, neither acknowledging that we see each other. It makes me want to find that damn book that was stolen so I can translate what it said on those pages about freeing pure souls.</p><p>I lie quietly in my bed for a while, the stillness absorbing into my skin as the loneliness weighs me down. The sun is sparkling through my window, the sky a clear blue and there\u2019s a bird chirping from the branches. Thankfully, it\u2019s not a raven; otherwise, I\u2019d think it was Cameron.</p><p>I decide what to do next for the day because if I don\u2019t find something to keep me distracted, the hours are going to drag. I could write maybe, but I\u2019m worried what might come out of me; my darkest desires I don\u2019t want to admit, how I briefly loved the taste of Cameron\u2019s life, the darkness living inside him. Even though it was just a dream, it frightens me.</p><p>Sighing, I reach for one of my textbooks on the nightstand beside my bed, choosing to catch up on schoolwork since it\u2019s the one thing I have left in my life that\u2019s not centered by death, angels and Reapers. But as my fingers grasp the edge of the book, I catch sight of my arm and jerk my hand back.</p> <p>Lines vine up and down my skin and wind around my wrist in black ink, like a tattoo. My thoughts flash back to my dream and I can taste the feeling of Cameron\u2019s life again, burning at the tip of my tongue.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was a dream,\u201d I whisper in horror as I grip my forearm, rotating my arm around to examine it. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really happen... it couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think you really believe that; do you, princess? The voice in my head appears again. This time its way clearer and louder. It\u2019s now to the point where I recognize it perfectly.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I frown. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening... it had to be a dream... there\u2019s no way you can really be inside my head.\u201d</p><p>Nope, it\u2019s really happening. I\u2019m in your thoughts now, even more so than last night when I compelled you to go to that club, so I could trick you into drinking my life, he says with amusement in his tone. Besides, deep down, you wanted to give in to me. Just like when you took my life... I bet you loved it.</p> <p>I don\u2019t react because it will give him a sense of satisfaction that I don\u2019t want him to have. \u201cIt could still be a dream,\u201d I say in denial. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s all it is. Maybe I\u2019m really still asleep, maybe you and I and my room and this conversation aren\u2019t really happening. Or maybe the Anamotti are making me think this is happening.\u201d</p><p>You know it\u2019s real, he says. You know you went there last night just like you know the black lines on your arms are from you devouring my life, tasting it and loving it.</p><p>I wince at the partial truth of his accusation. \u201cLeave me alone, Cameron. I don\u2019t want you here. And you can\u2019t stay here if I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>Things don\u2019t work like that anymore, he says. Especially after you took some of my life.</p><p>Shit. I knew there was a stipulation; a reason why he wanted me to do that.</p><p>Aggravated, I throw the blankets off my body and climb out of bed, trudging towards the dresser.</p> <p>Nice pajamas, he jokes.</p><p>As I glance down at my black shorts and thin purple tank top, he laughs at me and I shake my head and yank a dresser drawer open.</p><p>\u201cAbout what you said last night; do you really know something about my father or was that just one of your games?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell you that yet.</p><p>I rummage through the drawer for a clean shirt and a pair of jeans. \u201cPlease, Cameron, this is important to me.\u201d I hate the fact that it seems like I\u2019m begging.</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause and I hold my breath, waiting for his answer, thinking for a moment that he might actually give one to me.</p><p>But then he says, I might tell you in time, but not right now. In fact, you\u2019re not ready right now. Plus, I have to get what I want first; you have to give in before I give up my secrets.</p><p>Fury ignites inside me as I snatch up a shirt, jeans, and a pair of fingerless gloves to hide the lines on my arms before slamming the drawer shut, then I start for the closet. As I stomp towards it, I catch sight of the poem Cameron wrote on the wall weeks ago. It reminds me what his mission is in all of this.</p> <p>In separate fields of black feathers, the birds fly.</p><p>Four wings, two hearts, but only one soul.</p><p>They connect in the middle, though are separated by a thin line of ash.</p><p>It\u2019s what brings them together, yet rips their feathers apart.</p><p>They can never truly be together as light and dark.</p><p>Unless one makes the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Blows out their candle, and joins the other in the dark.</p><p>It\u2019s the poem that I read on Cameron\u2019s wall, but three extra lines have been added.</p><p>Or if the one dares to fly across the line and steal the other\u2019s light</p><p>To force them to cross over the line and join the darkness of life.</p><p>I\u2019m not gone, princess. I will come back for you until you give in.</p><p>\u2014Cameron</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m never going to give in to you,\u201d I tell him, drawing the closet curtain back as I duck inside. \u201cI\u2019m going to figure this out, so you might as well just leave my mind alone.\u201d</p><p>You really think you will? He questions. Because I think you\u2019re more lost now than you were a few days ago. I think with each day you grow weaker, more desperate. Lonelier. More willing to stand here and listen to me talk to you inside your head because I\u2019m the only one you have to talk to anymore.</p><p>He\u2019s painfully right. I\u2019ve been feeling lost and lonely a lot lately. I want\u2014need\u2014some sort of connection again, like I had with Asher. I want to be touched and touch someone else without death screaming in my thoughts, haunting me and letting me see things I don\u2019t want to see. With each passing day, I can feel myself slipping into the darkness, into the insanity, and ultimately, into the Reapers\u2019 world.</p><p>I miss Asher.</p><p>No, you don\u2019t, Cameron snaps harshly. You just think you do.</p><p>\u201cNo, I really do.\u201d I ball up the black sheer shirt and jeans I took out of my dresser and grab a red undershirt hanging up inside my closet. \u201cAnd just so you know,\u201d I say, descending further into the closet, knowing it\u2019s pointless to try and hide out, since Cameron seems to be everywhere, but still it\u2019s dark towards the back and hopefully he can\u2019t see me when I undress. \u201cI hated the taste of it.\u201d</p><p>His laughter fills my head again, a low chuckle that causes goosebumps to sprout all over my skin. The taste of what, princess?</p><p>\u201cYour life.\u201d</p><p>If that\u2019s what you need to tell yourself, he says. Then I\u2019ll let you, but deep down, we both know you\u2019re lying.</p><p>I stop talking, quickly changing my clothes as I attempt not to think about the fact that he could be watching me undress, although I\u2019m not sure how exactly it works; if he can see what I\u2019m seeing or if he\u2019s a ghost, watching me.</p><p>After I get dressed, I slip on a pair of black boots, pull my hair up, and leave the quietness of my room to go check my emails. There\u2019s nothing other than junk in there so I heavy-heartedly go into the kitchen and eat some breakfast.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved that I haven\u2019t heard a word from Cameron since I stepped into the closet, but at the same time, I\u2019m slightly disappointed because I want answers. Not just about my father, but how he\u2019s managed to enter my head.</p><p>I attempt to talk to him a few times, but he stays silent, so I pour myself a bowl of cereal, trying to ignore how my skin is starting to burn beneath my gloves, knowing it\u2019s coming from the lines, reminding me of what I did the other night with Cameron. It\u2019s early afternoon and the house is quiet and untouched from last night. Ian never came home and I have no idea where he is, or who he\u2019s with. It\u2019s torture, but all I can do is keep calling him and leaving voicemails.</p><p>I\u2019m running a little late this morning and should be getting ready to go to class, but I\u2019m considering skipping today, mainly because I don\u2019t feel like seeing Raven. Plus, I\u2019ve got these nasty lines on my arms and the last thing I need is for the town to think there\u2019s something wrong with me; other than the fact that they think I\u2019m a murderer, of course.</p><p>I finish off my cereal, reading the headlines of the local newspaper. My attention zeros in on article in particular, a headshot of Mackenzie; blonde hair, blue eyes and a smile on her face. Beside her is a picture of her mother and father holding onto each other, and above it the headline reads: New Mayor elected. Edmund Barker, winning despite his daughter\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>I shake my head. Great. Mackenzie\u2019s father is the mayor now, a man who\u2019s responsible for the death of his daughter.</p><p>Hollows Grove has actually always had a high death count, but there have been a lot of deaths over the last two weeks, including three girls around my age. And I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s either the Anamotti\u2019s doing it or unfortunately the new mayor.</p><p>The reporters have been saying we have a serial killer on our hands and I\u2019m pretty sure I know who the police think it is since they\u2019re continuously parked out in front of my house, watching me day in and day out. The whole town has been acting even more terrified of me and a lot of my neighbors scurry into their houses whenever I\u2019m around.</p><p>God, I\u2019m so alone.</p><p>As the painful truth starts to get to me, I get up, rinse out my bowl, and then place it in the sink. I put the cereal box away then turn around and lean against the counter. As I\u2019m standing there, trying to figure out where to go next, I get the strangest feeling that someone is watching me, like that night the book was stolen. I glance around the empty kitchen, that\u2019s filled with dishes that need to be washed, empty boxes of food, and overdue bills, normal stuff. I go to the doorway and peek into the living room then make a round through the foyer, but there\u2019s no one but me in the house.</p><p>Sighing at my craziness, I return to the kitchen and start to clean up. \u201cYou say that you\u2019ll only tell me about my father when you get what you want from me,\u201d I try to speak to Cameron again as I scrub down the countertops with a dish rag. \u201cBut what exactly do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>I wait for him to answer, but he never does and the silence only adds emptiness to the house. Deciding I need to hear an actual living person\u2019s voice, I cross the kitchen and collect my cellphone from the table. Then I go over to the note beside the sink and get the phone number to the clinic my mom\u2019s at. I dial the number and the secretary answers after three rings.</p><p>\u201cHi, can I speak to Rose Lawson,\u201d I ask, sitting down at the table.</p><p>\u201cAnd who may I ask is calling?\u201d she responds in an automated tone.</p><p>\u201cEmber Edwards,\u201d I tell her and then, since we don\u2019t have the same last name, I add, \u201cher daughter.\u201d</p><p>She pauses and I hear keyboard keys clicking. \u201cJust one moment, please.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a ringing in the background, overlapped by the sound of voices, as I silently wait. Moments later, the secretary says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Rose Lawson checked out last Friday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d I press my fingertips to my nose, feeling a headache emerging. \u201cThat was over five days ago and she hasn\u2019t come home yet. Can you please check again?\u201d</p><p>She tells me she will, but I can tell she\u2019s just tolerating me. When she gets back on the line, she tells me the same thing and I hang up without saying good-bye. I have no idea what else to do besides call Ian. But his phone sends me straight to voicemail and I hang up, feeling helpless, clutching my phone in my hand as I lower my head.</p><p>I breathe in and out, telling myself that it\u2019s okay. That my mom probably just decided she wasn\u2019t going to come home because she doesn\u2019t want to be around me, which is highly possible and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time. Still, I can\u2019t help wondering if she left of her own freewill, or did something happen to her? I need to find that out, so I go up to the computer and search the internet for any suspicious headlines, like maybe an unidentified body of a woman. It\u2019s sort of a messed up place to start, but since there\u2019s been a lot of murders lately, I have to go there first. Thankfully, nothing turns up. I could call the police, but I doubt that\u2019d go over well. She\u2019s an adult. I\u2019m crazy. End of discussion.</p><p>I start to head up to my room, when I hear the front door creak open. I pause, waiting for the sound of footsteps or a voice, but all I hear it the wind. Slowly, I go into the foyer again. The door is wide open and leaves are blowing in across the floor. There\u2019s no one in there though. No one out on the porch. I stick my head outside and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a single soul in sight.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d I say, shutting the door, confused as I turn for the stairs.</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear the swish.</p><p>Seconds later something flies over my head, getting so close it brushes against my hair. I duck, throwing my arms over my head as a dark mass circles around and does it again, this time going through me. A cold chill soars through my body, like it did the night the book was stolen, and I drop flat on my stomach on the hard floor. It feels like the wind is knocked out of me as I flip over, catching my breath, trying to scream, even though there\u2019s a good chance no one will hear me.</p><p>But as my lips part the shadow swoops straight up and then plunges straight at me, a black mass ready to devour me. I open my mouth to scream again, but the air is sucked from my lungs. I hear a voice as it nears, one I swear I\u2019ve heard before, but can\u2019t place.</p><p>\u201cYou better watch what you do,\u201d the shadow whispers, nearing me. \u201cWe\u2019re everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Then it disappears, right before it hits me.</p><p>I lie on the ground, stunned as I stare up at the ceiling stained with water spots. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d I ask, breathing loudly</p><p>You\u2019re being stalked. Cameron\u2019s voice rises in my head again.</p><p>\u201cBy what?\u201d I ask as I sit up, my body aching in protest.</p><p>By a Reaper, he says. I\u2019m not sure who it is though.</p><p>I clutch onto the wall as I get to my feet. \u201cSure you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not, Cameron snaps. I might be a Reaper, but I sure as hell don\u2019t know all the Reapers or what they\u2019re all doing. Your guess is as good as mine who that was and why they appeared so suddenly.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t suddenly,\u201d I say. \u201cThey were here about a week ago too.\u201d</p><p>And you didn\u2019t tell me because...</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re you.\u201d I get my balance and trudge toward the stairway.</p><p>Ha, ha, you\u2019re hilarious. He pauses. So when the shadow was here last time, did it do anything to you?</p><p>I shake my head as I start up the stairs. \u201cNo, it just dove at me and then stole a book from me. Honestly, I sort of thought it was you.\u201d</p><p>Well it wasn\u2019t. And I really wish you\u2019d mentioned this sooner.</p><p>I pause at the top of the stairway. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>Because it seems you have a Reaper stalker on your hands.</p><p>\u201cLike you?\u201d I ask sarcastically.</p><p>I\u2019m not stalking you. I merely see something I want and refuse to give up until I have it.</p><p>\u201cWhich will be never,\u201d I say, turning down the hallway. \u201cSo you might as well give up now.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond. I wait until I enter my room before I repeat what I said. I never get an answer and eventually the silence gets to me, along with the fear of being stalked and the fear of having a Reaper live inside my head. I decide to go to school because it\u2019s better than sitting around in a quiet house again, waiting for my shadow stalker to return again. Then, on my way home I can check out the clinic and the streets for my mom. I gather my backpack from my room and then head out the door, hoping upon hope that this isn\u2019t going to turn out like my dad.</p><p>Missing forever.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>I drive to school in my mom\u2019s car, cranking up the music because it\u2019s the only thing that will block out the dark thoughts in my head and the quiet around me. I thrum my fingers on top of the steering wheel to the beat as I drive up the highway, focusing on the road instead of the dead people walking up and down the streets. There are more of them today; I spot at least five. I have no clue if they\u2019re people who died here or if the Anamotti are scrounging for puppets elsewhere.</p><p>There\u2019s also a lot more living people out and about today. Usually, I only pass maybe six or seven, but I spot three crowds, plus ten individuals just on the main strip of town. The growing population only rises when I arrive at the campus and almost every parking spot is taken. Finally, I find one at the back, near the road, and maneuver my car into it.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been a fan of school at all lately. Never have been, even before the entire town thought I was a killer. So when I get ready to climb out of my car and my gut churns, I think it\u2019s caused by my usual loathing towards school. When I make it across the parking lot and to the campus yard, I realize something\u2019s off. People are filing in and out of the school entrance in a perfect line, their attention straight ahead on the person in front of them. They all move together in sync, taking steps together. It\u2019s not the entire population of the school, but it\u2019s enough people that I notice it.</p><p>I swing the hand of my bag over my shoulder and hike across the grass underneath the shedding trees towards the entrance, pink and orange leaves covering the browning grass. My eyes are fixed on the people in line along with others wandering around who seem a little out of it, like they have no real direction. When I pass by one guy with long legs and broad shoulders, his gaze catches with mine and I swear to God his eyes briefly glow, but it\u2019s just a flash and then he\u2019s turning around to head off in the direction of the west entrance.</p><p>I grow nervous with each step, especially when I pass by a few dead people roaming around, watching me with faint smiles. I keep my attention straight on the door, ignoring the rest of the looks I can feel boring into me. I tell myself that it\u2019s just my imagination, which feels like the biggest lie I\u2019ve ever told myself. By the time I enter the school, I\u2019m sweating and anxious.</p><p>Things only get worse when I pass the line forming from outside that weaves around through the columns of the quad and to the main office. Heads turn in my direction, one by one. Eyes lock on me, filled with hatred, like I\u2019m some foul creature they want to get rid of.</p><p>Fuck. This is bad.</p><p>The only thing I have going for me is that no one has yet to make a move on me and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m sticking around to find out if they\u2019re going to. I pick up my pace, heading towards where I entered, deciding that leaving is the best decision. However I slow down in the center of the quad when Professor Morgan approaches me. He\u2019s in his mid-forties, with chestnut brown hair and hazel eyes. He\u2019s wearing tan cargo pants and a red polo shirt smeared with charcoal, paint, and clay. He\u2019s also Asher\u2019s uncle, at least, if what Asher told me was the truth.</p><p>\u201cHey Ember,\u201d he says with his hands stuffed in his pockets. \u201cHow\u2019s it going today?\u201d</p><p>I pretend it\u2019s not weird at all that he\u2019s approaching me. \u201cGood, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, but I can tell it\u2019s forced. Then he discreetly glances around the campus, his attention lingering on the line before he returns his attention to me. \u201cLook, could you meet me in my classroom for a moment? I\u2019d like to discuss a project with you.\u201d</p><p>Project? Um, what? I\u2019m about to ask him what he\u2019s talking about when he aims me with an urgent glance. \u201cIt\u2019s a project Asher was supposed to turn into me, but I haven\u2019t seen him in a while so I wanted to talk to you about it.\u201d</p><p>I slowly catch on. The fact that the entire school seems to be under some sort of trance makes me wary to go anywhere with anyone, yet as I examine him over, attempting to see if his eyes are glowing like the others, he looks normal. As far as I can tell, he doesn\u2019t have any visible wounds on him or other signs that he\u2019s part of the undead</p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah. Sure... but I need to hurry because I have class.\u201d Because I need to get the hell out of here.</p><p>He nods and then turns for the hallway between two columns, motioning for me to follow him. For a moment it looks like a shadow is tailing him, but as soon as I blink it\u2019s gone. So I keep walking, more attention draws to us as we weave through the crowd. I\u2019m trying my hardest to keep from touching anyone, but a lot of them seem to be determined to touch me, slamming their shoulders against mine, stepping on my toes, their deaths smothering me. Blood fills the streets. They all lie dead. A cloud covers the town.</p><p>One foot in front of the other. Breathe. Eyes drift in my direction and some notably glow all around me. I have this gut-wrenching feeling that I\u2019m being watched by something more than just their eyes.</p><p>I hold my breath the entire journey and only breathe freely again when we\u2019re hidden in his classroom with the door shut behind us. He seems to feel the same way as well, since he lets out a loud exhale the moment the door clicks shut.</p><p>\u201cJesus, things are getting intense,\u201d he says, turning around and leaning against the shut door.</p><p>I don\u2019t respond, looking around the vacant room with art on the walls, bare easels and paint supplies everywhere. I can\u2019t stop my mind from wandering to thoughts of Asher and the first time we kissed. In here. How he touched me. How his tongue felt... and his tongue ring... amazing... the way he made me feel was amazing.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Professor Morgan asks.</p><p>I stand near the tables and face him. \u201cYeah,\u201d I reply with hesitancy. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d like to know why you wanted to talk to me in here because I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not about a project.\u201d</p><p>He stands up straight. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d He takes a cautious step forward. \u201cTell me, how have you been doing through all this?\u201d</p><p>I shift uneasily, noting that he\u2019s positioned himself between me and the door. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He points over his shoulder at the door. \u201cThe whole town going... well, a little berserk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve noticed things are a little...\u201d I search for the correct word that would best describe the madness. \u201cStrange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange might be a bit of an understatement. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve been taken over by some sort of...\u201d He trails off, shaking his head. \u201cAnd there are the murders and the strange disappearances.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m wary to say anything.

I know you\u2019re friends with Asher. And I know you\u2019re important to him.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if he knows I\u2019m a Grim Angel. If he\u2019s an Angel himself. I eye him over, deliberating if I can trust him or not, at least enough to ask. Then I come to the conclusion that it doesn\u2019t really matter. If he\u2019s after me, then he\u2019s already got me trapped. If he\u2019s not and just thinks I\u2019m crazy, then he can be one more person I add to the list.</p><p>\u201cAre you... are you...\u201d God, please don\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy. \u201cAre you an Angel of Death, too?\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head, not startled. A good sign. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to help you if I was, but I do know about them\u2014Angels and Reapers. You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Asher told you?\u201d</p><p>He considers something very carefully. \u201cMore or less.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s more to it than what he\u2019s telling me. If I\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s that he\u2019s probably not going to tell me because he either can\u2019t or wants to keep his secrets. \u201cYou said you were going to help me,\u201d I say. \u201cBut how exactly? And from what?\u201d</p><p>His attention strays over my shoulder as he picks a chunk of clay off his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m going to help you the only way I know how, by giving you some advice.\u201d He looks at me and when our eyes fasten, fear pulsates through me. I don\u2019t know where it stems from, whether he\u2019s scared and I\u2019m sensing it, or if he\u2019s simply scaring me. \u201cHave you ever heard of something called a ambulate umbra?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo... why?\u201d</p><p>He yanks his fingers through his hair, leaving it sticking up. Then someone bangs on the door and moments later a face appears in the small window at the top. Their eyes are bleeding, seeping out like rain and splattering across the glass. I glance back and forth between the dead person and the Professor, wondering if he can see it, but he continues on with the conversation, unbothered.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea where it is...\u201d He keeps talking, his hand falling to the side, his brows dipping together. \u201cOr who even has it.\u201d</p><p>I hitch my finger under the handle of my bag, adjusting it higher on my shoulder as I watch him pace back and forth in front me. \u201cWhat is it exactly?\u201d My eyes widen as the door creaks open and the dead person enters the classroom, glancing around at the art on the wall with a perplexed look.</p><p>Again, Professor Morgan seems oblivious. His forehead creases and then scurries over to his desk. \u201cHow about I show you,\u201d he says as he opens his desk drawer. He retrieves a pencil and paper from the drawer and starts sketching while the dead girl just stares at me. There is a mark on her neck like a rope burn, the tips of her hair stained with blood. As I look closer, I recognize her features as one of the girls I saw in the newspaper; one that was murdered a week ago, her body found near the forest.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she says in a haunting hollow voice as she stares at me with a distant expression. \u201cHelp us... free us from the pain. He\u2019s got our souls trapped, Ember. And he plans on trapping a lot more and then destroying us all.\u201d</p> <p>I want to ask her what she\u2019s talking about, but what about Professor Morgan? What would he say if I started talking aloud? If I told him I could see the dead?</p><p>Debating what to do, I start to open my mouth, deciding that looking insane might be worth the risk to find out what\u2019s going on. But as soon as my lips part, she disappears, vanishing into thin air without so much as a sound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m much better at drawing what I mean than trying to explain it,\u201d Professor Morgan continues to talk, while I stare at the spot where the girl vanished.</p><p>He\u2019s got people\u2019s souls trapped? Like someone is stealing souls and keeping them? Or is it something different? And who\u2019s he?</p><p>As my thoughts keep racing, Professor Morgan glides the pencil effortlessly across the paper. He makes one last stroke then drops the pencil down on the desk before holding up the drawing. My jaw just about hits the floor, but I smash my lips together to conceal my shock. It\u2019s a drawing that looks almost identical to my grandmother\u2019s necklace; the one Cameron has and swears my Grandmother stole from him. The problem is, I have no idea what the color of it is, so I can\u2019t be one-hundred percent certain.</p><p>A warning goes off inside me not to utter that I know where or what it is. \u201cSo it\u2019s a necklace,\u201d I state the obvious.</p><p>He nods and hands me the drawing. \u201cIt\u2019s believed to have the blood of the original leader of the Grim Reapers, Altarius Vinceton. He created it to protect himself from his own kind, making it out of Chrysoprase and sealing it with the blood of himself, which was the more powerful of the two elements so it made the green in the Chrysoprase turn a dark red.\u201d</p><p>Dark red. I stare at the drawing, the lines forming a near replica of the necklace I once owned. It has to be my grandmother\u2019s necklace. \u201cBut why would this Altarius guy need to protect himself from the Reapers if he was the leader of them? Wouldn\u2019t that make him the boss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf only things were that easy,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIf being the leader meant you never had to worry about anything, but unfortunately for Altarius, he knew the evil within himself and therefore understood the evil that lay in Reapers, all of them. No matter what they tell you.\u201d</p><p>What a convenient little story he\u2019s got going on here. The abrupt reappearance of Cameron\u2019s voice startles me so badly that I jump.</p><p>Professor Morgan gives me a startled look. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I tuck a fallen strand of my hair behind my ear, giving myself a moment to get myself together before I speak again. \u201cSo, you think this ambulate umbra could protect me from the Reapers killing me? Or is it going to protect me from something else because I thought they couldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d Only drive me crazy. Or if the book I was reading is right, steal my soul.</p><p>Not all Reapers want to drive you crazy, Cameron says. I want your mind completely intact. In fact, I find you very fascinating... now stealing your soul on the other hand. Please tell me more about this because I\u2019d love to try.</p><p>Like you already don\u2019t know how.</p><p>Actually I don\u2019t, he says. It\u2019s supposed to not be possible, so I\u2019m really curious as to what book you\u2019ve been reading.</p><p>The one that was stole from me, I say. From my shadow stalker.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t kill you,\u201d Professor Morgan says, interrupting Cameron\u2019s and mine\u2019s conversation. \u201cBut they can make you want to kill yourself.\u201d</p><p>Shock soars through me and strikes me in the chest, knocking the breath out of me. \u201cYou mean, they can possess me and force me to... to die.\u201d</p><p>He wavers with hesitancy, folding his arms. \u201cNot necessarily force you, but get you to that place, enter your thoughts and mess with your mind enough that you want it to all end.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing, Cameron insists. I want you around, Ember.</p><p>Sure you do.</p><p>Ember, think about what\u2019s going on here, he says. This guy pretty much just comes out of nowhere and willingly tells you all this stuff. Why would he all of a sudden do that?</p><p>I don\u2019t know... because he\u2019s Asher\u2019s uncle. I get what he\u2019s saying, though at the same time, it\u2019s hard to be on the same page as Cameron.</p><p>Yeah, on his father\u2019s side.</p><p>What the hell\u2019s that supposed to mean?</p><p>\u201cEmber, are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Professor Morgan is staring at me like he\u2019s starting to grow concerned with my state of mind. \u201cYou seem a little distracted.\u201d</p><p>I tear myself away from my internal conversation with Cameron. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just feeling a little sick. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go home and lie down.\u201d He glances out the window at the campus yard and his face pales.</p><p>I track his gaze and find that everyone has stopped moving except for one person. As soon as I see the guy everyone\u2019s looking at, my head starts to pound, my lips start to tingle and my back starts to burn. He moves with confidence through the sea of motionless people, taller than most with broad shoulders, a scraggy jawline and blonde hair that reaches his shoulders. He\u2019s wearing a black suit and a red tie. Everyone seems to be drawn to him as he makes his way slowly across the campus yard with heads turning, eyes following his movements. And the dead girl that walked in the room is walking just behind him, watching him, then she glances up at me. Our eyes lock and there\u2019s a silent plea inside them: help me.</p><p>\u201cWho is that guy?\u201d I ask as I scratch at the spot burning on my back, but as I say it, recognition clicks. \u201cWait, is that our new mayor?\u201d Why is he here? Better yet, why is he here when the entire school is possessed? Is it a coincidence? And is the dead girl trying to say he\u2019s the one she\u2019s talking about? That the mayor has their souls trapped?</p><p>Hmmm... I bet you\u2019re right, Cameron says. And I\u2019m guessing he has something to do with all those murders.</p><p>As the Professor removes his gaze from the window, I detect a hint of fear in his eyes. \u201cI think so... but I really think you should head home while all this is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what is going on?\u201d I ask, aware that he\u2019s extremely uneasy all of a sudden, more than before. \u201cI mean, everyone in the town... they seem so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the influence of the Anamotti,\u201d he finishes for me. \u201cThey\u2019ve somehow managed to take over minds in large quantities.</p><p>Just like Raven. Oh, my God, it\u2019s spreading like a virus. \u201cYou know about the Anamotti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of the Anamotti,\u201d he corrects, sitting down on one of the nearby tables, his shoulders slumping inward. \u201cBut they\u2019re sort of like a secret society and no one really knows anything about them.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. \u201cWell, why all of a sudden are they taking over everyone? I mean, they\u2019ve pretty much got the entire campus walking around like robots.\u201d</p><p>His expression plummets. \u201cI have no idea right now, but I\u2019m going to try to find out.\u201d He gets to his feet, returns to his desk again, and starts sifting through a collection of old books.</p><p>Sure he doesn\u2019t know anything. Cameron laughs inside my head. Why don\u2019t you ask him how he knows all this when he\u2019s not a Reaper or an Angel?</p><p>I want to tell Cameron to shut up, however he\u2019s right. I do need to find out why, all of a sudden, he\u2019s handing over all this information. \u201cProfessor Morgan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Elliot,\u201d he tells me, wiggling a book out from the bottom stack.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Elliot... How do you know about all of this?\u201d I head towards his desk. \u201cThe Reapers. The Angels. The necklace?\u201d</p><p>His face goes sheet white as he walks to me with the book in his hand. \u201cBecause...\u201d He swallows hard. \u201cBecause I was once an Angel of Death.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare at him, speechless. \u201cYou were once an Angel of Death?\u201d I finally manage to find my voice. \u201cWhat...? How...? Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story that doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d He glances nervously at the door as a loud bang echoes in the hallway then he tucks the book under his arm. \u201cBesides, I\u2019d rather not talk about here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He holds up his hand, cutting me off, still focused on the door. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not safe for you to be here... there are too many people possessed by the Anamotti and I have a feeling it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d When he looks at me again, he lowers his voice, \u201cBut if you want to meet somewhere more private, I can tell you more of what I know.\u201d</p> <p>The bang in the hallway grows louder and he flinches, jumping. I realize how nervous he is and how nervous I probably should be, considering we\u2019re standing in the center of a building that\u2019s swarming with Anamotti.</p><p>\u201cWhen and where?\u201d I ask quickly.</p><p>He hastily backs up towards his desk and retrieves a pencil before returning to me and taking the drawing from my hand. \u201cHere\u2019s my number,\u201d he says, scrawling it down while he holds onto the book. \u201cCall me after my last class ends, which is at four.\u201d He hands me the piece of paper. I fold it up and put it in my back pocket. \u201cAnd Ember, please go straight home. I have a feeling things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.\u201d</p><p>I eye the book he has tucked under his arm. I can\u2019t tell what the title is, but it looks old. \u201cOkay, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says and then he\u2019s ushering me towards the door.</p> <p>I trip over my own boots and grab ahold of the doorknob to stop myself from falling as he rushes me out. I\u2019m about to ask him what\u2019s going on when I feel the zipper of my bag being pulled on and then something heavy lands inside it. When I glance back at Elliot, he\u2019s already turning away from me, the book no longer in his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice talking to you, Ember,\u201d he says very formally as he goes back to his desk and starts sifting through his papers.</p><p>I\u2019m baffled by his abrupt, offish attitude, but I don\u2019t say anything and open the door, stepping out into the hallway, the book feeling like lead in my bag. I wonder why he was so weird about giving it to me. Or what it even is. I\u2019m wondering a lot of things about what just happened as I enter the quad. Then, all of those thoughts float from my mind.</p><p>I feel like Carrie at the prom as everyone turns to look at me. I half expect blood to splatter down from the ceiling and onto me. No blood ever shows up, but again, my head starts to pound, my lips get tingly, and my back feels like it\u2019s on fire. I\u2019m not sure what to do, so I start to turn back and head in the other direction when someone nudges me in the back. I throw a glance over my shoulder then stumble forward at the sight of a girl from my English class standing behind me with a hollow expression on her face and eyes glowing like nightlights. There is a line of people standing behind her, blocking the entrance to the hallway. I look back to see that people have started to line the walls of the circular quad, all of them just staring at me, and I catch the mayor of the town disappearing down the hall that the line of possessed people is leading to.</p><p>It\u2019s like he\u2019s leading them straight to him, but why? So he can kill them?</p><p>Don\u2019t worry about that right now.</p> <p>But what if he\u2019s going to kill everyone here?</p><p>Even if he is\u2014if he isn\u2019t just a normal human and has that kind of power\u2014you couldn\u2019t stop him alone. So do yourself a favor and walk straight ahead, Cameron whispers in my thoughts. They won\u2019t touch you, I promise.</p><p>Why should I listen to you? I ask. Trust you with anything?</p><p>Because you have no other option at the moment.</p><p>I know he\u2019s right and I hate it. The only thing I can really do is try to walk out of here.</p><p>Taking a small step, I move forward, waiting for them to attack, however all they do is stand there and watch me. So I take another step and another, continuing to cross the length of the campus as the fire on my back gets hotter and hotter. Their eyes pretty much burn holes in me, but none of them make a move to touch me.</p><p>Finally, I reach the opposite end where there\u2019s another hallway that will take me right outside to where my car is parked. However there are two very bulky guys\u2014football players, I think\u2014blocking my path. I hesitate.</p><p>Just nudge through them, Cameron says. They won\u2019t do anything to you.</p> <p>Shaking my head and summoning a deep inhale, I do what he says and start to move between them, holding my breath as I squeeze by. My shoulders brush against them and it feels like my entire being blazes up in flames. Blackness. Pain. Good-bye. Please don\u2019t leave me. I can\u2019t. Everything hurts. Capes and feathers showering from the sky. All over the town. Blood filling the streets that are filled with bodies. So many bodies. So many deaths. Thousands. I can feel them pouring through me like a river of needles and the mayor is standing in the midst of it all with blood on his hands.</p><p>Jerking myself from the painful images of death, I race by and duck down the hall, running down the hall.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what the hell was that?\u201d I whisper, pressing my hand to my chest, catching my breath as I burst out the door and onto the campus yard. As the cool air hits me, the heat starts to subside, calming down the further away from the school I get. I take long strides, hurrying for my car while looking at my feet as gazes bore into me.</p><p>\u201cCameron, why did I see that...? All those deaths? Was it because that guy was possessed by the Anamotti?\u201d</p><p>It takes Cameron a moment to answer. I\u2019m not even sure why I\u2019m asking him, other than I have no one to ask. No, it wasn\u2019t because he was Anamotti. He pauses as I unlock my car and climb into. It looks like you had your first death omen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been having death omens,\u201d I point out as I start the engine. \u201cFor a very long time.\u201d</p><p>No, you\u2019ve been able to see death, he states. Death omens are a whole different ballgame. They apply to a large group of people. Simultaneous deaths that happen all at once from the same force can only be felt through the touch of a Reaper.</p><p>\u201cBut I never feel them when I touch you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s because I care enough about you not to let you feel them.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to respond to his twisted act of kindness, so I avoid reacting at all. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying the entire town\u2019s going to die?\u201d I ask, gripping onto the steering wheel, my palms coating in sweat. \u201cAnd that the mayors going to do it?</p><p>I don\u2019t know anything except that you saw a death omen. Sorry, princess, but I can\u2019t give you all the answers, especially when I don\u2019t know them all. However, I will say that I think you need to steer clear of the mayor.</p><p>\u201cI already knew that.\u201d I put the shifter in reverse, ready to get as far away from here as I can; ready to forget, wishing I could forget. But I can\u2019t. It hurts from head to toe; throbbing, burning, intoxicating. \u201cThere has to be a way to stop it,\u201d I whisper. \u201cAll those deaths on top of all the other death\u2019s that have happened.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. How many times have I told you, Ember? You can\u2019t stop death. Death is endless.</p><p>\u201cYeah, death is endless,\u201d I say, steering the car towards the road. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t try to stop it.\u201d I pause, considering if I should ask him my next question, wondering if it might be a mistake by trusting him so much, but what other option do I have. \u201cCameron, have you ever heard of a Reaper stealing a Grim Angel\u2019s soul?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not possible, he says. I would have done it to you if it was.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d</p><p>But what? He presses.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it is? What if you just don\u2019t know about it?\u201d</p><p>He contemplates what I said. What do you know about it?</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say. \u201cOther than that if it can be done, then it could possibly free innocent souls being possessed, like this entire town.\u201d</p><p>Maybe... I mean, I don\u2019t know everything about Reapers, he says, which I find a little strange since he is a Reaper. What I\u2019d really like to know is where you learned about this.</p><p>Not wanting him to know about the book, fearing he\u2019ll track it down and figure out how to steal my soul, I opt to keep my mouth shut and he astonishingly doesn\u2019t press. I drive down the road and up Main Street towards where the clinic is, at the end of the city. There are people on the streets, coming in and out of stores. Most of them are acting normal, which means the Anamotti haven\u2019t gotten to the entire town just yet. Still, how have they even managed to take over so many people? I mean, when they captured me that night there was only a handful. However they\u2019ve at least got a hundred people under their possession now.</p><p>\u201cCameron, how are they doing it?\u201d I ask. \u201cTaking over so many people? Are there more Anamotti in Hollows Grove than I know about? Or is it something bigger than the Anamotti?\u201d I ask, thinking about the mayor, wondering what he is\u2014if he\u2019s just a powerful human or so much more.</p><p>I wait for Cameron to respond, but I never get an answer. I try a few more times with a few different questions, however his silence remains. I should be grateful, getting a break from the Reaper living inside my head except the silence of the car is heavier than anything. I twistedly find myself wishing he\u2019d come back.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The receptionist at the clinic tells me the same thing as she did on the phone; that my mom left a few days ago and didn\u2019t tell anyone where she was going. Thankfully, all of them seem like they\u2019re in control of their minds, but it still doesn\u2019t help me figure out where my mom is.</p><p>As I head home, I drive down a couple back roads and search the areas where I\u2019ve found my mom in the past.</p><p>There was a two-month period where she was addicted to meth and spent a lot of time out on the streets, sleeping behind dumpsters and doing God knows what to earn money. I was fourteen when this was going on and pretty much had to take care of Ian and myself, living off money I scrounged up wherever I could. We almost got evicted, but my mom came wandering back, got cleaned up and got a job again, deciding to briefly be responsible. It was always sort of her thing. Off and on she\u2019d take care of us. It sucked\u2014still does\u2014knowing that your mom doesn\u2019t care enough about you to be around and help take care of you, or take care of herself.</p><p>The messed up part is that I\u2019m not sure whether or not I\u2019d rather her be out on the streets somewhere, doing drugs, or if I\u2019d prefer something has actually happened to her.</p><p>Eventually, I make it home to the quiet and go up to my room to take a nap, but I\u2019m restless and end up simply staring at the ceiling, wide awake. Minutes tick by. Hours. I call Ian, wanting to hear someone\u2019s voice. He doesn\u2019t answer. I check the clock to see if it\u2019s four yet and time to call Elliot. I have two more hours, so I take out the book he put into my bag and my jaw nearly drops to the floor. It looks just like the book that was stolen from me. Sucking in a sharp breath, I open it up, but the wind is instantly knocked out of me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I mumble as I fan through the blank pages. I look back at the cover, wondering if I was wrong about it being the same book, but the title is still the same and August Millard is listed at the author. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I immediately take the piece of paper out of my pocket and call Professor Morgan, but it sends me straight to voicemail. There\u2019s got to be an explanation for this. He\u2019ll explain it, right? He\u2019ll know what the words on the pages meant, right? I\u2019m not so sure.</p><p>I\u2019m not so sure about anything anymore.</p><p>I shut the book, set it aside, then flop down on the bed. None of this makes sense. I need some sort of answers. What I need is someone to talk to. \u201cCameron, can you hear me?\u201d I ask and then wince at my desperation.</p><p>I try again and again without any response. After the fifth attempt, I finally turn up some music, a little Breaking Benjamin, hoping that will help with the quiet, yet there\u2019s still emptiness around me and inside me. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d The soundlessness. The seclusion. Everyone I have no longer talks to me, and I can\u2019t talk to them because I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re still themselves. I wish it\u2019d be over. God, just get it over with. I can\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cPlease, just make it...\u201d I trail off, realizing where I\u2019m heading and how I can\u2019t go there, especially after what Cameron told me. I can\u2019t give up. Give in. \u201cIs that what\u2019s going on?\u201d I squeeze my eyes shut. \u201cIs all this loneliness part of the torture, the Reapers\u2019 new way to get to me? Leave me alone to let me rot in my own lonely existence.\u201d</p> <p>Now, how would I know what they\u2019re up to? He answers and then unexpectedly the music turns down. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you that I don\u2019t want them to have you and therefore I have nothing to do with them.... I want you for myself.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shoot open at the sound of his voice around me instead of in my head. He\u2019s standing near the doorway of my room, dressed in normal clothes; a loose pair of name brand jeans, a fitted grey shirt, and his blonde hair lightly tousled.</p><p>\u201cSo you finally decided to show yourself.\u201d I sit up on the bed. \u201cInstead of just cowering inside my head.\u201d</p><p>He laughs wickedly as he skims over the contents of my room with intrigue. \u201cI wasn\u2019t cowering, princess. You just made it clear that you\u2019re in dire need of some company and I thought I\u2019d step up and help out, since I care for you.\u201d</p><p>I smooth my long, black hair into place as I lower my feet over the edge of the bed. \u201cLike hell you do. And besides, I don\u2019t want your help.\u201d Lie. Lie. Lie.</p> <p>\u201cYou say that now,\u201d he says, entering my room. He picks up a feather from my dresser and I have the most overwhelming urge to snatch it from his hand, especially since Asher had held it once when he was in my room. \u201cBut eventually you\u2019ll want me.\u201d He touches the feather with the tip of his finger, smiling at himself since it\u2019s a raven\u2019s feather and he can shift into a raven. Then he sets it back down on the dresser. \u201cEspecially for what\u2019s in store for you in the very near future.\u201d He says it with implication.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I stand up from my bed. \u201cAre you talking about the omen I saw?\u201d</p><p>He nods his gaze boring into me, his eyes filling with lust, which makes my skin feel like it\u2019s crawling and spontaneously combusting at the same time. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing stuff and I think something\u2019s going down in the Angel/Reaper battle,\u201d he finally says, stuffing his hands into his pockets. \u201cSomething that requires a lot of sacrifice of innocent people so that someone can get a lot of power, which I\u2019m guessing might be linked to the death omen you saw... all those deaths are a great source of power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you think the mayor has something to do with this?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMaybe, but if that\u2019s true than I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s probably not really the mayor, but a Reaper, working for a much powerful Reaper\u2014our leader probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the leader of the Reapers has something to do with this?\u201d I blow out a frustrated breath. \u201cThe murders? The number of people being possessed in the town multiplying overnight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if the possession has anything to do with the increasing possession,\u201d he explains. \u201cI still think that\u2019s the Anamotti trying to take down the last Grim Angel standing. I think things are getting close and their upping the forces.\u201d</p><p>As my muscles wind in knots, I work to keep a steady voice. \u201cHave things... is there only one Grim Angel left now?\u201d</p><p>His brow crooks. \u201cWell, that\u2019d make it you, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nearly fall down and have to grip onto the bedpost for support. \u201cPlease tell me that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes, like I just overreacted. \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t gotten to that point yet. There\u2019s still some left... although the numbers are small. And besides, you\u2019d know when you were the last one standing because your inner Reaper and Angel would reveal.\u201d He sighs and leans against my dresser. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s the least of our problems now, because if the lovely mayor is working for the Reapers, then it could quite possibly mean that my leader could be here, which is very bad for you and for me too, considering my family\u2019s rebellion to cooperate with the rules and order of the Reapers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised by that last fact?\u201d I say then frown, thinking about the story Elliot told me. \u201cWhen you say leader of the Reapers, do you mean the one that used to own that necklace you stole from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one and only Altarius Vinceton.\u201d His lips curve to a sinister grin. \u201cAnd I never stole the necklace from you; your grandmother stole it from me.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at him. \u201cSo you say.\u201d</p> <p>His grin darkens. \u201cSo I know.\u201d We carry each other\u2019s gazes, refusing to look away, and finally his facial expression softens. \u201cLook, I want to help you, Ember, no matter what you think.\u201d</p><p>I laugh sharply. \u201cOh, I doubt that.\u201d</p><p>His feet shuffle across the carpet as he strides towards me. \u201cWhy so doubtful? Have I ever done anything to harm you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me kill a person,\u201d I remind him, noting that I have nowhere to go as he closes in on me.</p><p>\u201cWhich I brought back to life.\u201d He takes another stride. The closer he gets, the more the lines on my arms beneath my gloves burn.</p><p>I back away, bumping into the bed and then fall down on the mattress on my ass. I continue to scoot back on the bed to get back the distance he\u2019s stealing as he moves across my room.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want to help me, then give me the necklace. So it can protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he says matter-of-factly as the front of his legs graze against the side of the bed. \u201cMy family needs it for their own protection. We\u2019re not the most loved Grim Reapers in the clan, especially when we stole the necklace to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d I say sarcastically as my back brushes the wall.</p><p>He gets aggravated as he leans over the bed and hovers over me. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know why you are so eager to believe that the necklace will protect you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know nothing about Elliot, other than he\u2019s Asher\u2019s uncle. It makes you really na\u00efve to simply believe him because of that.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the fact that his closeness accelerates my heart rate, telling myself that it\u2019s just like at the lake and the cemetery, that he\u2019s controlling it\u2014me. However I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s entirely true. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me na\u00efve. If I had a reason not to trust him, then I wouldn\u2019t, but he hasn\u2019t given me a reason yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t trust me,\u201d he says, like I don\u2019t have a reason not to.</p><p>I struggle not to laugh, knowing it won\u2019t make the situation any better. \u201cYou have to earn trust, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsher didn\u2019t earn your trust,\u201d he states, leaning closer to me, his shadow covering my body. \u201cHe lied to you just as much as I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Asher\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d A hand comes down on each side of my head, so he\u2019s pretty much lying on top of me, yet he remains standing. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t go around believing things until they\u2019re proven.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. Not about Asher, but about getting facts before deciding on what to believe \u201cTell me what the leader looks like,\u201d I demand, pressing my back against the mattress, desperate to get space between us. \u201cAnd why he\u2019s here. That\u2019s how you can establish my trust, if you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know those answers.\u201d He looks as lost as me. \u201cHowever, what I do know is that it\u2019s really bad that he\u2019s here.\u201d He licks his lips, eyeing mine. I can read all over his face that he wants me.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s bad.\u201d I place my hands on his chest to hold him back, repulsed by my body\u2019s disappointment of my shoving him back. \u201cBut how bad exactly? I mean, people are already possessed and there\u2019s a murder or disappearance at least once a week. How much worse could things get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch, much worse.\u201d He reaches for my face and I flinch as he strokes my cheek with his finger. \u201cMore and more deaths will happen.\u201d His fingers drift down my cheek, my jaw, my neckline, stopping just above where my breasts curve out of my top. \u201cReapers love their death. It\u2019s like a drug for us.\u201d He breathes my scent. \u201cWe crave it. Breathe it. And our leader is connected to all our power; our feelings. So imagine how much death he craves\u2014needs.\u201d</p><p>I shudder against his touch, momentarily falling into it, hating that sometimes it feels so easy to give in to him and so hard to push him away, but I still manage to get some room, pushing him away as far as he\u2019ll allow me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t touch me, Cameron. I-I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>He traces a line from my cleavage to my neck, his fingers resting over my pulse. \u201cWhy not? You let Asher touch you like this.\u201d His other hand finds my waist, gripping firmly, fingers delving into the fabric, causing me to shiver in response. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t fight it... you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsher\u2019s an Angel,\u201d I say, loathing that my voice cracks. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t just tell me that he\u2019s addicted to stealing souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if he\u2019s an Angel?\u201d His eyes flare, the tips of his fingers pressing into my skin. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a Reaper. Both of us symbolize death. Both of us collect souls. There\u2019s a very thin line between what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I wince from his violent touch. \u201cAnd besides, I know Asher enough to know that he cares about me and wouldn\u2019t do anything that would hurt me.\u201d</p><p>When he speaks his voice is low and conveys rage, his breath hot on my cheeks. \u201cMaybe you should get your facts straight before you go yammering your mouth off,\u201d he says. I open my mouth to speak, but he covers my lips with his hands. \u201cTell me this, princess. Did Asher, by chance, ever mention who his father is?\u201d</p><p>I reluctantly shake my head. \u201cNo, but what does that matter?\u201d I ask, my lips moving against the palm of his hand.</p><p>He lowers his hand from my mouth. \u201cIt matters when his father\u2019s part of the Anamotti.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible... It\u2019d mean he\u2019d have to have Reaper blood. And he can\u2019t have Reaper blood because then it\u2019d mean Asher would have Reaper blood in him, and I know that\u2019s not true,\u201d I say, my voice sounding a little off pitch. I can\u2019t help having some doubt. I know hardly anything about Asher\u2019s father, and from the few conversations we had about him, I got the impression that Asher\u2019s father wasn\u2019t that great. Still, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a Reaper.</p><p>I push Cameron off me and kneel up on the bed. \u201cQuit messing with my head. If Asher\u2019s father was a Reaper then he would have told me. And you would have told me a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I have told you sooner?\u201d Cameron asks, pressing his hand to his chest where I shoved him as if my touch burned. \u201cI barely tell you anything that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve what you want, princess. But before you go deciding things, get your facts straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how am I supposed to do that when my entire life is a fucking mind game at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe by going to the source and asking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to, if I could, but since I have no idea where Angels go to get punished by their leader, that\u2019s not happening anytime soon.\u201d I pause, assessing Cameron\u2019s reaction closely. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t by chance know how to bring him back, would you?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me like I\u2019m a moron. \u201cDo you think if I did, I\u2019d tell you...\u201d He trails off, tipping his head back with his eyes to the ceiling as he smirks. \u201cWait a minute. We have company.\u201d</p> <p>My forehead creases. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before I can finish, Cameron poofs into thin air with only a wisp of smoke that takes the form of a shadow left behind.</p><p>\u201cOh, Emmy,\u201d Raven singsongs, and my entire body stiffens. \u201cCan you come downstairs? I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Weeks of silence and suddenly she\u2019s barging into my home like we\u2019re still friends? My initial reaction is to run and hide, like I\u2019m a little kid, but I\u2019m not a little kid and I know if I stay up here, then she\u2019s just going to come up. So I reach for the knife I leave on my nightstand\u2014the one I stabbed the guy with\u2014then walk out of the room.</p><p>When I reach the top of the stairway, I spot her standing in the foyer, twisting a strand of her bubble gum pink hair around her finger. She looks like she always does; sapphire eyes framed with glitter, glossy lips, wearing black high-heeled boots and a short dress that matches them. There are only two differences between the Raven I met when I was a kid and this one standing in front of me. This one has a fresh scar on her throat where the fake detective\u2014that was really part of the Anamotti\u2014slit Raven\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I start down the stairway, slipping the pocket knife into my back pocket, knowing there\u2019s no way I\u2019d actually use it on her, but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use it on the Anamotti.</p> <p>She beams at me like there\u2019s nothing going on, as though we haven\u2019t been ignoring each other for weeks and that she never had secret rendezvous with my brother every night. That she\u2019s not possessed by the Anamotti, even though the X branded on her arm suggests otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to say hi to my best friend, silly.\u201d She meets me at the bottom of the stairs and then loops her arm through mine. I wince from the contact, her death smothering me like a heavy blanket. Standing on the ledge. Someone begs her to jump, so she does, falling to her death. She glances down at my wrists, noting the gloves I have on to cover up the lines on my skin from drinking Cameron\u2019s life. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the arm warmers, you weirdo? You\u2019re not even outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wear stuff like this,\u201d I say, which is the truth and normally she wouldn\u2019t question it.</p><p>She flicks the edge of the fabric with her finger. \u201cNot when you\u2019re just hanging at the house.\u201d She dithers, releasing my arm with a suspicious look on her face. \u201cWait a minute... are you going out on a date or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I have no one to go out on a date with,\u201d I remind her; or whoever\u2019s controlling her. \u201cUnlike you, who seems to be going out with my brother at the moment.\u201d It\u2019s a challenge. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re still meeting up, but I\u2019d like to find out.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t miss a beat, managing to breezily dodge my question and focus the conversation back on me. \u201cMaybe you have a date with that guy that moved in across the street. You know, the one that creeper Cameron lived in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis uncle?\u201d I ask. \u201cHe\u2019s really old.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs with a malicious twinkle in her eye. \u201cMaybe you like old dudes now. I mean, I feel like I barely know you anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the same as I\u2019ve always been.\u201d I maintain her gaze, wishing I had that book again so maybe I could figure out a way to bring my friend back. \u201cI think you\u2019re the one that\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re different,\u201d she replies. \u201cIn fact, you seem even crazier than when we first met.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, knowing she\u2019s trying to get a rise out of me. \u201cRaven, why are you here? Other than to insult me. Did you just stop by to see Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to see Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, because you\u2019ve been letting him paint you.\u201d I resist an eye roll at her feigned lack of remembering. \u201cI know you\u2019re his secret muse that sneaks into the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t done that in a few weeks,\u201d she says, discounting the truth. \u201cI only came over here to see you.\u201d</p><p>My mouth sinks to a frown. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cBecause we\u2019re friends and I want to hang out.\u201d Then she grabs my arm again and starts to drag me towards the front door. \u201cI thought we could have some fun like we used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to me in weeks.\u201d I plant my feet firmly on the floor, refusing to budge. \u201cAnd now suddenly you want us to be friends again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was thinking we should go bowling tonight.\u201d She tugs on my arm, ignoring me.</p><p>\u201cBowling? Seriously? That\u2019s why you came over here?\u201d I refuse to move and walk into whatever trap is lying ahead of me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019d be fun,\u201d she says with a huge smile plastered on her face.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in class?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou take art on Tuesdays, right?\u201d With Professor Morgan, who I\u2019m supposed to be calling in like an hour.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in class?\u201d she retorts in a whiney sing-song. We stare each other down until she ultimately lets go of my arm and then stomps her foot against the floor. \u201cOh, come on, go bowling with me. Please? It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I say, retreating for the living room. \u201cIt would be weird and awkward like this whole conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She tilts her head, confounded. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing weird about this conversation. We\u2019re just two best friends hanging out.\u201d</p><p>I stop backing away when I reach the doorway of the living room and then point at the front door. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not and you should go.\u201d</p><p>Now, Ember, is that any way to speak to your best friend. Cameron\u2019s voice reemerges in my head.</p><p>How the hell do I get you out of my head? I say loudly inside my head.</p><p>You don\u2019t.</p><p>I hate you.</p><p>No you don\u2019t. You want me, more than you\u2019d like to admit.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to say it out loud, but it slips out.</p><p>Raven gapes at me like I\u2019ve lost it. \u201cEm, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest. \u201cOh, like you already don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not okay. That nothing is okay.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know about me, Cameron hisses in my head. I already told you I\u2019m not part of the Anamotti and that Reapers hate me and my family, and if you know what\u2019s best for you, you won\u2019t utter a word to her about me.</p><p>Well, if that\u2019s what you don\u2019t want me to do, then it\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m not really planning on telling her, just making a threat. When I open my mouth, my jaw snaps shut of its own accord.</p><p>I guess we\u2019re going to do this the hard way then. He sighs, like he\u2019s so disappointed. I really would rather not, but you give me no choice.</p><p>Suddenly, my mouth turns upward into an enormous grin as I span my hands out to the sides of me. \u201cI\u2019d love to go bowling.\u201d The voice belongs to me, but I\u2019m not controlling it; I\u2019m suddenly nothing more than a puppet, just like everyone else at school.</p><p>Cameron, knock it off! I try to run towards the stairs and grab ahold of the railing, but my feet remain planted in place.</p><p>No, you need to go with her. It\u2019s important. He sounds serious, which is weird for him. It might help us figure some stuff out.</p><p>Us? There is no us. With a loud grunt, I manage to get my foot up and then step back very ungracefully, bumping my hip into the corner table.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d I ask Raven in a very cordial tone.</p><p>Cameron chuckles. Shall we? I guess I probably should have done better than that.</p><p>I feel a hot sensation whisk through my body and then he swiftly takes over, making my legs move, bringing my knees up a little too far so it looks like I\u2019m marching in a parade. Raven follows after me with a perplexed look on her face as I stumble to the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Raven asks as I open the front door and stumble over the threshold. Sunlight shines down on me, yet I feel like I\u2019m stuck in the shadows. In the cold.</p><p>You\u2019re feeling me, he explains. I know it\u2019s not the best sensation, but bear with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d My mouth moves as I trip down the stairway and onto the lawn. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly okay.\u201d I plaster a smile on my face, but on the inside I feel completely hollow. So cold. As though I\u2019m losing control of who I am as well as what makes me feel things. I think I could do anything at the moment\u2014good or bad\u2014and be okay with it.</p><p>Cameron, what is that? Why is everything so cold? It feels almost like that night in the room when the shadow dove into me.</p><p>I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about, he says. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s telling the truth or not. But that coldness you feel is the feeling of death, he explains. You\u2019re feeling me right now and the energy of the souls I\u2019ve stolen. I\u2019m part of you at the moment, Ember; part of your mind, body and soul. I just wish I could figure out how to take it. And who knows, maybe you\u2019ll break down and tell me.</p><p>Part of my soul?</p><p>Oh, God. I\u2019m in deep shit.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>The cops that are always parked out in front of my house are gone, probably taking one of their very rare breaks. The sun is shining down on the neighborhood, but it\u2019s eerily quiet with everyone too afraid to step outside or something. Leaves shower from the trees and land on the frosted ground, crunching underneath my boots.</p><p>\u201cI made them leave,\u201d Raven states as we cross the piece of lawn between our houses to her car parked in the driveway next door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMade who leave?\u201d I work to stay upright as Cameron ungracefully controls my legs.</p><p>She grins as she rounds the back of her silver car. \u201cThe cops.\u201d She unlocks the door, smiling to herself. \u201cI know they\u2019ve been watching you.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard as my arm stretches out and my fingers wrap around the door handle. I give it a tug and the door swings open. Then, bumping my head on the ceiling, I climb in. Raven gets in too and starts up the car.</p><p>\u201cThey think you killed all those girls,\u201d she says as she starts the engine while I buckle my seatbelt.</p> <p>See, I care about you, Cameron says as he forces me to buckle it.</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019m sure you do. And that\u2019s why you\u2019ve made me get into a car with a</p><p>girl that\u2019s possessed by the Anamotti and is probably leading me straight into a trap.</p><p>Just trust me. That\u2019s what we want.</p><p>I already told you that you have to earn trust and this isn\u2019t the way.</p> <p>\u201cSo, this should be fun,\u201d Raven says as she backs down the driveway and turns onto the street.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>What do you mean this is what we want? How are you doing this, Cameron? How are you controlling me? I thought the Anamotti couldn\u2019t control me like they control part of the humans.</p><p>I already told you that I\u2019m not part of the Anamotti.</p><p>Yeah, but you weren\u2019t able to do this before... make me move like this and talk inside my head. So what\u2019s changed?</p><p>You.</p> <p>What do you mean?</p><p>I sit quietly in the passenger seat of Raven\u2019s car, waiting for an answer, however he offers me none. I rack my brain for something that might have changed over the last few days, but I draw up a blank other than the fact that I\u2019ve gotten lonelier.</p><p>Is that how you\u2019re doing it? I ask. Because I\u2019m lonely and vulnerable.</p><p>He stays silent and I wonder if he\u2019s still inside me. I\u2019ve gotten less cold and the hollowness is starting to fill again. Perhaps he lost his hold over me. How can I find out for sure, though? I glance at Raven and then at the door handle, deciding to give it a try. I wait for her to slow down at the stop sign at the end of the road and then I focus on moving my hand towards the handle to jump out of the car, but it won\u2019t budge\u2014nothing will. Not my legs. My feet. My arms. Dammit!</p><p>I sit up straight in the seat with my hands on my lap, doing the only thing I can do. Nothing. Raven has the air conditioning cranked up even though it\u2019s cold outside with frost glazing the leaves and sidewalks and everyone walking up and down the sidewalk is wearing jackets. I didn\u2019t even think to grab mine, but then again, I wasn\u2019t really thinking on my own when I left the house.</p><p>Relax, you look beautiful, Cameron assures me. You always do.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d I say and Raven shoots me a stunned look.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She says, turning down the radio with one hand while she grips onto the steering wheel with the other.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d I sigh and rotate towards the window, knowing there\u2019s probably a very slim chance that I\u2019m just going bowling. Cameron starts laughing in my head again while Raven mutters something under her breath about me losing my mind. I need to calm down. Get myself together. Yes, Cameron has control of my body, but he doesn\u2019t have control of my mind. I start creating poetry, putting letters and words together.</p><p>Wings of freedom</p><p>Eyes of light</p><p>Touch that stills me</p><p>And Comforts</p><p>Like rays of sunshine</p><p>Instead of shadows</p><p>I start to relax, but then Cameron\u2019s and my thoughts mingle, and he takes over my internal poetry.</p><p>Through the whispers of the willows,</p><p>One leaf strives to survive</p><p>But endangered from the wind and branches,</p><p>It slowly starts to die</p><p>Though maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s better for it;</p><p>To give up, surrender, and make peace</p><p>Then perhaps it will taste the powerful freedom</p><p>Of the wind.</p><p>The darkness.</p><p>Surrender and give in.</p><p>I keep my thoughts to myself, pretending that Cameron isn\u2019t inside my head, that this isn\u2019t happening, but he chortles, reminding me that he\u2019s there.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s school, Emmy?\u201d Raven asks as she merges the car onto the highway. She\u2019s using my nickname to get to me. She knows that\u2019s what my dad used to call me and that it hurts whenever I hear it.</p><p>\u201cSchools great,\u201d I lie with a tight smile, wondering if she knows what\u2019s been going on there. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you around much, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I spend most of my time in the art room.\u201d She beams from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d I keep my tone light. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been very happy then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh superbly happily,\u201d she says. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with the art Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been spending time with Professor Morgan?\u201d I question in doubt. How can that be if he\u2019s good?</p><p>Raven nods while she checks her reflection in the mirror as we drive over the bridge. \u201cI have. In fact, we meet up every day after his last class.\u201d</p><p>See I told you, Cameron says. Don\u2019t trust anyone.</p><p>Just because he\u2019s spending time with her, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s bad.</p><p>Do you really believe that?</p><p>I\u2019m not sure. And that\u2019s the painful truth. I thought it was a little weird to begin with that Asher\u2019s uncle abruptly approached me and handed all that information to me on a silver platter. Not to mention that he then gave me the blank book that doesn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s super hot, too, just like Asher,\u201d Raven says, interrupting my thoughts.</p><p>My heart tightens in my chest at the mention of Asher. God, I miss him, more than I allow myself to. I wish he was here with me, filling me with the quiet and fulfillment his touch brings whenever he feels me, kisses me\u2014</p><p>Wow, living in your head is kind of disturbing. Cameron sounds annoyed.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you never did explain to me where Asher went,\u201d Raven says, adjusting her mirror. \u201cAfter that whole fiasco in the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>My mouth moves on its own. \u201cI think he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Raven gapes at me, genuinely stunned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, back in the cemetery.\u201d I have no control anymore.</p><p>She seems unconvinced, shooting me a doubtful look. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem that upset about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s because I was really in love with Cameron.\u201d I try to shake my head at Cameron, but fail.</p><p>What? He asks innocently. Weren\u2019t you in love with him?</p><p>I\u2019m not sure... just like I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m talking to you about this.</p><p>Raven gapes at me in disbelief for a moment before she returns her attention back to the road, grabbing her sunglasses from the cup holder between us and putting them on. I watch Hollows Grove blur by; Phil\u2019s Shenanigans and Fun, the bar Asher and I had our first date in, the outdated buildings that make up Main Street, an auto shop, and the trailer park. Finally, at the end of it\u2014near the mouth of the canyon\u2014we pull up in front of Dina\u2019s Bowling Alley. An open sign flashes in neon pink from the window and there are groups of people hanging around by the front door.</p><p>\u201cWow, there are a lot of people here,\u201d she remarks as she puts the car into park and turns off the engine. \u201cThis should be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Even though I don\u2019t want to, my fingers find the buckle of the seat belt and unfasten it. Then I get out of the car and meet Raven at the front, hyperaware that there are a lot of eyes focused on me. Things only get stranger when we enter the building and it\u2019s packed. Everyone looks really happy, too; too happy. Laughing. Chatting. Smiles. Drinks. It\u2019s not like at the college, yet there\u2019s still something off about it; like I\u2019ve stepped into a 1950s sitcom where everyone is eerily cheery.</p><p>The walls are splashed with rainbow patterns and there are arcade games to my left, flashing florescent colors and making loud noises. A 1970s something song plays from the speakers and it seems like a lot of the people around know the lyrics as they mutter them under their breath and sway their hips to the beat. To my right, there\u2019s a very long waiting line to get shoes and to pay for a lane. I search their faces, looking for signs that their eyes are glowing; that they\u2019re possessed.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d Raven tells me, taking her sunglasses off and putting them on top of her head. Then she skips to the front counter, swinging her arms while guys check out her ass.</p><p>My body reclines against the wall beside the door and waits to find out what she\u2019s up to. Probably something bad, I\u2019m sure, but I need to figure out what the Anamotti have got up their sleeve.</p><p>Relax, I won\u2019t let anything hurt you. His voice fills my head. It sounds like he\u2019s being sincere, too.</p><p>Why are you doing this? And how? How can you suddenly control me?</p><p>That\u2019s not important right now. All I need from you at this moment is to do what I tell you to do. Then, hopefully, this will go smoothly.</p><p>What\u2019s going to go smoothly? Please just tell me something! I start to get worked up again, fighting to regain control of my body; attempting to bend my knees, my elbow, even blink on my own.</p><p>Keep calm. You\u2019re standing in a room full of the Anamotti.</p><p>My jaw wants to drop as my gaze swiftly sweeps around the room, and the truth slaps me in the head as I realize that everyone around me has an X carved into their forehead or on their arm, their eye... Garrick, the guy who tormented me the first time Raven was possessed.</p><p>He looks just how I remember him; ridiculous sideburns, a leather jacket and the X over his eye like it\u2019s an eye patch. He recognizes me, too. I can see it on his face as he stares at me through the crowd, leaning against the wall with a knowing smile on his face. Yet, he turns away like nothing happened between us, like he didn\u2019t try to kill me. As if he doesn\u2019t want to.</p><p>Don\u2019t panic. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you, Cameron promises. Trust me, princess. I might not always do things that are good, but when it comes to you, I do.</p><p>I laugh aloud and a sturdy guy carrying a soda shoots me a suspicious look. I clear my throat and pretend to have a fascination with a small space of floor in front of my feet, worried that if I look up, they\u2019ll all attack me. I\u2019m practically in a shark pit, and yet, no one is taking a bite. It\u2019s not the same as at the college. The people there were in a trance state, however these people seem very alert. Very alive.</p><p>That\u2019s because they\u2019re Anamotti, Cameron says. Not humans with possessed souls.</p><p>Then why aren\u2019t they coming after me?</p><p>Because they have a plan.</p><p>What sort of plan? I ask, but he doesn\u2019t respond. Cameron, why did you bring me here? What\u2019s the point, other than to get me to walk straight into the enemy\u2019s hands?</p><p>To find out something important... something that might help you stop that death omen from happening, or at least help us figure out more about it.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s telling the truth, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it right now. I look over at the counter where Raven is laughing at something the cash register guy says. He\u2019s got an X on his forehead, too, and Raven has one on her forearm. They both look happy, but in a really creepy, possessed way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Is she... is she one of them? I mean, is that even possible? To change into one? I ask Cameron, not wanting to trust him, but I don\u2019t have a choice at the moment. I can\u2019t even feel my legs and arms anymore.</p><p>She\u2019s possessed, yes, but she\u2019s not one of them... yet. Yes, it\u2019s possible, though. To die and become a Reaper if under the possession for too long.</p><p>I manage to glance down at my arms, noting that they\u2019re shaking from the fear I\u2019m sure I feel, yet the coldness inside me blocks it out.</p><p>You won\u2019t die, princess. Relax.</p> <p>That\u2019s not what I\u2019m upset about. Well, not the only reason.</p><p>I hate thinking about how Asher risked breaking the rules to save Raven. On the night I first met Asher, he was supposed to collect Raven\u2019s soul after Landon tried to rape and kill her but instead he killed Landon because he said he saw in my eyes that Raven meant a lot to me. And now look at her; possessed and fraternizing with the enemy. Asher\u2019s risk was all for nothing and now he\u2019s being punished for it.</p><p>Is she... are they going to hurt me? I ask Cameron with my eyes fixed on Raven while she throws her head back and laughs as the cashier guy leans on the counter eyeing her with want.</p><p>No, but they\u2019re going to fuck with your head. That\u2019s why they brought you here. They\u2019re trying to break you down quickly and hopefully get you arrested for the murders.</p><p>I swallow hard, frozen in place even though I want to run. That\u2019s why they sent Raven to get me today? She\u2019s setting me up, right? But I don\u2019t get it. Why would she ever think I\u2019d come with her when she knows I know she\u2019s under the control of the Anamotti. Isn\u2019t she even a little suspicious of why I just came with her without much of a fight?</p> <p>Well, I think, if you didn\u2019t willingly come here, he says. Then they probably would have forced you to. He pauses. And here\u2019s the really crazy part of all this; I\u2019m going to need you to play along with whatever they try to do to you. Let them think they\u2019ve got into your head, like they did back at the Halloween dance, let them think you\u2019re caving to them so they\u2019ll let their guard down... let things slip. Make mistakes.</p><p>I try to inch towards the door, but to no avail. No. Way. I need to leave, Cameron. I can\u2019t get arrested again.</p><p>You can\u2019t go yet. I need you to find out... He trails off.</p><p>Cameron, I need more details if\u2014</p><p>\u201cHey, Emmy.\u201d Raven appears in front of me with a pair of shoes in each of her hands and a fake smile on her face. \u201cYou ready for this?\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat several times before Cameron lets me speak again. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I take the shoes she offers me and then weave through the crowd towards a bench at the back near the cubbies, practically skipping.</p> <p>Cameron, please tone down the skipping. I don\u2019t walk like this.</p><p>He laughs, but then sighs. Yeah, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s more of a Raven thing.</p><p>My feet slow as I reach the cubby area in the corner. I fight to breathe as hundreds of deaths pour through me like liquid fire, scorching my skin, as I walk through the crowd. Fire. Drowning. Hanging. Pain. Blood. Solitude. It singes the back of my throat as I taste each one, but I inhale through my nose and feel Cameron trying to help me stay calm. When I sink down on the bench, I breathe freely as the crowd parts and opens up. I hear balls rolling down the lanes behind me, crashing against the pins as I slip off my boots and tuck them into a cubby.</p><p>Raven drops down beside me and slips her foot out of her boot. \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at her as I tie my shoe. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>She kicks off her other boot and then wiggles her foot into her shoe. \u201cAbout this place, duh.\u201d She rolls her eyes at me.</p><p>I shrug as I tie my other shoe. \u201cLooks like the bowling alley we\u2019ve had in town since I was six.\u201d</p><p>She grins at me, and for a second, she looks like my real best friend. \u201cRemember how my dad used to take us here?\u201d</p> <p>I nod, genuinely smiling, and Cameron lets it through. The memory is a good one and deserves the credit. \u201cI do. It was a lot of fun. Probably the most fun I ever had at the time.\u201d</p><p>Her grin expands as she slips on the other shoe and laces it. \u201cIt was, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d I agree and then the conversation stops as I sit there, waiting for whatever comes next.</p><p>Raven finishes putting her shoes on then pulls me to my feet and drags me over to the lanes, stopping in front of two guys. They both are tall with the same black hair styled to the side, but their eye color is different and their features slightly vary; one\u2019s are sharper than the other\u2019s. Still, the resemblance between them is freakishly strange.</p><p>\u201cEmmy, I\u2019d like to introduce you to Geldon and Emerson.\u201d Raven gestures between the two of them while I attempt not to stare at the X\u2019s branded on their foreheads.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you,\u201d I say with a smile.</p><p>They smile back, but there\u2019s darkness behind it and then Geldon reaches out to shake my hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d His voice purrs out like a cat ready to pounce on a mouse and devour it.</p><p>I think he likes you, Cameron jokes, but his amusement falls flat.</p><p>\u201cEmber.\u201d Holding my breath, I wrap my fingers around his hand. Screams. Blood pouring like a river. I can\u2019t see. Where did you go? Fall. Fall. Fall. \u201cEmber.\u201d He continues to hold my hand with his gaze fastened on me like I\u2019m a piece of candy he wants to taste. \u201cThat\u2019s a unique name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is Geldon,\u201d I reply, trying to pull my hand away, but Cameron has taken over again and all I can do is helplessly stand there, feeling his horrid death. I can\u2019t go alone. Come with me. I need to breathe. Fly. Do you trust me? No!</p><p>Finally, he frees my hand and thankfully Emerson seems more focused on Raven than getting to know me. I wonder what happened with Garrick, the member of the Anamotti she was dating the first time she was possessed. Just a few weeks ago Raven was under his possession, but now they act as if they don\u2019t recognize each other.</p><p>Raven is obeying orders from someone else, Cameron clarifies. Her connection with Garrick doesn\u2019t exist anymore.</p><p>What do you mean her connection?</p><p>I mean that, in the past, Garrick was the one controlling everything Raven did to you, but now there\u2019s someone else controlling her.</p><p>Like how you\u2019re controlling me? I head towards the seating area.</p><p>No, this is different. What I did to you... well, not everyone can do that. You\u2019re a Grim Angel and you\u2019re not supposed to be possessed.</p><p>I start to lower myself into a chair in front of the lane beside the score board, but Cameron forces me to head towards the bowling balls while Geldon follows behind me, chatting about food and sodas, asking if I\u2019m hungry, however I barely can hear him.</p><p>I pause when I reach the balls. So who exactly is possessing Raven now, if it\u2019s not Garrick?</p><p>Cameron doesn\u2019t respond, instead he makes me search for a ball. At the same time, Emerson and Raven quickly start making out in one of the seats; Raven straddling his lap while he reaches up her dress, grabbing her ass.</p><p>\u201cDo they know each other?\u201d I ask Geldon as he stuffs his hands into the pockets of his jeans, watching me with inquisitiveness.</p><p>\u201cAs much as anyone else knows each other here,\u201d he says with a wink.</p><p>I shudder at his wink as I select a pink ball and pick it up. It\u2019s a lot heavier than I expected and I almost drop it on my toe.</p><p>\u201cEasy there,\u201d Geldon says, reaching out and helping me get the ball back into my hand.</p><p>I force a tight smile as he braces his hand on the small of my back. \u201cThanks,\u201d I mutter then approach the lane.</p><p>What the hell am I doing here? I ask Cameron.</p><p>Well, the point is to try and knock over as many pins as you can.</p><p>I\u2019m not talking about bowling, Cameron. I roll my eyes as I stop at the edge of the lane. I mean here, at the bowling alley. What are we looking for?</p><p>You\u2019re looking for their leader, Cameron whispers.</p><p>The Reapers\u2019 leader? I shut one of my eyes and get a good aim at the pins as I bring my arm back.</p><p>No, the leader of the Anamotti, the one who has made it his mission to track down all the Grim Angels and get rid of them one by one. I think he might know something about what\u2019s going on with our leader and maybe what he looks like.</p><p>The leader of the Anamotti is here in the bowling alley, right now?</p><p>I think so. At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping.</p><p>What does he look like? I ask, angling my head to the side as I focus on the pins at the end of the lane.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure, he says. All I know is that his name is Alton.</p><p>Shaking my head, I stroll forward and swing my arm forward, stumbling at the last second. My aim starts to drift to the side towards the gutter, but Cameron quickly seizes control and jerks me back to the left, regaining my balance for me. My fingers leave the holes in the ball and seconds later it\u2019s rolling straight towards the pins.</p><p>Strike. He laughs as all the pins topple over.</p><p>I roll my eyes as I turn around, ready to head back to the bench and sit down. Instead, I crash straight into a rock solid chest.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mutter, pushing back, but someone grabs ahold of my wrist and secures me in place. Their body heat floods me instead of their death. I slowly tip my chin up and meet the eyes of a tall stranger. Beautiful eyes that glisten like pieces of sea glass. His blonde hair runs to his shoulders, his features flawless like they were carved out of stone and his lips are as red as a rose... or blood. I\u2019ve also seen him before, in the newspaper, and when I was at the campus today. Edmund Baker, town Mayor, and Mackenzie\u2019s dad.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m a lot stronger than I look,\u201d he says, his voice is melodious and welcoming.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so...\u201d I trail off, my lips refusing to move anymore. It feels like I should feel more fear, but all I feel is numb. Dead inside. Stunned.</p><p>Shit, Cameron whispers. I\u2019m losing control of you...</p><p>What...? My thoughts get lost in the magnetism I feel pulling me towards the person before me.</p><p>The corners of his lips turn upward into a grin. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, dazzled by his eyes, his lips, by everything. It\u2019s like I\u2019m drowning in him and suddenly the cold inside me doesn\u2019t feel so cold anymore. It feels very inviting. In fact, I crave it; crave death. \u201cI\u2019m fine...\u201d</p><p>Why the hell am I not more afraid? This man murdered his daughter.</p><p>Ember, don\u2019t let him get control...</p><p>His smile darkens. \u201cYou look a little flushed.\u201d</p><p>I feel flushed. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I promise.\u201d My head does feel extremely foggy, though; like I\u2019m standing near a lake and fog is circling me everywhere while I can barely think or see straight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Alton,\u201d he says and I know I\u2019m in deep trouble, yet I can\u2019t seem to react to it. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmber Rose Edwards,\u201d I say dazedly, still gazing up at him. Alton. The mayor is Alton. The mayor is the leader of the Anamotti? Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful name,\u201d he tells me then lifts his hand to stroke my cheek. He sweeps his finger across my cheekbone once and then withdraws his hand back to his side. \u201cVery poetic.\u201d He assesses me for a moment more, and then starts to pull me with him as he heads over towards the counter. \u201cHere; come with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I follow him without even questioning him, not moving my own feet, yet I don\u2019t think Cameron is the one controlling me anymore, either. It\u2019s Alton, although I don\u2019t understand how.</p><p>Alton leads me over to the concession area with his hand resting on the small of my back, effortlessly steering me through the crowd. I think he\u2019s going to get in line, but instead he strolls up to the front, cutting in line exactly how Raven did with the shoes.</p><p>\u201cTwo waters, Adellia,\u201d he says to the lady behind the counter who\u2019s over-dressed in a sparkling, floor length skirt, a sheer top and hoop earrings with her hair done up in curls.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Alton,\u201d she says and then rushes off to the soda fountain as if he\u2019s the most important person in the world.</p> <p>I find myself leaning into Alton, and his grip tightens on me as he draws me closer and breathes in my scent. \u201cYou smell so good.\u201d</p><p>Cameron, what should I do...? I\u2019m losing control... and this guy... he\u2019s Mackenzie\u2019s dad.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond and I start to get worried. Cameron said that the Anamotti brought me here to set me up. Is that what\u2019s going on? Has Alton taken over my body so he can force me to say I\u2019m the one who\u2019s been murdering people?</p><p>I peer around the room, looking for cops, but all I see are Anamotti. Everywhere.</p><p>\u201cSo, Ember, are you from here?\u201d Alton asks, relaxing against the counter top, putting his elbow on top of the glass.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived here all my life,\u201d I admit, not under my own will, but I can\u2019t tell whose will it is anymore; who\u2019s controlling me.</p><p>\u201cWow, you must have some interesting stories,\u201d he says, admiring his refection in the glass of the counter top, gripping onto my arm. I have to lean forward with him.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I notice how quiet the room has gotten and I look around. Everyone is gathering around and watching me with hunger in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know, there is a rumor that the town was built on an old battlefield, one that went on between the Angels and the Reapers and conclusively the Grim Angel breed was created right afterward,\u201d Alton tells me, flicking his hair with his pinky as his fingers finally leave my arm. \u201cThat the town is linked to every part of the battle, every part of death, and therefore carries a lot of power linked to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask as the cashier lady returns with our waters, grinning at Talton and narrowing her eyes at me. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you haven\u2019t.\u201d He devilishly smiles as he picks up the cup. \u201cWhy would you? No one else knows. No human anyway.\u201d</p> <p>I swallow the lump in my throat as the people around me start to close in on me. \u201cI think I should go\u2014\u201d Someone nudges me from behind and I trip forward, straight into Alton.</p><p>His arms envelope me so he can steady me to my feet. \u201cEither you really like falling into me or you\u2019re clumsy. But I\u2019ll take either.\u201d He takes hold of my arm again, his fingers pressing down into my skin so hard that I wonder if I\u2019ll have bruises. Then he reaches behind his back with his free hand and I wish I could do the same thing. Take the knife out of my back pocket. Stab him. Kill him.</p><p>But I\u2019m frozen in place, unable to control my own body, and all I can do is wait. This is it. I can feel it. They\u2019re about to take me down.</p><p>\u201cYou know, a lot is going to change around this town soon. A lot of deaths will be happening,\u201d he says, which causes me to think of the death omen I saw back at the campus. \u201cAll for a greater cause, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeaths you cause.\u201d Suddenly my mouth and words are my own again. Freedom. It tastes divine. However I have no room for celebration as the Anamotti start to close in on me.</p><p>Alton smiles cleverly at me. \u201cOf course. Who else would be clever enough to cause them?\u201d</p><p>Grinning like the Cheshire cat, I scoot out of his hold. \u201cWell, it could easily have been The Torva.\u201d My brief control is gone again, back in the hands of who the hell knows. \u201cThey are cleverer than the Anamotti.\u201d</p><p>He misses a beat as he searches my eyes with a hint of fear in his own. Whatever the hell the Torva is has him worried. \u201cI see you know more than I thought, which surprises me. My daughter said you weren\u2019t very bright.\u201d</p> <p>The daughter you killed, I want to say it, but I lose control of my mouth again, Cameron taking over.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d I respond nonchalantly. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m part of you, aren\u2019t I? Half Angel. Half Reaper. Your blood runs through my veins and so does your knowledge.\u201d</p><p>His lids lower as he glares at me, his arm moving from behind his back. I detect a flicker of silver, like a blade catching in the light, and I try to reach behind my own back, for my own knife.</p><p>My knee springs upward and slams straight into the guy\u2019s balls with more force than I know I\u2019m capable of. Human or not, Alton still crumples to his knees, his face contorted in pain. Seconds later, I\u2019m diving for him, cupping his face in-between my hands. Without even thinking, I dip down and seal my lips to his, swiftly breathing in his life. I taste the deaths of the girl\u2019s he\u2019s killed. I can feel the power residing inside him, the power he gets from death. I feel this twisted urge to kill him\u2014kill other people. It\u2019s flowing off him and coursing through me, along with the potent death omen. Blood. People covering the street. So much blood.</p><p>He groans as I jerk back with the faint taste of him on my tongue. My lips part in shock as I feel his life burning venomously through me. I start to back away, withdrawing the knife, very aware that I\u2019m the one who took it out. I want to kill him. Hurt him. Bleed him out until he\u2019s screaming for mercy.</p><p>What\u2019s happening to me?</p><p>Anger burns in Alton\u2019s eyes as he glares at me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it.\u201d I lunge forward and strike the blade of the knife across his cheek, drawing a trail of blood.</p><p>He growls as someone slams into me and I fall to the ground, flat on my stomach, dropping my knife. Black capes swish around me as my head smacks against the floor. My ears ring while I see feathers floating everywhere. Just like in the alley.</p><p>I push myself up, wanting to charge each one of them and cause them incredible amounts of misery and pain, but I\u2019m pulled back down to the ground by the power of Cameron. Then, suddenly, the capes shift into shadows that dance and twirl around me, chilling the air. When there\u2019s a loud bang, I cover my head, feeling the fire on my back again; sweltering heat, melting my skin. It feels as if my flesh is tearing open and suddenly, there\u2019s a bursting of the pressure that has built. Black feathers rain all around me and then everything goes silent.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>In the corner</p><p>Lives a girl</p><p>Balled up</p><p>Lonely</p><p>Sullen</p><p>Locked away</p><p>By herself</p><p>She gave up</p><p>Curling in</p><p>Like a petal</p><p>Dying</p><p>Wilting</p><p>Edges browning</p><p>Cracking</p><p>So easy</p><p>The petal fell</p><p>Scattered like dust</p><p>Across</p><p>The charred ground</p><p>Covered with Cinders</p><p>Waiting to burn out.</p><p>\u201cEmber, open your eyes,\u201d Cameron whispers, his voice hued with panic. \u201cCome on, fight it.\u201d</p><p>My skin sears, liquid fire pulsating through my veins. I need something; I need deaths. Souls. I need blood on my hands. I need the fire on my back to subside. I need to stop melting.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, princess.\u201d Cameron sounds worried, but I can\u2019t see him. I can\u2019t see anything; I can only feel the aching need to feel death on my lips again.</p><p>\u201cI need it,\u201d I whisper. \u201cDeath... I need it.\u201d</p><p>Cameron mutters under his breath and then he\u2019s surrounding me, touching me, feeling me with his hands. I bask in it, wanting to press my lips against his and steal the breath from him, but I can\u2019t find him. Yet he ends up finding me and giving me exactly what I want.</p><p>Our lips touch.</p><p>He feeds my hunger.</p><p>Fills my veins.</p><p>Bringing me closer to death.</p><p>And farther away from life.</p><p>From good.</p><p>From Asher.</p><p>My eyelids flutter open, my eyeballs rolling back into my head that throbs in protest along with my whole body. My lids slip back shut. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d I groan. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been run over by a truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a truck, just a stampede of Anamotti.\u201d The sound of Cameron\u2019s voice hurts my head even more, especially since it\u2019s no longer in my head. \u201cPlus, you fed off their leader\u2019s death, so I\u2019m sure that didn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d I groan, clutching onto my head. \u201cWhat was all that stuff... or was I dreaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t dreaming,\u201d he says. \u201cYou fed off Alton\u2019s life, not because of me. It made you turn rabid for a moment, too much evil blood. But don\u2019t worry; I helped you out.\u201d</p><p>When I finally get my eyelids to open, I squint as the light of my room hits them. After I blink a few times, things around me start to take shape. My walls. My bed. My window. Cameron standing beside my doorway, looking very relaxed with his hands in his pockets and a bored expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you helped me out?\u201d I ask, but as soon as I say it, I feel the lines on my arms burn. \u201cDammit, Cameron, did you make me take more of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to,\u201d he insists, strolling towards me. He sinks down on the bed, the mattress concaving beneath his weight. \u201cAlton\u2019s blood was too much for you and you would have probably gone on a killing spree if I didn\u2019t override it with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd like your blood is any better.\u201d I ask, sitting up.</p><p>He shrugs nonchalantly. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like killing anyone right now, right? You should be thanking me.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him even though he\u2019s right. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had to go through any of it if you wouldn\u2019t have forced me to go to the bowling alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only trying to help you. If we can get to Alton, then maybe we can get to the leader of the Reapers, figure out what he looks like, what he\u2019s planning.\u201d His fingers brush my legs, sending shivers through my body.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so dead set on stopping him?\u201d I wonder, leaning against the headboard. \u201cWhen he\u2019s the leader of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of reasons,\u201d he says, bringing his knee up onto the bed. \u201cOne being that if I find him and can kill him it means freeing my family from a curse. He\u2019s been in hiding forever and impossible to get to, but if he\u2019s here than not so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that makes the Logan\u2019s outcasts,\u201d he explains in a venomous tone. \u201cTraps us here on earth even after the battle is over and quite honestly I\u2019m getting sick and tired of being trapped in the human world. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d I search his eyes for a sign that he\u2019s lying, but for once he seems like he\u2019s telling the truth. \u201cWell, I want to stop him too. And stop Alton from murdering anymore people.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it... he killed all those girls because he needed they\u2019re deaths... I could feel it flowing off him\u2014the need to kill so he could survive and gain power.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asks, stiffening. \u201cHe needs to kill to survive and gain power?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThat\u2019s what I felt when I drank some of his life... death. It\u2019s weird because usually my gift doesn\u2019t work like that\u2014usually I only see the person\u2019s death. But I felt the death\u2019s on him and his need for deaths.\u201d</p><p>He brushes strands of his hair out of his eyes, with a pucker in his brow. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like the leader of the Anamotti at all,\u201d he says, staring off into empty space.</p><p>\u201cI think it does,\u201d I disagree, remembering how the detective tried to kill Raven with no remorse at all. \u201cA guy who\u2019s killing innocent girls to feed his sick urge to take people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just an urge,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a need\u2014a need that the leader of the Reapers has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the leader of the Anamotti is the leader of the Reapers?\u201d I ask incredulously. \u201cYou think Alton is Altarius Vinceton.\u201d I pause as I say it, my poetry forming mind sifting through the letters. \u201cTake the first two letters of Altarius and the last three of Vinceton and you have Alton.\u201d</p><p>The color drains from Cameron\u2019s face. \u201cThis is very bad,\u201d he says, his gaze elevating to me and for a fleeting instant I see fear. \u201cNot only because he\u2019s the mayor of the town, but it also means that the leader of the Reapers is now rebelling with the Anamotti and torturing Grim Angels, which means there\u2019s no control left in my world. Anything can happen to anyone, including me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many innocent people are dying.\u201d I shake my head, wishing I didn\u2019t believe him. But I do. \u201cHe\u2019s killing off people to thrive... God and I\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s planning to do... all those lives.\u201d Anger burst through me and Cameron seems to get kicks off it, leaning closer to me as if he\u2019s going to kiss me. \u201cCould you give me some space, please?\u201d I ask, pressing my head back against the pillow.</p><p>He remains still for a moment then reclines back, looking too composed as he fleetingly glances around my room, his gaze landing on a poem that I wrote on my wall. He reads it aloud, \u201cBeneath the weakened structure lies something more. Something softer, yet stronger. It may appear brittle and unstable, like desert dust. But it\u2019s as sturdy as steal. It carries itself. Flourishes like flowers. Breathes and thrives. It\u2019s life to the very core.\u201d He pauses when he finishes then looks back at me. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re very talented.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t respond. Despite the fact that I despise him, Cameron is a very talented poet himself and he\u2019s kind of complimenting me. We stare at each other for a moment then finally he sits up straight and so do I.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, my head hurts.\u201d I wince from the pain as the memories of everything I did at the bowling alley come back to me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry about the headache,\u201d he says, but doesn\u2019t seem very remorseful. \u201cI accidentally lost control of your body for a moment. I think Alton may have some controlling power of his own, although I don\u2019t get how? Grim Angels are supposed to be protected from Reapers\u2019 possession since they have Reapers\u2019 blood in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he did the same thing as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me; he didn\u2019t do the same thing. I\u2019m guessing it might have something to do with him being the leader and having more power... plus he\u2019s feeding off the energy of souls by killing people...\u201d He trails off, looking confused. \u201cGod, I could feel his power... it was amazing, to say the least.\u201d He glances down at my arms that are covered with gloves. \u201cHe could have very easily taken over, if I hadn\u2019t stepped up.\u201d</p><p>It takes me a second to catch on. I quickly tug off one of my gloves and curse at the sight of the darkened lines. \u201cThat\u2019s why you wanted me to take your life.\u201d I grimace, tracing my finger over the lines. \u201cSo you could control me. God, I should have seen that coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow could you ever begin to understand enough about Reapers and death to know that?\u201d He tilts his head to the side, folding his arms over his chest, looking as though he wants to touch me. \u201cThere\u2019s still so much you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what a Torva is?\u201d I ask, putting my gloves back on, not wanting to look at the painful reminder of what I did.</p><p>He shrugs me off. \u201cThat\u2019s just another term for our leader, a term used amongst Reapers. I could tell it unsettled Alton when you\u2014well\u2014I, said it; like you might understand more than what the Anamotti want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly understand anything,\u201d I say. \u201cLike the town being built on a battlefield... I\u2019ve never heard of that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the war wasn\u2019t properly recorded, at least in human recordings\u201d he tells me, shifting his weight uncomfortably. \u201cThe battle between Reapers and Angels.\u201d</p><p>I point out the window at the town and mountains around the house. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that battle took place in little old Hollows Grove. It seems impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks. \u201cWith all the Anamotti running around, it shouldn\u2019t be that surprising. We\u2019re drawn to the place this all started, where our lives here on earth began and the place where Grim Angels were created.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is it just a coincidence that I\u2019m here... that I was born here in the town the battle took place in and where Grim Angels were first created?\u201d</p> <p>He looks at me like I\u2019m a moron. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He scoots towards me and places a hand on my knee. \u201cYou know, for such a small town, Hollows Grove has a very high Grim Angel population, or used to anyway. They\u2019re connected to this place\u2014your connected to this place, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike my father was connected to this place.\u201d I slip my knee out from under his hand.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter, since your father\u2019s dead?\" he says with a complete lack of compassion.</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cYeah, but is he dead?\u201d I watch his reaction closely. \u201cYou never did tell me what you knew about his death that day you showed up to warn me; only that you knew he was going to die soon.\u201d</p><p>He glances around to the open window where the moon is shining just outside. His expression is haunting, and if I look closely, I can see anguish in his eyes. Then he sighs, looking back at me, and the look is gone. \u201cI have to go.\u201d He starts to get up, but I snag the sleeve of his shirt, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cCameron, if you know anything about my dad, please just tell me and stop messing with my head,\u201d I say with a plea in my voice. \u201cYou said you want my trust. Well, if you tell me, then maybe I\u2019ll trust you more.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at me, and for the briefest second, he almost looks human, yet it quickly vanishes as he pulls his arm away. \u201cUntil next time, princess.\u201d</p><p>As he then starts to walk away, I spring from my bed, but I\u2019m slammed right back down by an invisible force, landing on the bed.</p><p>Wait until tomorrow and I\u2019ll tell you more.</p><p>Before I can respond, his cape materializes out of thin air. Standing in the center of my room, he wraps the black fabric around his body then he\u2019s folding up, shrinking into a ball; his arms sliding in, bending, twisting, his legs kinking. Wings sprout from his side, black feathers, a beak. There\u2019s a poof and then suddenly I\u2019m not in a room with a Reaper but with a raven.</p><p>\u201cCameron, come back!\u201d I shout out at him as he circles around my head and then flies out the open window into the night, disappearing in the moonlight. Frustrated, I flop down on the bed and shut my eyes. I\u2019m not sure what to do. Stay here? Am I even safe anymore? I\u2019m not even certain how I got out of the bowling alley alive. I worry that the Anamotti are going to come bursting through my door at any moment. And that Edmund Baker\u2014Alton\u2014who ever the hell he is will be with them, ready to take control over me again and make me feel those God awful things.</p><p>I need to make a plan. One that will make Cameron fess up to what he knows. A way to get these lines off my arm. A way to strengthen my mind. A way to figure out where my mother is. I need a plan for a lot of things, like how to save the town, which might be possible if I could get the words back on the pages of the book and find out how to free innocent souls.</p><p>I think about Elliot and how I was supposed to call him, but can I trust him? He tossed the book into my bag with the pages all erased... Maybe it was a warning. That he\u2019s been watching me. That he\u2019s the shadow who stole it that night.</p><p>Can I trust anyone?</p><p>Sighing, I take my phone from my pocket along with Elliot\u2019s number. I unfold it and set it down on the bed beside me. As I swipe my finger across the screen of my cellphone, I notice that I have a missed call and a voicemail. I press the button to listen to it, putting the phone up to my ear while I find myself hoping it\u2019s from my mother.</p><p>But it\u2019s Elliot\u2019s voice that appears on the other end. \u201cHey Ember, it\u2019s a quarter after five... I\u2019m a little worried about you since you were supposed to call at four.\u201d I can hear voices in the background. \u201cPlease give me a call when you can. There are some things I need to discuss with you in private about that book I gave you... I know you\u2019re probably wondering why the pages are all blank, why I have it, why I gave it to you... I know you must think I\u2019m the one that stole it from you.... But I just need you to know that everything I did was to protect the book from falling into the wrong hands.\u201d Someone whispers something in the background and the message ends.</p><p>I hang up, unsure of what to do, whether I can trust him. Whether I should just hold onto the book until I can figure out what\u2019s going on. My dad\u2019s words of wisdom echo in my head. Emmy, if there\u2019s one thing you need to know about life, it\u2019s to never, ever trust anyone or anything. Life is a freaking mind game and you and I are the pawns.</p><p>My mind is racing a million miles a minute as I attempt to sort through everything going on, however it\u2019s like a maze and I have no idea how to get to the end, or if there\u2019s even an end. Still, I call Professor Morgan, if only to question him about how he got the book, but it goes straight to his voicemail again.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, I climb off my bed and hide the book in an old antique trunk my grandmother gave me for my fourth birthday that has a hidden bottom. Then I lie down on my bed and stare up at the ceiling, trying to block everything out; all the noise, thoughts, worries, and fears. I manage to tune most of it out when exhaustion gets to me, but I don\u2019t feel any better.</p><p>Because the quietness is just as unsettling as the noise.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how much time drifts before I fall asleep or how I even manage to fall asleep, although somehow I do. I don\u2019t dream at all, at least from what I can remember, and I\u2019m relieved because it gives me time to calm down.</p><p>Then I start to hear voices. Not in my head, but coming from downstairs. At first I think it\u2019s probably Ian and disregard the noise, yet then this loud banging starts to happen over and over again. I open my eyes to my dark room, the moon shining through my window, and the branches of the tree just outside dancing with the soft breeze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I sit up, the banging grows louder, so I hurry and get out of bed, heading over to the door. Cracking it, I listen to the murmur of voices that are actually coming from Ian\u2019s studio in the attic. I can\u2019t tell what they\u2019re saying, so I open the door wider and step out of my room.</p><p>The air is chilly, like someone turned the air conditioning on, so I pad to the thermostat, only to find that it\u2019s turned up passed eighty. Shivering, I turn around and pad down the hallway towards the attic door. When I reach it, I hesitate to open it, listening to the chatter on the other side. There are definitely two different voices, one deep like a male\u2019s and one high like a female\u2019s.</p><p>I\u2019m worried that the female\u2019s might be Raven\u2019s, considering what happened at the bowling alley. Still, if my brother\u2019s in there, she could be trying to hurt him. So, summoning my courage, I grab the doorknob and open the door.</p><p>A slimy chill slithers up my spine the second the stale air on the other side of the door hits me. The voices instantly shush, but the banging continues. It\u2019s dark inside, only a single candle is burning from the center of the room, creating a pale orb around the slanted ceiling and wooden walls. There are paintings inside the small space, covered with sheets while paint and brushes litter the floor.</p> <p>Wrapping my arms around myself, I enter the room. The candle flickers as a breeze sweeps up behind me and my attention darts to the side of me as a loud thud echoes through the room. Horror pours through me as I realize what\u2019s causing the banging. Ian. He\u2019s facing the wall with his back turned to me, banging his forehead on the wall, over and over again.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I say, hurrying towards him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He immediately stops banging his head on the wall and gradually turns around to face me. His hair is disheveled, his clothes wrinkly and stained with either red paint or blood, and he has a cut on his lip that wasn\u2019t there the last time I saw him.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, what happened?\u201d I hurry towards him and reach for the cut on his lip, but he slaps my hand out of the way. I stumble back as his death flickers inside me and strangles me. Fire. Burning around him. Flames bright. He wants to be there. He wants to burn alive.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he snaps furiously, staggering back to the wall, terrified.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d I ask, cowering back. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been home in ages and now you\u2019re suddenly up here... banging your head on the wall.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his forehead where a lump is forming. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d he states in an emotionless tone.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I\u2019m worried that I might already know what the answer is; worried that he\u2019s going back to that place where he tried to take his own life.</p><p>His arms drop to his sides. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep living like this. Being here, in this place, when there\u2019s so much stuff going on... so much pain.\u201d He clutches at his chest like his heart is aching.</p><p>Is he talking about the Reapers? \u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I say as he backs up to the wall again like a skittish cat. I\u2019m concerned he\u2019s lost his mind.</p><p>His terror shifts to rage. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the fucking dead,\u201d he snaps, slamming his fist against the wall, causing the canvas beside him to fall over. \u201cAlways walking around and haunting me like a damn plague. I can\u2019t get rid of them.\u201d He tugs his fingers through his hair and yanks on the roots as his head falls forward. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get rid of Alyssa. She was everywhere. Always haunting me and reminding me of what I did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you saying...\u201d I\u2019m at a loss for words. He can see the dead? Is Ian a Grim Angel? How am I supposed to ask him this, though? Without even thinking, I say, \u201cCan you see the dead?\u201d Well, I guess there\u2019s no beating around the bush.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispers, his eyes bulging as he stares at me, but he\u2019s not looking at me, he\u2019s looking through me. \u201cThey won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>I inch towards him, the glow of the flame dancing across the walls. \u201cHave you... have you ever heard of a Grim Angel?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, eyes still wide, and then he charges at me. I start to jump back, but there\u2019s not enough time and Ian ends up colliding with me. We fall to the ground and I smack my head on the floor. His hands immediately wrap around my neck and he starts to strangle me as I kick and hit at him, trying to get him off me, however he has inhuman strength and my efforts are useless.</p><p>My oxygen flow starts to dwindle as I stare up at him, his eyes smoldering with blinding rage, letting me know he\u2019s possessed. It\u2019s actually sort of reassuring when I think about it. At least when he kills me, it won\u2019t really be him. It\u2019s a fucked up thought process, but I hold onto it with everything I have as my ears start to ring and I see spots. As I\u2019m about to take my last breath, he\u2019s suddenly thrown off me and someone else appears above me.</p><p>Her bubblegum pink hair looks red in the darkness around us and her eyes are filled with nothing except loathing and hatred as she stares down at me with her glossy lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cYou know the rules,\u201d she says, looking at me, but speaking to Ian as he gets to his feet.</p><p>He inches back to me and looks down at me with a blank expression on his face. \u201cSorry, I got a little carried away.\u201d</p> <p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t. We\u2019re not supposed to kill her; if she hasn\u2019t gave in yet. It\u2019s breaking the rules.\u201d She muses over something and then crouches down beside me, touching her fingers to my neck. \u201cAlthough, this is a good look for her.\u201d</p><p>I wince from her touch and then find enough energy to slap her hand off me. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d My voice sounds more like a croak as my throat aches.</p><p>She laughs snidely. \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight, Emmy. You don\u2019t give the orders around here.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand on my neck in a protective gesture. \u201cThen who does?\u201d</p><p>She angles her head to the side, strands of her hair falling over her eyes. \u201cI think you already know the answer to that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I used to think it was Garrick,\u201d I say, digging my heels into the floor and attempting to slide away from her, however she slams her hand down on my knee with a lot of force.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever mention that name again,\u201d she hisses, pushing down on my leg. The light of the flame reflects in her eyes, giving her face a haunted look. \u201cI\u2019ve moved up in the world now. No more dating the losers down at the bottom of the totem pole.\u201d</p><p>I resist an eye roll, wondering if this is really her talking or whoever\u2019s possessing her because, as sad as it is, it could be either way. \u201cSo who is it now?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curl to a malicious grin. \u201cThe one that has the power to take over an entire town.\u201d</p><p>A deafening exhale escapes my lips. \u201cThat guy at the bowling alley you were making out with? Seriously, you think that dumbass has the power to do that?\u201d I pretend to be more confident than I am.</p><p>She snorts a laugh. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good one.\u201d She straightens her legs and stands up, rearranging her skirt into place. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing but another pawn in all of this... another Anamotti that will probably lose his life in order for the leader to get what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating Alton?\u201d I\u2019m shocked as I push up on my elbows and watch her as she strolls back to the corner of the room towards the window, her high heels clicking against the floor. When she doesn\u2019t answer, I shake my head. \u201cYou know he\u2019s pure evil, right? That he\u2019s killed girls our age? People we went to school with and that he likes doing it\u2014thrives on it.\u201d</p><p>She peers out the window into the night covering the land, her silence unsettling. \u201cHe needs a lot of power.\u201d She taps her fingers on the glass. \u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t okay with the killings, considering he\u2019s needed to do so many lately, but then he explained it all to me and I understand. In order for him to exist in this world and be strong, he needs to kill and take their souls... keep them inside him until he builds up his strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep them inside him?\u201d I question, sitting up. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?</p><p>\u201cShe turns her head towards me, her eyes as cold as the ice glazing the window. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know. You talk to the dead\u2014he knows that they\u2019ve been asking you for your help to free their souls.\u201d</p><p>I think of the dead girl that walked into the classroom and how she begged me to help her. \u201cAnd can I do that?\u201d I ask, thinking about what I read in the book about freeing innocent souls. \u201cBecause if I can, I could help you Raven\u2014free you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trapped. In fact I am free.\u201d She lets out a high-pitched laugh, throwing her head back. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask me questions, Em. Everyone knows that the best evil villains never give their brilliant plans away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant?\u201d I question. \u201cOr just plain evil?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes as she struts towards me, the floorboards creaking below her feet. \u201cYou know, you have a lot of guts for someone who\u2019s part of a dying breed.\u201d She stops just short of me and flips her hair off her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve cleared out so many Grim Angels in just a few short weeks, and the less there are, the weaker the remaining become.\u201d She reaches over to the nearest canvas and tugs off the sheet. \u201cThey\u2019re giving in so easily. In only a few more days, they\u2019ll belong to the Reapers.\u201d</p><p>The painting she\u2019s uncovered is the one of her lying on the ground with an hourglass and an X; the one that I thought was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d I whisper. \u201cI thought it was gone.\u201d</p><p>She smiles as she examines the painting of herself. \u201cOh, I took it away for a while after you discovered it.\u201d She turns to me with her hands on her hips. \u201cYour mind\u2019s so easily bent. And the funny thing is that it doesn\u2019t even matter. The painting was simply a painting, showing what I really am and giving you a hint to what your brother was, only you were too stupid to figure it out.\u201d She walks up to Ian and pats him on the head. \u201cAnd we painted it together, although he felt a little guilty for painting someone else besides his dead girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>I look over at Ian, who\u2019s staring at the ceiling, looking as though he saw a ghost. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. I didn\u2019t do anything to him.\u201d She ambles around him, tracing her finger along his shoulder and neck. \u201cHe gave in way too easily; he was almost relieved to be getting rid of the guilt inside him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what she means by giving in. Giving into possession? Or insanity? \u201cIs he a Grim Angel?\u201d</p><p>Her hand wanders down the front of him to his chest as she peers over her shoulder at me with a smirk. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I look at my brother who is completely out of it\u2014so far gone\u2014before this he was just a pothead who struggled with losing his girlfriend. \u201cI think he\u2019s possessed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cNope. He was simply really good at keeping things hidden, like other people in your family.\u201d She thrums her finger against Ian\u2019s chest. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the most unfortunate family I\u2019ve ever come across. Your blood is so interwoven with Angels and Reapers. Your father. Your brother. So many more.\u201d She taps her finger on her lip. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain you\u2019re going to end up being the last Grim Angel standing.\u201d She glances over at Ian. \u201cI would have said this one a few years ago, but then his girlfriend OD\u2019d and that made him go a little off the deep end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was discovered in a lake.\u201d I\u2019m flabbergasted, waiting for Ian to chime in, but he just stands there, staring at the damn ceiling.</p><p>Her grin broadens. \u201cGuilt can be a real bitch, especially when you do something like help your friends throw a body into the lake because they don\u2019t want to be held responsible for a death.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, shaking my head in denial. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. They wouldn\u2019t throw her in a lake simply because she OD\u2019d.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she asks with amusement. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, then why don\u2019t you ask Ian what really happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, tell me she\u2019s lying. Please.\u201d As I look to Ian for an explanation, tears start to fall from his eyes as he stares at the wall behind me. I\u2019m not sure what that means; whether it\u2019s true or not. It\u2019s horrifying to think about, though; that my brother could be a part of that. I can\u2019t go there yet\u2014believe something so horrific when there\u2019s no proof\u2014especially when Raven\u2019s possessed by a man who\u2019s probably the leader of everything evil.</p><p>Raven walks around to the side of Ian and slips her fingers through his. \u201cNow look what you\u2019ve done.\u201d She reaches up and wipes away some of his tears, yet they continue to stream down his face. \u201cYou\u2019ve upset him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have,\u201d I say, starting to get to my feet, but as quick as lightning, she reaches back and shoves the large canvas forward, causing it to land on my legs. Pain spreads through my muscles as the weight of the painting pins me to the ground. I manage to kick it off and start to get to my feet once more, however then I fly back to the ground by an unseen force, hitting my head again, this time a lot harder.</p><p>I hear Raven laugh as the shadows around the attic start to move. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really beneficial to be controlled by one of the most powerful Anamotti that exists because it gives me more strength.\u201d</p> <p>I grip at my head as shadows swoop and dive at me, no longer attached to the wall. I think I might have a concussion because I can\u2019t see very clearly, but I can make out enough to notice that, while most of the shadows are diving towards me, one in particular is diving towards Raven. She seems to be bothered by it, too, waving her hands around and squealing while Ian just stands there helplessly.</p><p>\u201cGet away from me, you moron!\u201d she cries, running around as it swoops at her head like a bird. \u201cGet her, not me!\u201d</p><p>The shadow continues to swarm around her repetitively, whooshing at her hair, diving down and circling around her. I wonder if it\u2019s my stalker shadow and why it seems like it\u2019s trying to help me. \u201cGet away from me!\u201d she cries. \u201cAnd go find the book!\u201d</p><p>The book. Shit. Is that why they\u2019re here? I try to roll over to crawl out of the room, but they keep coming at me, strangling me with their chill every time they touch me. Through the madness of it, I swear I hear the faintest whisper coming from it. A voice that I recognize. \u201cEmber, stay put.\u201d When my dad\u2019s voice surrounds me, I swear to God time stops.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m losing it, but I still try to stay put like he said. Then the rest of the shadows start to swoop for me, smacking against my body; their chill seeping into my bones and drowning out my emotion. I struggle to get to my feet to help but I fall right back down the moment I get my feet underneath me. Again, I hit my head, and the whole room looks like a shadow while the world spins beneath me. I can\u2019t do anything about it, though, as shadows fly around me. With every brush against me, they feel deathly cold, surrounding me in their icy menace.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what their purpose is, yet the more they move, the more hollow I feel. I can\u2019t help thinking of the shadow realm. I wonder if this is what it is. If these are Reapers and they\u2019re here to get me. But why? And why did I hear my dad\u2019s voice coming from the shadow attacking Raven.</p> <p>I search the crowd of shadows, looking for which one it was, however they\u2019ve all blended together, orbiting my head like birds. I\u2019m confused about what the point is, and my confusion only grows when I hear Cameron\u2019s voice rise above the madness.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well. If it isn\u2019t my least favorite person,\u201d he says with a cocky grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t the Reaper that no one wants around,\u201d Raven retorts, and the swooping of the shadows stops. \u201cYou know, your obsession with her is ridiculous, especially when she\u2019s in love with the Angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in love with the Angel,\u201d Cameron says venomously. \u201cLove requires knowing everything about the other person, flaws and all, and loving them despite them.\u201d His footsteps grow louder as he moves up beside me. \u201cAnd trust me, Asher hasn\u2019t told her any of his flaws.\u201d It gets quiet, and seconds later, I feel his arm slip underneath me. He helps me up as I blink until my vision gets into focus, adjusting to the darkness of the room. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he whispers in my ear with genuine sincerity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, slipping out of his hold, confused why he\u2019s being nice.</p><p>\u201cWell, she definitely doesn\u2019t love you,\u201d Raven says snidely with her arms folded. \u201cSo I guess your rebellion is turning out to be for a lost cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy rebellion isn\u2019t only because of her,\u201d Cameron states, moving up beside me and into my line of vision. He\u2019s wearing his floor length cape, but the hood isn\u2019t pulled over his head, which leaves his facial features and blonde hair visible. \u201cAnd need I remind you that, despite your possession, you\u2019re still human and vulnerable to death? So if you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll walk out of here before things get really ugly.\u201d</p><p>Raven glares at him, but there\u2019s a flicker of fear in her eyes. \u201cFine.\u201d She snaps her fingers as she starts for the door. \u201cIan, let\u2019s go. We\u2019re done here.\u201d</p> <p>I snag the sleeve of Ian\u2019s shirt as he starts to walk towards her. \u201cNo, he\u2019s staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you think so?\u201d She glances from Ian to me then to Cameron. \u201cSince you\u2019re so keen on her, can you please explain to her that Ian can\u2019t stay here, not when he\u2019s under the possession of Alton\u2014not after he\u2019s given in to his Reaper blood?\u201d</p><p>Cameron gives her a bored look. \u201cTake the boy. Like I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron, I can\u2019t just let him go with her. She\u2019s evil,\u201d I hiss, knowing full well that there\u2019s no reasoning with him. That he\u2019s bad. Evil. A Reaper. At the same time, though, he\u2019s here and seems to be protecting me at the moment, so I have to at least try.</p><p>Cameron turns his head towards me and I startle back at the sight of his glowing eyes. \u201cPrincess, you need to let him go, otherwise you\u2019re going to have a whole swarm of Anamotti here to torture you until you do.\u201d</p><p>I refuse to let go of his shirt, but as Ian steps forward, the fabric slips from my fingertips. When he then goes to leave with Raven, I start to chase after him, but Cameron\u2019s arms enfold around me and he pulls me back. I have no other choice but to let him walk out of the attic and with her.</p><p>We stand in silence as they leave, listening to the sounds of their footsteps growing fainter until the sound disappears all together, and moments later the front door slams shut. Then all I can hear is my breathing and the sound of the wind outside.</p><p>\u201cShe said he\u2019s a Grim Angel,\u201d I whisper, staring at the doorway, tears blurring my vision.</p><p>\u201cWas a Grim Angel,\u201d Cameron says with very little sympathy. \u201cBut he gave in, and now they own him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d I utter, shaking my head in denial while hot tears spill down my cheeks. \u201cShe\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d he replies and then his hand touches the small of my back. I flinch at first, but then I realize that he\u2019s trying to comfort me, and for a moment, I take up the offer, letting him touch me because right now there\u2019s no one else.</p><p>Eventually I stop crying and pull myself together then step to the side and out of his touch. \u201cSo he\u2019s a Reaper now?\u201d I ask, glancing at Cameron, only to find that he\u2019s staring at me with perplexity and curiosity.</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d he answers, continuing to ogle me with fascination. \u201cBut it could all change, depending on the choice the last Grim Angel makes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, he could be freed if the last Grim Angel chooses the side of good?\u201d I ask, hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, but he could become an Angel if they choose the good.\u201d He moves towards me, cocking his head to the side, refusing to stop looking at me like I\u2019m a curious little creature. \u201cYour tears are so fascinating.\u201d He extends his arm towards me and brushes his fingers across my cheek. \u201cSo much emotion behind them.\u201d</p><p>I start to recoil at the feel of his cold fingers. \u201cCameron, please don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>He disregards my request, his fingers moving with me as I back up. He wipes a few tears away before he starts to lean in. At first I think he\u2019s going to kiss me and my body goes as rigid as the floorboards, but then he grazes his lips across my cheek where a tear is rolling down my skin. My initial reaction is to run from him, but the magnetic feeling I felt when we went to the lake and he dove in to get my necklace, resurfaces. I feel a pull towards him, and even though I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s manipulating me, I stand frozen in place as he kisses tear after tear, erasing each one. Once my face is dry, he moves away with a blas\u00e9 demeanor.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to consider staying somewhere else, especially since they seem to want that book you\u2019re harboring in your trunk,\u201d he says and then strolls towards the door, like nothing happened between us.</p><p>I follow him out into the hallway. \u201cThose shadows that were here... what are they?\u201d</p><p>He pauses, slowly turning around to face me. \u201cYou saw those?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cUm, yeah. They were everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He stares blankly at me and then suddenly he\u2019s smirking. \u201cWell, I guess your Reaper blood might be stronger than I thought, if you can see the shadow realm.\u201d Then he turns and walks away, calling over his shoulder, \u201cUntil next time, princess.\u201d</p><p>I want to chase him down and confront him, demand that he take back what he said. However, the painful truth starts to bleed inside me as I recount the last few days. How I\u2019ve killed. How I found out my brother gave into his Reaper\u2019s blood. How I drank Cameron\u2019s life.</p><p>Maybe Cameron is right.</p><p>Perhaps I\u2019m veering towards evil. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>My head and body ache from the beating I just took. Plus, my back has started to burn again along with my eyes. I have no idea why, but after I take some pain killers, I go up to my room and make a face as I realize that while I was being attacked, something or someone came into my room and trashed it, probably looking for the book. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t find it and it\u2019s still tucked away in the bottom of the trunk.</p><p>It\u2019s past two o\u2019clock in the morning, yet I don\u2019t feel tired at all. In fact, I\u2019m wired with thoughts of Reapers and Angels and my family racing through my mind. My brother\u2019s on their side, my mom is missing, and all I have left is a very annoying Reaper who insists the only reason he\u2019s tormenting me is because he wants me.</p><p>Plus, there\u2019s my dad. I know I heard his voice amongst the shadows, but I can\u2019t be certain it was actually my dad, especially if the shadows were Reapers. It might have been their way to get at me... but then why was the shadow diving at Raven\u2019s head?</p> <p>My head starts to throb the more I think about it. I need some rest. I close my eyes, and after a little while, I manage to drift off into dreamland. The next thing I know, someone\u2019s stroking my cheek, and I\u2019m yanked out of my sleep and back to reality.</p><p>I stiffen from the touch, not just because it frightens me, but because, for the briefest moment, it becomes welcoming. \u201cCameron, go away,\u201d I mumble. \u201cUnless you\u2019re going to tell me something that can give me any insight to what the hell\u2019s actually going on.\u201d</p><p>The fingers stroking my cheek pause and the person\u2019s muscles ravel before they remove their hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not Cameron.\u201d</p><p>Asher\u2019s voice engulfs my body and kisses every inch of my skin, awakening me from a deep, depressing slumber I\u2019ve been sinking into over the last few weeks. I instantly feel more awake, alive, lighter. Freer. Not so dark and twisted inside. Reapers don\u2019t consume my mind. The dark thoughts are gone.</p><p>For a brief moment, everything feels right.</p> <p>My eyelids lift open and I gradually sit up, my head retaliating with blinding pain. I blink through it and then my lips part in disbelief at the sight of him before me, sitting on the edge of my bed beside me while appearing exhausted; his shoulders slackened and his plaid shirt and jeans wrinkled. His head is tipped down, his eyes locked on the floor, and there are wisps of his inky black hair hanging in his eyes. He looks heartbreakingly sad and in pain. I recollect his angel painting I saw in the art classroom the first time we kissed. He looks just like it at the moment, and it breaks my heart.</p><p>I start to say something to him, but his presence has rendered me speechless, my voice won\u2019t leave my lips. So instead, I\u2019m left breathing deafeningly until, finally, he tilts his head and looks at me. When our eyes lock, anguish, agony, longing and want overpower me. He starts to reach for me, his fingers seeking my cheek, and I reach for him, but then he decides against touching me and pulls away, staring down at his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mutters with his brows knit.</p><p>I fold my arms over my chest, curling into myself, wondering what\u2019s wrong with him. Why he pulled away. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>He peers up at me, his slate eyes black against the inadequate lighting of the lamp. \u201cFor leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsher, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I insist, taking in the sight of his beautiful eyes, his eyebrow piercing, his dark red lips that taste divine, his long fingers that can do wonderful things to me. I take in all of him because I can. Because he\u2019s here. With me. God, I\u2019ve missed him. I want him to be real, but I have to question whether he\u2019s real or not because, at the moment, everything seems like it could be the Anamotti tricking me. Or Cameron.</p> <p>\u201cIs it really you?\u201d I ask, watching his reaction closely. \u201cOr is Cameron messing with my mind? Because it\u2019s not funny if that\u2019s what this is.\u201d</p><p>Anger smolders in his eyes. \u201cCameron. I thought he was gone?\u201d</p><p>I slowly shake my head, astonished by his anger. \u201cHe was, but he came back the other night... although I think he\u2019s been haunting my thoughts for longer than that.\u201d</p><p>His fists clench on his lap and his arms tremble with his rage as his arm muscles ripple. \u201cI should have known. He has a knack for never giving up. For always being around and trying to get what he wants, no matter what it takes.\u201d He huffs exasperatedly then his expression vaguely softens as he reaches for me again. He cups my cheek, his warmth spilling through me and heating the chill I didn\u2019t know had been residing inside me until now. \u201cI promise it\u2019s me and not him.\u201d He releases an unsteady exhale as his thumb caresses my skin. \u201cGod, I forgot how beautiful you are. I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s him. It has to be. There\u2019s no way Cameron or even one of the Anamotti could fake the passion in his voice or the honesty in his eyes. I leap from the bed and onto his lap, unable to control the amount of emotion bursting inside me as I throw my arms around his neck. I feel the silence of his touch as I bury my face against his solid chest and his arms wrap around me tightly, embracing me, pulling me closer to him. His chest crashes against my cheek with every breath he takes and his pulse is hammering in his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why is your heart racing?\u201d I start to pull away to look at him, but he only constricts his hold.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d He kisses my forehead and nuzzles his face into my hair, taking ragged breaths. \u201cNot now anyway.\u201d</p><p>I let him devour my cheeks and forehead with kisses, afraid to move and break the silent connection between us. Plus, he seems to be struggling with his emotions, as though he\u2019s overwhelmed by them, unable to keep what he\u2019s feeling trapped inside. I\u2019m falling to that place, too; wanting to cry over the sheer fact that he\u2019s here and I\u2019m no longer entirely surrounded by evil. I restrain the tears, however, because I know they\u2019ll make me think about how I cried just hours ago when Cameron wiped and kissed them away from me. Still, the thought seeps in and I feel a pang in my gut.</p> <p>Guilt</p><p>A plague</p><p>It eats away</p><p>At my rotting insides</p><p>The more I fight</p><p>The more it feasts</p><p>I choke back my emotions, glad Asher doesn\u2019t notice, glad he\u2019s here holding onto me and no one else. Eventually his arms loosen around me, and he leans back to look me in the eyes, resting his hands on my waist. \u201cSorry, I got a little emotional there for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve missed your touch,\u201d I tell him, my voice shaky. \u201cEven though I love that you\u2019re here and happy to see me, I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re here. I thought you had to go away... that you broke too many rules and were being punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being punished.\u201d He places a hand on my cheek again and I melt into his touch, letting his warmth consume me; the contact fills all the voids that formed over the last few weeks. \u201cBut protecting you is more important than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect me from what? Cameron?\u201d I ask with a frown. \u201cOr the Anamotti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said Cameron\u2019s name a lot in the last few minutes.\u201d The anger in his eyes resurfaces. \u201cHas he been around a lot?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and tell him the whole story, hating to admit what happened; that I was weak enough to mess up and allow Cameron to have access into my head. With each detail I give him, I feel more disappointed in myself, yet I feel a weight lifting from my shoulders. Asher is here to talk to, and even though I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m upsetting him, I love that he\u2019s here. That I\u2019m not alone in this madness. That I have someone here who I can confide in, touch, and kiss. Someone who doesn\u2019t drive me crazy and who doesn\u2019t constantly remind me of death.</p><p>When I finish explaining to him what\u2019s happened over the last few weeks, Asher stares at me for a lengthy amount of time, his face contorted with pain and confusion. I think he\u2019s going to yell at me or chew me out. Get angry about everything I\u2019ve done since he left; how much I\u2019ve screwed up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cFor everything I\u2019ve done while you\u2019re gone. For messing up so badly.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, the pain subsiding. \u201cEmber, I\u2019m not mad at you.\u201d He rakes his fingers through his hair and turns forward in the bed, his jaw set tight. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019m angry with Cameron.\u201d He contemplates something before he looks at me again. \u201cAfter you took some of his life...\u201d It\u2019s difficult for him to speak, so he reaches for me, gripping my sides securely. Then his hands stray to my hips and his fingers jab down into my skin, firm but not rough, and my skin blissfully scorches from his touch. \u201cDid something happen to you?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhen you took some of Cameron\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>The lines on my skin start to itch so I pull off one of my gloves, showing him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it, but I thought I had to in order to save the guy I stabbed. Although, honestly, I\u2019m surprised Cameron has any life in him. I thought maybe he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d Asher removes one of his hands from my hips and winces as he traces the vine-like lines on my arm. \u201cWhich is why these lines appeared. Instead of feeding yourself life, you were taking life in the form of death. If you would have gone for too long... done it too much...\u201d His Adam\u2019s apple bobs up and down as he swallows hard. \u201cYou would have drained all the angel blood out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I choke, panicking, thinking about my brother and the numbness, the emptiness he\u2019s carrying. \u201cThen I\u2019d just be a Reaper?\u201d</p><p>He withdraws his hand from the lines and then his arm wraps around my side, pulling me closer to him on the bed. \u201cLife is the Angel side of you and Reaper is death within you. You were filling your body with death, and therefore, eliminating the Angel blood inside you. That\u2019s why he was able to talk to you through your thoughts and completely take over your body when he hasn\u2019t been able to before. Yes, he\u2019s been able to render you helpless, but that was through the faint connection you have to the Reapers.\u201d Our gazes fasten. \u201cBut by filling your body with more death\u2014his death\u2014it gave him total control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d The last thing I want is to turn into death; into a Reaper. Or do you? My inner voice belongs to me this time and it sends a chill down my back as I briefly welcome the idea of walking around in a cloak, taking souls, devouring innocent lives. It\u2019s a thought that has been plaguing me for days and only seems to be amplifying with time. I could try to keep blaming it on Cameron, but deep down, I know part of it belongs to me and I can\u2019t help wondering if I\u2019m getting close to giving in to the dark side.</p><p>I blink the disturbing thought from my head and focus on Asher; his beautiful face and eyes that I could write about for hours. \u201cSo if I feed off a Reaper\u2019s life for too long, then I\u2019ll become one? Forever. I won\u2019t be a Grim Angel anymore?\u201d Jesus, I\u2019ve already done it twice. How much of an effect has it had on me already? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nods, releasing me, and then brings his leg up on the bed between us, his foot wiggling restlessly. \u201cYes, if you drink too much and do it too many times then it\u2019d eventually drained of all your Angel\u2019s blood, then Cameron would get exactly what he wants. He\u2019d have the Reaper version of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m so stupid... for a brief second, I thought he was trying to help me,\u201d I mutter, disgusted with myself for touching him like that, for talking to him, for letting him kiss my tears away, for thinking he was trying to help me. \u201cHe pretended like he knew stuff about my dad. God, what was I thinking giving into him like that, letting him convince me to take his life\u2014death\u2014like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid,\u201d he insists, taking my hand in his and tangling our fingers. \u201cDespite your Angel and Reaper blood, you\u2019re still a human who feels things and Cameron knew that threatening you with the life of that guy would break you down emotionally.\u201d He brings my hand to his mouth and grazes his lips across them. \u201cNone of this is your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the second time?\u201d I disagree with him, ashamed of what I\u2019ve done. \u201cHe didn\u2019t threaten me with anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself for the fact that he took over your body and stuff happened,\u201d Asher says with an underlying hint of pain in his voice. He\u2019s trying to shrug this off, although I can tell it\u2019s sort of bothering him.</p><p>\u201cStill, I never should have trusted him to begin with,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd let him get my hopes up that he\u2019d help me find out about my dad.\u201d I shake my head at myself, wondering if that was a lie, too. If Cameron really doesn\u2019t know a damn thing about my dad; if he ever did, even back when he told me my dad was going to die. \u201cI let him in and I shouldn\u2019t have, especially when so much has been going on in the town. I should have been more careful. Protected myself more instead of throwing myself into his will and letting him walk me into an Anamotti pit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, and besides...\u201d Asher deeply considers something, distractedly running his pierced tongue along his teeth, which is one of the sexiest things I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cDo you remember that story I told you? The one about the tattoo on my side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d Unable to help myself, I slip my free hand up the front of his shirt and trace my fingers along the cursive font, feeling him shudder beneath my touch. \u201cIt is about the last Grim Angel standing and how she will have to make a choice between good and evil.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at my hand beneath his shirt with confliction as he recites the story tattooed beneath where my hand rests. \u201cBlackness caped the land and possessed the bodies of the mortals. Fire erupted over the fields and famine possessed the oceans. The wrath of Death was winning and the Angels of Death suffered. It was the end, but a single sacrifice reversed it all. One beautiful Grim Angel with death in her blood and on her shoulders connected them all, and with a single choice, she would save the world. But the fight would not be easy. Death would play with her mind and her life. Angels would do everything they could to protect her. She would struggle with right and wrong and mess up along the way, but in the end, she would have to make the right choice; otherwise, Death would win then humans and Angels would endure an eternity of suffering.\u201d When he glances up at me, the amount of emotion his eyes carry causes me to gasp. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll mess up, but I know that, in the end, you\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought the story was about the last Grim Angel standing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then, you\u2019re saying I\u2019m the last Grim Angel standing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying I believe you\u2019re going to be the last Grim Angel standing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I croak, my voice faint and weak as I remove my hand from beneath his shirt and rest it on my lap.</p><p>He swallows hard. \u201cFor a lot of reasons, one being that you were born in Hollows Grove, along with your entire family, at least as far back as I can trace. You\u2019re roots started here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut a lot of Grim Angels were... because this is where it all started, right?\u201d I point out. \u201cMy dad was one of them and my brother, so how do you know for sure that I\u2019ll be the last one when there could be a ton more here.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates, considering what I said. \u201cDo you remember what Alton told you about the battle? How it started here? And how the beginning of Grim Angels started here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that Alton said that to me?\u201d I ask, perplexed. \u201cI don\u2019t remember mentioning that to you.\u201d</p><p>He deliberately shakes his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My confusion magnifies. \u201cThen how do you know he told me about the battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d He seems nervous, chewing on his lip. \u201cI was there and I could also see it in his eyes when he was talking to you that he thinks you\u2019re going to be the last Grim Angel standing\u2014could see how deep your Grim Angel bloodlines go\u2014which is why they\u2019re centering so much energy on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but... Wait a minute...\u201d I trail off, starting to retreat away from him as I back up on the bed, preparing to jump up and run. \u201cYou say you were there, but the only thing I saw was the Anamotti.\u201d</p><p>His arms snap out and he grasps onto my wrists, forcing me to sit back down. \u201cPlease, listen to me before you try to bolt,\u201d he says, a silent plea in his tone. I debate what to do, but ultimately let him pull me back down to the bed. He lets out a relieved breath the moment I sink down beside him and his hold on me loosens, but his hands remain on my wrists. \u201cI was there at the bowling alley, trying to help you,\u201d he starts to explain. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been watching you since I left, despite the fact that I was banned against doing so.\u201d He looks a little guilty as his fingers leave my wrists and he turns his back to me. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d he says passionately. \u201cNot knowing where you were\u2014or what was happening to you\u2014it was driving me crazy.\u201d He shakes his head at himself. \u201cAnd then I saw you in the bowling alley with the Anamotti. And Alton. I couldn\u2019t just stand by and watch them set you up for murder, to have you go to jail, or let them push your sanity even further.\u201d He rotates back around and scoots towards me, passion pouring off him as his gaze devours me. I can\u2019t help but think about when I read that Angels of Death are passionate in battle. \u201cI had to stop them. I couldn\u2019t let them frame you with Raven\u2019s murder and all the other murders that have happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they were doing? They were going to kill Raven and frame me for it?\u201d Goddammit, Cameron. \u201cWait, did Cameron know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what Cameron knows or what his brilliant plan was by bringing you there, but he\u2019s proved once again what side he\u2019s on,\u201d he says, his low tone nearing a growl as he turns back around to face me.</p><p>I don\u2019t entirely agree with him. Going to the bowling alley helped me discover that the mayor is also the leader of the Anamotti, however now is not the time to point that out. \u201cYou act like he could be on a different side than the Reapers,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d like to believe that despite his Reaper blood, he still has a bit of emotion left in him, enough that he wouldn\u2019t sacrifice your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he have emotion in him at all when he\u2019s death?\u201d I pause, recollecting the few times Cameron and Asher have crossed paths. \u201cYou know, you two have acted like you\u2019ve known each other from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for far too long,\u201d he says dryly, staring down at the floor.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I ask. \u201cI mean, how can Reapers and Angels know each other when they work for opposing sides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily on opposing sides,\u201d he mutters and then sighs, closing his eyes. \u201cAnd after being around for centuries, it\u2019s hard not to get acquainted with your enemies.\u201d</p><p>My head starts to pound at something he\u2019s said, something that scares the shit out of me. I massage my temples with my fingertips, forcing air in and out of my lungs. \u201cWait, how old are you?\u201d</p><p>It takes him a moment to answer, and when he does speak again, his voice is barely audible. \u201cI\u2019ve been around long enough to see five centuries pass by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I murmur, lowering my hands. \u201cYou were alive when Edgar Allan Poe was.\u201d There\u2019s brief silence and then suddenly Asher snorts a laugh. I look up at him, stunned by his humor. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Wrinkles crinkle around his eyes as he tries to stop laughing, his mouth concealed by his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but only you would make that first observation.\u201d His laughter dies down a little.</p><p>I press my lips together. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d I say, but laughter tickles the back of my throat. Call it insanity, but I do find it amusing. \u201cI mean, I just found out you\u2019re really old.\u201d</p><p>He starts laughing even harder and eventually my laughter slips through and I join him. Nothing we\u2019ve been talking about is humorous, yet honestly, I don\u2019t want it to stop. Call it madness. Call it too much darkness and death in my life. Call it whatever you want, but it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve laughed, and if I had my way, I\u2019d keep doing it forever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says after our laughter settles down. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I can\u2019t help but think about the first time I met you and how I could see in your eyes that you have an obsession with Edgar Allan Poe.\u201d</p><p>I wipe the tears of laughter from my eyes with the bottom of my shirt. \u201cI\u2019m not obsessed,\u201d I insist, \u201cI just admire his poetry.\u201d</p><p>He looks over at the picture of Poe on my wall and elevates his eyebrows in speculation. \u201cOh, really? Because I completely disagree.\u201d</p><p>I stifle a smile, playfully pinching him on the arm. \u201cQuit distracting me from the fact that you\u2019re so old. Like creepy old.\u201d</p><p>He redirects his focus on me and observes me momentarily before he scoots close enough that our knees touch and his heat spirals through my body. My stomach flutters with nerves and want. \u201cI might be old in numbers, but not in the way I look,\u201d he says, leaning in, wetting his lips with his tongue.</p><p>I catch the silver glint of his tongue ring and my body reacts inappropriately; shivers and tingles dancing up and down my thighs. I squeeze my legs together as I scan over his lean arms, his sturdy chest, and his near ageless eyes. \u201cYeah, I know, but still...\u201d I alter my weight as I sigh, bending inward to get closer to him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little startling, but I guess I should have known.\u201d</p><p>He quickly shakes his head. \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t have, especially when no one can, or will, give you the full truth.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cLike you?\u201d</p><p>He offers me an apologetic look, but doesn\u2019t say anything as he gazes off into empty space. I wonder what he\u2019s thinking about. What he\u2019s lied about. I wonder how many things between us are real and how many are fake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou never did tell me how you were watching me,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cI never saw you anywhere. Well, except for feathers. I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of feathers lately.\u201d</p><p>The sadness in his expression deepens as he absentmindedly reaches around and grazes his fingers across the back of his plaid shirt. \u201cI was in the shadows,\u201d he whispers without looking at me.</p><p>Shadows. I remember reading about those in the book that was stolen, but... \u201cYou were in the shadow realm?\u201d Please say it\u2019s not true.</p><p>His attention whips to me. \u201cWhere did you learn about the shadow realm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom a book.\u201d I glance at the antique chest where the book Elliot gave me is. \u201cA book that a... I think a shadow stole from me a couple of weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shadow was in here?\u201d He swiftly scans the room, his muscles going rigid as if he senses something dangerous. \u201cIn your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it took my book about Grim Angels, the one Raven gave to me around Halloween and the only one that\u2019s ever given me any useful information,\u201d I say and then open my mouth to tell him that I have it again, but I stop myself, not ready to tell him yet until he tells me why he was in the shadow realm. Or better yet, how?</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s been watching you,\u201d he mutters then abruptly rises to his feet and starts to pace in front of the bed, mumbling incoherently under his breath.</p><p>I watch him pace back and forth as my brain slowly processes what he\u2019s just told me. \u201cYou said you were in the shadow realm.\u201d I slide to the edge of the bed and lower my feet over the edge to the floor. \u201cBut from what I understand, the shadow realm is for Reapers.\u201d</p> <p>He stops in the center of my room, his eyes fixed on the floor. \u201cIt is.\u201d His voice trembles as he battles to control his emotions.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I breathe, gripping onto the edge of the bed. \u201cCameron was telling the truth. Your father\u2019s a Reaper.\u201d Shit. I need to run. Get out of here, away from him as fast as I can.</p><p>The need to run only amplifies when he doesn\u2019t deny my accusations, looking miserable and embarrassed amongst other things. I\u2019m not sure what to do. I probably wouldn\u2019t get very far if I ran and he tried to chase me.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d I dare to ask. How hard would it be to get to the door?</p><p>\u201cFor a lot of reasons,\u201d he says, carrying my gaze but with nervousness. \u201cAnd even if I wanted to tell you, I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t even supposed to get this involved with you to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it even possible?\u201d I ask, stunned beyond comprehension. \u201cHow can your father be a Reaper, yet you\u2019re an angel... or are you a Grim Angel?\u201d My eyes widen. \u201cOh, my God, are you a Reaper?\u201d</p> <p>He promptly shakes his head and then slides to the floor on his knees, kneeling in front of me. He then places his hands on top of my thighs, there\u2019s a slight tremble in his fingers. \u201cEmber, please relax. I\u2019m just an ordinary Angel of Death, just like I told you I was. You\u2019ve even seen my wings.\u201d He\u2019s panicking, looking so raw and emotional right now that, if I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d guess he was human. If I wasn\u2019t worried he was working with the Reapers, I\u2019d have paused the moment and tried to capture it with words\u2014write them on the wall\u2014so this moment would be recorded forever.</p><p>I move my legs out from under his hands, pull my knees to my chest, and hug my arms around them. \u201cI may have seen your wings, but it doesn\u2019t mean I believe that they were real... nothing seems real anymore. Everybody\u2014you, the Reapers, the Anamotti, Cameron\u2014are all throwing stuff at me, and I can barely sort through it all.\u201d I shut my eyes and inhale, sucking back the tears stinging at them. \u201cAnd you keep telling me you can\u2019t tell me things because it\u2019s against the rules, yet you\u2019ve told me enough that it seems that, if there were really rules\u2014or if you were telling the truth\u2014you\u2019d be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Silence overlaps the sound of my breathing while my heart pounds in my chest. Asher was the only person I\u2019d ever felt comfortable around. I let him feel every inch of me. Kiss me. I gave him my virginity. It feels like my heart\u2019s breaking right now. I think I might have thought I loved him once, but maybe Cameron was right. How could I love him when I didn\u2019t know his flaws; when I barely knew him? I was simply na\u00efve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything I know,\u201d he says softly. I feel him shift closer to me. \u201cBut I want to hold you while I do.\u201d</p><p>When I open my eyes and meet his gaze, his pupils are so massive only a ring of silver remains in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can let you do that. I... You lied to me, or at least omitted the truth. I trusted you, but now I\u2019m not so sure I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I lied. I messed up.\u201d He looks remorseful as he climbs on the bed beside me, keeping enough distance that I don\u2019t feel threatened, although he\u2019s still close enough that I nearly drown in his body heat. \u201cAnd I hated not telling you things, but trust me when I say I couldn\u2019t tell you at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you can?\u201d I ask, warily. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>Sadness floods his eyes again. \u201cBecause things are different now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so different now than it was a few weeks ago in the cemetery when you told me I had to figure out stuff on my own?\u201d</p><p>He diffidently extends his arm towards me, afraid I\u2019ll bolt if he moves too fast. And I want to bolt, but I can\u2019t bring myself to. So I let him put his arm around me and lure me onto his lap. Then I rotate my body so I\u2019m facing him and then slide a leg over him to straddle his lap.</p><p>He never takes his eyes off me as I get situated and then hook my arms around the back of his neck to hold onto something because it feels like whatever he tells me next might knock me down.</p><p>\u201cI missed touching you,\u201d I divulge truthfully, wanting just one moment to enjoy this moment; one beat of my heart, one breath. Before everything breaks apart because I know it\u2019s going to.</p><p>The corners of his lips quirk to a sad smile. \u201cI missed touching you, too.\u201d</p><p>When he doesn\u2019t begin explaining things right away, I say, \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not a Reaper before I go mad.\u201d</p><p>His arms circle my waist and he presses on my lower back, pushing me closer to him until the front of our bodies are perfectly aligned. \u201cI\u2019m not a Reaper. I promise. But I was faced with a choice once that had to do with my Reaper blood,\u201d he explains. \u201cI had to decide whether I wanted to be part of the good or the evil.\u201d He slants his head forward and I think he\u2019s going to kiss me, but instead he rests his forehead against mine. Then he shuts his eyes and breathes in deeply.</p><p>\u201cMy mother was an Angel of Death and my father was a Reaper. The love between the two breeds is obviously forbidden, so they hid it, but eventually my mother found out she was pregnant with me. After I was born, she hid me for as long as she could, but eventually she was discovered; I was discovered. A lot of the Angels wanted to send me down with the Reapers to live in their realm. The Angels feared what I\u2019d turn into\u2014that I\u2019d become death and start stealing souls\u2014but Michael gave me a choice of who I wanted to be, what I wanted to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you chose the side of the good,\u201d I say, sketching my finger up and down his neck.</p><p>\u201cI did, but it wasn\u2019t without a price.\u201d His eyelids lift and he puts a sliver of space between us as he reclines and looks me in the eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve pretty much been a prisoner amongst the Angels ever since I chose to be one,\u201d he says. \u201cAn outcast. And to constantly prove that I won\u2019t surrender to the Reaper side, I\u2019ve been forced to follow every order, day after day, collect soul after soul. If I refuse, then all the Angels question my allegiance. And collecting so many souls it... it takes a toll on you.\u201d</p><p>I clutch onto him tightly with an ache forming inside my chest because I understand what it\u2019s like to be an outcast. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible, Asher. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was... is.\u201d He urges me closer by pressing his hand against the small of my back and I give into him, pressing my chest to his. \u201cI\u2019ve been alone in all this for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound so much like me,\u201d I note, perplexed. \u201cWhich is something I don\u2019t get. If your father was a Reaper and your mother was an Angel than why aren\u2019t you considered a Grim Angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t born human,\u201d he says, sounding sadden. \u201cGrim Angels may have Angel blood and Reaper blood in them, but they\u2019re also human and part of the human world, where as I am part of the Angel and Reaper world, am Immortal, can fly, take souls\u2014it\u2019s my job to.\u201d</p><p>For a brief second I seriously thought he was going to say he was a Grim Angel and that we were the same\u2014that I wasn\u2019t as alone as I thought. \u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d I ask.</p><p>I feel him tremble under my hands. \u201cMy mother was banished and stripped of her wings when they found out what I was.\u201d</p><p>I pull back, startled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His fingers dig into my back in desperation. \u201cShe\u2019s human now, or at least, close to human. Her wings, some of her power lost, like the ability to take souls and her strength. She\u2019ll remain that way until the Angel\u2019s leader Michael decides to give her back her wings, but I doubt he ever will,\u201d he says, not with anger but with pain. \u201cMichael has a hard time forgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t he an Angel?\u201d I ask. \u201cI thought they were supposed to represent good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part they do, but they\u2014we\u2014do have our rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Asher,\u201d I say again because it\u2019s all I can think of to say. Suddenly I understand his painting even more. The pain he was able to capture probably stemmed from his own internal agony. \u201cDo you ever see your mother?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his pain amplifying. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to.\u201d</p><p>I place a hand on his cheek, unshaven and rough beneath my hand, wanting to comfort him despite the uncertainty between us. \u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think somewhere in New York,\u201d he tells me, leaning into my hand. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure where exactly and my whole basis of her living in New York only comes from rumors I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014do you know who your father is?\u201d I ask. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s a Reaper, but have you ever met him? Because you told me once that he was terrible to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says remorsefully, his eyes pleading with me to understand. \u201cI only told you that because I didn\u2019t know what to say when you started asking me questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said he took you to that place with the statue,\u201d I say, hurt that he\u2019s lied to me so much. \u201cWas that story a lie, too?\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes, then his firm chest lifts and descends as he takes a deep breath. \u201cI went there with my uncle and mentor, Elliot Morgan, who you know as Professor Morgan.\u201d His eyelids lift open, his pupils massive. \u201cHe was pretty much like a father to me. He was a friend of my mother and he sort of took it upon himself to step up and be a father figure when he could, but it was hard for him going up against the other Angels who wanted nothing to do with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It hurts my heart to hear his story. So much agony; so much punishment. All because of something that was out of his hands. \u201cBut I thought he was your father\u2019s brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was\u2014is\u2014 but there\u2019s more to it that even I don\u2019t know. My bloodlines... the people connected to it... it\u2019s so complicated... and no one ever wants to talk about it.\u201d He releases a stressed breath. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, filled with repeats of what my mom did. But to make it really short, my father\u2019s mother\u2014my grandmother\u2014had sons from two different fathers. While she herself was an Angel of Death, she had an affair with a Reaper and my father came out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t he get a choice, like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Two simple words, yet there\u2019s so much sorrow connected to them.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d It sounds like such a stupid response, but there\u2019s not much else to say. \u201cWell, why is Elliot\u2014Professor Morgan\u2014no longer an Angel of Death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother long story.\u201d His eyes widen in surprise. \u201cWait, how did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I talked to him at school. He gave me this book and said we should meet up to talk, although I didn\u2019t call him when I was supposed to and he left this really panicky message on my phone about...\u201d My gaze drifts to the trunk in the corner of my room. \u201cAbout the book that was taken that night by the shadow...\u201d I struggle to say it aloud, hoping I\u2019m not making a mistake telling him, hoping I can fully trust him.</p><p>Asher tracks my gaze to the trunk. \u201cWhy would he want to talk to you about the book?\u201d</p><p>I get up from the bed and go over to the trunk. \u201cProbably because he\u2019s the one who gave it back to me.\u201d I lift it open and take the book out of the hidden compartment in the bottom.</p> <p>Shock slowly crosses Asher\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean he gave it back to you?\u201d His worried gaze locks on mine and then darts to the book in my hands. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that mean he was the one who took it in the first place?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, maintaining his gaze as I walk back to the bed and hand him the book. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>He holds the book in his hands and considers what I said with bafflement. \u201cAre you sure the shadow was the one that took the book or could maybe my uncle have snuck in and you thought it was the shadow?\u201d</p><p>I look over at the window as he fans through the blank pages in the book. \u201cWell, that was open when I came up here and discovered it, so maybe... but still it wouldn\u2019t explain why when he gave it back to me, the pages were all blank.\u201d</p><p>I redirect my attention to him, expecting him to be more shocked, but he seems like he understands everything, nodding as he mutters something under his breath and shuts the book. \u201cHe did a secretum codice on the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>He traces his fingers over the leather cover of the book. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift Angels have,\u201d he says, his fingers wandering to his arm and he sketches the tip of his finger down his blood vein on his arm. \u201cOur blood carries a lot of power and if used properly, it can help keep our secrets hidden. I\u2019m guessing that my uncle spilled his blood on the pages of that book to hide the information in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would he want to hide it from me?\u201d I ask as he gives me the book to put away. \u201cWhen I was just getting to the part about freeing innocent souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing he wasn\u2019t hiding it from you,\u201d he says as I put the book back in the bottom of the trunk. \u201cI\u2019m guessing he knew that someone was after it and he took it from you to protect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but now I can\u2019t read anything on the pages,\u201d I tell him, closing the lid of the trunk. \u201cAnd unless you know how a Reaper can steal a Grim Angels soul and free innocent possessed souls, the entire town is screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to find that out,\u201d Asher says, frowning. \u201cUnless that Grim Angel isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be,\u201d I tell him, sitting down beside him and placing my hand on his. \u201cBut I do need to know how to do it\u2014how to free everyone from this madness. From death.\u201d</p><p>He momentarily stares down at my hand on his before looking up at me. \u201cThe only way to read what\u2019s on the pages is for my uncle to unlock it with his blood again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we need to track down your uncle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need to track down my uncle.\u201d</p><p>Feeling a weight crash on my shoulders, I retrieve my phone from my back pocket and hand it to him. \u201cCall him then. I haven\u2019t been able to get a hold of him, but maybe you\u2019ll have more luck.\u201d</p><p>Asher dials his uncle\u2019s number. After trying a couple of times and having no luck, I\u2019m a little surprised that Asher gets a hold of him. He chats quickly with him, asking him to meet up with us and explain what\u2019s going on. After that he starts nodding and then gets a weird look on his face as he hangs up.</p><p>\u201cThat was weird,\u201d he mutters, staring down at the phone in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, leaning over his shoulder.</p><p>He shakes his head, giving me back the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s not in Hollows Grove.</p><p>\u201cHow can that be possible?\u201d I ask, tossing the phone on my nightstand. \u201cWhen I just saw him earlier today?\u201d</p><p>Again, Asher shakes his head. \u201cHe said he had to run up to Jackson to get something for his class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis possessed class?\u201d I\u2019m completely baffled. \u201cAnd he left me a message to call him when I didn\u2019t call him. It makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, something\u2019s definitely up, but there\u2019s not anything I can do about it until he gets back in town unfortunately, which won\u2019t be until tomorrow,\u201d he says, glancing back at his back for some reason. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out though, what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll figure all this stuff out. I promise.\u201d His gaze collides with mine and emotions storm through me. \u201cWhat I want right now though is a little bit of time with you while we wait.\u201d His gaze drops to my lips and desire radiates in his eyes. \u201cAll that matters right now is that I\u2019m here with you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wrong. There\u2019s so much more that matters than just being with me. \u201cI\u2019m worried, Asher. About you. Me. My family. This whole entire town. I mean, so many people are possessed and there\u2019s so many Anamotti around... and they\u2019re leader is killing people... and that book could stop it all, if the pages hadn\u2019t been erased by your uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop worrying about stuff so much.\u201d He tucks his finger underneath my chin and tips my head back to look me in the eyes. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, but it\u2019ll only make it easier for the Anamotti to get to you. Let me worry for you. Let me take care of this for you.\u201d</p><p>He makes it sound so easy, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s hard, walking around, being the target of insanity, being so connected to death, knowing what lies ahead for everyone, knowing that a murderer is walking around and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it, at least not without that book. \u201cMaybe going crazy is the better solution than constantly fighting it.\u201d I could blame what I say on Cameron taking control of my mind again, but I know that\u2019s not the case. I know that part of me means it. That maybe, if I just gave in, my family could be free from the burden I\u2019ve put on them. Hell, maybe this whole town could be free from the possession. \u201cMaybe I should just give in like my brother, and then, perhaps someone else could become the last Grim Angel\u2014could free the entire town. I think I could live with banging my head against the wall.\u201d</p><p>Asher appears hurt. \u201cEmber, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I think I do. I mean, look at my father,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s gone; either dead, or lost, or locked up somewhere because of this. I honestly have no idea what happened to him, but I\u2019m sure it was something terrible. And I remember the final days I had with him.\u201d I slip out from under his touch and get to my feet. I start pacing the floor, needing to move because sitting still seems so maddening. \u201cHow insane he acted. Talking to birds. Flipping out over the smallest things.\u201d I shake my head at the dark memories. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s my brother, who might have had something to do with his girlfriend\u2019s death a few years ago, who never showed any signs of being a Grim Angel, yet he gave in so easily to the Reaper side.\u201d I want to cry, but my eyes have run dry. \u201cI don\u2019t want to become like them, yet I feel like I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is going to happen to you,\u201d Asher promises, standing up and moving in front of me, obstructing my path. \u201cI promise, I won\u2019t let you go crazy or vanish.\u201d</p><p>I stop in front of him, but don\u2019t respond. I can\u2019t let myself believe that\u2019s how things will be. My father always told me to trust no one, and at the moment, I have to look at things like that. Always. Everything could be a trick of the eye. There are still so many unanswered questions, and until I figure out what\u2019s going on, trusting someone else to protect me is not an option.</p><p>I\u2019m about to ask Asher another question that\u2019s tickling the tip of my tongue, however the look on his face silences me. His eyes are imbued with lust and desire, which seems out of place, considering the circumstances. Then again, we haven\u2019t really touched each other in weeks. I\u2019m very aware of how much I crave his touch, the kiss of his lips, his tongue. God, the desolation I\u2019ve been living in has been torture. And I don\u2019t want to be tortured, if only for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me, Ember.\u201d He steps for me and I step for him, like two magnets unable to fight against the invisible pull between them. \u201cNothing is going to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>I nod, my eyes bound to his as I take another step towards him, magnetized, or maybe under some sort of possession. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m not going to fight it. He follows my move and gradually we reduce the space between us, slowly at first, and then somewhere in the midst of our silence, we decide to move rapidly. A second later our lips collide.</p><p>He groans and I gasp, my lips willingly parting as his tongue slips deeply into my mouth and his fingers ravel in my hair. He tastes like warmth and comfort, and feels like heat and bliss. I melt at the touch of his hands as they grip at my hips, his fingers wandering underneath the fabric; the heat of his skin intensely consuming my body. I curve inward as I clutch onto his shoulders, pressing my chest against his. He steals the air from my lungs as his hand winds around my back and slips under my shirt, his hand demanding against my back, pushing me closer to him so that we\u2019re flesh to flesh, breath to breath, lips to lips.</p><p>God how I\u2019ve missed the contact.</p><p>I remember all those years I lived without it before. It was only because I\u2019d never had it before that I was able to live my life normally. After being with Asher, after he\u2019d felt every inch of me, things changed. I changed.</p><p>I need his touch now.</p><p>\u201cGod... This feels so...\u201d he moans against my mouth as he starts to back us towards the bed. Seconds later, we crash down onto the mattress where I land on top of him. His hands cup my ass and he urges me even closer, making a husky groan as his hardness presses up against me. Then he briefly pulls away, his eyes glazed over as he stares up at me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do this...\u201d He trails off, passion and hunger flooding his eyes, more raw than I\u2019ve ever seen him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I\u2019m panting, grasping onto him so hard that my nails pierce through the fabric and into his flesh as I fight the desperation and overpowering need pulsating through my body.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d He assesses me with contemplation before he leans up and kisses me again. The kiss is quick, testing, and then he pulls away, nibbling on my lip before he lowers his head back to the mattress and stares up at me again, looking torn and lost; baffled.</p><p>Something clicks inside my head. Asher has always asked for permission to kiss me, but this time he didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure what that means, or if it means anything, but something feels off.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, pushing up on my elbows to look down at him.</p> <p>He nods, a little bit dazed. \u201cI just want you, so fucking bad.\u201d The want flares in his eyes and he lets out a husky growl as he abruptly crashes his lips into mine so hard that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll both have bruises. His fingers delve into my waist as he grabs ahold of me and then flips us over so I\u2019m on my back and he\u2019s on top of me. As his tongue then slips into my mouth, our legs entangle at the same time that his fingers search every inch of my body. His movements are uncalculated and out of control; trembling with eagerness, fear, and desire.</p><p>I grab onto the front of his shirt and slip my fingers underneath the fabric, feeling the smoothness of his skin and the ragged intake of his breath. I want to feel more of him so I glide my palms all the way up his chest, balling up the fabric, wanting to rip it off, but not wanting to break the contact of our lips.</p><p>He moans against my mouth as I bite on his bottom lip and suck on his tongue. His tongue ring grazes my teeth and it only makes him groan deeper. I need him closer, so close I can barely breathe. My legs part and he falls between me, pressing against me. I writhe my hips, feeling a slow burn building in my body, frantic to ignite. Flames. Heat. Fire. I\u2019m blazing with passion while I start to helplessly pant; completely and utterly breathless as his hand slips under the waistband of my jeans and touches my bare skin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he whispers against my mouth as his fingers travel lower. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to follow all these rules, stay away from you, ask for permission before I do anything, but now... everything\u2019s different.\u201d He rocks his hips against mine and I gasp. \u201cEverything\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>Before I can ask what he means, his hand drifts farther down my jeans and then slips under my panties. My breath hitches as intense heat courses through my thighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with all this freedom, but I want to do whatever I want.\u201d His fingers enter me and my head falls back as I clutch onto his shoulder blades.</p> <p>\u201cThen do whatever you want,\u201d I moan, my chest heaving as I fight to catch my breath.</p><p>He moves back slightly to scan me over with this needy look in his eyes then his tongue slowly slips out of his mouth to wet his lips, causing the metallic tongue ring to flick against his teeth. The sound makes me shudder while desire rushes through my body, only amplifying as I take in the sight of him. His inky black hair is sticking up in a sexy bed-head way and his solid chest is rising and descending ravenously, his eyes burning with lust.</p><p>I move my hand down the front of his shirt and feel the beat of his heart, which is surprisingly erratic. I leave my palm on top of it for a moment and his heart rate only quickens. Then, without hesitation, I glide my hand downward and slip my fingers underneath the top of his jeans. His muscles stiffen as my fingers brush against his pulsating hardness and it only makes me want him inside me more.</p><p>A sound of pure ecstasy escapes his lips when my fingers wrap around him. He falls into my touch, holding onto me with desperation. He seems completely different from last time. So much more vulnerable and emotional. What\u2019s different? I struggle to place it and words form inside my head like a puzzle as I try to figure it out.</p><p>A stone statue</p><p>Perfect and Flawless</p> <p>Though beneath the structure</p><p>Cracks are hidden</p><p>Weakness shows</p><p>Vulnerability stems</p><p>So easily breakable</p><p>Like fine glass</p><p>Dropped onto the floor</p><p>Shattered</p> <p>Into pieces</p><p>They broke him.</p><p>\u201cEmber,\u201d he groans again as I run my fingers up and down him, feeling how hard he is for me; how much he wants to be inside me. Seconds later, his fingers start to move inside me and we feel each other together as we roll on our sides. A near scream escapes my throat as he slips another finger inside me, but I bite my lip, drawing blood while somehow managing to keep moving my hand, and at the same time I feel myself getting more lost in his touch.</p><p>I\u2019m about to lose it. Combust into pieces. Ignite in flames. When suddenly he stops moving his fingers and brings his free hand to my hair. He tangles his fingers through it, pulling roughly on the roots, causing my head to tip back before his lips come down on my throat. He sucks and nips at my skin, trembling with ragged breathing. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that something\u2019s up with him. He\u2019s so much more out of control. So much rougher, although in a good way.</p><p>Finally, I force myself to stop rubbing him and lean back from his bites and nips on my skin. \u201cAsher?\u201d</p><p>He tenses, momentarily unmoving, catching his breath before he reclines to look at me. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I search his eyes for an indication that something\u2019s changed inside him. \u201cI don\u2019t know... Is there something wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen and then he slides away from me, appearing lost as he lifts his hand up to rub his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not sure about anything anymore.\u201d His hand falls to his lap and his voice comes out as soft as a feather. \u201cDo you remember when I said there were punishments for breaking the rules and that I was going to have to pay for getting involved with your life?\u201d he asks and I nod, sitting up beside him. He reaches out and brushes the pad of his thumb across my bottom lip, shaking his head. \u201cThey\u2014Michael\u2014well, at first he just forced me to stay away from humans, but then I went into the shadows and he was more upset.\u201d His voice is unsteady. \u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m a traitor and Michael made... he made me...\u201d He sucks in a sharp breath and the words spill out of him. \u201cHe made me human again, or at least, stripped me of my wings.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops. \u201cLike your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispers, shutting his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been banished.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure Hell has frozen over or maybe it\u2019s Heaven, since he\u2019s an Angel. I\u2019m not even sure how that works, though, if there\u2019s a Heaven or Hell. From what Asher\u2019s just shared with me about Angels of Death and his leader, I\u2019m not sure Angels are quite as good as I thought.</p><p>Heaven and Hell</p><p>Reapers</p><p>Angels</p><p>Heavenly or Evil</p><p>Are they?</p><p>Aren\u2019t they?</p><p>It takes me a second or two to find my voice again. \u201cWhat does that mean exactly?\u201d I gape at him, stunned. Shocked to the point that I feel sedated.</p><p>He swiftly shakes his head and sits up, grabbing onto me and sitting me with him. \u201cIt means that I\u2019ve been banished like my mother and can no longer be with the Angels of Death. I\u2019m still immortal, but I don\u2019t have all of my Angel abilities such as my strength or the ability to fly.\u201d He frowns as if he\u2019s just realizing this.</p><p>I inspect him meticulously, running my fingers through the soft locks of his hair, taking in his eyes; they are the same slate grey, yet they look different somehow. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have your wings?\u201d I ask, placing my hands on his shoulders.</p><p>He reluctantly shakes head. \u201cNo, I have them, but they\u2019ve stripped the power from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I\u2014Can I see them?\u201d I have no idea why I\u2019m asking, other than I\u2019m curious. I\u2019ve seen them once in the graveyard and they were so beautiful that I couldn\u2019t find words to describe them.</p><p>\u201cYou want to see my wings?\u201d he asks, shocked and a little appalled.</p><p>With caution, I nod. \u201cUnless it\u2019s too weird.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent, considering my request, and then he scoots to the edge of the bed and rises to his feet. He takes a few steps then turns in the middle of the room, glancing from side to side at the narrow space between the walls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s enough room in here,\u201d he utters quietly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>I move to the edge of the bed and plant my feet on the floor as he starts to unbutton the plaid shirt he\u2019s wearing; undoing each button unhurriedly. He\u2019s definitely nervous, and so am I. I\u2019m not even sure why, other than it makes everything feel that much more real. We can kiss and touch all we want, but as soon as he brings out his wings, all I\u2019ll be able to think about are Angels and Reapers and how I\u2019m a mix of both.</p><p>When he gets the last button undone, he sucks in a large breath, straightens his arms at his side, and the shirt falls off him and onto the floor. Lean muscles carve his stomach where his skin is as smooth as porcelain. On his one side, there is a tattoo of an angel with tears falling from her eyes, her black hair flowing to her back where feathers molt. On his opposing rib there\u2019s an inscription that tells a story.</p><p>Unable to control myself, I get to my feet and walk towards him. Quivering slightly, I reach out and touch him, running my fingers along the cursive tattoo, feeling him shudder under my hand, but he doesn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cNigredo caped terra et possederunt corpora mortale,\u201d I read the tattoo aloud, baffled on how I even know the language. \u201cIgnis acquiritur super agros et fames possederunt maria. Mors vincit iram et Angelos morte. Erat, sed omne sacrificium unum contrarium. Morte puellae umero uno utrisque coniunctum esset electio salvificem mundum. Sed non facile ad pugnam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous, Ember,\u201d he says and my eyes rise from his stomach to his face, which is equally as beautiful.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I apologize with little sincerity. \u201cI couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>He sucks in a sharp breath and then releases it, wisps of his hair fluttering away from his face. \u201cIt feels so good to hear you speak our language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can I?\u201d I whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t even understand what I just said.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a lopsided smile. \u201cIt\u2019s the Angel blood inside you.\u201d He pauses, his eyes locked on me as his muscles start to tighten like a rope winding and knotting. There\u2019s a loud snap and then his back hunches over. Moments later, a tip of a wing peeks out from each side of his shoulders; pointed angles that are concealed by the softest black feathers. They continue to stretch and grow until a pair of wings span from his back across my bedroom, similar to the painting on my wall. They nearly take up the whole length, wall to wall, and are incredibly powerful as well as strikingly beautiful.</p><p>I don\u2019t speak as he straightens his back, standing to his full height while watching me, waiting for me to say something. I chew nervously on my lip, words connecting in my head, forming a description I\u2019ve wanted to write for weeks; ever since the last time I saw him in the cemetery.</p><p>Translucent beauty</p><p>Feathers and perfection </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing before me</p><p>So bold and bright</p><p>Blinding</p><p>Like the sun</p> <p>So striking</p><p>Almost unreal</p><p>\u201cEmber.\u201d The sound of Asher\u2019s voice brings me back to reality.</p><p>I blink away my thoughts that are still forming poetry and outstretch my hand to him. I trace my fingers up the front of his stomach, which flexes and sends heat soaring through my body. My hand pauses on his chest before traveling to his shoulders then around to his back. His focus is entirely on me, his gaze relentless, yet beneath it, there\u2019s vulnerability. Asher looks human. And the look only amplifies as my fingers connect with the lower part of his wings where they rise out of his skin.</p><p>\u201cGod, they\u2019re so soft,\u201d I whisper in awe, stroking the feathers with my fingers.</p> <p>He shudders as he lets out this soft moan, then his head lowers towards my neck. He buries his face into the crook of it and breathes in my skin. \u201cGod, that feels so good...\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together, fighting back the urge to moan with him as I continue to let my fingers explore the base of his wings, the feathers getting softer the higher I go. He gasps for air as his shoulders start to tremble and then suddenly his wings are folding up into his back as his head snaps up.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he growls as he grabs me by the waist. Before I can react, we\u2019re stumbling back onto the mattress, landing with a hard bounce.</p><p>His eyes darken as he jerks my shirt off and then undoes my bra, chucking it to the side. My breasts spring free and my nipples perk as the cold air hits them. I fight to maintain my breathing, but I can barely get control of anything inside me; my heart rate, my body heat, my desire. I know I\u2019ve done this before with him, but for some reason, I still feel as nervous as the first time.</p><p>When he covers my body with his and conceals his mouth over mine, my nerves vanish and turn to eagerness. The fiery heat of his chest spreads to mine and my back curves upward as his fingers graze my nipple. I gasp, biting at his lip as my neck angles back and I draw my mouth away from his. He nips and sucks a path of kisses across my jawline, down to my neck, and when his mouth covers my nipple, I cry out, threading my fingers through his hair, pulling him in while seeking a way to release the helpless energy building in my body.</p><p>Finally, he sits up, his mouth leaving my breast. With one flick of his finger, he undoes the button of my pants and then tugs them off my legs along with my panties. Before I even have time to process being naked, he spreads my legs, and seconds later, the cold metal of his tongue ring flicks across my skin, sending an eruption of sweltering heat throughout my body.</p> <p>As he moves his tongue and drives me further and further into blissfulness until I can\u2019t breathe, I clutch onto the blanket while my body bucks against his mouth. Every part of my body pulsates as I climb higher and higher, drifting out into sheer ecstasy.</p><p>Seconds or maybe minutes later, I start to come back down. I can barely see, but I feel his mouth leave me. I hear the sound of a condom wrapper being peeled open, however I don\u2019t open my eyes, spreading my legs when he shifts to position himself between them. He lowers his body closer to mine and I grip onto his arms as his mouth reaches mine. Then, with one swift thrust, he sinks deep inside me as he pins my arms beside my head and kisses me fiercely.</p><p>I cry out, stabbing my fingers into his back as he rocks into me. Want, desire, and passion potently flood through me and I can barely breathe. He thrusts into me again and I move my hips with him, meeting him in the middle. We continue to move rhythmically until our skin is covered in sweat; until we can\u2019t breathe. Until we\u2019re drifting away from everything, coming undone together, holding on, never wanting to let go.</p><p>Minutes later, he carefully slips out of me and rolls to his side, his arm slipping around me. He hugs me against his chest as I work to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m glad I got banished.\u201d He sounds like he might mean it.</p><p>I place a soft kiss on his chest. \u201cI think I\u2019m glad, too,\u201d I mutter, still breathless.</p><p>At the moment, I mean it. Because right now, I could live in the wonderful solitude we\u2019ve just created. Just Asher and me and no one else. However I know when I wake up the next morning it just might be gone.</p><p>We lie there for a while, in the silence, only it\u2019s not as maddening as before. In fact, it\u2019s sort of comfortable having him there with me. He makes everything else a little less terrifying. Eventually Asher starts to kiss me again, unable to keep his hands off me. I welcome his kiss, opening my mouth and letting his tongue slide deeply inside while his hand drifts up my spine. When he reaches the center of my back, however, and his skin brushes the spot of flesh between my shoulder blades, I jerk back from the tender pain.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Asher asks in concern.</p><p>I bend my arm and reach over my back, wincing the moment my fingers touch the area and the pain doubles. \u201cMy back hurts,\u201d I say, bringing my arm forward. \u201cIt\u2019s probably from falling on the ground like a dumbass when Raven was here.\u201d</p><p>Asher\u2019s brows furrow. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and then roll over onto my stomach, shivering with excitement as he leans over me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal,\u201d I try to tell him, flinching when he touches the area. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt that bad.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent for a while as he continues to examine me. \u201cYou said you fell?\u201d</p><p>I nod, my eyes shutting as his hands move away from the tender area and down my back, massaging my muscles. \u201cYeah, when I was being attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a couple of bruises,\u201d he says softly. \u201cBut usually a human doesn\u2019t bruise that quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be from something else...\u201d I drift off as his fingers work to unwind the knots on my back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d he says, yet he seems unconvinced. \u201cBut still, they\u2019re in the strangest place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere...\u201d A moan escapes my lips as his hands reach the bottom of my back.</p><p>It takes him a second to answer. \u201cThey\u2019re about in the same area where Angel wings usually sprout.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snap open and I start to sit up, but he gently pushes me back down against the bed. \u201cRelax, Ember. I didn\u2019t say you were growing wings, only that the bruises are in the same area.\u201d I start to relax again as he continues to massage me. \u201cThey might simply be bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they\u2019re not, though?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat if I am growing wings?\u201d</p><p>His fingers stop moving. \u201cThen it might mean that you\u2019re the last Grim Angel standing,\u201d he whispers. I feel the tension in the air and start to panic, so he quickly adds, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened yet, though.\u201d He returns to massaging my back again. I think it\u2019s his way of trying to keep me calm. \u201cJust relax,\u201d he says, his hands moving up and around the tender spots to my shoulders. \u201cI promise we\u2019ll figure stuff out.\u201d I feel him lean in and his lips brush just above the sore spot, right between my shoulder blades. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>I nod, the tension leaving my body with every movement of his hands. There\u2019s so much tension in my body, but he seems to be drawing it out, alleviating the pain as he moves up and down my back.</p><p>\u201cYou have amazing hands,\u201d I mutter with my eyes remaining shut as my mind drifts off towards sleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so,\u201d he replies with a hint of amusement in his tone. Then his chest lowers down onto my back and his head dips over my shoulder. I open my eyes and my heart leaps inside my chest at the lust blazing in his eyes. When he leans in to kiss me, I lift my head enough that our lips meet in the middle. It\u2019s kind of an awkward kiss with me on my stomach and him hovering over my back, but it\u2019s equally as amazing as it is awkward as he explores my mouth thoroughly.</p><p>The kiss goes on for hours and I wish it would go on forever, however eventually he moves away to get another condom. Then he\u2019s back over me and lifting my hips. With one swift rock of his hips, he thrusts deep inside me.</p><p>I get lost, clawing at the blankets in desperation as I vanish into bliss. And if I could, I\u2019d stay in this place forever, just him and I.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Later that night, somewhere between midnight and sun rise, Asher and I lie together in my bed, exhausted and tired from round three. My legs ache, but in the most wonderful way. I want to go to sleep, yet at the same time, I don\u2019t because I\u2019m afraid that the moment I close my eyes all of this will be gone. Knowing that when I wake up, I could very easily be in bed alone, with nothing except death around me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d I ask as Asher situates his head on the pillow beside me, lying on his side with his hair hanging in his eyes and his legs pressed against mine.</p><p>He brushes my hair out of my eyes and then places his hand on the curve of my bare waist. \u201cWhat\u2019s what like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven? Or wherever it is Angel\u2019s live.\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cRight now, most of the Angels live on earth, at least ever since the battle. And the one\u2019s that aren\u2019t, live in a pretty peaceful place between worlds.\u201d His fingers spread along my skin and he guides me closer to him. \u201cBut honestly when I\u2019m not here I live in a place that the human mind couldn\u2019t even begin to comprehend... a lot of angels choose to.\u201d</p><p>I slip my knee between his legs. \u201cI don\u2019t get what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cThe best way I can describe it to you is that it\u2019s not really a place; it\u2019s more a state of mind where we can create a place just how we want and put whoever we want there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound that bad.\u201d I delicately put a hand on his chest right above his thudding heart.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that bad. And when this is all over\u2014when the battle ends and I\u2019m forgiven for what I\u2019ve done\u2014I\u2019ll go back to it.\u201d</p><p>I try to hide my discontent the best that I can. \u201cAnd what will happen to me? If I survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will survive,\u201d he insists, intensity burning in his eyes as his hand slides up my spine to the nape of my neck. \u201cAnd when the battle\u2019s all over, you\u2019ll go back to being Ember and living your life just the way that you\u2019re supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the rest of the Grim Angels that gave in won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately no, but they will go to the good side, because I know that\u2019s the side you\u2019re going to choose.\u201d</p><p>He has so confident in me, but I wonder if he still would be if he lived inside my head and saw my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cBut what if I become the last one?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat happens when there\u2019s only one Grim Angel standing? Do they just make a choice and then poof, the battles over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that simple at all. In fact, I don\u2019t even know everything that will happen, only a few details,\u201d he replies with a pucker at his brow. \u201cBut regardless, after you make your choice, your blood will be free of angel and reaper blood.\u201d He pivots on his hip and rolls over me, covering my body with his and propping up on his elbows. \u201cAnd so will you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut then I won\u2019t ever see you again, right? I mean, if you go back to wherever it is that Angels go, you\u2019ll be there and I\u2019ll be here. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never be alone. Even when I\u2019m not here, you\u2019ll still have your family.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard to accept the fact that he\u2019s not going to tell me what I want to hear. That he won\u2019t be here after the battle ends. I wonder if it\u2019s because he won\u2019t be able to be here; if he\u2019ll have to go back along with all the other Angels of Death and the Grim Reapers.</p><p>\u201cMy family\u2019s not that great,\u201d I say miserably.</p> <p>\u201cI know right now they aren\u2019t, but they\u2019re under possession, or at least, your brother is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I checked, my mother wasn\u2019t. And she was never that great of a mother to me.\u201d I shake my head, feeling the tears burn in my eyes. \u201cYou know, I think she knew what I was all along and hated me for it.\u201d</p><p>His forehead creases as he gazes down at me. \u201cThat can\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is,\u201d I whisper. \u201cWhen I was younger, I took the life of my grandmother...\u201d I swallow the large lump wedged in my throat, \u201cbecause she was dying and asked me to, and even though my mom didn\u2019t flat out come to me and say \u2018hey, you\u2019re a Grim Angel\u2019, I could tell she knew because she kept telling me that I killed her.\u201d</p><p>Asher stares deeply into my eyes as he strokes the corner of my eye with his fingertip. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have known, unless your grandmother told her, but how would she even know?\u201d The more he thinks about it, the more confused he looks. Then he pushes up, leaving my body cold as he sits up and pulls up one knee, resting his elbow on it. \u201cWhat about your father? When all this was going on, where was he?\u201d</p> <p>I sit up and reach for my shirt on the floor. \u201cHe\u2019d moved out and was slowly starting to get the rep of the town crazy.\u201d I pull the shirt on over my head and flip my hair out of the collar. \u201cAsher, you\u2019re not... I mean, you don\u2019t think my mom has anything to do with this, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly. I do know that the Grim Angel blood on your father\u2019s side has been going on for many generations, which is one of the reason why I think you might be the last one standing, but if your mother is connected to it too, that would make you....\u201d He trails off.</p><p>\u201cMake me what?\u201d I press, even though I fear the answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be so pure,\u201d he says softly. \u201cYou\u2019re entire blood pure Grim Angel and it\u2019d give me even more of a reason to believe you\u2019re going to be the last Grim Angel, because your blood line could be connected to what started this all.\u201d He shakes his head, staring out the window at the moon shining in the sky as he processes this revelation and I try not to freak out about what this all means, not just in terms of being the last Grim Angel, but in terms of the fact that my mother\u2019s been connected to this the entire time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really like to talk to your mother and see is she knows about all of this.\u201d He looks over his shoulder at me, his head tipped to the side, strands of his black hair hanging in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never even met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sort of a good thing,\u201d I tell him. \u201cShe\u2019s not the nicest person. Or the most responsible.\u201d And honestly, if I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think she was a Grim Reaper, simply because of how much hate she carries inside her.</p> <p>His sympathy deepens. \u201cStill, I think I should talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if we can find her, you can,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut right now, I have no idea where she is. She was in a drug treatment facility up until a few days ago when she left without telling anyone and I haven\u2019t been able to find her.\u201d</p><p>He offers me a sympathetic look. \u201cWell, if she\u2019s human, then I can track her down rather easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I wonder.</p><p>\u201cBy tracking down her soul. It\u2019s what I do... or what I used to do.\u201d He pauses. \u201cShit. I\u2019m not even sure I can do that anymore...\u201d He ponders over this and then perks up a little. \u201cBut I\u2019ll try to find her no matter what it takes.\u201d</p><p>I gather my hair back behind my head and then reach for an elastic band on the nightstand. \u201cThank you. I know I\u2019m not a fan of hers, but she\u2019s all I have left and it\u2019s been lonely without her living here, even if she was only ever here just to change her clothes, grab a bite to eat, and shower. And plus, if she is part of this whole Grim Angel thing, then she\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been living here by yourself?\u201d he asks, glancing around at my room which is still a mess from when the shadows ransacked it.</p><p>\u201cWell, Ian was here off and on until about a few weeks ago.\u201d I scoot up next to him, needing to be near him, feel that I\u2019m no longer alone. \u201cAlthough, he never really is here, at least not mentally since I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s possessed. He hasn\u2019t been home in about a week and he wouldn\u2019t return any of my voicemails, but he showed up in the attic just a while ago... with Raven... Did you know he was a Grim Angel this entire time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as I see someone, I know if they are,\u201d he says guiltily.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you never say anything about it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t.\u201d He looks at me with pity in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Ember. That you lost your brother and that you\u2019ve been so secluded... You must have been so lonely having no one to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, but I wasn\u2019t entirely alone\u201d I stretch my arms out in front of me and glance down at my exposed arms and the fading lines on them. \u201cThere was Cameron, but I think I prefer the solitude over that.\u201d Liar. Liar.</p><p>He lowers his knees and allows our bodies to touch, our sides and shoulders pressing together. \u201cWe\u2019re going to figure all this out and I\u2019m not going to leave you until we do, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, choking up more than I like. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his lips quirk. \u201cNow, I can help you with one thing right now, if you trust me enough to do something.\u201d</p><p>I rack my mind for what I\u2019m truly feeling; whether or not I trust him. \u201cOkay, I trust you.\u201d</p><p>A full smile shines through as he reaches for my hand. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I lace my fingers through his and then he entices me onto his lap as he reclines against the wall just to the side of the window so I have a view of the dark, deserted street where even the police car is gone, which is unusual at night.</p><p>Asher\u2019s places a palm on each one of my cheeks and wets his lips with his tongue as he glimpses down at my lips with a slow burning fire in his eyes. \u201cI want you to drink some of my life,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>I instinctively jerk back, repulsed and frighteningly a little turned on. \u201cAsher, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>His hold on me is firm and I can barely put any space between us. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. I promise. And it will erase the death Cameron put on your arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will happen in its place?\u201d I ask worriedly.</p><p>His lips inch towards mine, his breath dusting my cheeks. \u201cMore of your Angel blood will emerge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I... I mean, if I took enough, could I become an Angel of Death?\u201d</p><p>His face turns a little white. \u201cYou could, but I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I feel gravely disappointed, yet grateful at the same time, proving again that I have no idea what I want. Evil or good? You\u2019ll have to decide eventually.</p><p>\u201cBecause Michael would never accept you,\u201d he says. I can feel his pulse pounding through his fingertips. \u201cHe\u2019d make you come back to serve your purpose. It\u2019s how he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019d make me a Grim Angel again?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there isn\u2019t really any easy way out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d I pause, my undivided attention centering on his luscious lips. \u201cSo how will I know when to stop drinking?\u201d</p><p>The half-smile appears again. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t let you take too much, even though I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll want you to,\u201d he says as he slides his palm up my side, his hand stopping just beneath my breast. \u201cAlthough, if I could, I\u2019d love to let you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not really sure what he means by that, but I trust him enough that I don\u2019t question him on it further. \u201cOkay, but it doesn\u2019t hurt you, right?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his eyes glimmering like the stars just outside the window. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt at all.\u201d</p><p>I nod nervously and then slant in closer so that my lips are brushing against his. I can hear his heart beating steadily inside his chest at the same time that I feel the warmth of his breath and body surrounding me. I inhale, and when I let it out, I eliminate the space between our mouths and seal my lips to his, focusing on drinking the life from him.</p><p>His lips instantly scald mine and I tug my fingers through his hair, crushing my chest against his. He gasps as I breathe in, feeling what\u2019s inside him transferring to the inside of me. It feels lighter than Cameron\u2019s, like I\u2019m drinking the sun. When it spills through my veins, it feels cool and soothing.</p><p>\u201cTake more,\u201d Asher whispers and I do, stealing larger breaths full of air as our tongues explore each other, entangle, become one. I want to stay like this forever, always linked to him and whatever it is that\u2019s inside him because it\u2019s the most potently wonderful thing I\u2019ve ever come across. I never want to let it go.</p><p>Eventually, though, he starts gasping for air and finally pulls away, breaking the connection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he pants, his pupils immense, his lips swollen. \u201cI just had to get some air.\u201d</p><p>My chest raggedly rises and falls as I inspect him for any damage, but he looks just the same; inky black hair that hangs in his slate grey eyes, smooth skin, luscious lips, and lean muscles that make up his near perfect body.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take too much, did I?\u201d I ask breathlessly.</p><p>He shakes his head, looking tired yet content. \u201cYou took the perfect amount,\u201d he says, his fingers finding my wrist and delving into my flesh. \u201cAnd it got rid of these, too.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at my arm and can\u2019t help smiling at the sight of my mark free skin. Deep down, though\u2014way, way down\u2014disappointment burns at the fact that I can no longer have the connection to Cameron, which makes me wonder who I am. If I really am evil but have been hiding behind the good because it\u2019s all I know.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>I wake up to the sunlight hitting my eyes, my face pressed against Asher\u2019s chest and my hand on his stomach. Somehow in our sleep, we tangled ourselves together, so I can barely figure out where he starts and I end. After a little bit of struggling, I manage to get my legs untangled from his and then I slip out from underneath his arm. I stretch my arms above my head and smile up at them, free from Cameron\u2019s death; realizing that despite my doubting thoughts, I am really glad that they\u2019re gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After I stretch, I relax back and stare down at Asher sleeping in my bed. I hate to admit it because I don\u2019t want to be one of those girls who\u2019s only happy when I have a boyfriend, however I do feel a little less weighted than I have over the last few weeks.</p><p>Maybe today will be a good day, I think to myself, staring out the window at the grey sky.</p><p>Think again, Cameron\u2019s voice stabs at my head like bees.</p><p>Dammit. I thought you left. I cup my fingers around my wrists. They\u2019re gone, so how are you still inside my head?</p> <p>There\u2019s just a hint of it left, since Reaper blood is more powerful then Angel blood, he says smugly. Which means I have a little bit of time left inside your head.</p><p>I grunt and get out of bed, heading to my closet, expecting Cameron to make a remark about the fact that I only have a shirt on that barely covers up my ass, but he stays silent inside my mind as I pull on a black shirt that\u2019s held together with a red ribbon along with a pair of black jeans. Then I tug the elastic out of my hair and tousle my fingers through it before I quietly sneak out of the room so Asher can sleep and I can fight with Cameron aloud.</p><p>He\u2019s so vulnerable now that he\u2019s banished, Cameron muses in my head as I head down the hallway. I\u2019ll have to remember that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare do anything to him,\u201d I warn as I pad down the stairs. \u201cHe\u2019s only that way because he helped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it happened because he wasn\u2019t supposed to touch you at all, especially how he touched you last night,\u201d Cameron says, miraculously appearing at the bottom of the stairs in full human form, wearing slacks, a black shirt with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows and a shiny watch.</p> <p>I freeze in the middle of the stairway, my eyes fixed on him as I take in the noiselessness of the house. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Isn\u2019t living in my head enough for you?\u201d</p><p>He ambles towards the bottom of the stairway, taking calculated strides. \u201cI\u2019m not literally in your head, Ember. Only my voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can read my mind,\u201d I state, daring to take another step. \u201cCan you see through my eyes, too?\u201d</p><p>He leisurely scrolls up my body, his eyes as black as the night sky and they burn like the stars. \u201cAfraid I\u2019ve seen you naked?\u201d</p><p>I protectively wrap my arms around myself, shaking my head, but it\u2019s a huge lie. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering how your little trick works so that maybe I can protect myself next time you force me to walk into a building full of people who want me dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want you dead,\u201d he says nonchalantly. \u201cThey want you on their side.\u201d</p> <p>I grip onto the railing and take another step down. \u201cAnd you want me because...? You never have made that one-hundred percent clear; why are you so eager to get me to do things for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have made that clear, you just don\u2019t want to believe me.\u201d His penetrating gaze makes me restless and uneasy. \u201cBecause I want you, princess.\u201d</p><p>I let out an uneven breath before I speak. \u201cWell, what if I don\u2019t want you to have me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes what we really want, isn\u2019t what we think we want.\u201d He extends his hand to me. \u201cNow, come with me. I have something to show you.\u201d</p><p>I lean away from his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s irritated. \u201cI promise I\u2019m not here to hurt you. Only help you.\u201d</p><p>I snort a laugh. \u201cThat is such a lie.\u201d</p><p>He keeps his hand out towards me with zero patience in his eyes. \u201cHave I ever hurt or tried to harm you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the bowling alley,\u201d I say without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cYou made it out of there safe and sound,\u201d he retorts.</p><p>\u201cBecause Asher helped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I helped you,\u201d he says heatedly. \u201cAsher may have been there, but I\u2019m the one who got you out of there alive.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at him. \u201cYou\u2019re the one that put me there in the first place.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes, still keeping his damn arm out to me. \u201cBecause I was trying to help you find the leader of the Reapers, the person behind all this madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Grim Reaper,\u201d I point out, swatting his hand away, but it barely moves. \u201cYou\u2019re part of this madness, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a Grim Angel,\u201d he spats back. \u201cWhich means part of you belongs to the Reaper bloodline and that makes us not that far apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe in blood,\u201d I say, fighting to keep my voice even. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t in terms of morals. Like, for instance, I\u2019m not a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d he questions, cocking his brow. \u201cWhat about the other night in the alleyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was an accident,\u201d I say, gripping onto the railing to keep my support as I feel my knees threatening to buckle. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to me.\u201d He slants forward and snatches hold of my hand, jerking me down the last two steps. \u201cNow, would you quit being stubborn and come with me? There\u2019s something I need to show you; something important,\u201d he says. When I glance apprehensively over my shoulder, he adds, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019ll be out for a while, especially now that he\u2019s human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not human,\u201d I argue as he hauls me towards the door and I try to figure out why I\u2019m going with him of my own freewill. Is it simply because I want to see what he wants to show me, or is it something deeper, a connection I don\u2019t want to admit exists? \u201cHe\u2019s just been banished... and how did you even know about it at all?\u201d</p><p>He pulls open the door and a chilly breeze gusts in along with dry leaves that flutter along the tile floor. \u201cBecause I heard you two talking last night when I decided to momentarily enter your thoughts and check if you were all right.\u201d</p><p>I pull an appalled face. \u201cWhat else did you hear?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cLike I\u2019d want to hear that. I tuned right out before I got to hear a live porn show,\u201d he says in a tight voice as he steers me out the front door with him.</p><p>I shut the door behind us and then we head across the grass towards the curb. The sun is peeking through the clouds, but the air is chilly and there\u2019s a layer of frost on the grass along with browned leaves. The neighborhood is rather vacant except for a neighbor up the street loading boxes into the trunk and the old lady that lives across the street. It would seem like an ordinary day except for the fact that both of them are dressed in summer clothes and their eyes are glowing as they watch me.</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s spreading like a virus,\u201d I say as I stare at the old lady across the street, who is watering the sidewalk with a hose, her gaze fixed on me.</p><p>\u201cThey sure seem to be fixated on you, too,\u201d Cameron remarks as he studies the woman wearing floral shorts and pink bunny slippers like it\u2019s not thirty degrees outside. She must be numb to the cold from the Reaper being inside her. \u201cIt makes me wonder just how close we\u2019re getting to you being the last Grim Angel standing. Or maybe we\u2019re already there,\u201d he says in a taunting voice as he looks at me.</p><p>I shake my head, but after everything I\u2019ve learned, I\u2019m starting to believe that it\u2019s going to end up being me and I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that; how I feel about being the one responsible for good or evil ruling the souls.</p><p>Whether I\u2019ll make the right choice.</p><p>I shove the disturbing thought out of my head and look around at my quiet neighborhood. There\u2019s a black car with tinted windows parked in front of the house across from mine. I can\u2019t see very well inside the window, but I know there are two undercover detectives in there.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s bad enough that I have the Anamotti possessing my neighbors, but I have the police watching me, too.\u201d I shake my head as I watch the cops observe me crossing my front lawn. \u201cI thought they would have given up by now,\u201d I mutter under my breath as I slip my hand from Cameron\u2019s so I can wrap my arms around myself.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they?\u201d he asks, looking at me from over his shoulder as we head up the sidewalk. \u201cThey\u2019re part of the Anamotti.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops and my head snaps in the direction of the police car. \u201cWhat? I thought they were real cops.\u201d</p><p>Cameron moves to the other side of me, blocking their view of me or maybe it\u2019s my view from them. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything weird,\u201d he hisses under his breath. \u201cJust keep walking straight to my house like nothing is going on. They\u2019re not Anamotti, but they\u2019re possessed by the Anamotti, which means they could very easily decide to get out and torment you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why are they here? They\u2019ve been parked out in front of my house for three weeks now and haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He touches the small of my back with his hand and guides me across the street. \u201cThe more natural you make things look, the more they\u2019re going to think that they\u2019re not getting to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing about this is natural,\u201d I say as we step up onto the curb in front of his house. \u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>His long legs stretch as we cross the strip of lawn. \u201cBut as far as they know, I\u2019m a Reaper who\u2019s not working against them, so they think it\u2019s natural that I\u2019m tormenting you.\u201d</p><p>My initial reaction is to stop, but I keep my legs moving forward. We trot up the steps and underneath the canopy of the front porch that belongs to his small, two-story house. There are leafless trees partially blocking us from the view of the undercover police car. He removes his hand from my back to open the front door.</p><p>He opens the door and holds it open for me, motioning me to go inside. \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate, glancing over my shoulder at my house before I step over the threshold into his. \u201cYou say you\u2019re not working with them because they hate your family, yet they seem okay with you wandering around with me. It makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>He shuts the door behind us and locks it. \u201cAs far as most of the Reapers know, I\u2019m working with them, trying to work my way back onto their good side,\u201d he says, turning around to face me. \u201cThe only person that truly knows is the one who cursed my family. Our lovely leader, Altarius Vinceton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet he doesn\u2019t come after you? Even after you took the necklace from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure he will eventually,\u201d he says, leaning against the door. \u201cAfter he\u2019s gained enough power to take on my family and get back the necklace. But for now, he\u2019s got more important things to worry about like killing innocent people and capturing their souls\u2014killing an entire town.\u201d He folds his arms and waits for me to react and when I do, my jaw nearly hits the floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to tell me that your family is more powerful than the leader of the Reapers?\u201d I ask, flabbergasted. \u201cHow can that be possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause for a very long time Altarius Vinceton or Alton has been suffering from the loss of his powers because we stole his precious necklace from him, therefore gaining some of his power and making it so he\u2019s susceptible to his own kind draining his energy as they live on this earth, collecting souls.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy the hell would your family take the necklace to begin with? Just to protect yourselves?</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask my father that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should just ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d he says. \u201cSince I have no idea who he is.\u201d</p> <p>I press my fingertips to my temples and breathe deep. \u201cI know that\u2019s not true. I saw him at the bar and that day you were moving into the house, which by the way, I\u2019m not even sure how you ended up here in the house again when I saw a for sale sign in it a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my uncle bought it,\u201d he says and then snorts a laugh. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing that that goofy looking guy you think is my father, is Delfonte, my older half-brother.\u201d</p><p>My lips form an \u2018o.\u2019 \u201cWell, he sure looks like you.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes like I\u2019m ridiculous. \u201cNo one looks as good as me.\u201d He stares at me for a moment, his eyes are unreadable as he whisks passed me towards the stairway that leads up to his bedroom. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He disappears up the stairs. Sighing, I go into the living room that has deep red walls and a brick fireplace. The mantle is ornamented with plastic plants and photos. Above it is a mirror trimmed with a gold frame. Just like last time, the air smells like cinnamon and apples from the candles burning on the shelf in the corner. The only thing that\u2019s different is the absence of Mackenzie Baker sitting on the sofa. I can\u2019t help thinking about that night; how I sat and talked to her, not knowing she was dead. I knew so little back then. Part of me wishes I could go back to being that na\u00efve person, but at the same time, if I was still her, then I would have never met Asher and last night would have never happened.</p> <p>God, last night was amazing.</p><p>I touch my lips as I remember, standing in the doorway without moving even when I hear the sound of Cameron\u2019s footsteps coming down the stairs. He stops just behind me, the heat of his body mixing with mine as he shifts his weight close to me and I tense, though I don\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d he whispers in my hair, breathing in my scent.</p><p>I shrug, trying not to shiver from his touch, but it\u2019s difficult. \u201cAbout that night.\u201d I turn and look over my shoulder at him, leaning back when I miscalculate our distance and our lips almost touch. \u201cHow I sat here talking to Mackenzie and she was dead the entire time\u201d</p><p>He gives me a mystified look. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a weird thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is weird... I\u2019m weird....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what if you\u2019re weird,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m weird. The entire world\u2019s weird if you really look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entire world doesn\u2019t see the dead and talk to Reapers who like to fuck with their head.\u201d I turn to face him. \u201cYou could have just told me she was dead that night and saved me a hell of a lot of confusion.\u201d</p><p>He folds his arms over his chest, his gaze weighted. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you that night that Mackenzie was dead for the same reason I don\u2019t tell you stuff that would lead you away from me.\u201d He inclines forward, the heat of his body suffocating and consuming me. \u201cYou and I aren\u2019t friends, and in the end, I only want one thing from you. And that\u2019s you. And the more you know about me, the less you\u2019re going to want me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to respond to his blunt statement. \u201cBut in order for you to have me means we\u2019d have to be friends,\u201d I say quietly, leaning back to get breathing room and my back bumps the wall.</p><p>\u201cNot with what I want from you.\u201d His eyes are locked on me, penetrating deep inside me, beneath my skin, to a part of me that I don\u2019t want to admit exists. The one that wants to see what it\u2019s like to be with him. Kiss him. Drink evil. Torture. The more I think about it, the more my eyes start to burn and my lips tingle. I\u2019m not sure what it means, but it has happened a couple of times and I\u2019m starting to believe there might be more to it.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want from me?\u201d Again my voice is unbalanced.</p><p>\u201cWhat Asher has taken from you twice,\u201d he says, in a low, husky voice that stupidly makes me shiver.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t take it from me.\u201d I glare at him, doubting that could possibly be the only reason he wants me. \u201cI gave it to him.\u201d</p> <p>His fists clench, so does his jaw, but the tense look quickly dissolves. Moments later, he looks calm, relaxed and in control. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Keep fighting. You will give in eventually, though.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to leave because clearly it wasn\u2019t a good idea to come here, yet then he inches back and sticks his hand out, palm up. Inside it, is a maroon stone that gleams in the light trickling through the windows.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother\u2019s necklace.\u201d I quickly reach for it, remembering how Professor Morgan said it could protect me.</p><p>Cameron pulls his hand away and tucks it behind his back. \u201cNo, it was my family\u2019s necklace... Well, the necklace we stole from Altarius Vinceton. Your grandmother stole it from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you say that,\u201d I tell him, folding my arms, \u201cyet how am I supposed to believe you when you\u2019re always lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe me,\u201d he replies nonchalantly. \u201cJust know that it\u2019s mine and that I\u2019m lending it to you for a while.\u201d Then he moves his hand back out and unfolds his fingers from it.</p><p>I don\u2019t budge. \u201cWhy are you lending it to me when you made such a big deal about getting it back? And made such a big deal about how Professor Morgan was lying to me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said he was lying to you about the necklace,\u201d he says. \u201cI said it was awfully suspicious that he was handing over information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re here handing over the necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it will protect you from what lies ahead in the very near future, which is going to be your death if you don\u2019t take it...\u201d He shoves his hand at me. \u201cSo take the damn necklace, Ember, before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t take it. \u201cHow do you know what lies ahead for me in the near future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way you know how,\u201d he responds, annoyed. \u201cI see death omens and I\u2019ve recently stumbled upon yours, so will you just take the damn necklace.\u201d</p><p>Again, I don\u2019t take it and get some sort of sick twisted pleasure over the fact that this seems to make him angry. \u201cYeah, but you made such a big deal about your family needing it because it protects you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so?\u201d he says, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cBut then you\u2019ll be vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glint with something that makes me all warm inside. \u201cWhich shows how important you are to me. I\u2019m pretty much giving up my family\u2019s security for a moment to protect you and trust me, we need protection right now since our leader is wandering around here on earth.\u201d</p><p>I feel disgustingly touched by his twisted gesture and reluctantly, I take it from his hand, thinking about the time I was wearing it and crashed my car into the lake. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to die in the near future, huh?\u201d</p><p>He arches a brow. \u201cYou say that with zero fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019ve died more than once and I\u2019m still standing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about death, princess. It\u2019s about the Anamotti getting ahold of you and torturing you.\u201d As he reduces the space between us, his fingers wrap around my wrist. \u201cSo, do what\u2019s best for you and let me put the necklace on you.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the necklace in my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll put it on myself.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t argue, moving back and letting me go. Then I put the necklace on, hoping I\u2019m not making a mistake, hoping that this moment won\u2019t come back to bite me in the ass. Once I get the chain fastened, I start to ask Cameron exactly how I\u2019m supposed to die, but he cuts me off, walking passed me to the door, his shoulder brushing against mine.</p><p>\u201cNow go back to your house and check your email,\u201d he says, opening the door up.</p><p>I wrap my fingers around the pendant resting in the hollow of my neck. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have a message from August Millard and I know you\u2019ve been dying to hear from him.\u201d Then irritation rises in his expression. \u201cPlus, Asher\u2019s about to wake up and I don\u2019t want him coming over here to look for you. I\u2019ve had enough of him to last me a century.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. \u201cHow do you know all of this? Are you freaking telepathic or something?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a gentle shove and I stumble out the door. \u201cNo, don\u2019t be ridiculous. I know everything because I live in the shadows and can see everything... which lets me get inside your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, was it you in the attic when Raven was up there?\u201d I shake my head in fury. \u201cWere you pretending to be my dad?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be absurd.\u201d But then he pauses, musing over something, and smiles. \u201cAlthough, I wouldn\u2019t completely discount that your dad might have been there.\u201d With that, he slams the door in my face.</p><p>My jaw drops as I\u2019m left wondering if he was telling the truth; if my dad could still be alive and was in the attic. If that\u2019s true, then that would mean he was one of the shadows; a Reaper.</p><p>\u201cCameron, is that true or were you just fucking with my head.\u201d I bang on the door a few times, telling him to explain what he meant, but he never responds. Finally, I give up and jog across his front lawn, ignoring the Anamotti in the police car parked only a few feet away as I hop over the curb. I rush across the street and to the front lawn, catching my breath as I enter my house. I quietly close the door behind me and rush up the stairs to Asher and my laptop.</p><p>When I get to my room, the door is wide open and Asher isn\u2019t in my bed. I grow nervous as I step inside and glance around, noting his clothes aren\u2019t on the floor anymore.</p><p>\u201cDid he leave me?\u201d I\u2019m stunned, my heart starting to split in two. No, that can\u2019t be possible. He wouldn\u2019t do that to me.</p><p>\u201cI would never leave you.\u201d The softness of his voice encases me.</p><p>I follow the sound over to the closet and draw the curtain back, letting daylight slip into the darkness. Asher is sitting on the floor wearing the same clothes as he had on last night. The plain shirt and jeans wrinkled, his hair ruffled, and his skin is a little pale. He\u2019s facing the wall that I often write poetry on. It makes me uneasy because sometimes my poetry can come off morbid.</p><p>\u201cDid you write this?\u201d he asks without looking at me. \u201cWell, I\u2019m assuming you did, since it\u2019s your wall.\u201d</p><p>I move up behind him and kneel down, feeling him stiffen, but he quickly relaxes. \u201cYeah, I wrote all of it... which one are you looking at?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He tips his head to the side, looking at me, wisps of his hair falling in his eyes. \u201cAll of them, really, but particularly the one on the top.\u201d He turns his attention back to the wall and reads it aloud, \u201cSmall and insignificant the Ember burns at the bottom, half alive, half dead, hidden beneath flames that roar bright, always the focus of life. Smothering and dying, the Embers always strive to burn, but never fully get there. They are never the light, the burn, the flashy focal of want and attention. They are simply charred and overlooked.\u201d When he finishes, he looks back at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not overlooked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust because the poem says Ember, doesn\u2019t mean I wrote it about me,\u201d I say quietly, crisscrossing my legs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about you then?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, but then sigh despairingly. \u201cAll right, it is about me, but keep in mind that I wrote it when I was fifteen and wasn\u2019t handling my gift very well. I always felt completely alone and empty, kind of like how I\u2019ve been feeling for the last few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never want you to feel alone and empty...\u201d He trails off as his gaze glides downward to the necklace resting in the hollow of my neck. His slate eyes turn as dark as magma. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d</p> <p>I cover the pendant with my hand. \u201cUm, Cameron gave it to me just a while ago,\u201d I tell him and then quickly add, \u201cHe said it would protect me from the death that\u2019s supposed to be in my near future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will protect you...\u201d He trails off again, his eyes gliding up to mine. He looks pained. \u201cWait a minute, you were with him before; that\u2019s where you were?\u201d</p><p>I feel like an asshole as I nod. \u201cHe showed up at the house this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just gave it to you? Without taking anything in return?\u201d He\u2019s not buying it.</p><p>\u201cWell, after he took me to his house,\u201d I say ashamedly.</p> <p>His jaw muscles go taut. \u201cYou went with him to his house. Alone? How...? Why...? Do you...?\u201d He scratches at the back of his neck as more and more anger rises. \u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. Asher, it\u2019s not like that. He was just chattering in my head and then he told me he had something to give me. I don\u2019t like him. At all. I promise.\u201d Laughter instantly fills my head and even though I hate to admit it, it\u2019s not Cameron\u2019s; it\u2019s my own.</p><p>\u201cYet you trusted him enough to go with him,\u201d he says, the hurt on his face so overwhelming that I feel like crying. \u201cTrust means a lot, especially when it comes to you. You don\u2019t trust very often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that... he just\u2014\u201d I blow out a frustrated breath. \u201cSometimes when he\u2019s around it\u2019s hard to think straight. Besides, I trust you more than I trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still unconvinced, however he lets his anger go. \u201cI just want you to be careful.\u201d He takes my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re so important to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to respond to his endearing remark, therefore I remain silent. I do need to be more careful, but at the same time, I\u2019m glad that I have the necklace right now because it makes me feel safe. It always has since the day my grandmother gave it to me.</p> <p>He releases my hand from his and rubs his eyes like he\u2019s exhausted. \u201cI feel weird, like really tired all the time and overly emotional. I think it might be because I was banished and am feeling more human stuff or something.\u201d</p><p>I force a light tone. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll get easier with time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he says, his mood plummeting. \u201cThe last thing I need is to be weakened by emotions, especially when you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I assure him then get to my feet, threading my fingers through his and pulling him with me. \u201cWhich reminds me, I need to check my email.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks as we exit the closet, holding hands.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been trying to get a hold of this guy named August Millard.\u201d I let go of his hand, get my laptop from the dresser, and drop down on my unmade bed. \u201cWho wrote that book your uncle erased. I\u2019m hoping he might be able to give me some answers, not just about freeing the town from the possession but also what lies for me ahead if I become a Grim Angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy uncle didn\u2019t erase the book... he just hid everything in it,\u201d he says, sitting down next to me. \u201cBesides, when my uncle puts the words on the pages, I can translate it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but the book can\u2019t tell me everything, like what\u2019s going to happen to me if I\u2019m the last one remaining.\u201d I say. \u201cBut August seems like he might know enough about it and he can tell me unlike you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI already told you I don\u2019t know everything. Only our leaders do, since they\u2019re the ones who created the curse.\u201d He sighs. \u201cAnd the parts that I do know, you wouldn\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to know,\u201d I insist. \u201cAnd August isn\u2019t an Angel so he might be able to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really want to know stuff....\u201d He rubs a hand over his face. \u201cI might be able to tell you a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you were bound not to tell because you\u2019re an Angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014but I\u2019m not feeling very....\u201d He angles his head back and looks up at the ceiling like he\u2019s thinking deep, feeling what lies inside him. \u201cAngel right now and it makes me wonder what would happen if I told you stuff I knew.\u201d</p><p>I open my laptop and press the power button. \u201cYou could try it out,\u201d I suggest, thinking about how Asher\u2019s uncle was able to tell me stuff and he was an Angel of Death once. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019m not really sure what will happen if you try to tell me and you can\u2019t. Will you just not be able to say anything, or do you simply get in trouble?\u201d</p><p>He absentmindedly reaches behind him and touches the spot on his back where I saw his wings sprout from. \u201cNo, in the past my lips literally couldn\u2019t utter the secrets bound in the Death Angels\u2019 circle.\u201d</p><p>I yawn as the computer screen lights up. \u201cOkay, then you should try to tell me something and see where it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to tell you the parts that I know,\u201d he states with indecision, staring down at his hands.</p><p>I type in my password, feeling my stomach jolt in fear of just how bad it is. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard, glancing up at me, his eyes flooded with worry. \u201cBecause it\u2019s bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse than being tortured by a group of rebellious Reapers?\u201d I point out, trying to be calm, but my nerves are jumbled.</p><p>He sighs heavy-heartedly, his head slumping forward as he shakes it. \u201cIt\u2019s way worse than that, Ember. There\u2019s so much more to it than just the torture.\u201d</p><p>I recollect the death omen I saw, the blood staining the streets\u2014blood that belonged to the entire town. \u201cPlease just tell me. I need to know what I have to face, if it comes down to that.\u201d</p><p>When he raises his head, he has a heart-wrenching look on his face, like he\u2019s carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. His lips part. Words leave his mouth. Words he\u2019s probably not supposed to tell me, yet somehow he manages to speak them. \u201cIn order for the battle between the Reapers and Angels to come to a complete end\u2014which I\u2019m not even sure how we get there\u2014you\u2019ll have to choose a side. You\u2019ll pick between good and evil\u2014pick the world\u2019s fate, and then... you have to sacrifice the life of someone close to you with your own hands.\u201d He shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath before he speaks, his voice barely a whisper, but I still hear him as clear as day. \u201cSomeone you love.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything for a while. I can\u2019t. My voice has drifted away like ash stolen by the wind. Sacrifice the life of someone I love. That\u2019s where this is all leading if I end up being the last one standing.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that regardless of what happens\u2014whether I choose Angels or Reapers\u2014I\u2019ll have to kill by sacrifice someone I love to make it all end?\u201d I want to cry, yet my eyes refuse to produce tears.</p><p>Asher nods, watching me attentively. \u201cEither way, you\u2019ll have to face the choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never do it,\u201d I whisper, setting the laptop to the side as I struggle to breathe. \u201cI\u2019m not a killer.\u201d And I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m in love with anyone.</p><p>He grabs my arm and guides me closer to him. \u201cI know you\u2019re not... I\u2019m just telling you what I know about the battle.\u201d His arms wrap around me and he pulls me in for a tight embrace.</p><p>I shake my head in astonishment, my arms pinned between us because I can\u2019t seem to find the strength to lift them up to hug him back. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it. Even if I\u2019m the last one standing, I\u2019ll never be able to go through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, kissing the top of my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll be the last one.\u201d I utter. \u201cI\u2019d have to... no... I can\u2019t... I can\u2019t be the last Grim Angel standing... I\u2019ll make sure that doesn\u2019t happen, if I have to, even if I have to take my own life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmber.\u201d Asher forces my body against his, tucking my head beneath his chin. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. We\u2019ll find a way out of this, even if it ends up that you\u2019re the last Grim Angel standing, I won\u2019t let things end for you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be the last one,\u201d I insist, leaning away to meet his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be another way... someone else has got to bear that burden. Not me.\u201d It sounds like such a selfish thing to say and the moment it leaves my lips, I hate myself for saying it. Yet, I want it to be true.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something else. Something I don\u2019t know,\u201d he mumbles to himself.</p><p>\u201cBut how can we find out? I mean, there\u2019s hardly any information anywhere about Grim Angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d He lets go of me with one hand and rubs his jawline. \u201cWe need to meet up with my uncle, not just so he can get the pages back on the book, but he also might know more about this than I do, considering he\u2019s much older and wiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to get a hold of August Millard still, just in case. Plus, he could know more.\u201d I move out of his arms, reaching for my computer. Asher observes me with curiosity as I open up the browser and my inbox. My heart leaps when I see that I have one unopened message from an August Millard.</p><p>\u201cKnow more than me and my uncle?\u201d Asher says with skepticism as he leans over my shoulder and squints at the screen. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be negative, but at the same time, this is just a guy that wrote a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA book that talks about ways to free people from possession,\u201d I say, clicking on the message. \u201cDo you know how to do that?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head with dissatisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a human being able to break their Reaper possession, unless the Reaper themselves break it. And I sure as hell haven\u2019t heard of a Grim Angel\u2019s soul getting possessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this book explained it. Although, it was in Latin, so all I got was the intro.\u201d I take a deep breath and read the message aloud. \u201cDear Miss Edwards, I\u2019m so very please that you took the time to read my book and write me such a passionate letter. I would like to accept your request that we should meet up and discuss my research about Angels of Death and the Grim Reapers that walk amongst us. Please give me a call at your convenience.\u201d At the bottom, he wrote his name and number. I glance over my shoulder at Asher who\u2019s reading the screen. \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A pucker forms at his brow as he reads the words on the screen again. \u201cI think he sounds sketchy.\u201d</p><p>I return my attention to the screen, hating that he might be right. \u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>Asher\u2019s shoulders lift and fall as he shrugs. \u201cBecause it\u2019s too formal. \u2018Discuss my research about Angels of Death and the Grim Reapers who walk amongst us\u2019. And he offers to meet you way too easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was expecting it to be a little harder, but at the same time, I want to know what he knows.\u201d I sigh and read the very short message over again, muttering, \u201cI wonder where the hell he even lives.\u201d</p> <p>Asher points at the phone number down at the bottom of the screen. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a New York City area code,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s in New York City?\u201d Where Asher thinks his mother is? Is it a coincidence? I\u2019m not sure, but for some reason I doubt it.</p><p>Asher gives a one-shouldered shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s at least where he registered the phone to, but it doesn\u2019t mean he lives there.\u201d He pauses and then reaches for the computer on my lap. \u201cLet me message him back and find out where he lives and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d I hand him my laptop. \u201cThen we\u2019ll talk to my uncle and see what he knows\u2014maybe we won\u2019t even have to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that easy, especially when Asher\u2019s uncle took the book in the first place and erased it. He might have just been protecting it, but at the same time, if I\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s never trust anyone.</p><p>And I know it\u2019s a good thing to have August as backup, just in case all hell breaks loose.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p><p>After Asher finishes the email to August, I shut the laptop and then give him my phone so he can call his uncle and see if he\u2019s back from Jackson so we can go over there and talk. While he makes the call, I slip on my jacket, noting how sore my back has become. With each movement of my arms, my muscles ache in protest and I wonder just how bad the bruises are getting.</p><p>Asher sits on my bed, watching me lean over to tie one of my boots up with the phone pressed to his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he says with a strange look on his face, distracting me from the pain. \u201cI\u2019d love to paint you sometime.\u201d</p><p>I stand up straight, and tuck my hair behind my ear, feeling a little awkward at his intimate words. \u201cMaybe when I\u2019m not being stalked by the dead.\u201d I head over to the trunk to get the book.</p><p>That gets him to smile. \u201cJust think about it. I promise it won\u2019t be a big deal.\u201d His eyes devour me and make my skin flame hotter as I open the lid and get the book out. \u201cYou can even keep your clothes on.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to say something witty back, but he holds up a finger, silencing me as he speaks into the phone. \u201cHey, Uncle Elliot. It\u2019s Asher.\u201d He pauses, listening to his uncle on the other end, the amusement in his expression diminishing the more time goes by. I close up the trunk then lean against the wall, hugging the book against my chest as Asher says, \u201cYeah, I figured you\u2019d heard by now. Sorry I didn\u2019t tell you on the phone last night I was just a little embarrassed they... stripped my wings.\u201d He glances over his shoulders at his back. Oddly, my own shoulders lurch forward as a sharp pain shoots through my back, like I\u2019m the one who just turned around and looked at it. His eyes settle on me the longer the conversation goes on. \u201cActually, I\u2019m at Ember\u2019s right now... why?\u201d He grows quiet again as I reach around and rub my tender back muscles, my fingers nowhere as soothing as Asher\u2019s touch. \u201cYeah, but why can\u2019t we leave?\u201d</p> <p>The longer the conversation goes on, the more uneasy he gets, and the more my back hurts. Finally, I can\u2019t take it anymore and I slide my hand up the back of my shirt, feeling around for feathers, but there is just the smoothness of my flesh. And the pain, it\u2019s becoming unbearable, like my skin is melting off my body like wax.</p><p>I continue to keep my hand on my back while Asher chats on the phone, giving me random confused looks. Then the confusion erases as his gaze darts to the book in my arms with a concerned look on his face. \u201cI\u2019m not sure... I\u2019ll have to ask Ember if she has it and she just left the house for a little bit to go look for her mother.\u201d</p><p>I give him a funny look, which he returns with a warning glance, pressing for me to keep quiet. I recline against the dresser, watching him sink further into doubt. By the time he hangs up the phone, he looks like he\u2019s about ready to flip out.</p><p>He leaps to his feet and takes the book from my hands. \u201cWe have to go now,\u201d he says, tucking my phone into the back pocket of his jeans before grabbing my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask as he practically drags me into the hall as he takes swift, even strides. With every step my back muscles seem to be getting tighter. \u201cAsher, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He keeps walking, grasping onto my hand. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my uncle on the phone,\u201d he says as we reach the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThen who was it?\u201d I ask as I trot down the stairs, working to stand up straight despite the overpowering urge to slant forward and fall to my knees.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was him,\u201d he corrects. \u201cBut he\u2019s possessed by the Anamotti and I could hear someone in the background that sounded an awful lot like Alton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlton\u2019s there with him?\u201d Caught off guard, I almost trip down the stairs, but brace myself by grabbing onto the banister for support. \u201cHow can that be possible? And how can he be possessed when he is... was an Angel? Or is that why he can?\u201d</p><p>Asher glances over his shoulder at me and I can see the worry he\u2019s carrying and the distress. \u201cBeing banished makes us susceptible to possession.\u201d</p><p>My guard suddenly goes up. Not only could Asher\u2019s uncle be possessed but Asher could be as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m me,\u201d he says like he reads my mind. \u201cI promise. And if they try to get to me like that, I\u2019ll end myself.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. \u201cAsher, don\u2019t talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>He covers my mouth with his hand. \u201cI said I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to protect you and I meant it.\u201d</p><p>I want to argue with him, but I can tell by the look on his face that he\u2019s made up his mind. \u201cSo now what do we do?</p><p>He stops in the center of the stairway, staring up at the window just above the door where lightning snaps across the sky and thunder booms. \u201cWe keep the book from him, until we can figure out what\u2019s going on and out what\u2019s on these pages... \u201d he trails off. \u201cGod, I could hear it in my uncle\u2019s voice the moment he started talking. He sounded so...\u201d He stops abruptly when we arrive at the bottom of the stairway and I bump into him. He whirls around and steadies me by the shoulders with a gracefulness that reminds me that, even though he isn\u2019t an Angel of Death at the moment, he\u2019s still not human. Letting go of my hand to hold up the book, he says, \u201cHe wanted this. In fact, he sounded like Gollum from Lord of the Rings, only instead of wanting the ring, he wants the book.\u201d Asher balances it in his arms, opens it up and then flips through the blank pages.</p><p>We both stare at the pages for a moment as if the words will somehow miraculously appear on them. All the while, the clock in the background ticks while thunder booms.</p><p>\u201cDammit, we need to get my uncle\u2019s blood to see what the hell he was trying to hide.\u201d Sighing, Asher gives up and shuts the book while I start itching at my back, my skin is starting to coat with sweat, my nails scratching at the top layer of skin. \u201cWe need a place to hide out for a while until we can figure out a plan,\u201d Asher says, putting the book under his arm. \u201cSomewhere where the Anamotti will have a hard time finding us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we hit the road and go to New York?\u201d I ask, grabbing the car keys from the end table. \u201cIt would help keep the Anamotti away and we could talk to August. He might be able to tell us how to free the innocent souls that are possessed, and then we could put a stop to the madness in the town and the death waiting for everyone if Alton goes through with what I saw happen in the death omen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHitting the road isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201d His head tips down as he looks at the book again, strands of his dark hair falling into his eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m still not sure we can trust this August guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t hurt to at least look into it.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, giving in. \u201cAll right, grab some stuff and we\u2019ll hit the road if he gets back to us. Then we can head out there after I try to track down some more information on him.\u201d</p><p>I nod, glad he\u2019s giving in. Then I rush back to my room and pack my bags while Asher waits on the stairway, watching the front door like he\u2019s afraid someone\u2019s going to barge in. I make sure to pack my lap top and leave a vague note to my mom just in case she returns and cares that I\u2019m gone.</p><p>By the time I go back to Asher, he looks so worried that his skin has gotten noticeably paler. His eyes meet mine as I walk down the stairs with the bag slung over my shoulder and when I reach the bottom, he grabs my hand and we hurry to the door.</p><p>Something occurs to me as Asher opens the front door. \u201cAsher, how can you be helping me right now when you couldn\u2019t in the past? Is it because you\u2019re banished?\u201d</p><p>Wind gusts through my hair and a drizzle of rain escapes into the foyer as the door swings open. \u201cNo, even though I\u2019m partially free from my Angel blood, I still could get in a lot of trouble for helping you right now,\u201d he says, not upset, but sort of relieved.</p><p>I tuck my hair behind my ear to keep it from blowing in my face. \u201cThen why are you?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer right away. Instead he leads me outside and into the rain bucketing down from the angry sky. Asher keeps walking while holding onto me, but then he stops just short of the grass to spin around to face me. \u201cBecause I\u2019m saying fuck the rules,\u201d he says with passion emitting with every syllable. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit anymore. About any of this.\u201d He swings his arm around, gesturing at the land. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that you were created to bare our sins and I\u2019m not going to let you suffer anymore, regardless of what happens to me.\u201d He cups my cheeks in his hand and I swear to god I can hear his heart hammering in his chest. \u201cAll I want is you safe. I should have been keeping you safe this entire time.\u201d Rain drenches his hair, beads his skin, soaks his clothes and makes them cling to his body.</p><p>My stomach flutters at the sight of him and his powerful words. Emotions surface inside me that are potent, intoxicating. I\u2019ve never felt anything like them before and it makes it too complex to control\u2014difficult to keep inside\u2014 it\u2019s hard not to just let them pour out of me like the rain. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s love, but I wonder where my emotions for Asher are going. If at the end of this, I will be in love with him, and if at the conclusion of all of this, I\u2019ll have to kill him to save humanity and their souls.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s hit the road then,\u201d I call out over the thunder and my shaky voice reveals that I\u2019m feeling something powerful. \u201cAt least until we can figure out how to save the town.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Asher looks like he notices it, but doesn\u2019t comment on it. Instead, he nods and grabs my hand again, his skin cold from the rain. Then we head for the car in the driveway, side-by-side beneath the rain. It\u2019d seem like the perfect moment except for the thunder booming above us and there are people standing all over the grass.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Asher and I say, noticing them at the exact same time. We stop dead in our tracks at the brink of the driveway as more people emerge. They aren\u2019t regular people. They\u2019re possessed; their expressions numb, eyes glowing through the veil of rain, and their hands are held lifelessly at their sides. I recognize a few of them as my neighbors. The two policemen that are always stalking me stand with them, too. However some of them I\u2019ve never seen before; they\u2019ve been drawn in from town, I\u2019m guessing, but why?</p><p>Deep down, I think I might know the answer, but I don\u2019t want to accept it just yet. Accept what the burn on my back means or why the Anamotti have suddenly stepped up their game.</p><p>As I stare at the thickening crowd, at the people wandering in from each side of the street, I spot another person that I recognize. She\u2019s tall and thin, and has dark hair that runs down her shoulders in waves. She\u2019s wearing a long, floral dress and her lips that were once red are blue. I went to school with her up until a week ago when her body was found near the riverbank only a half a mile from my father\u2019s crime scene.</p> <p>Her lips curl into a smile as I look at her and for a second I think she\u2019s going to beg me to help her like the other dead girl did, but all she says is, \u201cHey, Ember. It\u2019s nice to see you again,\u201d she says with a little wave. Vomit burns at the back of my throat at the sight of her fingerless hand. \u201cAlton says, \u2018Hi\u2019 and that \u2018he\u2019ll see you soon.\u2019\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops as Asher\u2019s hand tightens around mine. \u201cWe have to get out of here...\u201d His focus is secured on the people gathering in large numbers. \u201cQuickly.\u201d He blinks his eyes away from them and then we\u2019re running to the car, puddles splashing below our feet while thunder and lightning crack above us and rain hammers down. Like at school, the people don\u2019t move, letting the rain drench them as they watch us, waiting for something.</p><p>When we reach my mom\u2019s car parked in the driveway, we climb in and I start the engine. Asher drags his fingers through his soaked hair and pushes it back from his face. We buckle our seatbelts without saying anything and then I put the car in reverse. When I check the mirror, I see that the people have migrated from the lawn to the end of the driveway, making it impossible to back up.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I ask as Asher rotates around in the seat to look behind us at the forming group.</p><p>He deliberates, measuring the thickness of the crowd. \u201cI think we should just go. Test them and see if they get out of the way.\u201d</p> <p>I grip the shifter with one hand and the steering wheel with the other. \u201cAnd what if they don\u2019t move?\u201d</p><p>His Adam\u2019s apple bobs up and down as he gulps. \u201cThen bump them with your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d I say, alarmed. \u201cThey\u2019re still people, despite the fact that they\u2019re possessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d he mutters, turning around in his seat and tilting his head to check out the side window. \u201cJust drive up on the grass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to hot rod it over the front lawn?\u201d I question, eyeballing down the perfect path just between the house and the edge of the group.</p><p>He places the book on his lap and puts a hand on top of it like he\u2019s afraid to let it go. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable enough doing it, I can trade places with you.\u201d</p> <p>I tap the gas pedal, giving it a little throttle. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good. In fact, I\u2019m sort of looking forward to doing it.\u201d</p><p>His pierced brow shoots up as his head whips in my direction. \u201cI\u2019m a little surprised you\u2019re not slightly afraid, considering you crashed your car into a lake.\u201d</p><p>I pump the gas a few more times and the car starts to inch down the driveway. \u201cMy dad loved working on cars,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd hot rodding them.\u201d I crane the wheel. \u201cHe actually used to steal them with me in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Asher gapes at me.</p><p>I give a little shrug. \u201cAs embarrassing as it is, it was sort of like a father/daughter bonding thing.\u201d</p><p>I rotate the wheel in the other direction when the back end reaches the people. They don\u2019t even move out of my way. Then, pressing on the gas, the tires squeal as the car lurches forward. I burn rubber; the tires tear up the grass, splattering mud and rain all over the windows. I have to flip the wipers on from the sheer magnitude of debris that suddenly covers the windshield.</p><p>I\u2019m enjoying myself a little bit as I pull away from my house, not too surprised that I\u2019m sort of relieved to be leaving the stillness of it behind. Then I spot someone in the crowd that makes me slam on the brakes. The car lurches to a stop and my hands start to shake as I stare at my mom standing just to the side of the car in the midst of the horde of people. She\u2019s dressed in old jeans and an overly large t-shirt, her hair pulled back in a messy bun and her skin bare of makeup, looking pale. There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s her, though.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I whisper and my foot that\u2019s holding down the brake starts to tremble, causing the car to roll forward again. I quickly reach over and shove it into park then take my foot off the brake.</p> <p>Asher tracks my gaze to her standing in the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s your mom?\u201d</p><p>I slowly nod, my fingers fumbling to find the buckle of the seatbelt. \u201cYeah, but what\u2019s she doing out there with them...\u201d I trail off as the buckle unclicks and then suddenly, I\u2019m moving in fast motion, reaching for the door handle, ready to jump out.</p><p>\u201cEmber, wait.\u201d Asher snags my arm and stops me. \u201cDon\u2019t get out.\u201d</p><p>I jerk my arm, but he doesn\u2019t let go. \u201cAsher, let me go. It\u2019s my mom out there...\u201d I look at her through the windshield and she\u2019s looking at me, her expression not numb like the rest of them, however it is horribly morose. \u201cPlease, I need to see her, to see if she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>My mom lifts her hand and waves, though there\u2019s something robotic about her movements, something about it shatters me inside. Then she places her hand on the base of her neck and that\u2019s when I see the marks. Or more like wounds that look like they were inflicted by a knife or a rope. There\u2019s also an X on her forehead. When I realize what that means, I start to freak out, pushing and shoving at Asher to let me go, but he keeps holding onto me with unbreakable strength. I hear him say something, but I\u2019m veering towards shock because it looks like my mom is dead.</p><p>\u201cAsher, let me go. Please!\u201d I start to cry, hysterically sobbing as he pulls me against him with the console between us. Mascara is running down my cheeks. \u201cOh, my God, she\u2019s dead... Please tell me she\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>Asher doesn\u2019t respond and I lose it, tears cascading out of my eyes. These last couple of days she\u2019s been missing and I\u2019ve been walking around, thinking she was out on the streets somewhere, but the entire time, she\u2019s been dead.</p><p>God, no.</p><p>My shoulders heave with each sob as I continue to cry, losing touch with reality, drifting into a state of devastation as I stare out the window at her. The people start to close in on the car, narrowing the space around us, taking the upper hand. Then through the rain, shadows appear, flying and soaring around the car. They look just like the ones I saw in my room; wisps of darkness that gracefully soar. Asher starts to curse when he spots them and it feels like I should be terrified, but the pain of my mother overrides it and all I feel is sorrow.</p><p>I can\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>I need to help her.</p><p>With more strength than I thought I possessed, I shove Asher away from me. He startles back, his back hitting the door. I seize the opportunity to hop out of the car. Rain slams against my skin, like icy needles, and I shield my eyes, searching for my mom. I find her standing just at the front of the car, a neutral expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cEmber, get in the car,\u201d Asher orders as he jumps out of the other side. He looks at me from over the roof, blinking fiercely against the rain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this happened, but you have to remember that she isn\u2019t really your mom anymore.\u201d</p><p>I look at him and then my mother, torn on what to do. I want to go to her, but at the same time, I know Asher\u2019s right. I know that\u2019s not really her, just what\u2019s left of her.</p><p>God, I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s dead.</p><p>I tell myself I can do this and start to turn back to the open door of the car. Asher seems relieved, lowering his head to get back in, but then my mom calls out my name and I freeze.</p><p>\u201cEmber, help me,\u201d she says. When I look at her, the vacancy in her eyes has dwindled and she resembles the same mom I saw right before I took her life. Helpless. Lost. Possessed. Under no control of her own. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t let me go like this,\u201d she begs.</p><p>I run to her, unable to control myself, unable to admit that this is her ghost and not her. Asher shouts out my name, but I don\u2019t care. My feet hammer against the ground and raindrops sting at my skin. As I get closer, the mob surrounds her, packing their bodies tighter together, like their trying to block me from getting to her. I shove each one out of the way, feeling their death course through me, all of them the same. Blackness. Pain. Good-bye. Please don\u2019t leave me. I can\u2019t. Everything hurts. Capes and feathers showering from the sky. All over the town. Blood filling the streets that are filled with bodies. So many bodies. So many deaths. Thousands. I can feel them pouring through me like a river of needles. One Reaper stands in the middle of it feasting off the souls of the bodies, growing more powerful. Broad shoulders, blonde hair, a scraggily jawline, he stands tall in the center of the blood, craving more souls. More power. More control over the town he runs.</p><p>I can\u2019t stay on my feet as the death replays in my head. I stretch my hand out to my mother, wanting her to reach me as the people bump and touch me from all sides. She just gazes at me, though, sort of the same way she looked at me when I killed my grandmother, like she hates me. Fears me. Wants to disown me.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I always knew you were going to be trouble,\u201d she says as I\u2019m lurched around, glowing eyes everywhere, smothering me as the rain slams down against my skin. \u201cThe moment I found out I was pregnant I was disgusted. I saw what being a Grim Angel made your grandfather. A monster; the same thing it made your father, crazy and killing innocent people. No wonder you\u2019re alone in the world. No one can stand you. The fucked up girl that can see death.\u201d Each one of her words hits me like razors under my skin, the pain wanting to escape, but it\u2019s stuck inside. \u201cNo wonder I didn\u2019t come home. I\u2019d rather rot in a ditch somewhere than be near you.\u201d</p><p>Her words strangle me as though they\u2019re invisible fingers wrapping around my neck. It hurts, but at the same time, I can\u2019t entirely feel the hurt because it\u2019s mixing with the horrid images of the entire town\u2019s death as the mayor stands in the middle of it all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t breathe. Think. See. I go down. Hard. My knees sinking into the dirt. Legs slam into me. Feet stomp on me. Elbows jab me in the head. Something stabs at my neck, trying to tear off my necklace, but I smack them away.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d I whisper, but I\u2019m not even sure I know who I\u2019m speaking to. Someone hears me, though, because I\u2019m abruptly swept up into a pair of very strong arms and cradled against a very sturdy chest.</p><p>I think its Asher, but when I look up, I swear I see gleaming eyes beneath a hood and a speck of blonde hair peeking out. I must be hallucinating because Cameron would never help me like this. Moments later, I feel myself being carried away while the feeling of death diminishes with each step. I shut my eyes and let the fall of rain wash away my internal agony, let the quiet seep into my unsettled heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Asher asks, but I\u2019m not sure who he\u2019s talking to.</p> <p>\u201cSaving your ass.\u201d It sounds like Cameron, but again, that can\u2019t be possible. He would never help me nor would he speak to Asher in such a way.</p><p>\u201cGive her to me,\u201d Asher says coldly. There\u2019s a pause and then I feel myself being transferred into the arms of another.</p><p>I open my mouth to protest, but the feeling of the death omen has worn me out, drained me passed the point of being able to open my eyes. Footsteps thud against the ground and warm lips brush against my head. I hear a door open and then feel myself being lowered into the car. I think they\u2019re going to set me down, though instead they climb in, still holding me. A door slams. Then another. The feel of rain leaves my body and warm air kisses my skin, yet I still feel unbelievably cold inside, like ice has surrounded my bruised heart and soul.</p><p>Banging starts to fill up the air around me and the cab of the car gets darker and darker as it begins to vibrate. I clutch onto Asher, feeling his heart thrashing inside his chest. Somehow, through my numbness, I start to cry; tears shed in an attempt to try and alleviate some of the agonizing pressure wearing a hole in my heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Asher whispers in my ear as he pulls me closer to him.</p> <p>More tears fall. More pain stabs within me, splits me open, and I\u2019m not even sure if it\u2019s from seeing the death of the town or if it stems from my mother\u2019s cold words. Or maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s dead and that\u2019s the last thing she\u2019ll ever say to me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, try to relax,\u201d Asher utters, smoothing his hand over my wet hair. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, but I\u2019m here with you. You\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>The feel of the heat of his body and knowing he\u2019s here with me calms me down enough that I don\u2019t want to move, crying tear after tear, telling myself that wasn\u2019t her out there. That it was the Anamotti\u2019s words. However it\u2019s hard to convince myself when she\u2019d said stuff to me like that when she was alive.</p><p>Still, wanting to be stronger, I eventually stop crying. I clutch onto the front of Asher\u2019s shirt with my eyes closed, breathing in and out as I focus on that instead of everything else going on, yet still, the ache slips through.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d I whisper as Asher rubs my back.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replies, his voice hoarse as he places another kiss on my head. \u201cJust try to breathe.\u201d</p> <p>I want to tell him that even breathing seems hard, but then I realize that the car is moving and that, unless Asher is holding me while he\u2019s driving, someone else is in the car with us. I already think I know who it is; the person that pulled me out of the crowd.</p><p>Cameron.</p><p>What I don\u2019t get is why. Why he tried to help me. Why Asher\u2019s letting him help me. It takes a lot of energy to lift my head, but I manage to do so, and then my swollen eyes snap wide. Cameron\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat, grasping the wheel as he speeds the car down the street of our neighborhood, which is lined with people. All the while, Asher seems perfectly content with it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I mutter, instantly slammed with a spout of exhaustion, my head bobbing around like a bobble head.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the car, Cameron.\u201d I hear Asher say, but I can\u2019t see him or anything, my eyelids lowering of their own accord.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously want me to stop? In the middle of this?\u201d he asks. \u201cThey\u2019ll end her if I do. Now that they\u2019ve gotten her whole family to give into the Reaper side, they\u2019re going to torture her until she breaks. And you know as well as I do that right now she\u2019s going to break very easily.\u201d</p><p>Asher\u2019s conflicted, but finally gives in. \u201cFine,\u201d he replies through gritted teeth. I hear the car tires squeal, the car accelerating. \u201cAt least stop taking all of her energy away. You know that\u2019s forbidden with a Grim Angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you know it\u2019s forbidden to touch one the way you have,\u201d Cameron retorts, giving the car a slight swerve.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, I\u2019m under no rules,\u201d Asher says quietly, hugging me closer to him.</p><p>\u201cAh, so it is true,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing banished allows you to overlook your ridiculous goody-two-shoes Angel rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll catch up with me when Michael finds out,\u201d Asher mumbles, his muscles going rigid. \u201cBut you need to stop breaking the rules right now and let her wake up.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not even asleep, I want to say, yet my lips are numb\u2014tingling again\u2014and heat is starting to spread up my back. I feel like I\u2019m burning up with a fever. Maybe the rain did it to me? Or maybe I\u2019m sick because my heart is broken.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hysterical right now.\u201d Irritation laces Cameron\u2019s tone. \u201cAnd she\u2019s only going to get more hysterical when she wakes up and feels the full blunt of what happened back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Asher snaps. \u201cYou\u2019re just using this is an excuse to get to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on...?\u201d I struggle to speak with my head slumped against Asher\u2019s chest. \u201cWhy are you two... talking to each other...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just found out her mom is dead and her soul is with the Reapers,\u201d Cameron says at the same time that I hear the engine rev louder. \u201cDo you really think she\u2019s going to handle that very well, especially after she just found out her brother gave into the Reaper side and gave up his position as a Grim Angel? Besides, now she\u2019s going to find out about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to find out about that.\u201d Asher\u2019s voice is low, carrying a threat as his arms fasten tighter around me while his cold, wet shirt presses against my hot cheek. \u201cWe made an agreement to never talk about that\u2014to never accept what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just want to keep lying to her?\u201d Cameron questions with disdain. \u201cHow typical of you. Honestly, I was sort of hoping that you getting kicked out of your Angel clan would have knocked some sense into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how typical of you to think she even wants to know about this,\u201d he says venomously. \u201cSometimes not knowing everything is a good thing. There\u2019s only so much a person can handle before they break.\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughs maliciously. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, she always wants to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d he tells him. I know he\u2019s thinking about the time when I told him I didn\u2019t want to hear about the Anamotti, back when he took me to the Angel statue, back when everything was normal. \u201cSometimes she just wants to be normal.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so right, and at the moment, despite all the craziness going on, I want to hug him, however my arms feel heavy, stuck on my lap, and all I can do is cuddle up and breathe him in.</p><p>\u201cI think she might be sick,\u201d Asher says as his palm touches my forehead. \u201cShe\u2019s burning up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s the last Grim Angel standing,\u201d Cameron says in a derisive, joking tone. \u201cAnd her Reaper and Angel blood are about to manifest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what exactly happens if she is the last one standing. You just speculate like everyone else does,\u201d he states, removing his hand from my forehead. \u201cNo one, except our leaders, knows for sure what will happen once the last one is left, other than the sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014\u201d Cameron abruptly stops talking and I feel the car swerve to the side.</p><p>I\u2019m jolted by the force, my fingers digging into the fabric of Asher\u2019s shirt as I hang on for dear life. Then the car realigns itself and we start to slow down, allowing me to relax.</p><p>\u201cShit, don\u2019t run him over,\u201d Asher says, leaning forward, moving me with him.</p><p>I try to open my eyelids, but they won\u2019t move. Then the car\u2019s engine growls as the gas pedal gets slammed to the floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking crazy?\u201d Cameron asks. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to get taken out by the mob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d Asher growls. \u201cHe\u2019s still our uncle.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? He\u2019s still our uncle.</p><p>\u201cOnly by blood,\u201d Cameron says calmly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the one who can\u2019t fly at the moment if anything happens. I\u2019ll be perfectly flying off, leaving you two behind\u2014\u201d</p><p>His voice is overlapped by the sound of glass breaking and metal bending. Brakes squeal and the smell of burning rubber fills up the air. It reminds me of the time when I drove my car into the lake. When I died. I wonder if I\u2019m going to die again, if the necklace will protect me. I wonder if this is the moment Cameron saw and why he gave me the necklace.</p><p>I feel myself spinning, or maybe it\u2019s the car, then I hear voices, yet I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re coming from inside my head or around me. I sense the wind and rain brushing up against my skin at the same time that heat and cold mix inside me. Death feasts on my veins as Asher\u2019s touch leaves me and suddenly I feel all alone, the necklace around my neck feeling like it\u2019s singeing my skin.</p><p>There\u2019s a brief pause where I wonder what\u2019s going to happen next and then my back slams against something hard and a rough surface tears open my skin. I feel my life leave me and then return again, the pendant getting hotter and hotter. Cameron was right\u2014death was in my near future.</p><p>Jesus, that means he saved me.</p><p>Rain covers my body as water soaks my hair and my clothes, stinging the open wounds on my arms and legs. Thunder rumbles. The ground gets moister. And questions race through my mind. Where am I? What happened? Why does my body feel so strange; it\u2019s not because of the death, but could it be because of the sudden freedom I feel?</p><p>It takes a lot of effort, but I finally get my eyes to open and slowly try to make sense of where I am. The first thing I see are dark clouds and then, as I tilt my head, I see the bridge that goes over the river in town. There are hundreds of people standing on it, staring down at me.</p><p>It feels like I should be afraid of the ominous feeling in the air, but my senses are focused on other stuff; sounds, sights, smells. I can hear the sound of water and the soft pitter-patter of raindrops splattering against the ground. I can feel the coldness of the water absorbing into my skin, although the heat that\u2019s consuming my body overpowers it. I\u2019m not sure how I got here. Or where the car is. Or Asher. Or Cameron. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I start to sit up, but pause halfway when my vision flickers. For a second I see another world. One where the stream remains before me, the bridge to my side, yet everything is tinted red and shadows dance everywhere. I blink my eyes several times, hearing the up and down movement of my eyelids, then everything goes back to normal.</p><p>I grasp my throbbing head as I sit up the rest of the way and that\u2019s when I feel my skin split open. The sound of my tearing flesh is like nails on a chalkboard. Pressure builds between my shoulder blades while my muscles tighten. Knot. Protest. Then I hear the rip of the fabric belonging to my jacket. Seconds later, it falls off of me, and the only thing remaining are the sleeves. My back gets pushed up, straightened, lifted. For a brief instant, I think I\u2019m going to fly away. I feel wind sweep up behind me and weight pull me back; it\u2019s almost as though a bag of bricks has been tied to my back.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to look because I think I already know what\u2019s occurred. I can\u2019t stop myself from needing to know if I\u2019m right, though. I breathe through the heaviness and then progressively turn my head to look over my shoulder. Just as I suspected, a pair of wings rise out of my back and point to the sky. Beautiful black feathers, almost like Asher\u2019s except for the trim of them are hued with red, like each one has been dipped in blood.</p><p>\u201cWhy...\u201d It\u2019s all I can get out of me, too astounded to process what just happened, what I\u2019ve become. Although it\u2019s not written out in front of me, I\u2019m pretty sure I know what this means.</p> <p>That the battle is veering to an end.</p><p>And I\u2019m the last Grim Angel standing.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>I stumble to my feet, wanting to run away from the sight, but it follows me. They\u2019re attached to my back and take my balance away. I collapse to my knees on the gravel, my skin splitting open, the river washing over to me.</p><p>Fearing what\u2019s about to happen, I glance over at the bridge to see what the mob is doing, only to see that they\u2019re heading down the slope just beneath the bridge, sliding in the loose gravel as they come for me. I don\u2019t know enough about the battle to know what\u2019s going to happen next, but I have a feeling that the last thing I want is to be captured by them.</p> <p>I struggle to get to my feet again and manage to get my legs under me this time, but as soon as I take a step, the weight of the wings tilt me back and I tip over, straight onto my back. The sky grumbles above me and my vision snaps again like the lightning, red tinting everything as shadows swarm through the clouds.</p><p>My cheeks soak with raindrops as I flip my body, endeavoring to roll to the side, yet the wings below me won\u2019t allow it and I spring right back over. Rain hits me in the eyes as I hear the footsteps of the mob growing closer. I reach for the sky, wishing I could fly, but I have no idea how. Plus, it looks like its bleeding. Everything does until I blink again, hearing the flutter of my eyelids before the world returns to its normal color.</p><p>It gives me back a little hope and motivation. I summon up every amount of strength I have to lift myself to a sitting position when one of my wings starts to flap on its own and I\u2019m wrenched to the side, tumbling into the muddy ground again. I catch a glimpse of the people that are very close now, and note the man dressed in black, leading them along.</p><p>They mayor\u2014leader of the Reapers\u2014is coming for me.</p><p>This is bad.</p><p>Very bad.</p> <p>\u201cGive me your hand.\u201d Asher\u2019s voice sends elation through me and my gaze eagerly searches through the rain for him.</p><p>He\u2019s standing just to the side of me with his hand extended out to me, a sort of awestruck look on his face as he takes in my wings. Cameron is just behind him, dressed in his normal clothes, although they\u2019re drenched and cling to his muscular body. He\u2019s watching me with wonder and curiosity with the book in his hands, which is something I don\u2019t understand, yet I know now is not the time to question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say to Asher for reasons I don\u2019t understand then I reach out to him and slip my fingers through his.</p><p>With one swift tug, he pulls me to my feet and I stumble into his arms, unable to keep my stability. He grips onto me, his arms wrapping around my lower back while his fingers tickle the wet feathers that belong to my wings.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he whispers in my ear and I obey without arguing. \u201cReady?\u201d he asks. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s speaking to me. He\u2019s asking Cameron.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always ready,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cShe\u2019s the one I\u2019m worried about. And you. You\u2019re too used to flying and they\u2019re going to chase us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine... and we don\u2019t have time to help her prepare. We need to get as far away from here as we can.\u201d No sooner have the words left his lips than I hear the sound of a voice flowing from the distance, calling out. When I glance over, I see the mob and the leader of the Anamotti closing in on us.</p><p>A lot of them are pure Anamotti, the X\u2019s on their bodies branding them for what they are along with the black cloaks they\u2019re wearing. There are also many possessed humans, some of whom I know. Raven. My brother. My mother. Even Asher\u2019s uncle is there. God, Alton\u2019s got the entire town in the palm of his hands and I wonder how long it\u2019ll be until he kills them all.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to go. Now,\u201d Asher demands.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I gaze up at him, rain dripping against my eyes.</p><p>He gives me a small smile, I think trying to comfort me, but I can tell the sight of me is making him nervous. It\u2019s making me nervous as well. \u201cSomewhere safe.\u201d</p><p>A few booms of thunder later, I see a snap of lightning throw silver streaks across the sky. Then the snap of something else rings loudly and suddenly I\u2019m being thrown. Or maybe I\u2019m being lifted upward. Flying. Falling. It\u2019s hard to tell. All I know is that Asher is holding onto me, our bodies pressed so closely together that his heat mixes with mine. Blackness is swirling around us like a funnel. I can still see the river, the bridge, and the entire town below us along with the car crunched up in the bushes just to the side of the riverbank, but it\u2019s in the distance as I realize we\u2019re floating into the sky.</p><p>Screams and shouts chase after us as some of the Anamotti lift off, trying to follow us; their capes materialize as they soar up into the sky.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Asher whispers, and without arguing, I grip tightly onto him, wrapping my legs around his waist and holding on for dear life.</p><p>A second later, we\u2019re launched forward, sucked into the darkness around us. It\u2019s like going through a tunnel, lights flickering, cold air hitting my face. Whispers echo around me and the darkness keeps brushing against my skin, which is when I realize that the darkness is a veil of shadows.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the shadow realm?\u201d I ask, looking up at Asher as we fly through the shadows by an unseen current. It\u2019s strange to watch too, because their moving and we\u2019re moving and the two combined make it seem like we\u2019re not moving. They also whisper, but I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying as if they\u2019re speaking in code.</p><p>Asher nods, his face is barely visible with only the ambient light around us, but I can tell he\u2019s trying to concentrate on taking us somewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we could get out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can\u2019t the Anamotti get in here?\u201d I ask, looking over at Cameron flying just in front of us.</p><p>He gives a quick glance at me. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to move fast,\u201d he says with concern.</p><p>And move fast we do, going so quickly I start to get motion sickness the more the air flows over my body and the smaller the things below me get. We\u2019re getting higher. Things are getting dimmer. I feel like I\u2019m going to puke. Finally, I give up watching and bury my face into Asher\u2019s chest. I shut my eyes and tell myself that everything is going to be okay. That I\u2019ll get through this. However, deep down, I know I\u2019m wrong. I have hardly anyone in my life left, at least along the lines of being human, and now the fate of the world\u2019s souls is in my hands. I\u2019m going to have to make a choice. I\u2019m going to have to make a sacrifice.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have to kill someone I love.</p><p>The problem is, I\u2019m not sure I love anyone at the moment. So what does that mean? What does anything mean anymore?</p><p>I continue to think the same things over and over again, feeling myself drifting off to sleep the more time goes on. I don\u2019t even know how it\u2019s possible, considering how much adrenaline is coursing through me, however it feels like I could fall asleep in Asher\u2019s arms, right here in the middle of the shadow realm. I\u2019m about to let myself, too, when I hear something whisper my name.</p><p>\u201cJust hang on, Ember.\u201d</p><p>My eyelids lift open. We\u2019re still soaring through the shadow realm with the world zipping by below us. Shadows stream at our sides; some of them reach out for us, but Asher easily dodges them, zigzagging from side to side.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Asher asks, feeling my tension.</p><p>I shake my head, staring at the shadow wall to my right, my vision flicking around again. It becomes more defiant. Darker. Bolder. Forming a shape of a face with eyes that look just like mine; one\u2019s I haven\u2019t seen for years.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I whisper as it extends out of the surface like a statue made of obsidian.</p><p>He watches me for a moment before his lips start to unnaturally move. \u201cDon\u2019t trust anyone but yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cYou still have a long road ahead of you, filled with hard choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cHow do I know what\u2019s right and wrong, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve made it this far\u2014you\u2019re the last Grim Angel\u2014which means you\u2019re the strongest\u2014and the Anamotti know that. They fear it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I believe him. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are.\u201d The statue starts to crack. \u201cI know you\u2019ll do the right thing in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it you?\u201d I ask. \u201cThat day in the attic.\u201d</p><p>I swear the dark mass smiles. \u201cHow could I not protect my little girl when the leader of the Reapers is after her... His voice floats away.</p><p>\u201cDad, wait!\u201d I call out, but the pieces crumble apart and disintegrate into dust.</p><p>Without even thinking, I try to slip out of Asher\u2019s arms, trying to get to him, pull him back to me, even though I can\u2019t see him anymore. Yet Asher fights me, his arms refusing to let me go, pressing me closer to his chest.</p><p>\u201cEmber, hold still,\u201d he says softly. I wonder if he saw what I did. \u201cI don\u2019t want to drop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I saw my dad.\u201d I squirm and push against his chest. \u201cAsher, let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says with relentless stubbornness. \u201cIf I let you go, you\u2019ll fall.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at the shadow wall where my dad was, but it\u2019s now gone and then I look at the ground below me. Even though it kills me, I stop fighting, letting the drowsiness take over. My heart is being ripped apart all over again; just like the first time he disappeared.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>The Reaper has returned, tall and sinister, standing in the shadows of my room beside my dresser like a ghost. His eyes light up the night while his presence chills the air, and goosebumps dot my arms as I sit up in my bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s late; the moon a massive ring filled with light that glimmers through my window and illuminates the drawings and poetic ramblings on my wall; words the Reaper seems very interested in as he reads them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask the Reaper who\u2019s haunted me off and on since I was a child; the one that always seems to come back just when I\u2019m about to believe he\u2019s disappeared out of my life forever. \u201cI thought you went away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came back,\u201d he says simply, the hood over his head masking his face from me, but as he steps out of the shadows and into the moonlight, the glow of the moon hits his face. \u201cI needed to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, wrapping my arms around myself as I eye the door, wanting to run, but I know he\u2019ll simply follow me. He always does. \u201cNo way. I don\u2019t want to hear anything that you say... I just want you to leave.\u201d</p> <p>He takes another step towards my bed, seeming to grow taller with every movement. \u201cDon\u2019t tell lies, Ember Rose. You know that you\u2019ve missed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d I say, but it\u2019s not entirely true. Sometimes, when I\u2019m really lonely, when my mom\u2019s out doing drugs, my father\u2019s stealing cars and my brother is out with his girlfriend getting high, I do wish he was here. \u201cI never miss you when you leave.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as the afterglow of his eyes brightens, highlighting the features of his face. \u201cAnother lie, but I\u2019ll let it go because I came here to tell you something important.\u201d</p><p>I move my hands to cover my ears. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about your father,\u201d he says swiftly. With that, my hands fall to my lap.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d I ask worriedly, knowing it can never be a good thing when the Grim Reaper shows up in your room and says he knows something about your father.</p><p>He walks the rest of the distance to the bed and then hovers over me. \u201cHe\u2019s going to die.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, scooting away as the feel of his death flows off his body and tries to enter me. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>He sinks down on my bed, nearly sitting on my legs as he makes himself at home. \u201cI never lie. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing other than you show up sometimes and drive me insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a sucky job,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWhich makes you sucky.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, almost sounding human except his eyes are glowing and he\u2019s wearing a cloak. \u201cI love your sense of humor. You and I are really going to get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not,\u201d I protest. \u201cBecause you\u2019re going to go away again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll still see if you feel the same way when I tell you what I know,\u201d he says. I hold my breath, waiting for him to divulge what he knows, even though I know I should probably be running for the door. \u201cI\u2019ve been sent on a mission,\u201d he starts, \u201cto collect a very valuable soul.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, shivering from the chill creeping into my body. \u201cWhose soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you already know the answer, but just to be clear, it\u2019s your father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not dead,\u201d I choke, gripping onto the edge of the blanket. \u201cHe can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t yet,\u201d the Reaper replies, rising to his feet. \u201cBut as soon as I collect his soul, he will be.\u201d</p> <p>I grab onto his cloak, despite my initial urge not to touch him. \u201cWait, please don\u2019t do it. Please.\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder at me. \u201cIt\u2019s my job, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m asking you not to,\u201d I say in a pleading voice as I hold onto his cloak and kneel up on my bed. \u201cPlease, he\u2019s the only one in my family that\u2019s nice to me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I care,\u201d he questions, \u201cabout you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... but you\u2019re here, aren\u2019t you? And that\u2019s got to mean something.\u201d</p><p>He misses a beat and then quickly strides forward towards the door, swishing the end of his cloak behind him. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a few minutes to warn him,\u201d he says and then opens the door. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to do what I have to.\u201d</p><p>He exits the room and I leap to my feet, running out into the hall. It\u2019s dark and the house is quiet, the temperature icy and haunting, carrying a warning that death was just here. That he\u2019s about to take my dad\u2019s soul, which means my dad\u2019s going to die.</p><p>No. I won\u2019t let it happen.</p><p>I hurry through the darkness and then sprint down the stairs, racing for the kitchen phone. I dial my dad\u2019s house number, but no answer, so I try his cellphone. It\u2019s been disconnected. I hang up, glancing around the kitchen as I attempt to figure out what to do next. I could tell my mom if she\u2019s here, or my brother. Though, even if one of them is sober, they\u2019d never believe me.</p><p>Not able to think of another solution, I do something that I know is stupid. I call the police to report my dad\u2019s death, and as the words leave my lips, I swear I hear the Reaper\u2019s laughter echoing around me.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>When I wake up, I\u2019m surrounded by a thin cloud of mist that quickly dissolves. I can tell my wings are still out by the way it feels like I\u2019m lying on a pile of pillows. I\u2019m not sure where I am. In a bed, that much I can tell, but the room I\u2019m in looks like it belongs to a cottage. The walls are made of wood. Vines and flowers grow across the banisters in the ceiling. There\u2019s a dresser in the corner and a mirror on the farthest wall. There are also paintings on the walls; some of landscapes, some of Angels, others are abstracts, full of vibrant colors and intricate shapes.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d I mutter, blinking my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re somewhere safe where the Reaper\u2019s can\u2019t get to you.\u201d The sound of Asher\u2019s voice kisses my skin, but at the same time it repulses me, something hidden inside me shouts to stay away from him, that I need\u2014want\u2014to hear someone else\u2019s voice. Someone that calls me princess.</p><p>I shove the voice out of my mind and rotate my head to the side. Asher appears through the doorway with his arms crossed over his chest. He\u2019s changed his clothes and is now wearing a plain grey shirt, dark jeans and boots. His inky black hair is a little damp like he just got out of the shower while the tiredness in his eyes has diminished only slightly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks with caution, his gaze skimming every inch of me as I sit up.</p><p>I push the blankets off me, fighting to keep my body upright against the protest of my wings that flutter uncontrollably and bump against the wall behind me. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He walks to the middle of the room cautiously as he skims over my wings, desire filling his eyes and making my skin tingle. \u201cCameron put you in a state of sleepiness.\u201d He sighs, unfolding his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s a stupid Reaper thing.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, trying to find the nerves that control my wings to stop them from fluttering. \u201cNo, not that...\u201d I rub my eyes several times as red creeps into my vision again. \u201cI mean, what the hell happened back there? With the shadows... and you were talking to Cameron like that... Why?\u201d</p><p>He takes long strides to my bedside and he still seems nervous and tense as he shifts his weight uneasily. Then, with reluctance, he sinks down beside the bed as if he\u2019s bowing before me. \u201cI haven\u2019t been completely honest with you.\u201d</p><p>I bend one of my knees up and wrap my arms around it to hold up my body. \u201cI figured as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d He pauses, studying me with a look that makes my skin heat and my temper flare, but the rage is directed more at myself. \u201cRemember how I told you that I had to make a choice whether I wanted to be a Reaper or Angel of Death?\u201d he asks and I nod. \u201cWell, I left out an important part of the story.\u201d</p><p>I frown as I slant forward, trying to get more room for my wings. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it has to do with Cameron.\u201d</p><p>He nods, his gaze flicking to my wings, and for a fleeting moment, yearning flashes across his face. I half expect him to grab me and take me here on the bed... which doesn\u2019t sound so bad, yet at the same time, it does.</p><p>\u201cIt does have to do with Cameron.\u201d He fiddles with his eyebrow piercing as he chooses his words carefully. \u201cCameron was faced with a choice, too.\u201d He pauses again and I feel the tension. \u201cBecause he\u2019s my brother. My twin brother.\u201d</p><p>It takes a second or two for what he\u2019s saying to register. Between everything that\u2019s happened, I think I\u2019ve entered a state of shock and it makes it hard to process things that seem so unrealistic.</p><p>When I speak, my voice comes out strangely calm. \u201cSo, he chose his Reaper blood,\u201d I say. The story sounds strangely like my own story; whether I choose evil or good, Reaper or Angel, I now have an example of each. Of what I could become depending on what I choose. And now I have to choose. The wings growing out of my back are proof, but why just wings? Where\u2019s the sign of my Reaper blood?</p><p>\u201cMy mother had us both and we both faced the same decision,\u201d Asher explains, pressing his lips together when my wings tremble for no given reason. I keep waiting for him to say something, however it\u2019s like he\u2019s afraid to. \u201cI chose to accept my Angel blood and he chose to accept his Reaper blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were\u2014are\u2014brothers,\u201d I say, still processing that all this time they\u2019ve been brothers. All this time both of them have omitted the truth from me. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it\u2014whether I should feel anything about it\u2014because it seems like there\u2019s so many more things to worry about; worse things.</p><p>He nods. \u201cSadly, we are.\u201d</p><p>The past starts to make a little more sense. Why they were always fighting so much. Granted, they are Reaper and Angel, but being brothers makes things more complicated. \u201cSo does he know who your dad is?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his eyes fixed on mine. \u201cIt\u2019s the downfall of having a Reaper as a dad\u2014they don\u2019t make the best fathers. Besides, ours... well, he didn\u2019t want anything to do with us.\u201d</p><p>His sadness begins to get to me and I tentatively put a hand on his unshaven cheek, trying to comfort him even though I want to be comforted as well. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Not just for your father and not knowing exactly who he is, but for Cameron being your brother.\u201d</p><p>His lips tip up into the most depressing smile I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel bad for me; you have your own family problems, too, and I lied to you.\u201d</p><p>It feels like I should be more furious with him, but at the same time, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to admit Cameron was my brother, either. \u201cAsher, my mom... I saw her back in the crowd...\u201d I force back the impending tears. \u201cShe\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she?\u201d I ask it as a question, but I already know the answer. \u201cWas she a Grim Angel too... she said something about my grandfather being one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d He hesitates, but then something flashes in his eyes\u2014false hope maybe. Then he swiftly shakes his head and grabs my legs, pulling me to him. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure that she\u2019s dead,\u201d he says, his hands sliding up across the fabric of my torn up jeans until they reach my hips. \u201cIt could easily be the Anamotti messing with your head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it might not be, especially since you thought I was pure blood.\u201d Deep breaths. Keep breathing. My mom might have not been the greatest mom in the world, but the thought of losing another parent aches inside my heart, burns in my soul, makes me feel so alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I can try and find out though, but it\u2019ll probably take some time.\u201d He pauses, conflicted. \u201cI just want to make sure you prepare yourself for what I find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, prepare myself for if she\u2019s dead.\u201d My bluntness shocks him, however he quickly composes himself and nods. \u201cPrepare myself for another loss of a family member.\u201d An excruciating revelation clicks inside my head. If I ended up choosing the right side through all of this, I\u2019ll still end up alone if my mom is dead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re giving her false hope,\u201d Cameron says, materializing in the doorway, looking as though he just showered and shaved; his skin is smooth, his blonde hair perfectly styled and his black shirt and jeans unwrinkled. \u201cYou know as well as I do that that wasn\u2019t a joke. That her mother is probably dead.... That Ember has pure blood and that\u2019s how she\u2019s the last one standing...\u201d He shuts his eyes and inhales deeply. \u201cI can feel her mother\u2019s soul in the air, along with a ton of other\u2019s, waiting to be collected.\u201d He reopens his eyes. \u201cLucky for her, the Reapers seem to be preoccupied with tracking you down at the moment, so her soul has some time left in her body, but still, she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, maybe you can bring her back then,\u201d I say, knowing I\u2019m treading thin water here. \u201cLike you did with that guy in the alley.\u201d</p><p>He elevates his eyebrows at me with amusement dancing in his eyes. \u201cYou want to pay that price again?\u201d He smirks, looking over my body from head to toe and it feels like he\u2019s touching me, yet he\u2019s not. \u201cOnly this time it\u2019s much higher.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at him, but part of me wants to run up and hug him\u2014thank him for saving me by giving me the necklace. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I glance back at Asher \u201cYou said Reaper\u2019s couldn\u2019t come here?\u201d</p><p>Cameron rolls his eyes, strutting through the doorway like he owns the place. \u201cFull Reaper\u2019s can\u2019t, but half Reaper, half Angel\u2019s can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d I look back and forth between the two of them. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p> <p>Asher and Cameron exchange a look and then Asher sighs. \u201cRemember how I said that I spend most of my time in a place my mind creates, the one that I lived in. Sort of like an in between... well, we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your mind?\u201d I ask, flabbergasted.</p><p>Asher wavers. \u201cSort of, but not exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of it as a place that belongs to only one person,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cAnd that one person can create whatever they want, build it however they want, and only let in whoever they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a video game,\u201d I remark with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou could look at it that way,\u201d Cameron says.</p> <p>\u201cWell who built this place?\u201d I wonder.</p><p>Asher points at himself. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is he here.\u201d I aim a finger at Cameron. \u201cWhen all he\u2019s done is torture me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really believe that?\u201d Cameron questions with speculation, eyeballing the necklace on my neck. \u201cPlus, I helped you out back there, all because I care for you,\u201d Cameron says as Asher cringes. \u201cDespite what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything,\u201d I mutter, hating that I feel connected to both of them. That, at the moment, I feel a tug-o-war with my emotions; wanting to cave into Cameron, but also melt into Asher.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t.\u201d Cameron stops just short of the bed, right beside Asher. His face contorts with disgust. \u201cNice wings, by the way.\u201d His face pinches as he stares at them. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgusting look for you.\u201d His head cocks to the side. \u201cAlthough I do love the eyes.\u201d</p><p>My fingers shoot up to my face and I gently touch the skin around them. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my eyes?\u201d Right on cue, red fills my vision again. For a moment, it looks like the walls are bleeding.</p><p>Cameron stares at the back of Asher\u2019s head like he\u2019s mentally compelling him to turn around and look at him. \u201cDo you want to tell her or do you want me to?\u201d</p> <p>I look at Asher who\u2019s looking at me gravely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell her at all,\u201d he says with remorse.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s going to see eventually,\u201d he steps aside and gestures to the mirror hanging on the wall, \u201cso she might as well get it over with.\u201d</p><p>I wait for Asher to say something, but he conclusively rises to his feet with a gut-wrenching look on his face as he backs away from me. At first, I think he\u2019s trying to get away from me, but then he holds out his hand for me to take.</p><p>Nerves bubble inside my body as I take his offered hand. As he helps me to my feet, I start to tip back, but he pulls me forward, helping me balance.</p><p>\u201cKeep your shoulders up,\u201d he says, demonstrating by lifting his own. \u201cIt\u2019ll help a little.\u201d</p><p>I nod and then raise my shoulders higher, my chest sticking out and bearing more of the weight. Then, with his eyes fastened on mine, he backs up towards the mirror, guiding me along with him, taking small steps as I struggle to stay on my feet. When we reach it, he blocks my view for a moment, reluctant to let me see, but after a lot of mental deliberating, he irrevocably steps to the side and out of the way.</p><p>I inch forward, moving slowly until my reflection appears before me.</p><p>Wings of black and red.</p><p>Tall and strong.</p><p>Though shoulders curled in</p><p>Cursed with weight.</p><p>Eyes like ash.</p><p>Skin like snow.</p><p>Lips blood red.</p><p>Dark lines</p><p>Veined with death</p><p>Beneath black eyes.</p><p>Linked with the evil side</p><p>But below the surface</p><p>Good still thrives</p><p>Smoldering like cinders</p><p>Desperate to burn</p><p>Yet the chill inside</p><p>Won\u2019t allow it</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I breathe, reaching for my face and running my fingers beneath my black eyes that don\u2019t belong to me, yet somehow do. \u201cI\u2019m hideous.\u201d</p><p>Asher moves up to the side of me and his reflection joins mine in the mirror, looking even more perfect beside my mutated self. \u201cYou\u2019re not hideous. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, cringing at the lack of emotion my eyes portray. \u201cLook at my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they are the best part,\u201d Cameron remarks, stepping up to the other side of me, his reflection joining ours in the mirror.</p><p>We stand there together, taking in the sight of me. An Angel on one side and a Reaper on the other. My body feels drawn to both, my blood linked to both. Suddenly, I realize why everyone kept saying I\u2019d have to make a choice between good or evil. At the time, I always thought that there was no way it could even be a choice. That good would win, no matter what.</p><p>Yet now, standing here with both sides by me, I can tell it\u2019s going to be hard. I belong to both sides. Reaper and Angel. Good and bad.</p><p>I am the balance of both.</p><p>I am the Grim Angel.</p><p>\u201cSo does this mean I\u2019m the last one?\u201d I ask, turning around to look at Asher.</p><p>He glances at my wings as he slowly nods. \u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>His words slam hard against my chest, yet there\u2019s an invisible shield that protects me, one that belongs to my Reaper side and doesn\u2019t let me feel the fear I want to.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d I ask. \u201cI mean, how do I make the choice?\u201d And what choice do I make? I start to panic. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I can make that choice yet... do that...\u201d</p><p>Asher places a hand on my shoulder in comforting gesture and then glances at Cameron. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit more to it than that, Ember.\u201d</p><p>Cameron bumps my wings out of the way as he leans over my shoulder, invading my personal space and knocks Asher\u2019s hand off my shoulder. \u201cFrom what I understand, Michael and Alton are supposed to come down to earth for the end of the battle, let the Grim Angel make the choice, make her sacrifice,\u201d he glances over at Asher with a grin, \u201cWhoever that might be.\u201d His eyes land on me. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think things are going to happen exactly that way at the moment since my leader is pretty content with feeding off the souls of Hollows Grove.\u201d He makes a face, like he\u2019s upset about this and he probably is considering what he told me about his family, which come to think of it would also be Asher\u2019s family. \u201cIn fact, I think he\u2019ll probably drag this on as long as possible, at least that\u2019s what everyone was whispering about in the shadow realm.\u201d I loathe how my body responds to the words our leader. \u201cOf course that book you were harboring for my dear double-crossing uncle could help at least put that problem to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElliot didn\u2019t double cross us,\u201d Asher argues, reaching over my shoulder and pushing Cameron away from me. \u201cHe was just possessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say, Angel.\u201d Cameron staggers back, but quickly composes himself, and glances in the mirror. \u201cI say, Reaper. You know it\u2019s really hard to tell sometimes.\u201d He admires his reflection vainly.</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not. They\u2019re completely different,\u201d Asher retorts with hate in his eyes that\u2019s entirely directed at his brother.</p><p>Cameron arches his brow in my direction. \u201cReally? Because she\u2019s kind of walking proof that the two coexist.\u201d</p><p>Asher shakes his head, fury radiating from him, but it starts to fizzle after a moment or two goes by. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just need to make a plan... find that book and figure out what to do with Ember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure out what to do with me.... Wait, find the book?\u201d I glance back and forth between them and they both look guilty. \u201cWe already have it, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Asher gives Cameron the death glare and in response Cameron rolls his eyes shrugs, making a whoops face. \u201cWell, we would have it if I wouldn\u2019t have dropped it.\u201d He takes a step back from us, surrendering his hands up in front of him when I glare at him. \u201cCompletely by accident, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I not believe that?\u201d I narrow my eyes at him. \u201cWhy do I have the feeling that you\u2019ve hidden it in the shadow realm so you can go back and get it yourself?\u201d</p><p>He lowers his hands to his sides with a mocking expression. \u201cNow why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug, giving him attitude. \u201cMaybe for the same reason Alton wants it, whatever that is. Or maybe destroy it so I won\u2019t be able to help the town. Or maybe there\u2019s something more on those pages than what I realized that night.\u201d I glare at him as I fold my arms across my chest. \u201cOr better yet maybe for the same reason you hid my dad in there.\u201d</p><p>For the first time ever, Cameron\u2019s expression falters. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p><p>I want to wring his neck. \u201cBecause I saw him in there! Trapped in the shadows... part of them... God dammit, Cameron! Why didn\u2019t you just tell me he was there!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rubs his hand over his face tensely. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not true?\u201d I ask unfathomably. \u201cSince I\u2019m not thinking anything at the moment other than how confusing this all is.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for me, but I recoil back and Asher steps up behind me, smacking Cameron\u2019s hand away. Cameron scowls at him, however then he aims his attention back to me, locking his eyes with mine while he lets his shift to black to match my own, like he\u2019s trying to put us on the same ground. \u201cI had to put your dad there. It was either that or collect his soul and give it to the Reapers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he... is he dead?\u201d I sound strangled and it\u2019s difficult to breathe.</p> <p>He has little penitence on his face. \u201cMore like in-between,\u201d he says. When I open my mouth to yell at him for being so calm, he adds, \u201cLook, it was the only way I could stop from collecting his soul and handing it over to the Reapers. Since Grim Angels souls are more powerful than any other soul, Alton doesn\u2019t let those get revived, like the guy in the alley, or handed over to the Angels. He fights for those. But I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it, so I hid his soul in the shadows until I could figure out what to do with it. And you should be grateful. Alton\u2019s hates my family even more now and is even more dead set on getting more power so he can destroy us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d I ask, but as soon as the question leaves my mouth, I realize how dumb it is. \u201cNever mind. It was probably just another one of your tricks to fuck with my head.\u201d</p><p>Panic flashes in his eyes and unexpectedly he\u2019s rushing towards me, shoving Asher out of the way and putting his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI did it because I care for you. Otherwise, his soul would belong to the Reapers right now.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to respond. Not sure whether he\u2019s telling the truth or not. Not sure why he\u2019s been helping me, yet at the same time it seems like he\u2019s working against me. His hand is on my arm and the way he\u2019s looking at me is utterly awkward with Asher standing here, observing us.</p><p>I slip my shoulders from his grasp and stumble back. \u201cHow do we get him out?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure that out,\u201d he admits. I have no idea if he means it or not, though. I never do with him. \u201cHe escaped once when he paid you a little visit, but as merely a shadow and he was still attached to the shadow realm.... Right now, I have no idea how to get him out\u2014How to get him out of shadow form.\u201d He raises his hands in front of him as I frown at him. \u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I was only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell next time you help, make sure it\u2019s actually helping,\u201d I tell him, angry, but at the same time I feel bad for being so rude, because even though he\u2019s got my dad stuck in the shadow realm, he was trying to help in his own strange way.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure out a way to get him out,\u201d Cameron mutters, seeming puzzled.</p><p>Silence takes over and I can here water running in the distance as well as birds chirping and wind dancing. It sounds like nature is all around us, making me wonder what it looks like out the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d I break the silence. \u201cHollows Grove is possessed, and if my death omen is right, then Alton is going to kill the entire town. And the book is gone... although if we can get a hold of this August guy, then maybe we can find out how to free all those souls and stop him without the book.\u201d I glance over at Asher in disappointment. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t get wifi up here.\u201d</p><p>Asher looks close to laughing, but stops himself by smashing his lips together. \u201cI don\u2019t, but I\u2019ll find a way, Ember\u2014we\u2019ll figure out all of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFigure out all of this,\u201d Cameron says, rolling his eyes as he faces me. \u201cLike it\u2019s that simple. Even if we could figure out how to get the book back and save the town, then get the ball rolling on her making her choice, I think you and I, and even my lovely brother over there, know that you\u2019re conflicted, seeing as how you\u2019ve willingly drank both our lives and felt both the dark and the light inside you.\u201d</p><p>I peek over at Asher, trying to tell if he\u2019s believing this crap, but he avoids eye contract with me.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get the book back,\u201d Asher says, changing the subject. \u201cFree the souls and then hopefully I can talk to our uncle and get some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, answers would be good,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cThere are a lot of unanswered questions, well except for the sacrifice of the one she loves.\u201d Cameron winks at me. \u201cThat we already know.\u201d Then he angles his head to the side, musing over something. \u201cAlthough, we don\u2019t know who she\u2019s going to pick for that.\u201d</p><p>With no control over my emotions, I lift my hand to smack him. Surprisingly, Asher catches my arm. \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it. He\u2019s only doing this to mess with your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why am I handing out all of my Reaper secrets to you two on a silver platter?\u201d Cameron queries, annoyed. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much taking your side, whatever that may be, and you\u2019re treating me like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you think it\u2019s going to get you her,\u201d Asher interrupts quickly as I lower my hand. \u201cBecause, deep down, you care about her, and in the end, even if it means she has to kill you, you want her to love you.\u201d</p><p>As the awkwardness builds around us, I secretly wonder if what Asher is saying is true. If that\u2019s how Cameron feels. I wonder if it applies to Asher, too. If he doesn\u2019t care if I sacrifice him if it means that I love him.</p> <p>The tension cracks when Cameron suddenly waves his arm in front of him and his cloak appears and enfolds it around his body, covering him up.</p><p>\u201cBailing out, huh?\u201d Asher asks with a challenge, crossing his arms.</p><p>Cameron shoots him an aggravated look as he draws his hood over his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to go get the book back for her.\u201d He then flips his cape and shadows rise all around him as a mist comes out of the floorboards, taking him away.</p><p>Asher lunges for him, but the blackened mist quickly fades and he ends up bumping into the mirror. \u201cDammit,\u201d he curses, kicking the wall.</p><p>I momentarily stand frozen, feeling a pit in my stomach form, one created by the fact that he just left me and that part of me wants him to come back. Then reality catches up with me and my head snaps in Asher\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cShould we go get him before he gets the book?\u201d I ask Asher. \u201cWe can\u2019t let him get it, especially if he wants it.\u201d Because even though he says he\u2019s getting it for me, I\u2019m not completely buying it. Never trust anyone. It\u2019s becoming my life motto.</p><p>Asher bites his lip, staring at the spot Cameron vanished from. \u201cYou can\u2019t go back that way and the other way is impossible to go through right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go back into the shadow realm because the Anamotti were already invading it when we dove out.\u201d He turns his head to look at me and I\u2019m glad to see he\u2019s calmed down. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t leave you because this place won\u2019t exist without me; it exists only in my head. Once I\u2019m gone, it disappears.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAnd the only other way to get out of here is to fly and unfortunately your wings are about as useless as mine right now, seeing as how you don\u2019t know how to use them.\u201d</p><p>I tense. \u201cBut what if someone gets in here?\u201d Panic rushes through me. \u201cAsher, Cameron\u2019s right... I\u2019m not ready to make that decision just yet.\u201d As I realize what I\u2019ve said, I add, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to sacrifice someone\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>He searches my eyes intently then his gaze leisurely scroll over me, lingering a second or two longer on the ribbon of my shirt, which is starting to fray and loosen. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t.\u201d He stares at me as various emotions reflect in his eyes, some that make my blood heat and some that make me want to run for the door. \u201cAnd until you are, I\u2019m going to keep you here. They can\u2019t get to you if you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I safe here, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are for a while, yes.\u201d</p><p>I struggle to maintain my breathing, my heaving chest unraveling the ribbon even more, which causes my breasts to about spring free. Asher more than notices as he stares down at them through hooded eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d</p><p>He tears his gaze off my cleavage. \u201cI know it\u2019s scary right now, but your safe with me right now Ember. And we\u2019ll figure out how to end this all\u2014how to stop Alton from killing the town and get you ready to make your choice.\u201d He pretends to be unruffled, but I note he\u2019s gotten shaky. \u201cWhatever that might be.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell him that I already know. That it\u2019s him, but it would be a lie because I have no idea what I\u2019m feeling for him or for Cameron\u2014for anyone really. Everything is so confusing.</p><p>He must sense it too because he cuts me off as he moves to the window. \u201cWant to see something amazing?\u201d he asks and I nod, relieved he\u2019s giving me an out.</p><p>Seeming a little nervous, he draws the curtain back, showing me the view outside. I\u2019m not even sure how to respond to the surreal scene before me. Clouds that cover the sky, grass which encircles the house. A colossal waterfall in the distance rolls over rocks and crashes against the ground. Flourishing trees dot the land and flowers of all colors grow from the ground, twining around the trunks and branches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I say, stepping forward and placing my hand on the glass.</p><p>He watches me. \u201cI created this spot because I see it as perfect and no one can come here unless I allow them to.\u201d He takes my hand, grazing his finger along my knuckles. \u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>As he looks into my eyes, I feel something come to life inside me, but I\u2019m not exactly sure what it is. Still, it\u2019s warm and welcoming, so I let it grow and take over my body.</p><p>A smile slowly rises on Asher\u2019s face. \u201cYour eyes are back to normal.\u201d</p><p>I glance in the mirror and let out a relieved sigh at the sight of my normal, grey eyes. \u201cThank God.\u201d Yet, once again, my inner voice laughs at me, reminding me that I\u2019m conflicted between good and bad. That the change isn\u2019t permanent. \u201cNow if I can just put my wings away, then maybe I can feel normal again.\u201d</p><p>Asher\u2019s eyes darken with hunger as he glances from my eyes to my chest to my wings then back to my eyes. \u201cIn a moment, I\u2019ll show you how.\u201d He releases my hand and strolls to the front of me, deliberately skimming me from head to toe. \u201cBut first I want to do something.\u201d He wets his lips with his tongue and my thighs burn in anticipation. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot going on.\u201d He leans in towards me. \u201cI know there\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d His lips get closer and my stomach somersaults. \u201cBut you\u2019re so beautiful right now and I just want to touch you for a moment.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. There is so much unsaid. So much at risk, and we should be focusing on that, but still, I stand motionless, waiting for his lips to touch mine. When they do, hot, fiery liquid spills through my veins and pours throughout my body. The feeling only heightens as his tongue slips into my mouth and his tongue ring grazes my teeth. He groans as he pulls me closer, his fingers instantly seeking the ribbon and pulling on it. My breasts spring free, and when he gently pinches one of them, I nearly explode, my body needing more, yet at the same time, something stops me. A barrier, created by my Reaper blood, telling me not to kiss him, but kill him, suck his life from his body. The feeling only magnifies as he starts to back me towards the bed, gripping at my breasts while kissing me fervently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally it becomes too much and I pull back, shaking from head to toe as horrid feelings race through me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Asher says, his eyes a little glazed as he searches mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d My voice trembles and I take a deep breath before I say something that makes me hate myself. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel very well.\u201d I motion at the wings on my back, feeling tears of guilt sting at my eyes.</p><p>He stares at me with suspicion, almost like he knows I\u2019m full of shit, but it quickly evaporates and sympathy takes its place. \u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable, considering what you\u2019re going through.\u201d</p> <p>Tears stream from my eyes. I\u2019m not even sure why I\u2019m crying, whether it\u2019s from guilt because I really want to kiss him, or because I didn\u2019t get to drink his life.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He rushes for me and places my face between his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>I suck back the tears, but they keep fighting their way out. \u201cHow do you know it will, though? Because, right now, everything feels incredibly wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it does.\u201d His eyes are full of warmth and compassion. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you. I\u2019ll make sure everything is okay.\u201d</p><p>I nod, feeling the guilt build, like bricks, and crush me from the inside. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t ever need to thank me,\u201d he says with sincerity and then leans in to give me a quick kiss on the lips before pulling away. \u201cNow, how about I show you how to put your wings away and then we\u2019ll work on flying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where will we go if I can fly?\u201d I ask. \u201cI thought you said I was safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cBut maybe we\u2019ll fly to New York if we half to.\u201d He gives me a sad half-smile. \u201cThe possibilities are endless really, but I want to make sure you\u2019re prepared just in case something happens.\u201d</p><p>I nod, a little relieved. Not just because of what he said, but that I managed to pull myself away from my Reaper side and not kill Asher. Yet I can\u2019t help wonder how long I can fight it. How long do I honestly have until my true side comes out?</p><p>And which side will be my true side? </p> </body></html>"]
