I just wanted to kiss her, but that\u2019s all I\u2019d done the first time, and my intent wasn\u2019t, apparently, as obvious as I\u2019d thought. Emma needed words. Declarations. We were more similar than I\u2019d given us credit for, and I trusted in that knowledge and gave them to her. \u201cI haven\u2019t wanted anyone but you since the night we met. And as much as I value our friendship... being friends with you is not what I have in mind.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and her breath caught as I slid my knuckles across the soft skin of her jaw, curled my fingers and cupped her chin in my hand. When I leaned my face to hers, her eyelids fluttered closed, and in that seemingly trivial movement I felt her surrender and acceptance. That was the turning point, the precise split second when I knew.</p> <p>I forced myself to go slow, inhaling the emotion behind her response as decidedly as I inhaled her sweet breath. My tongue skimmed her lower lip, tasting her gently while I reminded myself repeatedly that I could not press her to the corner of the booth, that I could not pull her beneath me and unleash every pent-up desire I\u2019d held in check for months.</p><p>Very little of my restraint had to do with the fact that we were in a public place. I\u2019d never been so uncaring of that fact, to tell the truth.</p><p>The kiss in her room the night before had almost broken me, but I\u2019m practiced in denying myself what I know I can\u2019t have. She was having none of my caution this morning. Her hands twisting in my t-shirt, she opened her mouth, cracking my control like a hammer against glass. I kissed her deeply, my mind going fuzzy and refusing to allow my logical side any say whatsoever. She curled into me\u2014I don\u2019t even know how\u2014just that we were suddenly a knot of torsos and limbs, her knees pulled up and folded against my side, my arms around her, one hand at her nape and the other pressing her lower back as though it was possible for us to be closer.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>My only thought was more of a feeling than a conscious deliberation: Mine. Mine. Mine.</p> <p>We broke the kiss to breathe, and I hated that I needed air at all. Exploring her mouth was so much better than breathing. I rested my forehead against hers, both of us panting like we used to at the end of an uphill sprint. Our daily runs in Austin were a lifetime ago\u2014those weeks I thought she belonged to Reid Alexander, or soon would. My fears and insecurities pressed into the space between us as I watched her eyes open and focus slowly. I wondered then, if she pulled away, if I could take it. If I could survive losing her again.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d she said, blinking her gray-green eyes, and I almost laughed with relief. That non-word of hers was a code I knew by heart, and when she uttered it in that moment it was an unguarded secret set of instructions I knew how to follow. And follow it I did.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I\u2019d prefer you keep that particular habit after all,\u201d I told her before I pulled her closer and kissed her again.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>I was sure I would never love anyone as much as I loved Zoe.</p> <p>Something about first love defies duplication. Before it, your heart is blank. Unwritten. After, the walls are left inscribed and graffitied. When it ends, no amount of scrubbing will purge the scrawled oaths and sketched images, but sooner or later, you find that there\u2019s space for someone else, between the words and in the margins.</p><p>I accepted some time ago that for me, that someone else was my daughter, Cara. The conclusion seemed reasonable at the time. She was the only tangible thing that survived that tumultuous relationship, and the only piece of Zoe I was allowed to keep in the end.</p><p>I called Zoe the day after she told me it was over to ask her why, and what I\u2019d done, and if I could do something, anything to win her back. I thought we were in love\u2014that whatever it was that made her end it, I could fix. Neither of us knew yet that she was pregnant.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to make me feel bad?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis is hard for me, too.\u201d</p><p>I took a controlled breath. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem that way.\u201d Earlier that day I\u2019d passed her in the hall as she leaned against her locker, flirting with a couple of our classmates, guys whom summer had turned into men. The same couldn\u2019t be said for me. Though Zoe and I were both seniors, she was more than a year older. My summer birthday and the skipped grade in elementary school meant I\u2019d only been sixteen for four months. I wouldn\u2019t turn seventeen until a couple of weeks after graduation.</p><p>She huffed an exaggerated sigh. \u201cJeez, Graham\u2014I\u2019m in fourth-year theatre, you know. I can act like I\u2019m fine when I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>No way was she acting when Ross Stewart, varsity wrestling team hero, made some teasing comment and she giggled up at him, batting her lashes, her small hand on his ham of a forearm. It had been less than twenty-four hours since our breakup. I was hoarse from crying for half the night, and she was smiling and flirting, her eyes as bright blue as always.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do, Zoe? Did I do something wrong? If you\u2019ll just talk to me, tell me what you need me to do\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGraham, there\u2019s nothing you can do. I\u2019m just not, you know, attracted to you anymore. This decision is about me and my feelings. Not you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not attracted to you anymore sure sounded like it was about me. I felt as if she\u2019d kicked me through the phone. Zoe had been my first everything, though I hadn\u2019t been hers\u2014a fact that had never bothered me. I\u2019d been a willing enough pupil, and despite our arguments and a multitude of misunderstandings, I thought we were good together. Right up until she broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cIs there someone else?\u201d I don\u2019t know what I expected when I asked. Maybe that she\u2019d deny it immediately. She was silent for too long on the other end. I could feel her deliberating. \u201cShit, Zoe,\u201d I whispered, my voice breaking due to the overnight crying bender.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Graham. But I don\u2019t want to talk about this with you anymore. I can\u2019t help how I feel... or don\u2019t feel. I never meant to hurt you, but you and me are over now. You\u2019re gonna have to accept it.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t talk to her for a couple of weeks after that, though I saw her around at school. While our breakup was out-of-left-field and excruciating for me, it was liberating but awkward for her. I only knew the awkward part because her friends Mia and Taylor told me that the reason she changed her routes between classes and started going off campus for lunch every day was because watching me mope was such a downer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moping. I mean sure, I\u2019m kind of depressed\u2014I wasn\u2019t expecting this. I can\u2019t just become resigned to it overnight.\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s been like two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Taylor shrugged one bony shoulder, screwing her mouth up in the no-big-deal smirk she was fond of making. \u201cYou really need to move past it already, Graham. Zoe has.\u201d</p><p>I stared at them, bewildered. \u201cShe did the breaking up. She was probably moving past it when she did it. I haven\u2019t had time to acclimate to being so expendable. I can\u2019t just snap out of it like the past year meant nothing.\u201d</p><p>Even though that\u2019s exactly what Zoe had done.</p><p>\u201cGraham and his I\u2019m-a-genius vocab,\u201d Mia mumbled, just loud enough for me to hear as they walked away.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Taylor agreed.</p><p>When Emma kissed me last night, right before I bolted from her hotel room, I recognized a resurgence of the yearning I\u2019d felt for her the whole time we were in Austin. I thought I\u2019d conquered it, because she wasn\u2019t possible\u2014for so many reasons.</p><p>For one, she\u2019s young\u2014eighteen now, seventeen when I met her. She carries herself with a maturity that belies her age, though, and once I knew her better, I knew why that was. With a deceased mother and an emotionally absent father, she\u2019d been parenting herself for years. But I couldn\u2019t forget that behind that mask of maturity was a girl who\u2019d fallen for Reid Alexander, king of the Hollywood douchebags. I had pushed her into the friend box in my head and held her there forcibly. I couldn\u2019t fall for a girl who\u2019d fall for Reid\u2014reason number two.</p><p>Reason number three\u2014she lives on the opposite coast, though my subconscious mind (okay, fine, my completely conscious mind) did everything imaginable to change that fact. Once we started talking about college and her desire to act on the stage instead of in front of a camera, it made sense to suggest universities and conservatories in New York. That\u2019s what I told myself, while thoughts of her being that near, all the time, buzzed feverishly through my head.</p><p>Finally, reason number four\u2014I don\u2019t share Cara with anyone but family and a couple of very close friends. Her existence is unknown to the world at large, though that won\u2019t be true for long. When Emma ran into us at the coffee shop yesterday and interacted with Cara, that part of my wall began to fall.</p><p>Our kiss last night all but detonated the rest of it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d I say now, glancing at my watch before tossing bills onto the table and taking her hand. \u201cWhat time is your flight?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes don\u2019t waver from mine as I pull her from the booth. \u201cNoon.\u201d Holding her hand as tightly as she\u2019s holding mine, I lead her through the caf\u00e9 to the exit, a riot of thoughts whirlpooling in my brain. Soon, she and her dad have to leave for the airport, where they\u2019ll board a plane for Sacramento. Suddenly, the end of August is intolerably far away.</p><p>The first time I saw Emma was almost eight months ago. Leaving my hotel room to talk Brooke down from a freak-out over seeing Reid for the first time in years, I noticed Emma, slipping a key card into her hotel room door. Small and slim, surrounded by luggage, she glanced up as my gaze scanned over her, blinking her beautiful green eyes. I smiled, instantly curious who she was. I was on a Brooke-support mission, though, with no time to stop and chat with beautiful strangers.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, feeling like a dork. What kind of guy comes out of his hotel room wearing pajamas and says hey to some random girl in the hall right before entering another girl\u2019s room?</p><p>Two nights later, we finally met after the first cast outing. I recognized her in the club, talking with MiShaun and dancing with some of our costars, but Brooke kept me close until it became clear that Reid intended to ignore her completely. On a smoking break outside, I spotted Emma waiting for a taxi back to the hotel, and on a whim, I asked to share her cab. Brooke was ticked that I just left her there, but I couldn\u2019t be sorry.</p><p>I lay in my bed that night tasting the sound of her name on my tongue\u2014Emma.</p><p>We began running in the mornings and we hung out alone a couple of times, talking, while I weighed her involvement with Reid. I was patient and cautious until the morning I sat next to her on a covered picnic table, soaking wet, waiting for the rain to lighten up so we could finish our run. As we sat there small-talking, another conversation was taking place under the surface.</p><p>Her ponytail dripped down her back, her thin t-shirt clinging like a second skin, and she smelled incredible. One loose strand of hair snaked across her cheek and clung to the corner of her lip, and I think I almost stopped breathing, staring at it. I reached to move it behind her ear, thinking don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t kiss her. Followed by kiss her, kiss her, you idiot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I congratulated myself on following the former and ignoring the latter.</p><p>Until I walked out of Brooke\u2019s room that night (another Reid-related panic attack) to see Emma leaving my door and sprinting to her room like she didn\u2019t want me to see her. I had two choices: go to my room and beat my head on the wall, or knock on her door and try to mitigate the damages of her having witnessed me leaving Brooke\u2019s room late at night.</p><p>I knew the best case scenario for keeping Emma at arm\u2019s length was to let her assume Brooke and I were involved. She was already halfway there; all I had to do was nothing. Then the image of her upturned face that morning flashed across my mind\u2019s eye, and my memory conjured the smell of the rain on her skin and in her hair. I considered the easy rapport we\u2019d established, and the comfort I felt when she was near. In a fit of unprecedented impulsiveness, I was at her door inviting myself in, and before I left her room I\u2019d held her and kissed her and fallen so hard that I was happy to be broken into bits.</p><p>24 hours later: Emma and Reid\u2019s kiss-seen-around-the-world. The kiss that occurred the night after my daughter was rushed to the hospital, unable to breathe. The night I\u2019d stoically accepted a blistering lecture from Mom about my smoking and Cara\u2019s asthma, incredulous at the timing of Emma\u2019s big plan to help me quit. That night, shot through the concern for my daughter, was the anticipation of returning to the first girl I\u2019d fallen for since Zoe.</p> <p>And then Brooke texted me the photo from the concert\u2014the same photo that ended up on multiple gossip sites the next day, though she swore she only sent it to \u201ca couple of trusted friends.\u201d I didn\u2019t chastise her, not really, though I was disappointed that she\u2019d be so careless. Her defense was that Reid and Emma had kissed in public, and anyone could have taken a photo of them.</p><p>\u201cAnyone didn\u2019t, though\u2014you did,\u201d I said.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThe point isn\u2019t the picture. The point is the kiss.\u201d</p><p>She was right. For me, the point was the kiss.</p><p>Now, we have less than three hours together, and we\u2019re on the street and I\u2019m remembering belatedly how freaking cold it is, along with the fact that I was in such a fog this morning that I forgot to grab a jacket when I left the house. I glance down at her, hunched and shivering in her thin sweater. Nestling her against my side, I point to a subway entrance. \u201cIt\u2019s warmer underground, I think.\u201d We head for the descending stairs and hop on the R. The view from the bridge into Brooklyn can make you fall in love with New York, if you haven\u2019t already.</p> <p>Once we\u2019re seated in the sparsely occupied car, Emma leans her head on my shoulder, our arms entwined and hands tightly clasped on my knee. I don\u2019t think we even let go for the turnstile. \u201cLet\u2019s play Truth or Dare,\u201d I say, \u201cbut without the Dare.\u201d</p><p>Her brows elevate. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t a games sort of guy.\u201d</p><p>I smile down at her. \u201cI did say that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d She nods. \u201cAll right, then. Let\u2019s not call it a game. Let\u2019s just call it getting the hard questions out of the way, because I know we both have them. You can go first. Ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>She chews her lip, staring into my eyes. \u201cOkay... Why did you kiss me in Austin?\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly and she frowns. \u201cSorry. That one\u2019s too easy.\u201d My gaze flicks to her mouth and back. \u201cI\u2019d wanted to kiss you ever since Quinton suggested playing spin the bottle, and by that night in your room, I\u2019d run out of the willpower to fight it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I place my fingers over her lips and shake my head. \u201cNuh-uh. My turn.\u201d When I slide my fingers across her mouth, she parts her lips. I want to kiss her again, but if I start, I suspect I\u2019m not going to stop, and we need this talk. I\u2019d rather spend the next month dreaming about kissing her than worrying over questions never asked or answered.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kiss Reid the day after you kissed me?\u201d I\u2019ve pulled no punches. This is the sorest point I\u2019ve got, and I want it behind us.</p><p>She takes a deep breath, staring at our intertwined hands. It\u2019s a full minute before she speaks. \u201cWhen I went to Austin, I thought he was what I wanted.\u201d She checks my reaction, and I urge her to go on with a slight nod. \u201cI was wrong. I just... didn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d Her eyes fill and her voice is uneven. \u201cI know that\u2019s not good enough.\u201d</p><p>Fingers below her chin, I tip her face up so I can look into her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth, so it\u2019s good enough. Did you... love him?\u201d</p><p>Sniffling, she shakes her head, setting a finger over my lips. \u201cNuh-uh,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201d When I frown, she laughs, and a tear escapes the corner of her eye. She dashes it away with the back of her hand. \u201cBut no, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Squashing the urge to beat my chest like a Neanderthal, I pull her closer and inhale her scent, so familiar, even these months later. My voice drops. \u201cCan I kiss you now?\u201d</p><p>Her expression turns coy. \u201cGraham, that\u2019s three questions in a row. I\u2019m starting to think you don\u2019t understand the concept of taking turns.\u201d</p><p>To hell with questions. We can talk on the phone. I can\u2019t kiss her long-distance. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll give you your turn, Emma.\u201d Closing the small space between us, I slide my hand behind her neck and touch my lips to hers. She presses closer\u2014warm lips, sweet breath, soft fingertips drifting down the side of my face as we kiss.</p> <p>Up to this point, we\u2019ve been ignoring the small number of fellow passengers entering and exiting as we move down the line, stopping every few minutes. And then the train squeals to a stop, and three dozen loud, matching-t-shirt-wearing middle schoolers and their harried chaperones crowd into our car. A small pack of girls stare at Emma and me unabashedly, like we\u2019re on a screen and not real people. Whispering behind their hands, their eyes wide, their attention swings between us and the group of boys who plop onto the adjacent seat and proceed to make fart noises with a weirdly impressive array of body parts.</p><p>So much for that kiss.</p><p>Emma</p><p>I thought of Graham a dozen times since we arrived in New York, chiding myself when my focus lingered on some tall, dark-haired guy standing hands-in-pockets at a deli counter, or crossing quickly at an intersection, or smoking in a courtyard.</p><p>Graham quit smoking months ago, of course.</p><p>More to the point, though\u2014what was the likelihood I\u2019d just happen upon Graham in a city this enormous? I felt silly for even considering it a possibility. And then\u2014there he was, sitting in a coffee shop on MacDougal. With his daughter.</p><p>\u201cSo, Cara is four?\u201d I ask, taking my turn.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll actually be four in a couple of months,\u201d he says, leaning close, his breath warm in my ear. \u201cRight after my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon is so immature,\u201d one of the girls across the aisle declares to the others. They all nod and level disdainful looks on the boy responsible for the majority of rude noises.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I do?\u201d he says, palms up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>One of the other boys offers, \u201cBitches, man,\u201d and a fist bump in consolation, and they all howl with laughter while the girls huff and refuse to look openly at them again.</p><p>Graham and I stare at each other, our eyes tearing and lips compressed in an effort to remain outwardly indifferent. \u201cI would be willing to swear I was never a preteen boy,\u201d he says, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like denial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s my story.\u201d His eyes dance. \u201cNext question: Are you seeing anyone now?\u201d</p><p>Emily set me up with several guys during the past few months\u2014dinner, movies, ballet, bowling. Each one was perfectly nice, but I didn\u2019t feel a connection with any of them. Then, during the community theatre production of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life over the holidays, I met Marcus. He\u2019d already been accepted early-decision to Pace, and was elated at the possibility of us both starting college in New York in the fall. Since December, we\u2019ve been out multiple times. I saw him last weekend. We\u2019re supposed to hang out tonight when I get home. And... I agreed to go to his small private school\u2019s prom next weekend.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Not the quick refusal I was hoping for,\u201d Graham says, his thumb moving hypnotically over the back of my hand. \u201cShould I plan to follow you home and challenge some guy to a duel?\u201d In his eyes, I see the teasing and the sincerity behind his words. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a horribly possessive guy, Emma, and I know this is all sudden and unforeseen for both of us. But watching you with Reid was almost more than I could take. I don\u2019t think my heart can tolerate sharing you again. You\u2019re free to make your own decision, of course. But I have to be allowed to make mine, too.\u201d</p><p>I hate the thought of hurting Marcus. He\u2019s been patient, never grilling me about my well-known failed liaison with Reid Alexander. When I came back home after the School Pride photo shoot last month, Marcus maintained his cheerful disposition while I pulled myself through a delayed depression over the whole Reid debacle and came to grips with the fact that I still cared for Graham and felt his absence, though whatever was between us in Austin was long gone.</p><p>Except now, suddenly, it\u2019s not gone. And Graham is sitting here next to me, waiting for me to tell him I want him.</p><p>\u201cI have been seeing someone, but it\u2019s not... this.\u201d I swallow, hard, hoping he\u2019ll give me the time to be compassionate. \u201cI\u2019ll end it when I get back home.\u201d When he exhales, I realize he was holding his breath. \u201cBut... I did promise to go to his prom next weekend.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirk and he watches me closely. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head slightly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His forearm flexes as he brings our interlaced hands up, rotating his arm and kissing the back of my hand. \u201cThen I guess there\u2019s no reason to begrudge some poor guy his prom date.\u201d</p><p>The knot of girls across the car sighs audibly, and I think one of them just took our picture with her phone. It\u2019s possible that they know who we are. School Pride doesn\u2019t come out until next month, though the media blitz has begun. Or maybe they\u2019re just starry-eyed girls, and the two of us tangled up in each other on the subway is classic NYC romantic\u2014which makes me think of Emily. I\u2019m going to have a lot to tell her when I get home.</p><p>\u201cAre you, you know, seeing anyone?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his dark eyes intense despite the half-smile on his lips. \u201cI passed the point of being willing to settle a long time ago. If I\u2019m not fiercely inclined, I don\u2019t bother.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together, but they kick up on one side. It isn\u2019t really fair, that I\u2019m happy to have no competition for his attention while he trusts me to go home, go to prom with some faceless boy and then kick him to the curb.</p><p>The preteens reach their stop, and the noise escalates to something resembling the running of the bulls as the chaperones attempt to make sure every single one of them makes it off the subway before it pulls away. It\u2019s so quiet once they exit that I can hear my own breathing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Graham leans closer. \u201cHow is it that I\u2019ve survived seeing you only once in the past five months, and now the thought of being separated from you for four months seems insane?\u201d</p><p>I lean my cheek onto his shoulder, caught up in his penetrating gaze. \u201cThe premiere is next month.

I\u2019ll be at the premiere, of course, but most of those other appearances will just be the two of you.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, I\u2019d not considered this possibility. \u201cHuh,\u201d I say, and Graham chuckles.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>Telling her I\u2019m not possessive isn\u2019t technically a lie... but it\u2019s not completely true, either, particularly where Reid Alexander is concerned. After watching how he managed to win Emma\u2019s trust last fall\u2014even if he blew it shortly thereafter\u2014I have a grudging respect for his ability to play charming. The truth is, he is charming. That part of his persona isn\u2019t faked. He\u2019s just too selfish and immature to care about the bodies he leaves in his wake. Literally.</p><p>I\u2019m ninety-nine percent certain Emma won\u2019t fall for his fa\u00e7ade again, but that one percent of insecurity nags at the back of my mind. Raised by a feminist, I learned early to resist the urge to go all alpha-male. But after years of disliking Reid on Brooke\u2019s behalf, followed by a desire to pound the shit out of him for hurting Emma, an uncharacteristic longing to claim and protect her surges through me, telling me I may have to man up.</p><p>\u201cGraham?\u201d</p> <p>I glance down at her worried face, gathering from her expression that I\u2019m scowling. \u201cI hate the thought of you spending time with him.\u201d God. If my mother or sisters heard me say this, I\u2019d never hear the end of it.</p><p>Emma looks surprised, her head angling as she reveals a slow smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be jealous of Reid, you know.\u201d</p><p>I grimace in return. \u201cI guess I sort of don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She stares at our clasped hands, dragging the tips of her fingers over my forearm, and I\u2019m immediately wishing we were somewhere more private. \u201cLast month, he talked to me after the photo shoot wrapped up. He told me wanted another chance. I don\u2019t know how sincere he was, really\u2014I mean, he\u2019s Reid, so who knows\u2014but he seemed more earnest than he\u2019s ever been.\u201d</p><p>They spoke privately that last night at the hotel, in his room. He caught her hand and held her back as the rest of us poured into the hallway, and I watched from my slightly-ajar door as she left his room minutes later. She was in tears as she pushed open the door to her room, and my feelings were torn. I didn\u2019t want her unhappy, but I was relieved that whatever was said between them hadn\u2019t resulted in a reunion of any sort.</p><p>Reid Alexander has never, that I know of, been good for anyone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he had to say didn\u2019t matter, though,\u201d she continues, peering up at me, \u201cbecause I knew what kind of guy I wanted, even if I was sure I couldn\u2019t have him, per se.\u201d</p><p>I kiss the tip of her nose and laugh softly, shaking my head. \u201cI had no idea. You could clean up as a poker player, Emma. You\u2019ve got no tell.\u201d</p><p>Just then, the train emerges from the ground at the edge of the East River, heading for the Manhattan Bridge, one of several leading into Brooklyn. The sun in our eyes renders the scene semi-blinding, at first. And then, individual beams thread through the buildings lining the opposite bank, reflecting like waves off the skyscrapers behind us and sparkling across the short expanse of water. It\u2019s a magical view, one to which few people are immune. \u201cOh,\u201d Emma says, blinking. I\u2019ve officially begun my plan to dissuade her from ever wanting to leave New York once she moves here.</p><p>My oldest sister, Cassie, is an early riser. If we get off at DeKalb, we can be at her loft in minutes. I pull out my phone and turn Emma\u2019s hand palm down on my leg. I like the sight of it there way too much.</p><p>Me: You up? I want you to meet someone.</p><p>Cas: Now? Are you high? It\u2019s not even 7 am! WHO is this someone???</p><p>Me: Yes and yes and i know and emma</p><p>Cas: THE emma?</p> <p>Me: Yeah</p><p>Cas: But I\u2019m not presentable!</p><p>Me: No worries, she\u2019s not like that</p><p>Cas: If you say so. Doug is still asleep. The baby is up. The baby is always up. I\u2019m looking forward to sleeping again someday. I vaguely remember sleep...</p><p>Me: Haha, sorry cas. See you in a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see my sister.\u201d</p><p>Alarm flashes across Emma\u2019s face, her eyes widening. \u201cWhat\u2014now?\u201d</p><p>I have to laugh, since Cassie had the same response. \u201cShe lives just over the bridge. I want her to meet you. You\u2019ll love her.\u201d I shove the phone back into the pocket of my jeans and pull the hand she\u2019s pressing against her chest into my lap. I haven\u2019t felt this impulsive in years, which is pretty damned tragic considering the fact that I\u2019m not even twenty-one yet. Feeling older than my age is a common enough sensation for me, but early fatherhood will do that.</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet the remainder of the way, each lost in our own thoughts. I know it\u2019s ageist to assume that Emma will have a difficult time handling the fact that I have a child. But fatherhood is the reason I don\u2019t date, the reason I hesitate to form romantic relationships. I didn\u2019t mean to imply that I\u2019ve been celibate, though I may have given Emma precisely that impression. I\u2019m not sure how to clear that up without an awkward conversation\u2014one that can definitely wait.</p><p>My sisters have been supportive about pushing me to get out and lead as close to a normal life as possible, especially Cassie. Brynn is nearer to me in age\u2014four years older, but I\u2019m closer to Cassie\u2014six years my senior. She\u2019s the one I always turned to when interactions with my peers went sour, as they often did. The combination of being more academically driven and younger than all of my classmates was bad enough. Add being something of a smartass, and that equaled very few friends. Cassie\u2019s artistic nature gave her more of an understanding of my sensitivity than our professor-parents could comprehend.</p><p>In their early twenties when their barely seventeen-year-old brother became a parent, neither of my sisters envied me the title. But Cassie volunteered to take Cara home overnight once a week, leaving me free to go out like a normal teenager, and she and our parents began taking turns watching her once I was getting film roles regularly.</p><p>University life at Columbia was immediately less intimate than my small preparatory high school, and I could easily lose myself amongst the undergrad population. Living uptown with my parents rather than on campus negated anyone\u2019s expectation to go home with me for the night. Whenever Cassie had Cara, I stayed over in dorms or apartments of friends who knew little about me, or girls who never knew more than my name and major, and sometimes not even that much.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Emma asks, probably anxious over meeting my sister while I\u2019m worrying too soon over whether or not she can deal with my parental status.</p><p>\u201cHmm? Oh. Nothing important.\u201d I untangle my hand from hers and slide my arm behind her, pulling her to my side. \u201cFYI, Cassie already likes you.\u201d Her expression becomes more alarmed rather than less. Uh-oh. \u201cEr, I talked to her about you while we were filming.\u201d Better not to disclose that it was more than once, I think.</p><p>\u201cWhat was there for her to like about me? Wouldn\u2019t she have been outraged on your behalf?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. She\u2019ll understand when she meets Cassie. \u201cNo, she blamed ninety percent of the end result on me and the other ten percent on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Emma says, and I can\u2019t make any answer to that other than to lean down and kiss her.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s our stop,\u201d I say once I break regretfully from her lips, having managed to distract her for a few minutes. There are reasons I\u2019m usually not impetuous, and one of them has to do with sucking at it. The only thing I had in mind when we got on the subway was warmth and that amazing view\u2014one that can only be topped by the view on the way back. Visiting Cassie was full-fledged spontaneity.</p><p>Now that I\u2019m thinking more clearly, dragging Emma to meet my sister less than two hours after declaring ourselves might be well past spontaneous and well on the way to unreasonable. Shit.</p><p>Emma</p><p>I can\u2019t believe Graham is taking me to meet his sister this early on a Saturday morning. Within minutes of emerging onto the street, we\u2019re standing in front of her building, and I reason that at least the anxiety didn\u2019t have time to mount high enough to knock me flat.</p><p>Graham pushes a button on the speaker, and right away a woman\u2019s teasing voice says, \u201cWho the hell\u2019s buzzing me at seven o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Cas,\u201d Graham says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cGraham, you\u2019ve always been a pain in the butt. You know that, right?\u201d The speaker buzzes as the lock clicks on the door.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been saying for twenty years or so,\u201d he answers, pulling open the heavy metal door and ushering me inside a tiny lobby\u2014one wall lined with mailboxes and the other housing a single elevator. When Graham pushes the button, the doors part sluggishly, as though someone is cranking them open by hand. \u201cShe\u2019s on the third floor.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes tell me he has ideas in mind for the ascent, but when the doors close behind us, he merely takes my hand, his focus alternating between the ancient checkered floor and the very slowly shifting numbers above the door. As the claustrophobic car finally comes to a stop, he squeezes my hand and gives me one quick kiss.</p><p>We step into a five-by-five foot vestibule, and he knocks lightly on one of two doors. Multiple bolts slide, and my stomach drops to my knees just before the door opens to a smiling, female version of Graham, wearing sweats and holding a tiny baby. \u201cTake this,\u201d she says to Graham, handing the baby off in an effortless transfer. She sticks out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Cassie. You must be Emma.\u201d When I take her hand, she smoothly pulls me into the apartment behind Graham, who heads towards the living space in the center of the roomy loft, talking to the baby in his natural voice, as though it\u2019s a very small man and not an infant.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cGraham, I know you want coffee,\u201d Cassie says, heading through the room to the open kitchen on the opposite end. \u201cEmma? Coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, following her after a brief look back at Graham, who flashes me a smile. His dark eyes drink me in while I do the same to him. The sensation is surreal, that no part of him is off-limits to my imagination now\u2014from his full lips to his wide shoulders to the hands cradling the baby in the crook of one arm.</p><p>Suddenly this is all moving too quickly, but before I can work up a good panic, my phone vibrates in my front pocket. At my twitch and yelp, Cassie glances back, one brow arched on her pretty, makeup-free face. When I pull the phone from my pocket, my father\u2019s picture smiles up from the display.</p><p>\u201cHi Dad.\u201d I left a note telling him I was meeting Graham in the caf\u00e9. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEmma, where are you?\u201d He\u2019s not quite frantic, but not calm, either.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you find my note? Under your glasses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019m in the caf\u00e9\u2014where you, by the way, are not.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cUm, Graham and I decided to take a walk, and then we got on the subway because it\u2019s a little chilly out... and now we\u2019re in Brooklyn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrooklyn?\u201d he yells, his voice piercing, and Graham and Cassie both glance at my phone and then at each other from opposite ends of the huge space.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at his sister\u2019s loft,\u201d I smile at her in what I hope is a reassuring manner, \u201chaving coffee.\u201d</p><p>He tries for a mildly concerned tone. \u201cEmma, our flight is at noon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d he sighs, and I imagine him rubbing his hand over his face in that way he does when he\u2019s frustrated. We\u2019ve grown closer over the past six months, but he missed his chance to be the monitoring parent years ago and he knows it. \u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen do you want to leave for the airport?\u201d I hedge.</p><p>\u201cNine-thirty?\u201d</p><p>Last night and last month and last fall I wanted nothing more than to hear Graham tell me he wanted me, and now, he has. Suddenly aware that we will say goodbye in less than two hours, the whole thing feels hopelessly muddled and complicated.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad, sorry. I\u2019ll be back in time to pack up.\u201d My throat tightens with the realization that it could be more than a month before I see Graham again.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>He sighs again. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, sweetheart. I can tell you can\u2019t talk now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Cassie is a cellist with the New York Symphony, on a short leave of absence at the moment to be a full-time mother. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let my little brother show me up on the parenting front,\u201d she smirks, watching as Graham makes faces at the baby, whose name is Caleb.</p><p>Gesturing to a barstool, she moves to the opposite side of the granite-slabbed counter while I examine the loft. Wood cut-outs, iron sculptures, paintings, prints and mixed media arrangements hang on the rough brick walls, along with two bicycles. An upright bass and a cello flank the undivided windows and floor-to-ceiling shelves house tons of books and photos. The loft is casual and cozy.</p><p>My stepmother, Chloe, would hate this place. I love it.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to New York, Emma?\u201d Cassie asks, pouring coffee into three mugs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with my dad, choosing a college.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes flick across the room and back and she smiles. \u201cAre you? So you\u2019ll be moving to New York in the fall?\u201d I nod and her smile widens. \u201cI\u2019m sure my brother is happy about that.\u201d</p><p>I wonder what, exactly, Graham has told her about me. As though I\u2019d posed this question aloud, she leans onto her elbows and lowers her voice. \u201cHe likes you a lot, you know.\u201d My face warms, but she doesn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t butt in, but he\u2019s too damned reserved, and if one of you doesn\u2019t exhibit some daring, this whole thing will be one big missed opportunity.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cWe\u2019ve already, um, talked about things this morning...\u201d I say, and she slaps a hand on the counter.</p><p>\u201cWell thank God. It\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s about time?\u201d Graham\u2019s voice is right behind me. He takes a seat on the stool next to me.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s brows rise and she gives him a haughty stare. \u201cIf we wanted you to be part of this conversation, we\u2019d have been talking louder.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, and Caleb coos up at him. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll just wheedle it out of Emma later.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>She\u2019s quiet on the return trip. We both are. For all of our earlier give-and-take, there\u2019s only one issue on my mind now: the 2500 miles between us for the next four months. I have three more weeks of class before graduation. The premiere of School Pride is in LA the following week, with the associated whirlwind of red carpets and cast parties and Hollywood in its usual circus atmosphere. Mid-summer, I\u2019ll begin filming my next movie here in New York. It\u2019s a low-budget indie, which means fast and cheap and long hours with no time to fly to LA for a weekend.</p><p>Cassie loaned us hoodies, so we don\u2019t have to huddle together for warmth, but I hold Emma\u2019s hand, fingers laced, and she presses her thigh against mine and leans her head against my shoulder. Sighing, she stares out at the Manhattan Bridge view that keeps me from ever wanting to live anywhere but New York. The high-rise windows are thousands of tiny mirrors from this distance, the skyline lit in waves like a sun-drenched waterfall as rays strike each building. I wish I could hit replay on this five-minute span of time; it might be enough to tide me over for a while. But we reach the other side of the river and plunge underground, the fluorescent lighting casting everything with a sickly green tint.</p><p>Between the later hour and the hoodies, we won\u2019t freeze now, walking around. There\u2019s plenty to see in SoHo, even this early in the morning. Peering into wide-windowed galleries and tiny shops, we maneuver our way around street vendors setting up for the day\u2014crowding onto the edges of sidewalks that will be jammed with people in an hour or two. Emma and I hunch together as though we live here and we\u2019re just out getting breakfast, and I realize that this is what scares the hell out of me\u2014I already want that with her. I want to be with her, absorb her into my life and have her absorb me into hers.</p><p>A conversation I had with Cassie years ago, soon after Zoe and I broke up, pushes into my consciousness. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what girls want,\u201d I told her. From what I could tell, girls acted like they wanted declarations of undying love, but once they got them, those confessions were taken for granted. That, or you were rejected for being too clingy, dependent, or insecure\u2014all words Zoe tossed out during the week leading up to the breakup.</p><p>\u201cGirls expect you to love them forever, and they say they feel the same, but they really mean until I get bored with you.\u201d I was well on my way to becoming a very bitter sixteen-year-old boy.</p><p>Cassie was twenty-two, and had been through her share of relationships by that point. She\u2019d not yet met Doug, and wouldn\u2019t for another three years and one more failed relationship. Sitting at her kitchen table in the tiny walkup she shared with two other girls, we faced a window overlooking a courtyard of dead grass and gravel. The remainder of the view consisted of an adjacent, equally dilapidated building and no sky at all.</p><p>\u201cGraham, not all girls will be like that.\u201d</p><p>Torn between despair and hope, I said, \u201cHmph,\u201d and gulped from the soda can she handed me when I sat down. She grabbed my hand, wanting to fix everything for me, I know, but she was as powerless to remedy what had happened as I was. The combination of her commiseration and another wave of Zoe thoughts made my throat ache. Yanking my hand from beneath hers, I stared out the viewless window. I didn\u2019t want to cry over Zoe anymore. I wanted to be angry. Anger was so much easier to work with.</p><p>Cassie sighed. \u201cSomeday, you\u2019ll find a girl who can handle the intense way you love. Who isn\u2019t intimidated by it\u2014because that\u2019s what this is. Zoe can\u2019t feel this profoundly about anything or anyone. She\u2019s shallow and self-centered. And she\u2019s blown the chance at a wonderful guy.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t believed her, of course\u2014that I\u2019d find a girl like that, someone other than Zoe.</p><p>I still didn\u2019t quite believe it last night, when Emma kissed me, and everything I\u2019d dreamed of with her flashed before my eyes.</p><p>Now, I\u2019m visualizing us walking these streets together, alone or with Cara between us. I picture her sleeping in my bed. I imagine her accompanying me on location during breaks from school. Then everything speeds up and I watch her walk across a stage to accept her diploma. I see myself sliding a ring on her finger and promising her eternity and lifting a veil and kissing her.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t sent that text at 2 a.m. last night, I might have let her go. I might have never confessed how I felt about her. I was so afraid of wanting too much that I couldn\u2019t trust her handing me a shot at getting it. I don\u2019t want to be that senselessly fearful ever again.</p><p>Our outer hands shoved into our respective hoodie pockets, I hold Emma\u2019s left hand in my right, deep inside my pocket. We end up on a bench in front of her hotel, the minutes ticking away, nothing to be done but let them fall until she\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d she says, just as I was going to ask if taking her to meet Cassie was too uncomfortable for her. Too much, too soon.</p><p>I swallow my question and answer hers. \u201cNow, we run up the minutes on our cell phones and we text, and Skype, and in less than five weeks, I\u2019ll be in LA and so will you.\u201d Then I realize that I\u2019m not sure if she means now, this second, or now, this point in our newly established relationship. She chews her lip, and I say, \u201cIf all you meant was what are we doing for the next half hour, please don\u2019t tell me, because I\u2019ll feel like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good with the five week plan.\u201d</p><p>What about a five year plan? I think. But instead of voicing that, I take her face in my hands and kiss her.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Dad sleeps during the flight. I try to read but can\u2019t concentrate, so I end up reading and rereading the same passages until it\u2019s just ridiculous and I give up and stare out at the blue sky. The cottony clouds below us come in transient batches, alternatively showing and obscuring the miles and miles of nothing, towns and cities popping up occasionally and disappearing before I can begin to guess where we are.</p><p>Every mile takes me farther from Graham.</p><p>And every mile makes me less sure that what happened between us actually happened. It\u2019s like a dream. All of it. I tried to explain to Dad what had taken place\u2014the share-with-your-parent version, of course. I didn\u2019t tell him Graham came to the hotel last night. Or that I texted him at 2 a.m. But he knows something\u2019s up\u2014more than just meeting a friend for breakfast. He\u2019s given me a couple of sidelong glances I\u2019m probably not supposed to have noticed. He knows that Graham has all of a sudden become significant. I don\u2019t know how to explain myself. I know what I feel; I\u2019m just not sure how to make it sound as sensible as it seems to me.</p><p>I turn it all over in my head. Neither of us said the words, but they hung over our heads like a shared thought bubble: I love you. I can\u2019t reconcile the fact that the words seem both too soon and past due.</p><p>Emily will help me sort it out. Before I left for New York, she asked me if I was falling for Marcus. We\u2019ve gone out together several times, the four of us. Emily\u2019s boyfriend, Derek, is one of those guys who gets along with anyone; so is Marcus, usually. Which makes it all the more odd that they don\u2019t seem to relate to each other. Emily and I have watched the two of them talk, and we decided they\u2019re like polite coworkers, or neighbors who\u2019ve never seen the inside of each other\u2019s houses, and don\u2019t really need to, thanks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We shrugged and said, \u201cBoys,\u201d though it annoyed us both.</p><p>I text her right before takeoff.</p><p>Me: I have news</p><p>Em: You changed your mind and aren\u2019t going to move THOUSANDS of miles away from me?</p> <p>Me: Um.

MILLIONS of people in nyc... and you run into the hunky, mysterious costar with whom you shared a steamy hotel room moment?</p><p>Me: You\u2019re reading those trashy romance novels again, aren\u2019t you</p> <p>Em: I dunno what you\u2019re talking about</p><p>Me: ANYWAY. So graham has a daughter.</p><p>Em: WHAT?!?!?!?</p><p>Me: And also, we\u2019re sort of seeing each other now.</p><p>Em: WHAT?!?!?!?</p><p>Me: Gotta go. Getting the evil eye from flight attendant. Meet me at home at like 3.</p> <p>Em: I\u2019m just... WHAT?!?!?!?</p><p>Two minutes after we land and right after I power it up, my cell is ringing. I\u2019m surprised to see Dan\u2019s name in the display, but he did warn me he\u2019d have School Pride promos set up and we\u2019d discuss them when I returned from my \u201clittle college tour.\u201d I didn\u2019t know he meant we\u2019d talk about them the very minute I got back. My energetic agent is probably on high alert, though I suppose he doesn\u2019t really have any other setting.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, glad you\u2019re back. I have a tentative schedule of interviews, appearances, etcetera for you\u2014Ellen, by the way\u2014woot!\u2014we can go over that in a moment, though, because first I really have to ask\u2014are you absolutely certain about this whole college slash career-killing slash no-more-movies decision? Because I\u2019m getting tons of calls about parts you\u2019d be perfect for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dan. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow hear me out just a moment\u2014the call that came in this morning was actually an action flick and you\u2019d need some personal training to get all badass of course, but hey if Linda Hamilton can do it for The Terminator sequel\u2014oh, I guess that\u2019s before your time, though\u2014\u201d he chuckles and I take that opportunity to try to stop him again.</p><p>\u201cDan, seriously, I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m not interested. But thank you. Really.\u201d</p><p>He sighs in his long-suffering agent manner. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Emma. Killing. Me.\u201d</p> <p>This is not an appropriate time to laugh. Not even if I can picture the exact sad-puppy expression on Dan\u2019s face, which is made funnier by the fact that he\u2019s known in industry circles for being more of a piranha and less of a Bassett hound. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dan.\u201d</p><p>Dad, removing our luggage from the overhead bins, smiles and shakes his head. He knows Dan as well as I do.</p><p>\u201cYadda yadda,\u201d Dan says, which is Dan-speak for you are saying words I don\u2019t like.</p><p>The first interview is in a couple of days, and Graham was right\u2014it\u2019s just Reid and me. This doesn\u2019t really bother me until Dan says, \u201cYou probably know there\u2019s still widespread speculation about the nature of the relationship between you and Reid Alexander\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t really have any re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t feel as though you have to share anything with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan. There\u2019s nothing to share. We\u2019re barely speaking. I mean, I don\u2019t even know if we are speaking...\u201d</p><p>Dad mouths What? and I shrug one shoulder and roll my eyes as we stand in the clogged aisle with our carry-on luggage in hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just keep that to ourselves, shall we? Here\u2019s the deal. The studio wants you two to make nice. You can tell interviewers that there\u2019s nothing going on between you, or leave it open by saying no comment, but you should look as though something could be going on. It\u2019ll be good publicity for the film release if people already love you as a couple.\u201d</p><p>My mouth hangs slightly ajar and I snap it closed as Dad gives me an arch look. I\u2019m acutely aware of the people crammed into the aisle in front of and behind me, waiting to deplane, so I keep my voice low. \u201cAre you\u2014are you saying we should pretend to be together?\u201d I ask, teeth clenched. Oh, hell no. That is not going to work.</p><p>\u201cOf course not! Just don\u2019t pretend not to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no different from pretending we are. Dan, we aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean to say is, just don\u2019t make that an obvious thing.\u201d</p><p>I pinch the bridge of my nose, eyes closed. This is a nightmare. \u201cAs in, the studio wants us to pretend we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay, if you need to put it that way.\u201d At my silence, he adds, \u201cJust give enough of the illusion of the possibility that you could be in love or involved in some delicious little clandestine liaison.\u201d It\u2019s easy to visualize Dan leaning back in his huge leather chair behind his massive desk (which I\u2019ve always suspected had been carved from illegally-obtained rainforest lumber). Headset in place, his elbows resting on the arms of the chair with fingers steepled, he\u2019s swiveled to face the giant plate-glass window overlooking LA. Too many times, I\u2019ve been on the opposite side of his desk, listening in on these short conversations with other actors. \u201cOh and BT-dubs, they just let me know that there\u2019s a photo shoot for People in a week and a half. Whole cast. So clear time for that.\u201d</p><p>My brain skids to a stop. Whole cast. Graham. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere in LA. They\u2019re flying everyone in.\u201d</p><p>The upcoming sham relationship with Reid forgotten for the moment, I focus on the fact that I\u2019ll see Graham next week. As soon as I hang up with Dan, I\u2019m texting him to see if his agent has already given him the news.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Brooke</p><p>I haven\u2019t talked to Graham in a week. Maybe two. His graduation is in three or four weeks. I wonder if I should offer to attend. If he\u2019d want me to. We\u2019ve been friends for four years, and I\u2019ve only interacted with his family a couple of times, when I was in New York. His sisters were kind of snotty. One works on Wall Street, and the other is a classical musician of some sort\u2014a violinist or something else with strings... She plays in the Philharmonic. Or is it the New York Symphony? Same difference.</p><p>I just got word from my manager that there\u2019s going to be a photo shoot for People next week, here in LA. Graham has to come for that. He\u2019s the best-looking guy in the cast, which people might not know if they only see the movie\u2014his character is a flaming nerd. Nothing like the real Graham. Well, I take that back. Graham can be nerdy, but it\u2019s endearing, in that he-still-seems-innocent sort of way. Until you get a load of those gorgeous brown eyes staring into yours and you forget what you were just thinking. Because those eyes are not innocent.</p><p>Shit. Shake it off, Brooke.</p><p>Me: Hey handsome. Heard about the photo shoot next week?</p><p>Graham: Yeah, just heard from emma, and then my agent called and told me.</p><p>Me: I didn\u2019t know you were still in contact with emma.</p><p>Son. Of. A. Bitch. He\u2019s talking to Emma? When the hell did that happen? I\u2019d hoped he\u2019d gotten that little thing he had for her out of his system months ago. He hasn\u2019t mentioned a damned thing about her lately. Plus, there have been intermittent rumors about Emma and Reid hooking up ever since we quit filming, though I suspect that\u2019s all crap\u2014none of them included any new photos.</p><p>Graham: I ran into her yesterday</p><p>Me: Ran into her, like in nyc?</p><p>Graham: Yeah. I had cara with me.</p><p>Me: Oh shit. Did she suspect?</p><p>Graham: I told her. Well actually cara told her, by calling me daddy.</p><p>My brain feels like it\u2019s on speed. He ran into Emma. In New York. When does that ever happen? Okay, time to reassess. Emma finding out about Cara could be a good thing\u2014just another wall between them\u2014her on one side, me on the other. With him. I understand Graham in a way no one else can. I\u2019ve been patient, waiting for him to see what could be between us, and he\u2019s been playing typical clueless guy. Time to step it up. I am not letting Emma back in there.</p><p>Me: Wow, how did that go?</p><p>Graham: Pretty well, actually.</p><p>I wait for more and of course there\u2019s nothing, because in addition to the tall, dark and hot thing Graham\u2019s got going on, he\u2019s also infuriatingly close-mouthed. About everything. I\u2019ve had dozens of conversations with him where I feel like we really communicated. Then later, I realize that nearly everything he contributed was a question or an observation on something I said. That he\u2019d not actually revealed much, if anything.</p><p>Like I said\u2014infuriating. And so frustrating. In that mouth-watering sort of way.</p><p>Me: I guess I\u2019ll see you in less than two weeks, then &lt;3</p><p>Graham: Cool, see you then.</p><p>Decisions, decisions. How to handle this little glitch...</p><p>Two things stood between Graham and Emma getting together during the months on location: Reid\u2019s all-out pursuit of her, and my pretense that something was going on between Graham and me. Graham and Emma are similar in one glaring way\u2014neither of them will stage a shit-fit throw-down territory dispute.</p><p>When Reid kissed Emma during that concert, it was like a freaking miracle. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Hell yes it is. It wasn\u2019t like I set out to hurt Graham. I mean, Emma and Reid were kissing\u2014that was a fact. I was just being protective, sending him that picture. So he\u2019d know what was going on. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better response. He didn\u2019t say another word about her. Before, he\u2019d driven me up the wall with occasional tidbits of Emma-related nonsense.</p><p>Convincing Emma that Graham and I had a thing going was relatively easy. He and I have been friends for so long, and I was in such a state at having to work around Reid after not laying eyes on him in person for years. All I had to do was play up the I\u2019m so fragile act a bit, and the whole freaking cast thought Graham and I were screwing each other.</p><p>I wish.</p><p>Graham made it obvious from the start of our relationship that we could be friends, but he wasn\u2019t interested in anything more. I\u2019ve never been sure why that was. At first, I think he just noticed the desperate way I felt about everything. Right after Reid broke up with me, I was raw. I was needy. I was pissed as hell. I would conclude that all that stuff scared Graham, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true or he wouldn\u2019t have become my friend. It was like he saw my damage and knew instinctively to avoid getting tangled up in it.</p><p>But I\u2019m better now. I know what I want. And what I want is Graham.</p><p>REID</p><p>Brooke: Hey asshole, we need to chat</p><p>Me: Aww, how could i ignore such a sweet appeal? What do you want.</p><p>Brooke: I have a proposition. Come over.</p><p>Me: Not interested. But thanks for thinking of me.</p><p>Brooke: NOT that kind of proposition, you freak. This has to do with Emma.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m both intrigued and suspicious.</p><p>Brooke: Trust me, what i have in mind will benefit us both.</p><p>Me: No way in hell i trust you. But i\u2019m too curious for my own good.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes to convince me to listen to anything further, so spill it.\u201d When she opens the door, I walk in talking. Her apartment is stunning, second only to her. She\u2019s wearing tiny white shorts and a violet halter tank, showcasing her warm skin and sleek blonde hair. My intent is to avoid staring at her directly as much as possible. She\u2019s like Medusa\u2014the most beautiful woman you\u2019ve ever laid eyes on, and also the most personally dangerous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m a little afraid that she\u2019d kill me if she thought she could get away with it.</p><p>I walk into her monochromatic living room, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a view to die for, and drop onto her white leather sofa, letting my head fall back and staring at the ceiling. So far, so not dead. She sits across from me in a black club chair, crossing her perfectly toned legs but not speaking. If she thinks I\u2019m dragging whatever this is out of her, she can think again.</p><p>Finally, she sighs. \u201cI assume that if you thought you could have another shot at Emma, you\u2019d take it?\u201d</p><p>What the hell? \u201cNot really your business, Brooke.\u201d I\u2019m still staring straight up, counting the tiny lights in the track lighting while wondering what scheme has lodged itself in her head.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Reid, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a state secret.\u201d</p><p>I chance looking at her. Her expression is serious, almost fierce. There\u2019s definitely something she wants from me\u2014and me only\u2014because if she could get this from anyone else, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be sitting here now. Playing along is the only way I\u2019ll find out what this is about. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite. Sure, I\u2019d take another shot if I had it. Your turn.\u201d</p><p>The only thing that betrays her is one finger, repeatedly scratching at the seam of her chair. She sits up. \u201cI want Graham.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Fixing me with a mocking smile, she says, \u201cWell apparently, they want each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I knew it. I knew it.</p><p>She laughs, not humored. \u201cHe\u2019s... reserved. It\u2019s hard to tell what\u2014or who\u2014he wants. But they ran into each other in New York a few days ago\u2014where she\u2019s looking to go to school next fall and where he lives. Just the fact that he mentioned their little meet-up is enough to ring my alarm bells.\u201d</p><p>I sit up, too, leaning my forearms on my knees. I still don\u2019t fully comprehend what she has in mind, but I\u2019m starting to get an idea of it. \u201cIf they decide to hook up, what are we supposed to do about it? Maybe you\u2019re forgetting that thanks to you, Emma dumped me. She didn\u2019t choose some other guy over me. She chose to be alone rather than be with me. You set that whole shit up, Brooke. I don\u2019t know what you told her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her anything. She was in the bathroom stall.\u201d</p><p>The silence is profound after she says this. She\u2019s actually managed to shock me. Emma didn\u2019t just get a second-hand account of what went down between Brooke and me, she heard the entire sordid conversation, along with all of the hostility I obviously still felt over Brooke\u2019s betrayal years ago. I\u2019d thought, before that night, that I was solidly recovered. Wrong.</p><p>Little wonder Emma disappeared that night. I slump back into the sofa. \u201cHoly shit, Brooke. How could you do that? You, and you alone, are responsible for both of them knowing about that pregnancy. And that I bailed on you. But do they both know you were cheating on me? Do they know that fucking part of the story?\u201d</p> <p>She sits back, staring out the window for several minutes with her chin in her hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I stand up. This is bullshit. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of fantasy land you live in, where you can get two people to just forget the extremely dysfunctional shit they know about both of us\u2014again, thanks to you\u2014and fall into our arms. I don\u2019t see it happening. If I\u2019d known Emma overheard us that night\u2014\u201d I run a hand through my hair. I\u2019m so pissed I want to smash my foot through her chrome and glass table or throw something across the room. \u201cIf I\u2019d known she heard that conversation, I\u2019d have given her the chance to calm down instead of being a complete dickwad and literally screwing the first girl who bumped into me.\u201d</p><p>Brooke is silent, frowning and still staring out the window. \u201cI can change her mind.\u201d Her words are soft, spoken into her hand.</p><p>\u201cHow? Why would she listen to you\u2014because she trusts you so much? She\u2019s not that stupid,\u201d I sneer, still standing.</p><p>Her eyes flash to me. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve thought about Emma several times in the past month, ever since my spontaneous apology that night in my hotel room. The one she rejected, soundly. The thing is\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have been willing, or able, to actually change for her. The only change I had in mind was attempting a monogamous hookup, for however long it lasted. I\u2019m standing across from the only other girl who\u2019s ever gotten that out of me. But Brooke and Emma are night and day, so it seemed likely that the outcome would be different with Emma. Not that she gave me the chance to find out.</p><p>I sit back down. \u201cLet me get this straight\u2014you\u2019re proposing that we work together to either break up, or stop from forming, a relationship between Graham and Emma. And moreover, that we manage to seduce them for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Her chin comes up. \u201cYes. Are you in or not?\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re staring at each other across the expanse of glass table, the room impossibly bright. I can see every sliver of ice blue in her eyes, every perfect highlight altering her natural honey blonde hair to a streaked blonde not found in nature. Her nose, too, is a little more perfect than it was when we were younger, her brows flawlessly shaped and raised in silent question, waiting for my answer.</p><p>I nod once. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Emma</p><p>In the taxi between my hotel and the Hollywood studio where On the Air is recorded, I try to psyche myself up to see Reid. I have no idea what to expect. The last time I saw him, only a month ago, he\u2019d apologized for what he put me through last fall. Forgive me, please.</p><p>I did forgive him, but not in the way he wanted.</p><p>He said he thought he could be different with me. That I could help him be something better. And I replied that I wanted someone who was already that, on his own, with or without me. Visions of Graham swam through my head as I said those words. I was so sure Graham belonged to Brooke. I was so sure he was impossible and unobtainable and not for me.</p><p>And now he is possible, obtainable, mine.</p><p>I expect Reid to be aloof. Resentful, possibly. But Reid Alexander doesn\u2019t focus on one girl for long. He could have anyone he wants. Well, almost anyone. It would be ridiculous for him to have any residual feelings for me, but that might not stop him from being vindictive over my rejection, because one thing Reid Alexander doesn\u2019t get is rejected.</p><p>I\u2019ve exceeded my comfort level on confrontation lately. My initial conversation with Marcus went less well than I\u2019d hoped. When he arrived Saturday night, he was in his usual upbeat mood. When he kissed me, a quick peck on the mouth, I knew we had to have the awkward conversation first thing. I don\u2019t want to kiss anyone but Graham, even superficially.</p><p>\u201cSo what are we doing tonight? Hanging out with Em and Derek, or do I get you all to myself?\u201d</p><p>For some inexplicable reason, it really bugs me when Marcus calls Emily Em. There\u2019s no good reason for this. It doesn\u2019t bother me when Dad does it. Or Derek, though he only calls her Em when he\u2019s parodying some Jersey Shore guy, like he did last week: \u201cAaay, Em, babe, whaddaya mean we ain\u2019t got time to make out? Badda-bing, five minutes\u2014I\u2019m happy, you\u2019re happy, every-freakin-body\u2019s copacetic.\u201d Emily punched him in the arm, earning, \u201cOw, woman, whaddaya gotta do that for? I\u2019m a sensitive guy.\u201d And then she rolled her eyes and he dipped her backwards and kissed her so thoroughly that I felt it.</p><p>I ignored Marcus\u2019s \u201cEm,\u201d as I had every other time he\u2019d said it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just us tonight. And, um, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, that sounds a little serious,\u201d he said, still smiling. When I pressed my lips together and didn\u2019t deny that it was, his smile wilted, and I turned and led the way to my room.</p><p>I\u2019d never actually seen Marcus in a bad mood, except for a few times during rehearsals for It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, when I thought he was somewhat overly-critical of our cast mates\u2019 performances. We were doing community theatre, not Broadway. But I took him to be a typical serious, perfectionist theatre geek and let it pass. We started going out after the show wrapped, and he\u2019d never showed any sign of irritation with anything.</p><p>We sat on my bed and he waited for me to explain. I cleared my throat and arranged the words in my head. There was no reason Marcus and I couldn\u2019t remain friends. We\u2019d had the rare kissing marathon, but hadn\u2019t gone any further than that. Frankly, I\u2019d had a hard time picturing myself with Marcus in any serious physical way. I\u2019d assumed that the botched relationship attempts with Reid and Graham had stomped those desires right out of me.</p><p>The thought of Graham flooded my imagination with thoughts of him, and it took concerted effort to push those contemplations from my mind and direct my attention to the task at hand: letting Marcus down gently. \u201cYou know the, uh, movie I just filmed?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow and then laughed lightly. \u201cYeah, School Pride\u2014I think everyone who knows you is familiar.\u201d</p><p>I chewed my lip. \u201cWell, I was close friends with a guy in the cast\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be... Graham Douglas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. How did you\u2014? Nevermind. Not important.\u201d I shook my head. Those tabloid stories I\u2019d ignored hadn\u2019t been ignored by everyone else. And everyone else apparently included Marcus. \u201cI ran into him in New York. And... it appears that we have feelings for each other.\u201d I watched the effect these words had on him\u2014the confused frown, the tilt of his head as what I was saying started to become clear, the incredulous look when he got it.</p><p>\u201cSo wait. You go to New York and \u2018run into\u2019 a guy you haven\u2019t seen for a month, and didn\u2019t see for several months before that\u2014or is there more to this that I need to know?\u201d His anger took me by surprise, not because it was undeserved, but because it was so uncharacteristic.</p><p>\u201cUh, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou run into him, and the two of you just decide to embark on\u2014what\u2014a full-fledged relationship? Are you breaking up with me?\u201d</p><p>I was stunned at his vehemence. And his assumption. \u201cMarcus, we never agreed we were a couple\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, we\u2019ve been going out for almost four months, and neither of us\u2014that I know of\u2014has seen anyone else for the past couple of months. I\u2019m not crazy to make assumptions.\u201d His tone was spiteful. This wasn\u2019t the Marcus I\u2019d known for months. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d It was lame, but it was the best I could do.</p><p>He stared at the bedspread, and I almost held my breath. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him, but I gathered that his feelings had grown stronger than I\u2019d comprehended. Wondering if I\u2019d been blind to this, I thought back over the past few months and couldn\u2019t pinpoint a thing he\u2019d said or done that would have let me know he was growing possessive. But then, I hadn\u2019t given him any reason to express it before. He\u2019d felt safe in the knowledge that there was no one else.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m going to my prom alone.\u201d His voice was sullen, hostile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d be happy to still go with you, if you want me to...\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed up to mine. \u201cSo he\u2019ll allow you to go with me?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean, allow me to go\u2014this is my decision, and I told you I\u2019d go with you, so I\u2019m willing to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t do me any favors, okay?\u201d He stood, fists clenched at his sides. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow. I don\u2019t know if I want to see you again, Emma, prom or not. This is so out of left field. I didn\u2019t think you had it in you to lead someone on like that. I guess you\u2019re more Hollywood girl than I thought.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes filled with tears as he stomped from the room, down the stairs and out the front door.</p><p>REID</p><p>The studio valet takes the keys to my Lotus. It\u2019s over a year old now, and I\u2019m utterly bored with it. I\u2019ve been thinking about getting a Porsche. Something sleek and black. Sexy. I have no idea what the hell I was thinking buying a yellow car. Dad\u2019s \u201cdouche taxi\u201d comments aside, it\u2019s way too happy-smiley-sunny for me now. I\u2019m nineteen as of last month. Yellow is something a kid chooses, not a man.</p><p>I\u2019m psyched to see Emma, though I\u2019m going to have to play that way down. Brooke warned me to do nothing beyond being civil and warm. Absolutely no flirting. \u201cThe last time you saw her you tried to pull her back into a relationship. She\u2019s going to expect you to either be resentful or flirtatious. Be neither. Just be... sweet. You can fake that, right?\u201d</p><p>I gave her a look that clearly said, You are a grade-A bitch, and she laughed. Brooke is a calculating genius, and I\u2019m glad that for once I\u2019m on her side. Sort of.</p> <p>\u201cOh and by the way, no screwing around. At all. You nail-gunned your own coffin with that shit last fall. If you\u2019re going to convince Emma that you\u2019re a changed man, you\u2019ve gotta start by keeping your dick in your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassy, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, Reid\u2014and tell me this: was Blossom, or whatever the hell her name was, worth losing Emma for? Because that\u2019s what did it. Emma\u2019s too forgiving for her own good, and I\u2019m positive she\u2019d have given you another shot if you hadn\u2019t screwed it up for yourself\u2014literally.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Bullseye.</p><p>As the valet steers the Lotus away from the curb (carefully, because he knows I\u2019m watching), a taxi pulls up. Wearing a floral sundress, her hair piled adorably at her crown and looking as though it will all tumble down any moment, Emma steps from the back seat, watching me warily. \u201cHey, beautiful,\u201d I smile. Oops. So much for not flirting.</p><p>\u201cHi, Reid.\u201d She looks equal parts reserved and relieved, so I haven\u2019t blown it yet.</p> <p>Focus on sweet and friendly. No flirting. So I guess pulling her forward and seeing if she\u2019ll let me kiss her is out. As is telling her she looks good enough to eat. \u201cSo. Um. Ready to meet Ryan?\u201d I assume Seacrest hasn\u2019t been on her list of interviewers before now.</p><p>She takes a deep breath and exhales slowly. Nervous. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. He\u2019s as cool as they come\u2014he won\u2019t do anything to make you feel uncomfortable.\u201d I hook my thumbs into my front jeans pockets and offer her an elbow. \u201cSo... I suppose you got the word from the powers that be on how we\u2019re supposed to play up the Darcy-and-Lizbeth-in-love angle, huh?\u201d</p><p>She slides her hand into the crook of my arm and we walk up to the studio doors. I glance down at her and she looks up, a small crease between her brows. \u201cYeah, my agent told me. I\u2019m not really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d I lean closer and lower my voice. \u201cThis will be a piece of cake. I\u2019ve had to do it once before, and I couldn\u2019t stand my costar. It took everything in me not to stuff a sock into her mouth any time she started talking. We managed to keep up the pretense until the initial release was over. You and I won\u2019t have the same problem... unless you find yourself wanting to stuff a sock in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>One corner of her mouth turns up and she smirks, and I know we\u2019re good. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need so far,\u201d she retorts. \u201cBut I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>The interview goes well. When questioned, we issue polite denials of any romantic ties between us, stating that the whole cast was cozy last fall, what with the close quarters and our similar respective ages. Ryan quirks an eyebrow when I bump Emma softly with my shoulder and smile down at her like we have a secret. We\u2019ve definitely fulfilled what the studio wants from us\u2014ambiguity in our answers about a possible relationship, coupled with seemingly minor physical displays of affection.</p><p>What the public believes or doesn\u2019t about Emma and me is irrelevant to me personally, and I know she won\u2019t be swayed into (or out of) a relationship because of fan reaction, especially considering her upcoming exit from Hollywood this fall. Whatever\u2019s going on between her and Graham Douglas can\u2019t possibly be all that significant yet. They live too far apart and have hardly seen each other in months. He\u2019s a wild card, though. I never did figure him out. Brooke seems to think she can manipulate this with my help, and both of us will end up with what we want.</p> <p>I\u2019m less sure of that, but perfectly willing to play my part. Losing Emma was a massive disappointment. One I\u2019d like to reverse.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>It\u2019s been four days since I\u2019ve seen her. In person, anyway. I\u2019m currently staring at a jerky graphic of her on my laptop screen\u2014the best Emma-substitute technology has to offer. It\u2019s not enough. Not even close.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have class tomorrow?\u201d she asks, blinking into her webcam, staring at a correspondingly spasmodic image of me.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d The time difference between us doesn\u2019t play into my favor. She\u2019s the one who can afford to sleep in; I\u2019m the one with eight o\u2019clock classes. 10:03 p.m. in Sacramento is 1:03 a.m. in New York. \u201cBut if you were here, I wouldn\u2019t be sleeping, either. So what\u2019s the difference?\u201d Aside from the fact that sitting in my bed, laptop tilted to watch your face as you speak, is so inferior to the feel of you in my hands, the taste of you on my tongue.</p><p>The fuzzy Emma image smiles, one hand nervously pushing her hair behind her ear. She glances away, towards her bedroom door, I imagine, and back to me. Leaning closer, her face fills my screen. \u201cOh?\u201d Her voice lowers. \u201cAnd what would we be doing, instead of sleeping, if I was there?\u201d</p><p>I give her a somewhat tame version. Not exactly censored, but not enough to scare her, either. The light on her end is too dark to see if she blushes, but her lips part and her eyes widen slightly and she bites her lip adorably and listens like I\u2019m telling her the best story ever.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how far she went with Reid. Or with anyone before him, for that matter, though I surmised that there was no one before him, from how frustrated he often seemed. I know far too much about Reid Alexander and his seduction capabilities. Not wanting a full accounting of just how critically I screwed up by not taking her from him last fall, I have no plans to ask her about their involvement. It has no bearing on what I think of her. It has no bearing on us.</p><p>\u201cI wish you were here,\u201d she says finally, her lower lip jutting out so slightly I might be imagining it. I run my finger across it on the screen, which she can\u2019t see me do.</p><p>\u201cI will be, in a week.\u201d</p><p>She groans. \u201cToo long.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>A faint scratching comes from my closed bedroom door. \u201cGo away, Noodles,\u201d I call. Cara\u2019s cat is usually asleep at the foot of her bed at 1:00 a.m., not wandering around the house scratching on random closed doors.</p><p>Then my doorknob turns, the door opening a sliver before a small face appears. \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a visitor,\u201d I say into the tiny camera at the top of my screen, pushing the laptop onto the bed and padding across the room. \u201cCara? What are you doing up?\u201d I open the door and she latches onto me, impeded only by the stuffed rabbit clenched in one fist.</p><p>Grasping her under the arms, I lift her and settle her in my arms. She sniffles and buries her face in my neck. \u201cBad dream?\u201d I ask, and she nods, sniffling a little harder.</p><p>\u201cCan I sleep with you?\u201d A hiccup follows this muffled request. Emma coughs lightly, the sound coming through the laptop speakers with a scratchy unevenness, and Cara\u2019s head pops up. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to Emma,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s get you back to bed.\u201d</p><p>She turns her head back and forth mulishly, her dark eyes intent. \u201cI want to talk to Emma, too.\u201d</p><p>Great. Wrestling Cara back into her bed could take me half an hour. She\u2019ll want to tell me her entire nightmare, and she\u2019s quite the dramatic narrator. I fully suspect she adds details as she goes along, just to enhance the story. And then the request for water. The request for a kiss. The need to be accompanied to the bathroom. The checking for monsters in her closet, under her bed and behind her draperies. Another kiss.</p><p>I love my daughter, but crap, what timing.</p><p>I walk over and pick up the laptop with my free hand, turning it towards Cara and myself. \u201cI might as well let you go,\u201d I tell Emma. \u201cThis could take a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Emma,\u201d Cara says, posing for the camera, horrible nightmare forgotten. She\u2019s used to conversing with me this way when I\u2019m away from home and she\u2019s with Brynn or Cassie. \u201cThis is Bunny.\u201d She holds the rabbit in front of the webcam. I\u2019m sure all Emma can see is a screen full of worn blue fur.</p><p>\u201cOh, well hello there, Bunny. Are you by any chance... a turtle?\u201d</p><p>Cara giggles, snatching Bunny to her chest and replacing the stuffed toy with her own face. \u201cNooooo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA giraffe, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooooo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA doggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m stumped. What kind of animal has a name like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bunny!\u201d Cara is dissolving into a fit of laughter, and I can\u2019t help laughing along. She turns to me and points to my bed. \u201cSit, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>I sit with a sigh, torn between shock and elation at Emma\u2019s ability to switch gears. Five minutes ago I was whispering rather wicked details of what I wanted to do to her, and if the look on her face was any indication, she was having no problem following along. And now she\u2019s charming my daughter.</p><p>Cara begins to get sleepy quickly, slumping into my lap a short time later, curled around Bunny. It\u2019s inching closer to 2 a.m. \u201cI\u2019m going to go put her back down and hope she stays down. Same time tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier tomorrow,\u201d she promises. \u201cGoodnight, Graham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Emma. See you soon.\u201d She signs off and the screen goes black.</p><p>Ah, God. My life has become more complicated than I ever imagined it could be. I had no real idea what I was doing to myself when I decided to take on parenthood. To cope, I made adjustments I thought I could manage, like forgoing close romantic entanglements. At first, nothing could have been easier, because I was still in love with Zoe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once I was finally over her, I realized I\u2019d also grown up, filled out. Girls on campus watched me with shameless curiosity and signaled uncomplicated desires, and my refusals to share any shred of personal information only amplified their interest. I didn\u2019t particularly care if they liked my no-strings position or not. A few drew lines in the sand, and I simply walked away. I never lied to anyone. I never promised anything. I never wanted anything more from anyone.</p><p>Until Emma. The friendship we developed was unlike any relationship I\u2019ve ever had. So easy, so companionable, but that physical pull was there, too, from the first moment first I saw her. I refused to believe I was falling for a 17-year-old girl, and I fought it, hard. The first time I kissed her uncovered feelings so compelling that they tumbled over into protectiveness. The resolve came naturally: I wouldn\u2019t touch her\u2014beyond what we\u2019d already done\u2014until she was a legal adult, until she specifically asked me to. For the first time since Zoe, my guard was down.</p><p>Which was exactly why that photo of Reid and Emma sliced right through me.</p><p>Emma</p> <p>The prom is a nightmare. While it\u2019s not exactly Carrie, it\u2019s no High School Musical III, either.</p><p>When Marcus called to tell me he still wanted me to accompany him to his prom, I swallowed back clich\u00e9d reassurances: It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me. We can still be friends. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.</p><p>Though I didn\u2019t vocalize any of these, I did tell him I was sorry at least half a dozen times. My apparent guilt must have given him the mental go-ahead to transform into a total dick by the next weekend.</p><p>The downward spiral began when he arrived to pick me up. I\u2019d told Dad and Chloe that we were going as friends, so I didn\u2019t want them to make a big deal of it. Naturally, Chloe ignored that entreaty and had the camera charged and ready.</p><p>\u201cI remember my prom,\u201d she said, smiling dreamily into the distance as I thought, Oh, crap, here we go. \u201cI was a total princess, all the way down to the glass slippers.\u201d She put a hand to her mouth like she was about to reveal a secret. \u201cActually, those shoes were acrylic and uncomfortable as hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said, attempting to look sympathetic.</p><p>Chloe blinded us with multiple flashes as Marcus slid a corsage onto my wrist in the entryway. She led us out back and posed us in front of the pool landscaping that made Dad walk around for days with his jaw clenched, mute and furious, after he got the bill for all the upgrades she\u2019d authorized.</p><p>Snapping photos like she had aspirations as a high-fashion photographer, Chloe was oblivious to the ice-cold wall between her subjects. \u201cMarcus, put your arms around her. Like that, but with your hands meeting in the middle. Oh! Yes! Just like that!\u201d</p><p>I let her get off a few of shots before breaking from the false embrace. \u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s enough pictures. You know, Marcus might actually like to go to his prom as part of this experience...\u201d I hoped Marcus and I would share a knowing look about Chloe\u2014not uncommon for us\u2014so we could begin to salvage the night somewhat before it was entirely wrecked. But he stood, one hand in the trousers of his tux, flicking a fingernail and looking bored, and my sense of foreboding mushroomed.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s arts-heavy prep school is relatively small, with a modest graduating class. Judging by the response his arrival generates, he\u2019s clearly one of the in-crowd. The venue is the tented rooftop terrace of the Citizen Hotel\u2014the city\u2019s oldest skyscraper. Though the view is only a very familiar Sacramento, it\u2019s breathtaking from this height. Distance alters everything.</p><p>Introducing me to his group of friends by way of, \u201cThis is Emma,\u201d and a turn of his wrist in my general direction, he doesn\u2019t introduce any of them to me. Unbelievably, no one steps forward, either. I\u2019m stuck knowing no one\u2019s name\u2014except those discovered by eavesdropping on neighboring conversations\u2014so there\u2019s nothing to do but stand next to Marcus, my dress and his tux accoutrements so perfectly matched that it leaves no doubt we\u2019re here together. Trapped at the receiving end of stares and whispers in a crowd of people where I don\u2019t know a single person beyond my asshole of a date, I consider calling a taxi, or Dad, to come pick me up.</p> <p>I can\u2019t shake the conviction that I\u2019m getting what I deserve for leading Marcus on, as convincingly as Emily objected to that conclusion. \u201cMarcus doesn\u2019t own you,\u201d she said after I told her what had happened with Graham in New York, and the resulting altercation with Marcus. \u201cI don\u2019t see a ring on your finger, not that you\u2019d ever want one from that pompous ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked him?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cPsshh,\u201d she said, glancing at me as she made a right turn. We were on the way to get our annual almost-summer pedicures. \u201cI tolerated him. Derek and I didn\u2019t think he was for you.\u201d</p><p>I sputtered before answering, \u201cYou and Derek discussed\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHells yeah.\u201d She was, as usual, unapologetic. \u201cWe hoped it would fade out before you ended up in New York with him leeching onto you. Derek thinks he just wanted you for your film and theatre connections. With the bonus of your smokin\u2019 little bod, of course.\u201d</p><p>I almost spit berry smoothie onto her dashboard. \u201cGod, Em. I feel so cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m just glad we didn\u2019t have to resort to breaking you guys up.\u201d She parked the Sentra and yanked up the brake.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you and Derek would have\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many times in this conversation must I say hells yeah? Wouldn\u2019t have been that hard, either. You weren\u2019t all that attached to him, thankfully. You\u2019d just better hope we like this Graham guy.\u201d</p><p>I leveled a look at her. \u201cNo. Graham is off-limits. I don\u2019t care if the two of you hate him.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and pinched my arm. \u201cNow that\u2019s more like it.\u201d</p><p>When I come back to earth, I\u2019m still at Marcus\u2019s prom, being pointedly ignored by every person here. Then my focus lands on the other side of the huge indoor/outdoor space. One of the photographers snapping shots of prom-goers appears to be aiming his camera in my direction exclusively. I think paparazzi? before giving myself a mental shake, feeling silly.</p><p>Still, I glance around surreptitiously, looking for the other photographers, who are progressing through the crowd, setting up shots of small knots of people talking and laughing, snapping candid shots of couples dancing and teachers chaperoning. Sliding my eyes back to the first photographer, I notice two things. One, his camera is badass in comparison to what the other two are utilizing. And two, he\u2019s still aiming every single shot in my direction.</p><p>I have an uneasy feeling about this.</p><p>Emily spent ten minutes scolding me about my recent dumbass decisions: first, trying to placate Marcus by going to his prom, and second, breaking my own rule about checking gossip sites. She\u2019s right, of course. I can\u2019t unsee the photos of me\u2014alternating between miserable and pissed\u2014standing beside Marcus, being snubbed by everyone at that dance. I can\u2019t unread the stories claiming that it was my choice to isolate myself, or the bonus rumors that I\u2019m cheating on Reid Alexander.</p><p>My best friend stomps back and forth across my room while Derek and I look on silently. Finally, she stops and glares at the laptop screen. \u201cWhat a bunch of jealous pricks!\u201d Emily will never be accused of beating around the bush.</p><p>\u201cMarcus\u2019s friends or the gossip sites?\u201d I\u2019m not sure which infuriates her more.</p><p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d She\u2019s so angry she\u2019s growling.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, baby,\u201d Derek says, tugging on her hand as she paces by him.</p><p>\u201cI will not calm down!\u201d Stopping suddenly, she slides onto his lap. \u201cDerek, please do me a favor.\u201d She nuzzles the side of his closely-shorn blond head and his eyes close.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease beat the shit out of Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that.\u201d</p><p>Sitting straight up, she folds her arms over her chest and glares at him. \u201cWhat the hell good is having a muscly boyfriend if he won\u2019t beat people up for you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m glad the text from Reid comes after they\u2019ve gone.</p><p>Reid: You went to prom with some other guy? I\u2019m hurt.</p><p>Me: Very funny</p><p>Reid: Our little act is a success. I\u2019ve already been contacted for comment.</p><p>Me: Crap</p><p>Reid: It would help if we go out to dinner and look happy</p><p>Me: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea</p><p>Reid: Sure it is. One happy outing in the face of those stories will put an end to them.</p><p>Me: You know I\u2019m 400 miles from los angeles, right?</p><p>Reid: I\u2019m visiting a friend in san fran tomorrow. Drive in, stay over. We\u2019ll go somewhere cool.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m not meeting you in san francisco, reid</p><p>Reid: Fine, i\u2019ll come to you</p><p>Graham is as supportive as Emily, though far less violence-craving.</p><p>\u201cI should have just backed out of prom,\u201d I sigh into my webcam, scrubbing my hands over my face. \u201cMarcus wasn\u2019t going to be happy no matter what I did, and now the whole world thinks I\u2019m a stuck-up bitch who wouldn\u2019t lower herself to speak to regular folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure no one believes a word of that.\u201d His voice is so warm and soothing that I almost believe him.</p><p>\u201cPeople do believe it! And you know the most annoying part? Before now, I was a middle-class nonentity to most of the people from his school. Marcus and I have run into classmates of his several times, and every time I felt exactly like I do when Chloe eyeballs whatever I\u2019m wearing and gears up to mock my entire sense of fashion\u2014or lack of it.\u201d</p><p>He smiles reassuringly. \u201cI happen to like your fashion sense.\u201d</p><p>I barely hear him. \u201cAnd what about the rumors that I\u2019m cheating on Reid with Marcus? I\u2019m not dating Reid, but the studio wants everyone to think I am... so of course I\u2019m a cheater if I go out with anyone else. What will that mean when you\u2019re here? We\u2019ll have to sneak around. If we\u2019re caught, I\u2019ll look like the biggest slut in Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and shakes his head. \u201cEmma, love, you\u2019ve got a long way to go to win that crown.\u201d</p><p>I smile goofily at my screen. \u201cYou called me love.\u201d</p><p>He smirks, chin tucked low, staring at his screen through his lashes. \u201cYou okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I stare into his beautiful warm eyes and wish for the hundredth time in two days that he was standing in front of me. \u201cAre you okay with me meeting Reid for dinner?\u201d</p><p>He nods and says, \u201cAs okay as I can be.\u201d Which seems cryptic, but I don\u2019t push him. I can\u2019t expect him to be thrilled about it.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Brooke</p><p>\u201cThis is the part where you\u2019ll either start gaining her trust or you\u2019ll blow it.\u201d Obviously, Reid hasn\u2019t gained my trust. I\u2019m fully expecting him to blow it.</p><p>\u201cWho died and made you all-knowing?\u201d He\u2019s barely got the words out before I want to strangle the ability to speak right out of him. I don\u2019t know if Reid and I are capable of ever not wanting to rip each other to shreds. That desire lingers right under the surface of every conversation we have. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Reid, if you touch her or pressure her in any way before I do my part of this, it\u2019s over and we\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not,\u201d he quips.</p><p>\u201cHa. Ha.\u201d God, I have had just about enough of his horseshit.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d He pauses and I know he\u2019s thinking he left that wide open. I would dearly love to deliver the retort he expects, but it\u2019s just too easy. \u201cEverything else in my life is boring the shit out of me. This is the only thing remotely stimulating. I\u2019m following your orders, because you\u2019re the most successfully conniving girl I\u2019ve ever known, plus I can smell how badly you want Graham.\u201d</p> <p>If it wasn\u2019t true, how much I want Graham, I\u2019d end this here and now. But Reid makes it sound like wanting him is dirty. It\u2019s not. I\u2019m simply ready for something more serious and meaningful than all of the faceless boys and men I\u2019ve been with in the last few years. None of them were worth half of Graham, and I\u2019m willing to be whatever he wants me to be to get him. What\u2019s so wrong about that?</p><p>I\u2019ve always been a crap judge of character. Graham was the only exception to that, though the existence of our friendship was all due to him. When I met him, I was reeling from Reid breaking my heart, and I just wanted to hook up. I was bouncing off of guys like the shiny silver ball in my father\u2019s vintage pinball machine\u2014ding-ding-ding. I guess Graham could tell that about me. He was one of the few who turned me down, but he didn\u2019t run away when my humiliation that any guy would reject me morphed into uber-bitch mode. He stuck around and became one of my best friends. Something I didn\u2019t deserve, and something I\u2019ve always hoped would grow into more.</p><p>Graham has this quiet, steady aura about him, and of course I\u2019m drawn to a disposition so completely opposite of mine. I thought we\u2019d balance out, like a relationship seesaw. When we both scored roles in School Pride, I was sure my chance had come. Close quarters for three months, and my very real need for emotional protection from Reid that only Graham could provide.</p><p>Then he met Emma.</p><p>At first, I assumed she\u2019d screw him over for Reid. She was obviously not immune to him, and he focused exclusively on her. I remembered all too well how that felt. When Reid and I first met, he flashed those blue eyes at me\u2014baby blues, because holy shit he was what, fourteen then?\u2014and I was a goner. Fifteen years old, and I was sure I\u2019d met my soul mate, the guy I wanted to spend forever with. God, what a na\u00efve idiot I was.</p> <p>Unlike me, though, Emma figured him out. I have to give the girl props, she resisted long enough to witness him doing what he does, and then she dropped his ass. It would have been a joy to behold, if not for Graham. I\u2019d never seen him so crazy infatuated before. Every time we hung out, I made careful plans to seduce him, but all he wanted to talk about was Emma, if he talked instead of brooding over her\u2014which he was more prone to do. I don\u2019t think he even noticed my seduction efforts. Now, I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Because this time, those efforts are going to work.</p><p>REID</p><p>Choosing a restaurant in a city you\u2019ve never visited is tough. Since Emma lives in Sacramento, I asked her to choose whatever she\u2019d like. This one will do, though not for my calculated purpose of being observed together in the restaurant. The windows are draped, probably thwarting the cozy paparazzi photos Brooke and I were anticipating. For actual intimacy, though, it\u2019s ideal\u2014corner table, flickering candles, semi-tasteful d\u00e9cor (points deducted for the acoustic tile ceiling and likely-artificial paneling on a far wall).</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with this Marcus character? He seems like an ass. I thought when you dumped me you were trying to move away from that type.\u201d I smile, bumping Emma\u2019s arm lightly, and she rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I guess that\u2019s harder to avoid than I thought.\u201d She returns my smile, but pulls her forearm away from mine, slowly, putting an ever-so-slight distance between us.</p> <p>I lean back, pretending not to notice her withdrawal while she examines the menu. The waiter, introducing himself as Chad, is so uneasy he\u2019s twitching. He also punctuates practically every sentence with either heh-heh or Mr. Alexander. After taking our drink order, he scurries to the back through a set of double doors where the rest of the wait staff congregates. They\u2019ve all been not-so-sneakily casting looks our way since we walked in. Typical.</p><p>A fun fact about celebrity: If you get carded, there\u2019s no such thing as a fake ID. They already know your real name. All anyone has to do is hit up IMDb or Wikipedia to get your exact birthdate. I rarely get carded, especially in LA or New York, or really anywhere we\u2019re filming. Most restaurants, bars and clubs are so freaked at having celebrities show up that they just don\u2019t give a crap. Apparently this place, which passes as \u201cupscale\u201d for Sacramento, gives a crap. I can\u2019t help my reaction, though, when Chad the waiter comes back a few minutes later all sheepish and asking to see ID for the bottle of wine I ordered.</p><p>\u201cDude, are you serious?\u201d I say, and his face goes scarlet.</p><p>\u201cMy manager, heh-heh,\u201d he subtly inclines his head towards the back. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Emma says, giving him a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019ll just have water.\u201d The breath wooshes out of the poor guy and he looks back at me.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d Chad rushes off and I shake my head. \u201cI guess I\u2019m not in LA anymore, Toto.\u201d</p><p>Emma laughs. \u201cNo, definitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard through the grapevine that you were in New York recently, visiting colleges. Chosen one yet?\u201d I\u2019m curious about whether or not she\u2019ll ask which grapevine I got that from. What might she think to know it was Graham-to-Brooke-to-me?</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t take the bait. Either she doesn\u2019t see it, or she\u2019s too smart to pick it up. \u201cI\u2019m leaning towards NYU.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTisch.\u201d I nod. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sound so surprised. I was up to my eyeballs with paying work by the time I got close to finishing my high school coursework. College was never really on my radar. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know all the major theatre programs. You know, just in case.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head. \u201cIn case what?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right, Emma. Follow the crumbs. \u201cIn case I decide to take my career in a more serious direction at some point.\u201d</p><p>A crease appears on her forehead and my finger itches to smooth it out. \u201cBut I thought you said something about wanting the crazy famous and ton of money route?\u201d</p><p>Wow. She remembers what I said months ago. Suddenly I\u2019m recalling why I found her so unusual. She\u2019s outwardly focused, in a way few people in this business are. Including me. I smile. \u201cMaybe the critical acclaim is more important to me than I let on.\u201d Total lie, of course.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d she says, and then for some reason she blushes.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Graham</p><p>Me: Touching down now. I\u2019d call but i\u2019m afraid of the flight attendant.</p><p>Emma: Lol why?</p><p>Me: She has a mustache. And sideburns. And perpetual anger.</p><p>Emma: Be careful...</p><p>Me: I\u2019m taking my life in my hands to text that i\u2019m only a few hundred miles from you</p><p>Emma: Wish I was there now</p><p>Me: I want to see you so bad it hurts</p><p>The second I hit send, I\u2019m rethinking\u2014too late\u2014that last text. Because how desperate can I seem? It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve felt this way. No. I\u2019ve never felt this way. I was lovesick over Zoe, but I didn\u2019t rearrange my life in my head to make room for her everywhere. In a matter of what\u2014less than two weeks?\u2014Emma has gone from the girl who got away to the girl I see in every moment of my future. I\u2019m starting to enter panic mode and second-think everything when my phone plays its text tone.</p><p>Emma: Me too</p><p>And just like that\u2014relief. Muscle-flooding, breath-releasing, mind-calming relief. Laughing to myself, I stare out at LA as we taxi up to the terminal. I was sixteen the last time I felt so jerked around by my own desires. I\u2019m out of practice.</p><p>I won\u2019t see Emma until tomorrow, when she checks into the hotel in LA, and I\u2019m already craving the sight of her like I used to crave the feel of a cigarette between my fingers, between my lips, inhaling, exhaling, the nicotine flooding my system and making everything right with the world, thirty seconds in.</p><p>I definitely shouldn\u2019t tell her that thinking of her makes me wish for a cigarette to take the edge off, for the first time in months. Not that I\u2019m sure it would even work.</p><p>Me: Heads up, seeing you will not be enough.</p><p>Emma: Consider me warned and ready</p><p>Emma: OMG *blushing*</p><p>Me: :)</p><p>My next text is to Cassie, to let her know I\u2019ve landed, to ask how Cara\u2019s doing. Most of the time she\u2019s fine when dropped at her aunt\u2019s, but sometimes not. My sister reports that currently, Cara is dancing in front of Caleb\u2019s battery-powered swing and eating Cheerios from a cup.</p><p>My family has been supportive from day one as far as Cara goes, day one being the day I brought her home. Before that, they were divided\u2014Mom and Brynn on one side and Dad and Cassie on the other. Mom and Brynn were not in favor of me taking custody of Cara. We\u2019d had a family meeting to make the decision, and even though my sisters were both in college and no longer lived at home, they were both given a vote. Mom was tight-lipped, but Brynn was livid.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do this to yourself?\u201d Her hand smacked the pine-planked kitchen table where we all sat, me at the head like the accused. \u201cShe told you she\u2019s absolutely not keeping it, thank God, so you\u2019re off the hook for eighteen years of child support. Let her take care of it in whatever way she sees fit and go live your life! You\u2019re sixteen for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>No one said anything. I don\u2019t think Dad and Cassie disagreed with her. They just thought I should be given the choice, and I\u2019d made it.</p><p>I stared at my hands, splayed on the table. They weren\u2019t as big as my dad\u2019s yet. They weren\u2019t the hands of a man. They were the hands of a boy. I knew in that moment that I could reclaim my adolescence and walk away from this with my family\u2019s full support.</p><p>My voice was low, but sure. \u201cIt\u2019s my baby. I can\u2019t just let her give it away\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham, honey, we can all appreciate your sense of responsibility.\u201d Mom\u2019s placating tone annoyed me even more than Brynn\u2019s anger had. \u201cBut Zoe is accountable for not protecting herself, too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know antibiotics would screw up her pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t using condoms?\u201d Brynn yelled. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>My face flamed. I was sitting in the kitchen while my entire family discussed my sex life and stared at me like I was the biggest idiot on the planet. Unquestionably the most awkward moment of my life.</p><p>Dad cleared his throat, and everyone waited for his tie-breaking assessment. My father is a man of few words\u2014a trait I inherited. His eyes met those of Mom, Cassie and Brynn, one by one. \u201cI think Graham\u2019s made his decision, and if Zoe agrees with this, we\u2019ll have another member of the family, and we\u2019ll all adjust accordingly.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cGraham, I want your word that you\u2019ll handle this like a man. No running away when it gets hard. No changing your mind later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u201cI know, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He returned the nod, as though I was an equal, and I sat up straighter.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Zoe. Keep us informed. This will all work out.\u201d He offered a half-grin to my mother, who sat stoically across from him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like all three of you were planned, after all.\u201d Mom smirked back at him. That was the end of the family meeting.</p><p>Zoe was convinced she was going to be \u201cjust like Juno.\u201d We told her parents our decision, and since they\u2019d given Zoe everything she wanted since the day she was born, it was easy enough to convince them to go along. There were moments during the next few months when she was pissed and blaming me for talking her into having the baby. Like the weeks she spent part of second period in the bathroom, throwing up, every day. Or when she got a new stretch mark. Or when she realized she\u2019d gained forty pounds and the baby wouldn\u2019t weigh more than eight.</p> <p>We weren\u2019t together-together, but Ross Stewart was no longer hanging around (which somehow confused Zoe), and I was convinced that part of everything working out would include Zoe and me getting back together. That didn\u2019t happen, of course.</p><p>Once Cara was born, Zoe handed her over, signed the legal papers terminating her parental rights, and went to spend a month in the south of France with her parents. When she returned to New York, she spent several weeks in the Hamptons before heading off to Florida for college. She never called or came by. It was like Cara never happened. Like I never happened.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Once I\u2019ve pulled my suitcase across the threshold of my room, I speed-dial Graham to tell him my room number. Waiting for him, I pace the length of the suite, door to window, window to door, my stomach in knots and my face as flushed as if I had a fever.</p><p>As he predicted, we\u2019ve texted and talked and Skyped for the past ten days. I know so much more about him than I did a month ago. I didn\u2019t know him at all last fall. I only knew the comfort I felt in his presence, as though he\u2019d always been a part of my life, a part of me. Maybe this is how it feels to lose your memory\u2014only impressions and shadowed inclinations remain, with no factual signals to back them up.</p> <p>A knock sounds at my door and my heart stops and falls to my knees, starting back up violently as I walk to the door and pull it open. For the barest moment we stand there drinking each other in, before I take a step backwards into the room and he follows as though there\u2019s a cord attached to his chest. The door snaps closed behind him.</p><p>Every detail about him has sharpened, my brain having played my mental pictures of him over and over. His dark hair is messy and falls over his forehead. His eyes are deep caramel in this late afternoon room, but they\u2019ll be black in low light. Slight stubble on his chin, and across his jaw. His mouth is set\u2014if I was a stranger to him I\u2019d think he was angry, but I know he\u2019s not. His nostrils flare just the slightest bit and I back up another step.</p><p>\u201cIs it... okay... if I lock the door?\u201d His voice is so low, and I recognize it as the voice he uses when we\u2019re talking late at night.</p><p>I nod, and he turns to twist the bolt and slam the interior lock home, the sleeve of his black t-shirt drawing back to expose the taut, defined muscles of his upper arm. My mouth goes dry with a longing so strong it makes my breath catch. When he steps towards me, I\u2019m stock still, torn between swaying towards him and taking another step back.</p><p>His arms slip around me as he bends and buries his face in my neck. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d His voice hums along my collar bone, soaks into my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too,\u201d I say, my voice a whisper, like smoke.</p> <p>He pulls back, his arms still locked at my lower back, and grins. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you more.\u201d I remember this promise from him as he walked away from me last fall in the airport, after we exchanged goodbyes and I told him I\u2019d miss him. I\u2019ll miss you more, he\u2019d said.</p><p>I give him a mock-stern look and flash my eyes to his. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I think you should have to prove a statement like that.\u201d</p><p>His mouth turns up on one side as he stares down at me, that expression so familiar and beautiful it impedes my breath. \u201cOh?\u201d he says, one eyebrow angling up.</p><p>My hands have been inching up his arms, which are tensed and tight around me still. He\u2019s not loosened his hold since he slid them around me. I take fistfuls of his sleeves on both sides and revel in the feel of his shoulders, broad and solid and so different from mine that I feel soft and small.</p><p>Pulling me closer, Graham lifts me onto my toes as his mouth crashes down on mine. The feel of his lips, insistent and giving no quarter, stuns me for a split-second, and then I\u2019m matching his movements, opening my mouth, a restrained moan building in my throat as our tongues meet. My hands glide into his hair, the dark strands like ink spilling over my fingers as I urge him closer. \u201cEmma,\u201d he breathes, wrapping one arm around my lower back, his fingers stroking over the skin at my waist as his opposite hand cradles my head, thrusting through the hair at my nape. His touch gentles then, kisses shifting to slow-motion, pulling me along like a subtle current, unhurried.</p><p>Without realizing I\u2019ve even moved, I feel the mattress pressing into my calves, and he breaks his mouth from mine long enough to lift me onto it, rising over me in the center of the bed. \u201cI just want to kiss you,\u201d he murmurs, his lips tracing a path from under my chin to my ear before he rolls onto his back and pulls me across him. My knee is between both of his, anchoring him to the bed as his hands run over my back and my shoulders before framing my face and pulling me down for a long, languid kiss.</p><p>Capturing his wrists, I mash them into the mattress, my hair falling over my shoulder and tickling along the side of his jaw. \u201cThat\u2019s all you want? Are you sure?\u201d I ask, brazen in a way I\u2019ve never been. Because this is Graham, and he\u2019s real and here and touching me\u2014not a face on a screen, thousands of miles away.</p><p>He chuckles, his eyes closing as he turns his head and nuzzles my forearm, leaving soft kisses on my wrist, grazing my skin with his teeth and igniting an eruption of goose bumps straight up my arm. His eyes open and he stares at me, all heat. \u201cNo. I want everything from you, with you.\u201d He turns his hands until they imprison my wrists, curving over me until I\u2019m under him again. \u201cBut right now, I\u2019m just going to keep kissing you until you make me stop.\u201d</p> <p>If he\u2019s waiting for an objection, he isn\u2019t going to get one. I lick my lips, a signal for kiss me please. And he does.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Brooke</p><p>I scroll to Reid and hit talk. Just when I think he\u2019s letting it go to voicemail, he says, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to bump up the interference,\u201d I say. \u201cHis flight landed a couple of hours ago, but he\u2019s not answering his phone.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Reid never looks at his phone before answering, and obviously, he\u2019s not yet reacquainted with my voice. A rather unreasonable hostility bubbles to the surface, though I suppose I should feel privileged\u2014his skanks don\u2019t score his phone number at all. He learned that the hard way, I\u2019m sure. Not that I can talk. I had to change my number half a dozen times before I finally comprehended that hot guys can turn as psycho as any girl. \u201cBrooke?\u201d</p><p>I puff out a sigh. \u201cFor chrissake, Reid, who do you think it is? And haven\u2019t you put me into your contacts yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... It just says Satan, though, and I forgot I\u2019d assigned that title to you.\u201d</p><p>I would dearly love to choke the ever-lovin\u2019 life out of him. \u201cThat\u2019s very funny. You\u2019re hilarious. Can we move on from the juvenile name-calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But really, you should consider it a compliment to your level of evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway. I think we should check into the hotel. Recreate the atmosphere from Austin last fall.\u201d</p><p>He laughs once, condescension saturating his tone. \u201cBecause that worked out so well for each of us.\u201d</p><p>True, asshole. But beside the point. \u201cWe weren\u2019t working together then\u2014hello.\u201d</p><p>He sighs into the phone. \u201cI\u2019d venture to say that at least on your end, we were doing the opposite of working together. I might even suggest that one of us was actively engaged in sabotage of the other.\u201d</p><p>I knew he could hold a grudge, justified or not, but hell\u2019s bells. \u201cOkay, fine, I helped screw it up for you. But I couldn\u2019t have if you hadn\u2019t done most of it to yourself. You could have salvaged it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you.\u201d</p><p>I grip the phone tighter, bound by my own designs for reconnecting with him in the first place. If he doesn\u2019t go along with this scheme, it could prove impossible. Who am I kidding? It will prove impossible. \u201cReid, if you don\u2019t believe me on this, then you won\u2019t trust what I tell you to do to get her back and we might as well give up now. In which case I might just have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d I don\u2019t hear any noise on his end, which strikes me as odd. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving. Going to pick up a couple of guys, do some clubs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo some girls, you mean.\u201d</p><p>He barks a laugh. \u201cHey, I consider tonight my bachelor party. You told me I have to be good once I\u2019m luring Emma into my lair, right? This may be my last night to get laid for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassy.\u201d I throw his assessment of me back at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, you asked. So. You think we need to check into the hotel where everyone else is\u2014even though we both live in LA. Proximity to the victims makes sense, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Victims? \u201cShit, Reid. Talk about harsh. I don\u2019t just want to screw Graham, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I don\u2019t know. Especially considering your MO.\u201d</p><p>For half a second, I consider hurling my phone at the wall. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve had it with the snide comments. I\u2019m not any more of a slut than you are, so just lay the hell off.\u201d Dammit, there goes my stupid twang. I can be a cold bitch all day long and sound like the perfect LA native, but get me actually pissed and I go all Texan, which just pisses me off more. If he mentions it, I swear to God...</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll stop. And Brooke?\u201d His voice has turned husky, and the sound of it slams me right in the solar plexus. \u201cThat accent still gets me hot, damn you.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and shake it off. I\u2019m not playing that game with him. \u201cEnjoy your last night of freedom, ha ha. I\u2019ll set up reservations for both of us at the hotel. Our story is that the studio wants us there with everyone else. No one will question it. Text me once you\u2019re in tomorrow morning and we\u2019ll review strategy. You remember morning, right? That brightish space of time between eight and noon when you\u2019re usually sleeping off a hangover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saluting, in case you\u2019re wondering.\u201d</p><p>I imagine clearly the exact gesture he\u2019s making. \u201cPut your middle finger down, asshat, before someone thinks you\u2019re flipping them off and drives your ass off the road. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone expected.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>GRAHAM</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been this content. Not that I don\u2019t want more. Because God, I do. But I\u2019m not desperate enough to forsake the need to hold her close, to feel her heart beat against me, to require nothing more than the exquisite fusing of our mouths and the stroke of our fingers over each other.</p><p>We lie entwined in the center of the bed, spent from a couple of hours of kissing that set fire to every emotion I\u2019ve ever felt for this girl. I know she can tell that I\u2019ve held myself in check a couple of times, physically\u2014a small crease appears on her forehead, or she affects a marginal withdrawal of her own. I hope she knows there\u2019s no need for her worry. As much as I want her, I\u2019ve been falling in love with her for months, and sleeping with someone you\u2019re in love with shifts everything to a more complex level. I can\u2019t go there alone. I have to know she\u2019s going with me.</p><p>As if sensing my heavy thoughts, she turns her face up from my shoulder and stares into my eyes, silent. My fingertips continue caressing her arm, up and over her shoulder, down her back, and I shamelessly examine the distinctive facets of her gray-green eyes, savoring the unguarded way she allows me to study her. My head tells me it\u2019s far too soon to tell her everything my heart wants me to blurt out. The last thing I want to do is scare her away. I\u2019ll take as long as she needs, be more patient than I\u2019ve ever been, if it means she\u2019ll be mine in the end. I\u2019m not afraid of my own feelings. I\u2019m only afraid of misjudging hers.</p> <p>The words lay on my tongue, unspoken. Waiting. My fingers have wandered up her back, rising and falling over each tiny arch of vertebrae until I reach her neck. Shifting, I lean over her and kiss her gently. My lips are sore and I know hers must be, too, though I\u2019ve tried to use restraint. I smile now, knowing that any restraint I\u2019ve employed didn\u2019t last long. I\u2019ve practically devoured her for the past two hours. From the bedside table, our phones have beeped and buzzed a couple of times each, but neither of us made any move towards them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201d she asks, her voice rasping between regular speech and a whisper, a tentative answering smile on her red, red mouth.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about how sore my lips are, and wondering if yours are, too.\u201d</p><p>She nods, her smile expanding. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can feel them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you feel this?\u201d I ask, leaning closer to run my tongue over her swollen lower lip, dipping inside her mouth when she opens with a sigh.</p> <p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d she says, raising her hand to my face and holding me just so, mirroring my effort. When her small tongue slips inside my mouth, I release a moan that sounds more like a growl and then I\u2019m rattling off baseball statistics and diagramming sentences in my head. (I was so sure last semester\u2019s Advanced Structures of Modern English would never come to any practical use.)</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d my voice breaks and I clear my throat, \u201cMaybe we should get dinner... or something.\u201d</p><p>She blinks, and I\u2019m glad to see she\u2019s as affected as I am. \u201cRoom service and a movie?\u201d She gestures to the television, reading my mind.</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect. I don\u2019t want to leave this room. Well, I mean, not until I have to. Um\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you... want to sleep here?\u201d Her eyes fall, watching her own hand where it lays on my chest, rising and falling with every breath I take. My heartbeat accelerates with her words; she must feel it pounding under her palm. \u201cWe only have a couple of days, and I\u2019ll probably fall asleep if we\u2019re up late...\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t mention the biggest impediment\u2014the fact that thanks to the ruse she and Reid are perpetrating, she and I can\u2019t be demonstrative in public. Her room\u2014and mine\u2014are like private islands. The only places we\u2019ll be safe to touch unguardedly.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you want me here when you wake up?\u201d She nods, and I kiss her carefully. \u201cI would love to stay with you tonight, Emma.\u201d Tipping her chin up, I look into her eyes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not taking that as an invitation for anything other than sleeping next to you.\u201d</p><p>After dinner, I walk to my room to grab a toothbrush and clean stuff to wear tomorrow, checking my phone messages on the way. No calls from home, but one missed call and a text from Brooke. Basic Hi babe, are you here yet? stuff. Texting back that I\u2019m all checked in, I tell her I\u2019m going to bed early\u2014using the three-hour time difference as an excuse for my exhaustion.</p><p>True to her word, Emma\u2019s out cold before the second movie is over. Cuddled up against my side, she sleeps on her stomach, a pillow flattened under her face and chest, one of her knees drawn up against my thigh and the other sprawled behind her. I grin and shake my head that such a small person can take up so much of a queen-sized bed. Her face angled towards me, her lashes lay across her creamy skin and her lips are parted slightly... and they actually do look a little puffy.</p><p>That thought has me contemplating noun phrases (Emma\u2019s lips) and verb phrases (are swollen) and prepositional phrases (from hours of kissing)... which does absolutely nothing to help me. When a groan escapes me, Emma moans softly in response, shifting without waking, her arm stealing across my abdomen. Oh, man. I am never getting to sleep. Still, I wouldn\u2019t trade the feeling of holding her like this for anything.</p><p>It\u2019s midnight in LA\u20143:00 a.m. New York time\u2014and I\u2019m staring at the swirling patterns on the ceiling, trying to concentrate on anything but my t-shirt loosely bunched in Emma\u2019s fist. A few minutes later, or half an hour, she stretches, pulling my shirt askew at the same time. When I glance down, she\u2019s awake, sort of. A drowsy, slowly-blinking stage of awake.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I whisper back. My arm has gone to sleep under her head, so I\u2019m grateful when she moves to lay her face on my chest. \u201cChecking for a heartbeat?\u201d I ask, stretching my arms out, returning one to pull her closer and tucking the other behind my head so I can see her more clearly. Her eyes go to my bicep and I feel like an idiot boy, wanting to flex it and be impressive. She props herself on her forearms, chin on her hands, and stares at me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how comfortable I feel,\u201d she says, a confused note in her confession. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p> <p>I raise an eyebrow, equally confused. \u201cHow do I do what?\u201d</p><p>She breathes out a sigh, her fingers scraping over the underside of my jaw. \u201cMake me feel like... like I can trust you with everything. I haven\u2019t felt like that in so long, with anyone. I\u2019m always afraid of being left. I always hold something back.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re cautious. Maybe... losing your mother did that to you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers still on my chin, she\u2019s quiet for a moment before saying, \u201cMaybe so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for trusting me, Emma. I\u2019ll be worthy of it. I swear.\u201d In my ears, this seems a too-solemn promise, but somehow it seems necessary in this moment. She doesn\u2019t reply beyond another sigh.</p><p>Running my hands over her, I spread her hair across my chest, fingertips trailing the sides of her face, hands kneading her shoulders and folding over her like a blanket. I have no problem falling asleep this time, with her locked in my arms.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>REID</p><p>Damn Brooke and her hangover comments. I\u2019d say she knows me well, but I\u2019m no different than any other eighteen to twenty-five in LA, especially the celebrity subset. I suspect she\u2019s the same; she just likes being high-handed with me.</p><p>Her orders, texted to me last night: Check into the hotel by TEN. The cars are picking everyone up at 11:30. Look hot. Don\u2019t flirt. Be friendly and sweet. Make her think you\u2019ve forgotten about her rejection.</p><p>Rejection. Way to twist the knife there, Brooke... almost as if she doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s doing it. Damn, she\u2019s good.</p><p>I check into the hotel at 11:15, after not bothering to answer her texts and calls all morning. She\u2019s got to get one thing straight\u2014I\u2019ll follow her dictates to a point, but only to a point. I don\u2019t trust her enough to blindly obey everything she says, and I\u2019m not stupid enough to ignore the fact that she\u2019ll hit her goal first. For Emma to fall into my arms, Graham has to fall into Brooke\u2019s. And I have no illusions about how much help Brooke will be to me once she gets what she wants. I\u2019ll be on my own.</p><p>After checking into my suite, I text Brooke: I\u2019m here.</p><p>The lobby is one big Austin d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and after I step off of the elevator, I stop to observe the interaction of my former costars before joining them. Tadd spots me first.</p><p>\u201cReid, you\u2019ve got to come to Chicago and hang out.\u201d He walks over and we exchange a fierce hug. \u201cMy new place is awesome\u2014penthouse right on the river. Oprah is just down the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be painting each other\u2019s toenails in no time, man,\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d He tosses his straight pale blond hair out of his eyes, his clear blue eyes flicking to Emma and back.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, dude. I\u2019m getting there, though.\u201d</p><p>Both eyebrows rise now. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>My eyes trace over Emma. She stands a foot from Graham\u2014nothing outwardly betraying anything between them, though an alert observer would say the way they seem to avoid touch or eye contact is conspicuous. \u201cThe studio wants us to maintain an illusory thing until the film\u2019s released. I want less illusory and more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he says. \u201cA warning, then.\u201d Shoulder to shoulder, we stand watching everyone else. \u201cThere\u2019s a little, I don\u2019t know\u2014chemistry? Going on between her and Graham.\u201d</p><p>No need to fake ignorance with Tadd\u2014he\u2019s had my back too many times to count. He likes Emma, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019d come down on my side if it came to that. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been made aware.\u201d</p><p>He smirks through the fringe of hair that falls right back down over one eye\u2014a look that probably gets him whatever guy he wants, whenever he wants it. \u201cBy who?\u201d he asks, and I glance in Brooke\u2019s direction. She\u2019s deliberately snubbing me, still pissed that I ignored her texted commands, I\u2019m sure. \u201cReally.\u201d Tadd\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cMore interesting.\u201d</p><p>Emma</p><p>Remaining hands-off with Graham is more difficult than I expected. I\u2019m drawn to him, as though there\u2019s some sort of gravitational attraction tethering us to each other. I want to press myself into his side. I want him to slide his arms around me like he did last night as we slept. I want to run my hands over him like I did an hour ago in my room, pushing his shirt up and counting his abdominal muscles out loud while he laughed, self-conscious and proud at the same time. This belongs to me, I thought, touching his hard stomach and biceps, kissing his mouth. And this. And this.</p><p>When I woke up in his arms this morning, I spent five minutes staring at his flawless, sleeping face. The world had tilted overnight, and everything had fallen into place. I slipped carefully from his grasp and tip-toed to the bathroom to brush my teeth, and when I came back and snuggled against him, he came slowly awake, kissed the top of my head and excused himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he came back to bed and kissed me, his minty breath echoed mine. I giggled when he rolled me flat on my back and smiled. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, mischief in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo I snore? Or talk in my sleep? Or drool? Or something worse?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNot that I know of. As far as I know, you\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>Turning my head back and forth, I stared up at him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Intertwining our fingers, he pushed my arms above my head, holding me prisoner. A bolt of pure liquid fire shot through me and pooled where our bodies pressed together. \u201cOh yes. You are,\u201d he said, kissing me.</p><p>By the time he left the room and I got into the shower, I had only half an hour to get ready. My hair is wavy and damp now because I didn\u2019t have time to dry it, let alone style it.</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d Brooke snatches my attention back to the lobby and my costars. She arches a flawless brow as her eyes dart over my hair. \u201cYou could have borrowed my flat iron if you needed one. I owe you, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>As was her intent, I\u2019m reminded of the night she borrowed my straightener in Austin, when Reid took me out to dinner and I thought I was falling for him. I glance over at him, and he smiles like he knows exactly what night I\u2019m thinking about. Sliding his eyes away, he greets Meredith and MiShaun.</p><p>He must be over our breakup last fall, and our exchange in Austin just a few weeks ago\u2014when he said I could be different with you and I refused to be that girl. This is the third time we\u2019ve seen each other since then, and he doesn\u2019t seem at all resentful. He hasn\u2019t really flirted with me, either\u2014not any more than he does with everyone. Maybe the coming month won\u2019t be so bad.</p> <p>When I turn back to Brooke, she\u2019s staring at Graham as he listens to Quinton relate some amusing story in his usual animated manner. Graham laughs, arms crossed loosely over his chest, and Brooke\u2019s eyes roam over him in a way that makes me want to stomp on her foot. She and Graham have been close for years. He says she\u2019s never been more than a friend, and there\u2019s no reason for me to distrust that. I can\u2019t tell Graham who to keep as friends; I wouldn\u2019t accept any guy doing that to me. Despite all of these reasons, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be relaxed around her. Not when she\u2019s looking at him like he\u2019s a steak and she\u2019s starving.</p><p>I clear my throat and her ice blue eyes snap to me. There\u2019s no guilt in them, but maybe she\u2019s just incapable of feeling any. I remind myself that she was sympathetic, even supportive, when everything blew up in my face with Reid. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been, Brooke?\u201d She\u2019s a couple of inches taller than me, plus she\u2019s wearing spiked heels\u2014a true LA girl. Not for the first time, she reminds me of my stepmother.</p><p>Her smile is pretty and calculated, like a magazine cover. \u201cVery well, actually. I\u2019ve got a little rom-com thing lined up for the end of the summer, and my agent\u2019s gathered new scripts for me to look at after that\u2019s done. How about you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure she and I discussed the fact that I\u2019m going to college in the fall, but people seldom remember personally unimportant things. Although, Reid remembered. \u201cI decided on going to college. I\u2019m starting this fall.\u201d</p><p>She laughs in that throaty way some girls do that attracts all male attention within hearing distance. \u201cOh that\u2019s right. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to back up and do college now... but I forget how young you are.\u201d</p><p>Graham hears this last bit, and his lips flatten just barely. What the hell does she mean by how young you are? She seems to be ridiculing my age in relation to her own\u2014or Graham's, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s even told her anything about us. As new as this all is, we haven\u2019t discussed who to tell or when. Emily and Dad know, of course\u2014and Chloe by association. Graham\u2019s sister knows, and possibly the rest of his family...</p> <p>They\u2019re both staring at me and I realize I zoned out. \u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, looks like someone didn\u2019t get much sleep last night...\u201d Brooke\u2019s grin is full of comprehension, and my eyes flick to Graham, who shakes his head almost imperceptibly. Whatever he\u2019s told her didn\u2019t include where he spent the night. What exactly is she assuming I was doing? And with who? My face burns as I scramble for something to say.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d MiShaun says, touching my arm. I smile and turn to hug her, grateful for the interruption. \u201cI hear you\u2019re going off to college in the fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. In New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome! I expect to see you on Broadway in no time, headlining, dating some hot leading man, or maybe some sugar daddy Wall Street type.\u201d My glance bounces off of Graham\u2019s. Judging by the semi-smirk of his lips, he\u2019s amused. When he catches me staring at his mouth, his eyes heat and I have to look away.</p><p>\u201cSo, MiShaun... are you still visiting Austin occasionally?\u201d I ask with a conspiratorial smile, and she waggles her brows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually considering a permanent relocation there,\u201d she says, tapping her chin with the index finger of her left hand.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, MiShaun! Is that an engagement ring?\u201d Brooke grabs her hand and squeals as though she\u2019s just won a beauty pageant and the rhinestone-studded crown to go with it.</p> <p>MiShaun\u2019s ring finger sports a near-flawless marquise-cut solitaire.</p><p>I know this because Chloe dragged me along to shop for a tenth anniversary gift Dad didn\u2019t know he was giving. After hours of babbling cut-color-clarity basics, she found the perfect diamond, and then pouted until he bought it. I borrowed Blood Diamond from Emily that weekend, but Chloe totally missed the insult. What a depressing movie, she commented, yawning as she left in the middle of it to take a bubble bath. Nice try, Dad smirked at me.</p><p>\u201cThis settles it\u2014we\u2019re all going out after the shoot is over tomorrow night\u2014we have to celebrate!\u201d Brooke beams at her.</p><p>Graham and I glance at each other. Tomorrow night is our last night together until the premiere, and it appears we\u2019ll be spending the evening in a group, out in public. Crap.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>The first shoot is in the studio\u2014the layout: a stylized schoolroom. Everyone is made up, hair is runway-model-styled, and the clothes are exclusive labels\u2014fitted to us with pins and clips. If people got a 360-view of us, we\u2019d all look a hell of a lot sillier.</p><p>Like the shoot in Austin, the majority of pics are Reid and Emma, separate or together. Emma\u2019s hair is teased and coiffed and I can tell by the set of her mouth and the way she holds her head that she hates it. Her eyes are darkly lined and shadowed, her lips filled in, and she looks closer to twenty-eight than eighteen. I know she hates this, too, though she looks beautiful. Not as beautiful as she did this morning when I woke up to her face snuggling against my chest, but beautiful in a different way\u2014aggressively sexy. The photographer has her biting on the string of pearls around her neck, invoking the memory of her nipping my earlobe last night.</p><p>I\u2019ve never in my life gone over so many sports statistics in my head so frequently. I didn\u2019t know I knew so many sports statistics.</p><p>Batting averages for Jose Reyes become unnecessary mental fodder a few minutes later, when Reid joins Emma and I\u2019m trying to psyche myself for the positions in which they\u2019re about to be placed. They\u2019ve put him in a navy pinstripe suit, crisp white shirt and loose red tie. Next to him, Emma\u2019s outfit is an elegant compliment\u2014a very short, very tight, strapless red dress, which she hitches up at the bodice between shots until the photographer\u2019s assistant pins it tighter down her back.</p><p>Why do photographers insist on putting her in his lap? The guy from Vanity Fair had her wrapping her legs around him, though her posture screamed how uncomfortable she was doing it. Now, she perches on his thighs with his hands splayed at her waist, and then he leans her back like he\u2019s about to kiss her. My entire body is rigid with irritation. The audible photographer instructions would negate this if I wasn\u2019t imagining\u2014if I didn\u2019t know\u2014that they\u2019ve done this before, in private. All illusions that I\u2019m keeping these deliberations under control are shattered when Brooke leans closer, her brow knit, and whispers, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, failing at pretending to be unconcerned as Reid pulls Emma up and turns her so that she\u2019s facing out from him, her legs straddling one of his. His arms are wrapped around her, his head on her bare shoulder, their faces jammed together as the photographer hops around, babbling words like sexy and hot and baby. Is this photo shoot for a PG-13 movie, or an ad for high-priced escort services?</p><p>Emma\u2019s eyes find me and her gaze immediately falls to my thigh, where Brooke\u2019s hand sits. She stares, puzzled, her brows furrowing until the photographer asks her in an annoyed whine why she\u2019s frowning and she wrenches her eyes from my leg.</p><p>I\u2019m smoldering from my head to my toes, watching Reid\u2019s hands move over her body like they belong there, and she\u2019s annoyed that Brooke\u2019s hand sits passively on my leg.</p><p>I suppose one could argue that there\u2019s no photographer ordering the placement of Brooke\u2019s hand. Removing it to her own knee, I shoot up and walk to the back corner where bottles of water and snacks are located. Grabbing a bottle and twisting the cap from it, I wish I could just pour it over my head. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust her. I don\u2019t trust him. And I don\u2019t trust his history with her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Brooke says, appearing next to me, one hand on my back, stroking down. I take a deep breath, her touch calming me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and laugh once, turning and looking down at her with a grim smile. \u201cNothing out of the ordinary. I just really hate photo shoots. The makeup. The crap in my hair. The clothes.\u201d I gesture to the black suit that screams either \u201cchurch\u201d or \u201cfuneral,\u201d depending on your mood. Anyone could guess mine right now\u2014at least Brooke certainly can. I hope it\u2019s because she\u2019s known me for so long and not because I\u2019m so ridiculously transparent.</p><p>She tilts her head to the side a bit, glancing back at Emma and Reid. I don\u2019t follow her gaze. I\u2019m still just trying to breathe while Reid Alexander practically makes out with my girlfriend in the live version of photos millions of people will see. Many of those people already think they make an attractive couple. Against all better judgment, I glance towards them and get confirmation of this fact. They\u2019re both beautiful. Of course they look good together. How could they not?</p><p>\u201cIs there... something going on between you and Emma?\u201d Brooke asks, her LA-smile, as I call it, firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d I hedge, and she does that low-laugh thing, still smiling up at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen jealous Graham before.\u201d She squeezes my bicep and arches a brow. \u201cMmm, very alpha-male.\u201d</p><p>When I scowl, she laughs at me again and I take a deep breath, feeling years less mature. \u201cGod, am I that obvious?\u201d I start to run a hand through my hair, but can\u2019t. The styling for the shoot looks better than my Bill Collins helmet-do during filming, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Either way, it\u2019s untouchable. \u201cAauuugh,\u201d I say, and Brooke laughs again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you and Emma, huh?\u201d She selects a Perrier from the ice bucket and fingers through the snacks, choosing nothing. \u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head once. \u201cNot long.\u201d</p><p>The photographer calls us for group shots, and I\u2019m happy to end this conversation. Talking to Brooke has had a dual effect. I\u2019m less tense, but instantly worried by the jealousy accusation. Alpha-male? Good God, no. Mom and Brynn would lecture me until my ears rang. Possessive men are at the top of their lists of to-be-scorned things. \u201cA self-possessed man is what a psychologically healthy woman wants,\u201d preaches my mother, the psychologist. \u201cNot some guy who dispenses orders and punishment\u2014whether physical or emotional\u2014and distrusts her every move.\u201d</p><p>She brought home enough codependent client stories, a few complete with stalking\u2014two of which turned criminal\u2014to scare my sisters away from those type of guys and scare me away from that type of girl. The type who wants\u2014needs\u2014the jealous boyfriend to prove she has worth. My eyes are on Emma as she talks and laughs with Jenna and MiShaun, and I know she\u2019s not in that category. Compromising and generous, yes. Forgiving, too, I think, watching as Reid moves near her and joins the conversation.</p> <p>Her response to being held too tightly would be a quick exit.</p><p>Her eyes swing to meet mine, and everything in me snaps and sings with pleasure. A slow burn begins at my core and I know it will build until we\u2019re alone in her room again, the rest of the world shut out. There\u2019s a line at the edge of possessive, and she makes me want to walk it. This three-second glance between us reinforces what I know. I love her. Everything else\u2014the ins and outs of my feelings and hers in conjunction with what it all means\u2014can be deciphered in due time. I love her. That\u2019s all that matters, and in this moment, that\u2019s all I am.</p><p>Brooke</p><p>Well, shit. This is more serious than I thought. He may actually believe he\u2019s in love with her.</p><p>I\u2019ve put far too many years into this relationship to lose him like this, to her. I care about Graham deeply, but if he pairs up with Emma, what we have will be over. For some reason, I know this. My intuition is screaming it at me\u2014that I\u2019m losing him. I could be what he wants. I could be sweeter and softer with him. Not so hard. God, I\u2019m tired of being so uncompromisingly hard all the time.</p> <p>If I backpedal and stop this now, linger forever off to the side as his friend and confidant, I could convince Emma that I\u2019m not a threat. I could hold onto his friendship, which means more to me than he\u2019ll ever know.</p><p>But, no. Friendship isn\u2019t enough. I want him. All of him. He\u2019s exactly the type of guy I need, and all I have to do is get Emma out of the way and convince Graham that I can be what he needs. Somewhere between Reid and myself there\u2019s enough deviousness to pull this off. And if this has to be an all-or-nothing battle, then so be it. No time to be squeamish. I\u2019ve lied my ass off for worse causes than landing the perfect guy.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Emma</p><p>Getting out of that tiny dress and the five thousand pins they used to fit it to me like a glove took forever, so I\u2019m the last one out of the studio. Three black cars idle at the curb, waiting to transport the nine of us to the hotel. Brooke climbs into the first car behind Tadd, and I\u2019m both relieved and annoyed at myself for being relieved that Graham isn\u2019t with her.</p><p>Brooke is a force of nature. The last thing any sane girl would want is to get into a tug-of-war with her over a guy. Graham says they\u2019re just friends, and I have to trust him if this is going to work. No matter how beautiful she is. No matter how familiar her casual touches seem to be. No matter how many times I catch her looking at him like he\u2019s on her room service menu.</p> <p>As I\u2019m standing near the last car, scanning for Graham as covertly as possible, someone says, \u201cPssst.\u201d I bite my lip to stifle a yelp when Graham snakes an arm around my waist and drags me into the car. MiShaun, chatting with Jenna a few feet away, raises an eyebrow as I disappear into the back seat, backwards. She bends to see who\u2019s snatched me off of the sidewalk. When she spots Graham, her wide eyes tell me I can expect to be quizzed about this later.</p><p>\u201cGraham,\u201d I hiss, laughing. \u201cYou just made me look like that hapless character in every horror film who\u2019s dumb enough to stand right next to the darkened basement doorway.\u201d</p><p>Grinning mischievously, he kisses the back of my neck, withdrawing his arm before anyone else sees. Thank God for opaque windows. \u201cSo you\u2019re the expendable cheerleader, and I\u2019m the demon, or werewolf...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the mentally unbalanced guy with the chainsaw, yeah.\u201d Aware that I\u2019ll have to sit up straight and keep my hands to myself once someone joins us, I press back against him for a moment, leaning my head onto his shoulder and tracing the top of his hand with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d want to check out Griffith Park in the morning.\u201d His question is a breath in my ear as Jenna moves to stand by the open door, still talking to MiShaun. He flips his hand over and my index finger maps the lines of his palm. \u201cWe\u2019d have to go early to get back in time to leave for the second shoot.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Griffith, but not for years. My family used to go hiking there.\u201d</p><p>My memories of hiking in Griffith have been augmented with photos my parents took there when I was very young. Some are from weeks\u2014days perhaps\u2014before Mom began to get sick. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure if my memories of Griffith Park\u2014or my mother\u2014are genuine. Almost every clear recollection I have of her was caught on film. Perhaps the real memories faded away long ago, supplanted by the unchanging photographs.</p><p>\u201cIf you climb high enough, you can see all of Hollywood,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd the sign.\u201d</p> <p>My childhood scrapbook contains a series of photos Mom took of me near my birthday every year, standing in the same exact spot on some unspecified trail of Griffith. In each of these, the Hollywood sign is stark white against the hill in the background, my own personal growth chart. In the last one, I\u2019d turned six. Her quick downward spiral didn\u2019t allow her to return, and Dad either forgot the tradition or didn\u2019t have the heart to keep it up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I read\u2014sounds cool. I\u2019ll rent a car and have it brought around at, say, 5:30? We can pack coffee thermoses and catch the sunrise.\u201d He takes my hand in his, fingers stroking the back of my arm. His eyes catch and hold mine. \u201cUnless it would be too painful for you to go there.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, twisting my mother\u2019s ring around and around on my finger. \u201cNo. I\u2019d like to go with you.\u201d</p><p>When Jenna starts to get in, I straighten from leaning against Graham, my hands folding primly in my lap. I feel more than hear him chuckle at my suddenly proper posture. Just before Jenna sits down, I hear Reid\u2019s voice. \u201cHey, Jenna\u2014Brooke wants you to ride with her. Wanna switch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay, sure.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m wondering at the oddity of Reid delivering a message for Brooke as he slides in next to me. Graham\u2019s thigh tenses against mine.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Reid says, sticking a hand out to Graham. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Graham answers, reaching over. I sit for two surreal seconds with their hands clasped just above my lap, tension radiating from them both, though neither one\u2019s expression betrays it.</p><p>Swinging his hair from his eyes, Reid glances at me and winks before returning his attention to Graham. His knee presses against mine as he leans forward. \u201cGot any new projects lined up?\u201d</p><p>My face warms as Graham\u2019s fist clenches and unclenches once before settling on his leg. \u201cNot right now. I\u2019m finishing up my last semester at Columbia. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing \u2019til fall\u2014just trying to get into decent shape before then. I\u2019m supposed to do some of my own stunts in the next flick. Hopefully the ones that won\u2019t kill me.\u201d One side of his mouth turns up and he glances at me again.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Graham says.</p><p>Reid clears his throat, looks back at Graham. \u201cSo\u2014theatre degree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish Lit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>Having reached the end of conversable topics, Reid sits back and they both fall silent while I sit mutely between them, contemplating how the hell I got myself into this incredibly awkward position.</p><p>When we reach the hotel, Reid slips out, turning and offering his hand. Without thinking, I take it. Pulling me alongside him, he places his opposite palm at my lower back as he smiles for the paparazzi gathered around the entrance while our bodyguards ensure that we get to the door unmolested. I have no chance to look back for Graham until we reach the lobby, at which point Reid drops his hand from my back. \u201cWe\u2019re all meeting in my room in a little while\u2014you\u2019re coming, right?\u201d</p><p>Before I reply, he turns and looks past Graham, whose eyes connect with mine. Our hours to be alone are dwindling down. Brooke walks up behind Graham, her hand coming to rest on his arm, arguably unintentional, if she didn\u2019t do it so habitually. \u201cHey,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, you told Emma and Graham about tonight, right?\u201d Reid asks no trace of the hostility\u2014let alone the desire to maim each other permanently\u2014that usually colors every word they say to each other.</p><p>Graham appears as astonished as I am at this friendly exchange, especially when Brooke replies, \u201cOh, shit, I forgot,\u201d without biting Reid\u2019s head off first. Linking her arm with Graham\u2019s, she smiles up at him, her perfect faux-tan and red-nailed talons standing out against his paler skin. \u201cMixer in Reid\u2019s room! You have to come.\u201d She turns her toothpaste-ad smile on me, saying, \u201cOh, and you too, Emma,\u201d like an afterthought.</p><p>The desire to stomp on her foot returns, a hundred times stronger than it was this morning. Worse, her calculating smile says she\u2019s more than aware of it.</p><p>REID</p><p>Watching Brooke and Emma face off is possibly the most involuntarily hot thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed. They\u2019re subtle, and perfectly civil to each other, while under the surface lurks a murderous biting, kicking, hair-pulling, bitch-slapping violence. The only thing that would have made it better\u2014much better, in fact\u2014is if I was the inspiration for those vicious feelings. But no. It\u2019s all for Graham.</p><p>I sort of get it. I mean, he\u2019s good-looking. And he\u2019s got that mysterious element about him that chicks are drawn to. I know his protectiveness is attractive to Brooke. When she and I were together and I got the slightest bit possessive of her\u2014which, granted, has never come naturally for me\u2014she loved it. In fact, the more jealous I was, the more controlling I acted, the more she liked it. Kind of freaked me out a little, actually.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re flirting with her too much in front of Graham.\u201d Brooke walks through my door a quarter hour early, issuing unrequested critiques of my progress. \u201cIf you make him jealous before anything happens between Graham and me, you\u2019ll never get her away from him.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cThanks for the vote of confidence. And that\u2019s not what happened last time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turns, arms crossed under her breasts and wearing her patented I-know-better-than-you expression, stopping when her eyes flick over my bare chest. I haven\u2019t yet buttoned the shirt I threw on after my shower. Clearing her throat and averting her eyes to anything in the room but me, she retorts, \u201cLast time, he was fighting falling for her. Now he\u2019s not. The only way he\u2019ll give her up is if she falls into bed with you. And since you were a big fail on that last fall\u2014before she even knew what a man-whore you are, I think we can safely assume that isn\u2019t going to happen easily.\u201d</p><p>I take a slow breath. No way am I letting her know how much I want to test the challenge she just threw down, just because she tossed it at me. She\u2019s probably correct, though\u2014neither of them is going to cave easily. \u201cShit, Brooke, if you think it\u2019s so impossible, why bother?\u201d</p><p>She glares at me. \u201cI told you. I want him. I\u2019m right for him, and it\u2019s not impossible. It\u2019s just going to take shrewd planning and careful execution, and I don\u2019t want you screwing it up.\u201d</p><p>The combination of a hot ex-lover alone in my room and the cleavage-flaunting way her arms are crossed is killing me. With effort, I cut my eyes away from her heaving chest and deceptively flawless face and pour a shot of whatever the hell is sitting on my dresser.</p> <p>\u201cHow much attention have you been paying to following your own orders, Brooke? Emma has definitely noticed the fact that you can\u2019t keep your hands off of him. As far as condemning your ingenious plan before it gets off the ground, that will do it. If she feels threatened and talks to him about his relationship with you, this whole little plot could be toast.\u201d</p><p>I watch her face in the mirror over the dresser. A crease appears between her brows, her self-confidence slipping faintly. \u201cHow do you know? That she\u2019s noticed anything, I mean.\u201d</p><p>What I wonder is how Brooke hasn\u2019t noticed. I thought girls were better tuned to each other than that. \u201cI was standing right next to her, and I\u2019m observant.\u201d She makes a noise of derision I choose to ignore. \u201cShe\u2019s noticing. So cool it yourself, or you may have to give my bed a try if you want to get laid.\u201d If the objects of our affections weren\u2019t showing up in five minutes, I would give that proposition a more enthusiastic effort.</p><p>\u201cAnother offer to sleep with you? How sweet. I\u2019m flattered. Have you forgotten what I told you last time?\u201d It\u2019s almost impossible to associate this Brooke with the girl she was when I met her. Almost.</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d I saunter closer, but she doesn\u2019t budge. She\u2019s always been tall and thin\u2014willowy, George would say. When I was fourteen and she was fifteen, we were almost eye to eye up close. I\u2019ve got several inches on her now. With her arms locked under her breasts, the view from my vantage point is greatly improved. \u201cI also remember what we were like together, even if we were just inexperienced kids.\u201d I shrug. \u201cWell, one of us was inexperienced.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s silent, but her eyes are furious. Every time we start to get into it, I want her to feel what I felt when I saw the photos and read the story that ended us. But that\u2019s not possible. She has no heart, and she managed to stomp the shit out of mine years ago. I\u2019m playing games with a viper and I damn well know it. I should feel sorry for Graham, but I don\u2019t really know him, he\u2019s got a girl I want, and I\u2019m in the mood to be petty.</p><p>\u201cLook. We\u2019ve got time before the premiere. She and I have an interview schedule from hell, but that means we\u2019ll be around each other, a lot, without Graham\u2019s interference. I suggest you work on him from the same angle. He can\u2019t hang around LA\u2014he\u2019s got school. Isn\u2019t he graduating or something? Why don\u2019t you show up in New York for that. Hang around after.\u201d</p><p>She nods, her poker face firmly in place. \u201cI\u2019d already considered doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s do it, then. Divide and conquer.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s so outwardly cool, but her breaths are too shallow. \u201cI still say don\u2019t push her until I get to Graham. She\u2019ll turn you down on principle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d We\u2019re six inches apart, and still she isn\u2019t backing away.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Reid.\u201d She puts one hand up, to stop me, I suppose, but her hand is on bare skin and her eyes widen and I know we both feel the surge.</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>She stares up at me like I\u2019m some sort of twisted riddle, and then a knock sounds on the door and she jumps, muttering, \u201cJesus,\u201d under her breath.</p><p>I button the shirt as I walk to the door. There\u2019s something gratifying about making an ex want you, even for a second.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>I didn\u2019t sleep in Emma\u2019s room last night.</p><p>There were no let\u2019s-get-hammered games in Reid\u2019s room since we have the final photo shoot today, but Brooke had no trouble convincing Tadd to man the bar and shake up margaritas. Even though straight-up shots were out, everyone had enough tequila to tamp down inhibitions and loosen tongues. And Emma and I had just enough to be hazardous.</p> <p>I took one look at her half-mast eyes and knew I\u2019d fail any test of having her in bed with nothing but boxers and t-shirts between us. Worse? I wanted to fail it, and we\u2019d spent the whole evening not touching.</p><p>My sexual history began with Zoe, followed by a self-imposed dry spell waiting for Cara to be born, and Zoe to come back around\u2014which didn\u2019t happen. Next up, a sampling of indiscriminate college hookups. Nothing has been ultimately satisfying, and while I was capable of feeling turned on and wanting a physical connection, I never felt anything more intense. Nothing deeper, nothing emotionally linked. Not until Emma. By the time I left her standing in that airport last October, I wanted so much with her that it scared the hell out of me. I hoped it would fade with time, and after the VF photo shoot in March, I felt confident I was getting over it.</p><p>And then there she was, a month later\u2014standing in that damned coffee shop, our eyes locked over Cara\u2019s head. My daughter had demanded hot chocolate after her dance rehearsal, shoving her cold little fingers under my sweater to prove her need for it. If we\u2019d not stopped exactly there, exactly then, Emma and I would have never crossed paths when I didn\u2019t have my guard up. I\u2019m not sure if I believe in fate, but this could be evidence of it.</p><p>They call it falling in love because it\u2019s less like stepping and more like tripping. Tripping is the part where you\u2019re still trying to remain upright. I hadn\u2019t fought it with Zoe. I just fell right in, head first. With Emma, I fought it all the way down, and now, I\u2019ve lost.</p><p>Emma: Are you sleeping here?</p><p>Me: Not a good idea tonight</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer for several minutes, during which I called myself all sorts of idiot, because that was an open invitation, as was the progressively unreserved look in her eyes all evening. I only wanted to be sure of her feelings, not make her wonder about mine.</p><p>Me: This has nothing and everything to do with how much i want you. If i was in your bed tonight...after the alcohol...i want you. Trust me.</p><p>Emma: I kind of feel like a hussy now</p><p>Me: NO, that isn\u2019t what i mean. It\u2019s me. It would be too difficult. Tomorrow night, no drinking, and i can be good.</p><p>Emma: Well dammit you should have told me this before margaritas. I would have practiced my just say no. To alcohol that is. :(</p><p>Me: God how do you make me laugh through this. Hussy, indeed. I\u2019m one nudge from coming to your room and ravishing you to hell.</p><p>Emma: I want you to</p><p>Me: OMG emma...</p><p>Emma: I\u2019m sorry</p><p>Two rings. Three rings. Please don\u2019t go to voicemail was running through my head. She answered talking. \u201cGraham, I\u2019m sorry, really, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t be sorry. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling you.\u201d I lay back on my bed, eyes closed. The alcohol buzz was diminishing but not gone. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, Emma.\u201d My voice was almost a whisper. \u201cDo you remember those things I said I wanted to do to you?\u201d A few of our calls and Skype conversations over the past couple of weeks had reduced both of us to mush.</p><p>Her reply was an exhalation of a pant. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that has changed. Increased, maybe. Some of those things are looking quite tame, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. I\u2019m not even sure what that\u2014what that means...\u201d</p><p>I pictured her lying back on her bed exactly as I was on mine. \u201cYes. I know. Which is why we\u2019re waiting a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going back to New York.\u201d</p><p>Her sulky tone made me chuckle. \u201cYes. And I\u2019m coming back to LA in three weeks.\u201d</p><p>Her sigh was faint. Not relieved, or exasperated. Just... accepting. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, sounding so much like Cara when she doesn\u2019t get her way and she knows she isn\u2019t going to.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to take advantage of you, or push you\u2014\u201d Lies, lies, lies\u2014I wanted her so bad I could conjure up her scent, imagine the feel of her skin under my fingertips...</p><p>\u201cBut Graham, I\u2019m pushing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My voice is like a growl\u2014so appropriate to the feral hunger coursing through my body. \u201cAnd in three weeks, I\u2019m going to let you. If you still want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>At 5:30 a.m., we meet in the lobby\u2014which is deserted except for a bored desk clerk who gives us a disinterested once-over. Flashback to our mornings in Austin, up before everyone and heading out to run. I remember stepping out of the elevator and seeing her waiting in the lobby, or getting there first and waiting for her, looking up at the soft chime, stainless steel doors swooshing open and delivering her to the ground floor. I loved those mornings.</p><p>I hand her a thermos when she comes to stand next to me, fighting the urge to slip my arms around her and kiss her. \u201cReady?\u201d I ask, and she nods. Tossing the backpack onto one shoulder, I take her hand. This is a risk, if only to cross the lobby. I don\u2019t want her mortified over stories of multiple hookups like she was in Austin, so we have to remain a secret until after the premiere. I get that, but it still sucks. \u201cI packed water, bagels and a blanket. I figured this morning was more about watching the sunrise and less about exercise.\u201d</p><p>Her hand squeezes mine. \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>The Jeep is ideal for the early morning drive and the cool weather but not conducive to quiet conversation. We have to yell over the road noise to hear each other. Falling silent after a few minutes, we just hold hands and watch the street lamps start to pop off as the sky begins to lighten. I spent an hour on the Internet last night, making sure of the route to Griffith and the trail to take once we get there. The sun is already a half-orb above the horizon by the time we get to the spot I mapped out and spread the blanket.</p><p>Pressed together, we sip the coffee and watch what\u2019s left of the sunrise. Perhaps I should say she watches it while I watch her. I\u2019ve seldom been this close to her and allowed myself the pleasure of staring, of drinking her in\u2014all the seemingly trivial details. The indistinct image of a webcam never revealed the fine blondish hairs at her temple, and the darkness of her bed hides the freckle behind her ear and the blush across her cheeks when she realizes I\u2019m examining her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaning to her, I tell her softly, \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lift as she glances into my eyes before closing hers. \u201cNo, you are.\u201d</p><p>My mouth pulls up on one side. We\u2019re a little off the beaten path, but not so far that we can\u2019t hear people walking by, talking. \u201cGod,\u201d one of them says, stopping just out of sight where there\u2019s a perfect view of the sunrise. \u201cSo beautiful!\u201d</p><p>Emma and I suppress our laughter, attempting to avoid detection. I kiss her softly. \u201cSee, he agrees with me,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>She leans up, her hand on my jaw. \u201cMaybe he agrees with me.\u201d When she starts to giggle, I cover her mouth with mine, partly to silence her but mostly because I can\u2019t escape the need to kiss her again.</p><p>REID</p><p>It hadn\u2019t occurred to me what a huge advantage this photo shoot is for getting Emma used to me touching her again. Not that she\u2019s particularly responding to it. I mourn the loss of that wistful, spellbound look she had back when we first began filming School Pride last August, but then again the fact that she\u2019s less affected by me makes up for it.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m one of those guys\u2014more turned on by what I can\u2019t have than anything else. When you think about it, though, how surprising is that? When getting girls is as simple as deciding that you want one\u2014no different, really, from deciding what to have for lunch\u2014of course the ones who stand out will be the ones who don\u2019t come when called. Emma is like that pizza I can only get in one hole-in-the-wall place in the middle of Brooklyn, and nowhere else. If I lived in Brooklyn, maybe it\u2019d be no big deal. But I live in LA, and goddamn do I hate it when I think about that pizza I can\u2019t have.</p><p>We\u2019re on some estate in the LA hills, but the backdrop is very middle of nowhere. The grounds are rustic and native, but carefully cultivated to look that way rather than just left wild. My parents would probably hate it. Our lawn looks more like it belongs in the English countryside\u2014bordering hedgerows and shaped shrubberies and roses, etcetera. It\u2019s impressive but sort of laughable and out of sync at the same time.</p> <p>Emma is perched on the wooden-slat seat of a swing attached to a high limb of a stories-tall tree. Staring straight up through the branches, I wonder how they got the ropes attached that high\u2014if someone climbed this tree like they might have done a hundred years ago, or if they brought in a truck with a ladder or one of those bucket things like the guys who work on telephone lines use. While the photographer reframes the shot for what feels like the hundredth time and we wait for instructions, I grip the ropes just over Emma\u2019s hands, my pinkies grazing her index fingers.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t get a lunch break soon, I\u2019m going to start nibbling on you,\u201d I murmur, careful not to lean too close. \u201cI\u2019m freaking starving.\u201d Emma\u2019s stomach growls just then, which makes both of us laugh. The photographer\u2019s head snaps up and he starts taking shots. Damn if I\u2019m not thinking about that pizza now. And then Emma telling me yes in my room that afternoon last fall, hours before everything went to hell.</p><p>\u201cReid, go ahead and give her a gentle push.\u201d I pull the swing back and let her go, and she swings out and right back to me.</p><p>I\u2019ve never tried to win a girl over by feigning friendship-only intentions, mostly because it seems counter-intuitive. Brooke\u2019s plan isn\u2019t infallible, but if she succeeds in getting Graham in her bed, Emma will be distraught. And I\u2019ll be right there to assure her she\u2019s desirable and provide emotional support\u2014the sort of support everyone needs after discovering infidelity. She was attracted to me before. There\u2019s no reason those feelings can\u2019t be revived, with Graham out of the way. All I have to do is be patient.</p><p>Not exactly my forte.</p><p>Chapter 14</p> <p>Brooke</p><p>\u201cOkay people!\u201d Elevating my voice above the music and general bar noise, I clank a spoon against my daiquiri glass until everyone looks my way. \u201cWe\u2019re here to celebrate\u2014or mourn, depending on your interpretation of the event\u2014the fact that our friend MiShaun has decided to take this smokin\u2019 hot body\u2014\u201d I pull her up from her chair and pirouette her in a circle \u201c\u2014and give it to one guy for the rest of eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooooo,\u201d Tadd says, hands cupped around his mouth, and everyone laughs.</p><p>\u201cTadd Wyler, what the hell do you care what I do with my body?\u201d MiShaun asks him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m objecting on general principle,\u201d he answers. Standing, he takes her hands and holds them out to her sides, scanning her curves in the tight little black dress she\u2019s wearing. \u201cPlus, it seems a shame to deprive the straight end of the male population of this sort of perfection.\u201d</p><p>MiShaun shoves him back into his seat with a laugh. \u201cThe male population has mostly been deprived of it on personal principle.\u201d Smoothing her hands down her hips and cocking one eyebrow at him, she adds, \u201cThis body is more discriminating than some others seated around this table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now,\u201d Tadd says. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to talk about Quinton that way.\u201d</p><p>Details of Quinton\u2019s on-again, off-again relationship with his childhood sweetheart, along with allegations of a few casual hookups around LA, have been plaguing him for the past month. Apparently, Mr. Hottest Up-and-Coming Star played the field too close to a designated \u201con\u201d period, and his girlfriend\u2014who\u2019s close friends with his sister\u2014caught wind of it and went on a tell-all rampage. Boys. They never learn.</p> <p>\u201cDude!\u201d Quinton says, shaking his head. \u201cLow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes and raising my glass. \u201cTo MiShaun. May she be happy with her computer guy, and may he be freaky in hot and stimulating ways.\u201d</p><p>MiShaun hides her face behind her hands as everyone clinks glasses.</p><p>One of the bodyguards walks up behind Reid and leans over to speak to him in a low voice, pointing to a couple of girls\u2014women, actually\u2014standing off to the side. They\u2019re early twenties and hot. Not good, and no way for me to telepathically threaten him because he\u2019s pointedly refusing to look in my direction. As he slides from his chair and strolls over to his drooling fans, I try not to watch too closely because I don\u2019t want to call Emma\u2019s attention to him.</p><p>Too late\u2014dammit, she\u2019s already watching him. He\u2019s smiling that easy, sexy smile, and the women are all stupid-melty at the sight of him so close, in the flesh. One of them asks to squeeze his bicep\u2014hello, creepy\u2014and when he consents, flexing, they both coo over him. Ugh. Directing the bodyguard to take their phones, he poses with each of them separately and together, their arms wrapped around his torso like seaweed. And then, still grinning, he shakes hands with each of them before turning and walking back to the table.</p><p>I have to admit, I\u2019m astonished. He didn\u2019t pull out his phone, or jot a number on a napkin, or confer with the bodyguard to escort them back to the hotel to await his pleasure. Nothing.</p><p>Emma\u2019s head leans at the slightest angle, observing him. Glancing her way as he pulls his chair out, Reid smiles at her. When Meredith asks her a question and she turns to answer, he turns those stormy blue eyes on me, one eyebrow rising in a quick non-verbal See?</p><p>I incline my head. Well done. Smug son of a bitch. I signal the waiter for another round of daiquiris for MiShaun and me, and scan everyone from my vantage point at the head of the table.</p><p>Reid sits at the opposite end, now chatting with Quinton and knocking back another Jack and Coke. Jenna sits next to Quinton, and then Graham, next to me. MiShaun is on my right, then Tadd, Emma and Meredith. My eyes shift back to Emma, who\u2019s having a silent exchange with Graham as she sips her drink. I thought she\u2019d ordered a Long Island iced tea, but from the looks of it, it appears she\u2019s drinking an actual iced tea. And Graham is either drinking straight-up vodka on the rocks or water. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cSome reason you\u2019re going teetotaler tonight, Graham?\u201d I smile, chin in hand. \u201cNot planning on driving anywhere, I assume?\u201d</p><p>His glance towards Emma and back is rapid, but not rapid enough for me to miss it. \u201cMmm, no, just not in the mood. I have an early flight tomorrow morning. Nothing worse than flying hungover.\u201d</p><p>He says this as though he\u2019s ever in his life flown hungover, which I doubt. I\u2019ve seen Graham under the influence, but never smashed. This is just another of his always-in-control qualities\u2014one that used to bother me, when I was in my phase of going hard and getting as trashed as humanly possible. I wanted him to join in. I didn\u2019t see then that getting liquored up and trying to seduce him was never going to work. Graham doesn\u2019t do drunken hookups.</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Oh shit. Are he and Emma hooking up tonight? Is that what this is about? Is this the first time, or a repeat? This could affect my best laid plans\u2014so to speak. I can\u2019t imagine how to discover the answer to that question, though. Damn, damn, damn.</p><p>I fight to keep my voice even while my brain is going a hundred miles per hour. \u201cSo you\u2019re going back home tomorrow, then. Did you miss class this week?\u201d</p><p>He rests his chin in his hand, too. \u201cYeah, but two are independent study, and the other two gave me a pass because I completed research papers early. So it\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re in this mirrored pose, a foot apart, over the corner of the table. I ask him about his final classes, as though I\u2019m interested in the specifics of them\u2014and perhaps I would be, if I knew enough about literature to know what the hell he\u2019s talking about. I\u2019m listening just closely enough to reply and form questions while I\u2019m cataloguing details I haven\u2019t had the chance to savor in a while.</p><p>I\u2019ve said that Graham is the best-looking guy in the cast\u2014a towering claim considering the fact that Reid, Quinton and Tadd are no fugly ducklings and are constantly publicized as Hollywood\u2019s hottest young celebs. Quinton is solid, cut musculature while Tadd embodies the buff surfer look, and Reid is so beautiful that sometimes I\u2019m jealous of the perfection of his face.</p><p>But Graham is all dark, smoldering male. In the hazy, subdued light of the bar and against his lighter-toned skin, his dark chocolate hair and smoky eyes are almost black. He\u2019s wearing his usual expression\u2014cool and easygoing, but shuttered. My God, he\u2019s hot, and though he must have some idea of this, he rarely exhibits that cocky veneer that comes second nature to Reid.</p><p>He\u2019s rattling off something about Dostoyevsky and existentialism when suddenly he stops mid-sentence and runs a hand through his hair. One lock of hair sticks straight up in front. \u201cSorry. That can\u2019t possibly be as fascinating to you as your acting skills indicate.\u201d His smile is self-deprecating, lashes sweeping down as he sighs. \u201cYou should stop me before I get that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, \u201cjust because I can\u2019t even say Dosty-Dosto\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDostoyevsky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, Dostoyevsky, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t find something you\u2019re that enthusiastic about interesting.\u201d That adorable cowlick is begging me to reach out and blend it in with the rest of his hair, but I recall what Reid had to say about my casual touches in front of Emma and I keep my hands to myself with immense effort. Having raised the thought of her in my head, I have to fight the urge to check if she\u2019s even watching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Graham clears his throat and glances down the table at her. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that he at least forgot all about her for the space of that little literary exchange, even if he\u2019s recalling her existence now. When he smiles and winks at her, I want to emit a sharp little scream and stomp like I used to do as a small child whenever someone told me no. His eyes swing back to mine and I swallow that outburst and smile instead.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Graham is leaving California in the morning. I\u2019m enjoying interacting with everyone, celebrating MiShaun\u2019s engagement to David, but I\u2019m hyper aware of the hours and minutes ticking away. His wink is a tiny electrical zap, darting a zing of pleasure through me.</p><p>He\u2019s sitting at the other end of the table, with Brooke hanging on his every word, and I\u2019m trying not to be jealous\u2014or concerned.</p> <p>That attempt isn\u2019t going so well.</p><p>I tell myself that I\u2019m only jealous of the time I\u2019m losing with him, which rings half-true and half-hollow.</p><p>\u201cEmma, I hear you and Reid are doing Ellen?\u201d Meredith snaps me out of my gloomy trance.</p><p>\u201cYeah, in a couple of weeks. I\u2019m scared to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to be scared,\u201d Reid says, swinging his attention to our conversation. \u201cShe\u2019s just as nice in person as she seems.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said that about Ryan,\u201d I accuse, smirking. \u201cAre you going to tell me that every time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was right, wasn\u2019t I? And no, if someone\u2019s going to be tough, I\u2019ll give you a heads up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>He hooks my pinky with his. \u201cPromise. And for the record, I\u2019ve never broken a pinky swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many pinky swears have you made, Mr. Alexander?\u201d Meredith asks, arms folded loosely over her chest as she leans back to watch our discussion play out in front of her.</p><p>\u201cMeredith,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s classified information. Top secret. Plus I tried the Boy Scout promise on her months ago, and she promptly accused me of never having been a Boy Scout. Imagine.\u201d He blinks innocently and we can\u2019t help but laugh. This far away from the humiliation of last fall, his wicked reputation feels less personal.</p> <p>Lips flattened, Meredith says, \u201cYes, imagine. I\u2019m thinking this is numero uno pinky swear for you, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Our fingers are still hooked on the table in front of Meredith, who angles one eyebrow in question before I withdraw my hand and give Reid a stern look. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m choosing to believe you and your pinky swear. Don\u2019t blow that trust.\u201d</p><p>He looks back, steadily, suddenly more serious than he was seconds ago. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It takes forever for the hallway in front of my door to clear. Graham\u2019s room is on the same floor, but two turns and a couple dozen rooms away from mine. I text him when everything grows quiet and I haven\u2019t seen a soul pass my peephole in five minutes. It\u2019s nearly 2 a.m.</p><p>When he walks up to the door, I swing it open silently, and try to close it just as quietly. He\u2019s wearing jeans and canvas flip flops and holding the ice bucket from his room. \u201cThis is your idea of subterfuge?\u201d I whisper, pointing at the bucket and trying not to laugh.</p><p>He pretends offense. \u201cThe vending area is between our rooms, so I thought it made more sense than pretending to be lurking in the hall for no apparent reason.\u201d</p><p>I take the bucket from his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s still empty.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cWell, duh, I wasn\u2019t going to waste time getting actual ice.\u201d I\u2019ve left one small lamp glowing in the corner, and his black eyes regard me in the dim light. While waiting for the hallway to clear, I changed into a dark violet shorts and tank set from Victoria\u2019s Secret that Emily gave me before I left town. Purple is the I\u2019m-a-woman version of pink, she cautioned, fixing me with a knowing look. Graham\u2019s slow perusal is like a caress, leaving me breathless and feeling somehow powerful and vulnerable at once. He raises one eyebrow. \u201cUnless we need it for something kinky.\u201d</p> <p>My blush is immediate, and I turn to put the ice bucket on my sink counter in an effort to hide it, in case the low lighting isn\u2019t low enough. His arms slide around me from behind, his cheek nuzzling and stroking my hair back from my neck. His lips are warm and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s supporting me, because my legs feel boneless as he places light, sucking kisses from the curve between my shoulder and neck to the sensitive hollow behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cIf I traced an ice cube along this line,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cit would melt instantly, because your skin is so hot.\u201d I gasp lightly, imagining his tongue following a line of icy water sluicing down my neck. Turning me gently, his hands are in my hair and then his mouth is on mine, so gentle and slow that kissing him feels like a dream. I don\u2019t want to wake up.</p><p>A minute later, I find my calves hitting the edge of the mattress as they did two nights ago. I scarcely have the capacity to register the question of how he manages to transport me all the way across a room without my notice before he lifts me into the center of the bed, still kissing me.</p><p>Rolling to his back, Graham\u2019s strong hands pull me halfway over his body, one palm on my thigh and the other cradling my head. His jeans are rough against my bare legs, but he\u2019s kicked off his shoes somewhere between the door and the bed. My knee falls between his legs as he angles up, never breaking his mouth from mine for more than half a second. His hand runs along my back from shoulder to waist, lightly over my hip and down the leg that presses between his.</p><p>His heart hammers beneath my hand, matching the tempo of my own, and I\u2019m not content to lie here and let him find his equilibrium. When I lift my hand from his chest and slide it under his shirt, he makes a noise between his teeth\u2014tsss\u2014like I\u2019ve burned him. \u201cGod, Emma.\u201d His hand covers mine with the t-shirt between us. I spread my fingers over his abdomen and his breath catches.</p><p>At first, he doesn\u2019t loosen his hold, stilling my hand with his. Distracting him with kisses, I wait until his grip goes slack, and when it does I set my fingers to roam slowly over his sleek skin and hard muscle, moving under his shirt soundlessly. He holds himself very still, but when my fingers glide lower to the waistband of his jeans, his eyes flash open and stare into mine, his hand clasping mine again.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep in your jeans,\u201d I say, repressing the urge to giggle at this deceptively rational argument for why he should remove his pants in my bed.</p><p>\u201cI probably should.\u201d We\u2019re both whispering, as though everyone in the hotel will be able to hear us if our voices rise to regular levels.</p><p>\u201cGraham, I\u2019m not going to take advantage of you. I promise.\u201d I hold up two fingers, Reid\u2019s silly months-ago vow still front-and-center from our conversation earlier tonight. \u201cScout\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d he says, laughing softly. He caresses my face, his thumb moving over my lower lip as his expression transforms from amusement to want. \u201cI can\u2019t promise the same thing. And that\u2019s why.\u201d My eyes slide from his and he takes an unsteady breath. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t bring anything with me tonight\u2014as in, ah, protection.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bring condoms, which means he wasn\u2019t just assuming we weren\u2019t going to, he was actively planning that we weren\u2019t going to. I bite my lip. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want. Hell yes, I want. Three weeks, remember? I need to, um, get tested when I get home, too.\u201d When my eyes widen, he adds, \u201cI\u2019m sure everything is fine, because I\u2019ve always been careful.\u201d His mouth twists. \u201cWell, ever since Cara I\u2019ve been careful. I was a whole lot of stupid before that, because you always believe that stuff is never going to happen to you, until it does.\u201d</p><p>I find myself wondering how many girls there\u2019ve been. And then I wonder if Brooke was ever one of them, even if it didn\u2019t result in a relationship, even if it was casual. I want to ask, but the questions are stuck in my throat and won\u2019t get near the surface. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised\u2014he\u2019s much too good at this to have been celibate since his daughter was born. He hasn\u2019t asked me about my sexual history at all, and I wonder if he doesn\u2019t care, or if my inexperience is just that freaking obvious.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He takes my chin between his fingertips, obliging me to look at him. \u201cI just... I need both of us to be sure.\u201d His finger traces the frown line on my forehead. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry whether this has anything to do with wanting you. It doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t ask about the multitude of girls I imagined parading through his bed. I don\u2019t ask about Brooke. I just sigh and curl up against his chest, though I don\u2019t remove my hand from under his shirt. Gained ground is gained ground. \u201cOkay.\u201d I feel distinctly pouty.</p><p>Laughing quietly, his arms encircle me. \u201cHmm. I\u2019m not ready to stop kissing you, you know,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d I mumble into his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWell, now you do.\u201d</p><p>I lean my head back on his arm, my eyes meeting his. \u201cSo many warnings, so little action...\u201d I sigh.</p><p>He growls and flips me onto my back, and we don\u2019t fall asleep until close to 4 a.m. In the end his jeans are in a heap on the floor and my tank is decidedly askew and he\u2019s taken at least three very serious breaks. Inexperience or not, I\u2019m reasonably certain this adds up in my favor.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>I was convinced Emma would cause me to internally combust last night.</p><p>It\u2019s a lucky thing my sense of responsibility is so unswerving, because at some point between arriving in her room and falling asleep, I no longer cared whether or not she loved me\u2014the desire was so powerful and overwhelming that my sense of emotional self-preservation was prepared to toss itself out the window and to hell with it. I must have suspected that weakness skulking below the surface, which was why I left my wallet (and the condom inside it) in my room when I went to hers. I know myself that well, at least\u2014using protection is second nature. Not once since Zoe have I had unprotected sex.</p><p>I promised Emma three weeks, and I\u2019ll willingly keep that promise, as worried as I might be that she doesn\u2019t feel as strongly as I do. I suppose love is never a sure thing, no matter what words are spoken. Love requires a leap of faith into the abyss, every time.</p><p>I scribble a sappy note to leave on her nightstand. My sisters call me an old-fashioned boy. Perhaps this is the result of too much close-reading and analyzing of eighteenth century literature. Even still, there are romantic, old-school sides of myself I\u2019ve never fully unleashed, and for some reason Emma brings every one of them to the surface.</p><p>Zoe didn\u2019t care to be courted. When I left notes in her locker or under her windshield wiper, she asked if she had to respond in kind, and also why couldn\u2019t I just text her like a normal person? And though she appreciated having an armful of carnations delivered from the Choir Cupid on Valentine\u2019s Day, she paid little attention to the attached poem that took me a week to write.</p><p>Relatively sure that I was past such unmanly silliness by the time I met Emma, my feelings for her slammed into me, unexpected and inspiring. All of a sudden I found myself rivaling Keats and Rilke for romantic musings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first note I left for Emma was in Austin, after she told me about her mother\u2019s death and we fell asleep watching television. That one was the result of several longer, more maudlin versions. I left the abbreviated edition on her night table, and threw the others away in my room. Since then, I\u2019ve crafted poems to her in my head (discarded without being jotted down), written her two letters (put through the shredder in Mom\u2019s home office), and tapped out multiple soul-baring texts (deleted without even being saved to drafts).</p><p>As I pull her door shut and it locks behind me, I have a two-second panic attack about the note I just left for her before I take a deep breath and head for my room. There\u2019s no taking it back, apart from the fact that I don\u2019t actually want to.</p><p>I round the corner and inexplicably, Brooke is standing in front of me. \u201cGraham?\u201d Her expression is bemused, head at an angle like a bemused puppy. She frowns at the ice bucket in my hand. \u201cAre you... getting ice?\u201d She points back to where the vending alcove is, which I\u2019d have passed if I was coming from my room.</p><p>\u201cUm. No?\u201d My mind is blank. I have no idea what to offer as an excuse. Thank God I\u2019m wearing pants.</p> <p>She glances behind me towards Emma\u2019s door, but thankfully, she doesn\u2019t voice the question that flashes through her eyes, because I\u2019d have to tell her it\u2019s none of her business, which would answer her curiosity in any case. For some reason, she directs her best faux-smile at me. I seldom get the faux-smile from Brooke. \u201cAre you about to check out?\u201d she asks. Her Louis Vuitton overnight bag is slung over her shoulder, D&amp;G sunglasses perched on her head, and I\u2019m not sure what label the stilettos are, but I\u2019d be willing to bet they\u2019re the ones with the red undersides. She\u2019s a walking LA-girl stereotype.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve gotta grab a quick shower and then get a taxi to LAX.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take you.\u201d She shrugs and turns to walk to my room with me. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a booked schedule. And we didn\u2019t get to hang out much this trip.\u201d</p><p>I have been focused on Emma for the past three days. I didn\u2019t consider that Brooke might want face time, too. \u201cOh. Okay, cool. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>When we get to my room, I tell her to make herself at home while I shower. Twenty minutes later we\u2019re crossing the lobby as Reid is coming in with his bodyguard. \u201cYou two leaving?\u201d he asks, unnecessarily, since we\u2019re both holding luggage.</p> <p>I\u2019m anticipating Brooke\u2019s sure-to-be acerbic answer when she says, without a trace of condescension, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m taking Graham to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d He shoves his mirrored shades up and sticks a hand out. \u201cSee you guys in three weeks, eh?\u201d I shake his hand, and then he gives Brooke a quick hug as I begin to wonder what kind of twilight zone I\u2019ve entered.</p><p>When he walks off, I\u2019m staring at her, perplexed. Sunglasses in place, she says, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know\u2014possibly the hug and friendly banter with a guy I nearly decked in the middle of a nightclub for you a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI guess we needed to get that shit out of the way. It was all a long time ago. I\u2019m trying to move past it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSure. Okay.\u201d</p> <p>A valet pulls up with her black two-seater Mercedes, and I put our bags in the trunk while she tips him. I\u2019ve barely clicked my seatbelt in place when she pulls into traffic. \u201cSo tell me... just how serious is this thing with Emma?\u201d Her tone is very nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not really revealing anything about it yet.\u201d My attempt at being evasive earns me a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured that much. Because of the studio edict for Reid and Emma to look like a real-life love-match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you about that?\u201d</p><p>She flips her hand off the top of the steering wheel. \u201cHe did, I guess. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>This is more and more odd. So now they\u2019re chatting? \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at me through her sunglasses, she says, \u201cYou can tell me, right? You know I won\u2019t say anything to the freaking media.\u201d</p><p>In four years of friendship, Brooke has never given me a reason not to trust her.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. It\u2019s semi-serious.\u201d</p><p>She shoots me a look over the top of her sunglasses.</p><p>I shrug and look out the window. \u201cAnd I want it to be more than semi.\u201d</p><p>Her faux-smile is back, but she\u2019s directing it out the windshield. \u201cThat\u2019s new for you.\u201d</p><p>Isn\u2019t it though. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>REID</p><p>While I\u2019m packing up, I text John to find out if he wants to go out tonight, and he calls me back while I wait in the lobby for the valet to bring my car around.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, you know I\u2019m game,\u201d he says. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you had something. No clubs\u2014I\u2019ve got studio orders of exclusive coupledom until the premiere. Can\u2019t risk taking anyone home if it could get leaked.\u201d Not to mention the fact that Brooke will hang me up by my balls if I screw up this elaborate scheme of hers. \u201cAny private parties?\u201d John\u2019s network includes plenty of the bored rich kids of LA\u2019s most prominent cosmetic surgeons, Hollywood execs, and professionals like our dads. He\u2019s even better connected for that shit than I am.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, there\u2019s at least one or two that might not prove lame. Pick you up at ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>John and I have known each other for three years, ever since a party during which I thought I was going to die.</p><p>I was hitting on this girl, and she was hitting back like a pro. We found a shadowy spot near the pool waterfall to make some semi-stoned explorations and get better acquainted\u2014all fine and good until someone yanked me away from her with the clear intent of ripping my arm from its socket. Apparently she had a boyfriend who was a bit disappointed to find her with her shirt hanging open and one hand down the front of my jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he screamed, eyes crazy and swinging back and forth between us. His hand was still clenched around my nearly dislocated arm as she stumbled backwards. He was smaller than me, but older and really pissed off.</p><p>When he let go, I tried to just retreat and take the loss. No sense getting my ass kicked for some girl who hadn\u2019t bothered to volunteer her name or ask mine, as far as I could remember. \u201cNothing, man, seriously,\u201d I mumbled, still high but sobering up fast. Unfortunately, my unzipped jeans and the fact that she was fumbling to rebutton her shirt contradicted my words.</p><p>He stepped closer to me, his wiry neck muscles bulging. \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when John popped up next to me. I\u2019d never seen him before. \u201cHey! Do I know you?\u201d At first I thought he meant me, but a quick glance told me he meant pissed-off guy.</p><p>\u201cBack off, dickwad.\u201d The guy stabbed a finger at me. \u201cThis is between me and him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? This is my house. So why don\u2019t you back off.\u201d John was smaller than both of us, but he was gushing righteous indignation.</p><p>That\u2019s when pissed-off guy\u2019s six-foot-four, linebacker-width friend materialized. Gaping at him, I thought: I\u2019m dead. Holy shit, I\u2019m totally dead. Expressionless, he stared back as I contemplated whether or not it was even remotely possible for me to get in one punch that might stun him long enough for me to make a run for it. I couldn\u2019t look away from his glassy-eyed gaze until he cracked his knuckles.</p><p>I swallowed, trying one last stab at conciliation with the pissed-off boyfriend. \u201cHey, uh, sorry, dude\u2014I didn\u2019t know she was taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough, dude,\u201d he sneered, unappeased. He didn\u2019t want apologies. He wanted blood. Mine.</p><p>That\u2019s when John sidestepped me and meaty guy, all 140 pounds of him barreling straight into pissed-off guy. Knocking the guy flat on his ass, he commenced to beat the shit out of him, fists flying. Great, I thought, my eyes sliding back to the huge thug whose neck was the size of one of my thighs, now I\u2019m definitely getting my ass kicked.</p><p>I stood straight, fists clenched, certain that if that guy landed one punch, I was going to be (a) unconscious and (b) not nearly as attractive as I began this lousy evening. And then meaty guy breathed a deep, frustrated sigh, rolled his eyes, and leaned down to grab his friend out from under John. Making for the side gate, he towed his bleeding, stumbling comrade along. Without a word, the girl followed.</p><p>This all happened in the time it took me to blink twice.</p><p>Like a prize fighter, John rocked his head back and forth a couple of times, popping his neck, and then looked at me. \u201cCome on, man, I\u2019ve gotta ice my knuckles.\u201d He grinned idiotically as he pumped his hands open and closed as though that would help the pain. \u201cGod damn, that hurts.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him. \u201cUh, thanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob. That guy was a dick.\u201d I followed him into the house, where he opened a drawer in the freezer and rummaged through ice packs of various shapes and sizes. \u201cMy step-mom does kickboxing,\u201d he said, in explanation of the ice packs. I tried and failed to imagine my mom kickboxing. Pulling a hand-sized pack from the freezer drawer, he said, \u201cSo, you\u2019re Reid Alexander, yeah?\u201d</p><p>At sixteen, I was still on the outer fringes of celebrity. \u201cYou know who I am?\u201d</p><p>I had no idea then how much everything would change, or how quickly. Meeting John was one of the earliest indications of the approaching shift in my social status. John is one of my closest friends now, but he\u2019s always been conscious of who\u2019s who, and I\u2019ve wondered if our friendship would have ever occurred if he hadn\u2019t known who I was that night.</p><p>\u201cI know Karen and Olivia, and they said they were bringing you tonight.\u201d</p><p>The last glimpse I\u2019d gotten of Karen and Olivia, they were dancing together and driving every guy in the vicinity nuts. Too bad for the guys, because neither girl would be interested in any of them. They were much more interested in each other... which is why I\u2019d gone looking for my own amusement.</p><p>Taking two beers from the fridge with his uninjured hand, John handed me one.</p><p>I twisted the cap off and shook my head. \u201cGuess I got lucky that big guy wasn\u2019t in the mood to fight, eh?\u201d</p><p>John shrugged. \u201cThe smaller guy was the douche. I figured, take him out, problem solved.\u201d</p><p>Risky guess. \u201cYeah, well, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Emma</p><p>I wake up alone, with bits and pieces of last night and this morning floating back to me. The first thing I remember is the last thing that happened\u2014Graham leaving a piece of paper on the night table before he leaned over, hands on either side of my head, and kissed me goodbye. I drifted back to sleep with the taste of him on my lips.</p><p>I sit up a bit, scooting back against the pillows and rubbing my eyes, and the note is there, where I remember him leaving it. The clock reads 11 a.m., so he must have left three hours ago. He\u2019s somewhere between California and New York, probably flying over a patchwork quilt of corn and wheat fields. The room-darkening draperies seal out the sunlight completely, so I have to switch the lamp on to read his note. I run the pad of my finger over his familiar scrawl, my name at the top and his at the bottom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma,</p><p>I\u2019m sitting next to you with a directory balanced on my knee, watching you sleep and striving to compose something profound and passionate that will express how I feel. Something that will make you breathless waiting for me to return. Instead, I\u2019m the breathless one, recalling the feel of your mouth opening to me, the stroke of your fingertips everywhere you touched me, the perfect weight of you in my arms. The thought of time away from you is torture. I haven\u2019t even left your room and I already miss you. Tonight, we\u2019ll talk, and I\u2019ll tell you a story of exactly what I plan to do to you in three weeks. Or perhaps you\u2019d prefer to tell me what you want\u2014like a list of resolutions, or a treasure hunt, or crumbs along a pathway... I\u2019m very good at following crumbs. Or instructions, directions, entreaties...</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Graham</p> <p>Reid: Are you still at the hotel?</p><p>Me: Yes, leaving for the airport soon</p><p>Reid: I\u2019ll drive you and we can talk about the interview schedule on the way</p><p>Me: k</p><p>\u201cYour car is really... yellow.\u201d Yellow or not, this is the fanciest non-limousine vehicle I\u2019ve ever been in. This even beats out Marcus and his Sacramento-rich-kid Volvo. I\u2019m afraid to touch anything.</p> <p>Reid\u2019s eyes are invisible behind the sunglasses, but I can tell he\u2019s rolling them. \u201cUgh! Don\u2019t start, woman. I\u2019m replacing it soon anyway.\u201d</p><p>I click the seatbelt in place and he takes off. \u201cWhy? It looks brand new.\u201d</p><p>Smirking, he says, \u201cBecause it\u2019s yellow.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, confused. \u201cBut didn\u2019t you choose it?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, he looks at me and smiles. \u201cSemantics.\u201d Taking a sharp right at the corner, he says, \u201cHold on,\u201d and I\u2019m suddenly glad for the molded seat and multiple interior handles.</p><p>\u201cWere you a race car driver in a past life?\u201d I ask after he weaves through several cars like he\u2019s James Bond.</p> <p>\u201cToo fast for you, Emma?\u201d he asks, laughing. \u201cDamn. I\u2019m always going too fast for you. I\u2019ve gotta learn to rein it in...\u201d</p><p>Lips pressed tight, I glance at him, and he flips me a patented Reid Alexander smile, decreasing his speed and moving into the right lane, his hand smoothly working the gear shift between us. \u201cI\u2019m just teasing, you know.\u201d</p><p>I shrug in reply, hoping we aren\u2019t going to rehash what happened last fall, hoping he isn\u2019t going to renew his request for another chance. Everything with Graham is too new, and I\u2019m not ready to share it, or defend it to Reid.</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for several minutes, tapping his fingers on the wheel along with the beat of the music. Finally, he clears his throat and says, \u201cSo, we have a few semi-local radio and TV appearances to do\u2014something scheduled every day next week.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, relieved at the change of subject. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be back in LA Monday, then.\u201d</p><p>He nods once. \u201cMost are morning shows beginning at totally unacceptable times of day\u2014starting with Monday morning at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix a.m.? Crap.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cThat word is nowhere near strong enough for anything that begins at six a.m. The first one\u2019s at a local LA station, though. I\u2019ll drive, or get a car, and pick you up at your hotel, so don\u2019t worry about transportation. Actually I might as well handle that for all of them. We don\u2019t want anyone talking to us separately if at all possible, what with our romantic charade.\u201d He smiles at me again, but playfully. No reason for alarm.</p> <p>The coming week will include lots of one-on-one time with Reid. Not long ago I\u2019d have been euphoric over a chance like that. Now it makes me nervous in a whole different way. Though I no longer want a relationship with him, he\u2019s still charismatic and curiously easy to be around\u2014most of the time. I should feel more distrustful and wary. That\u2019s the problem, really\u2014I\u2019m not totally on guard when every logical cell in my body tells me I should be. But then that\u2019s the sort of thing at which Reid Alexander excels\u2014faking trustworthiness.</p><p>The rest of the trip is filled with small talk. He asks what I\u2019m planning to study in college, and I ask about his upcoming project\u2014an action film opposite Chelsea Radin, small-town weathergirl turned hot celebrity. He doesn\u2019t bring up last fall or our conversation in March. When we arrive at the airport, he hops out to retrieve my bag from the trunk. Pulling the handle up and out, he presses it into my hand, and before I can react, he leans in close and brushes my cheek with a kiss.</p><p>He\u2019s sliding his sunglasses back on and getting into his car, calling, \u201cSee ya Monday morning,\u201d while I\u2019m standing on the sidewalk, blinking. The kiss was an unexpected shock, even if it wasn\u2019t on the mouth and seemed oh-so-casual. But his mostly-harmless kiss isn\u2019t what has me frozen.</p><p>On the other side of the multiple one-way lanes in front of my departure gate stands a girl with a camera aimed directly at me. This is no cell phone, and no touristy three hundred dollar Kodak. It\u2019s a big, black, professional-looking piece of equipment. Damn. It. As I turn away, her face breaks into a happy, evil grin before she turns, too, quickly disappearing into the parking garage.</p><p>I know what just happened between Reid and me on the sidewalk: an innocuous kiss. I also know exactly how it will look on every celebrity gossip website to which that girl can upload and sell a photo.</p><p>Brooke</p><p>I\u2019m not as afraid of the paparazzi as some celebs. Very little of my life isn\u2019t an open book, anyway. Aside from my one ginormous secret\u2014that somewhere out there is a (most likely) blonde, blue-eyed, beautiful three-year-old with a mix of genes from Reid and me. (God help whoever\u2019s trying to raise that kid if there\u2019s any truth to the \u201cnature\u201d end of the nature versus nurture debate.)</p><p>I have a secret weapon in my paparazzi back pocket. Her name is Rowena, and she\u2019s a female jackal amongst the pack of a male-majority profession. I chose her for that reason, in fact. Anytime I can give a woman a leg up over a man, I\u2019m on board\u2014as long as the woman in question isn\u2019t competition, because then all bets are off. Rowena didn\u2019t trust me, at first. Not until she got two or three photos that would have never been possible without my help. Since then, when I call she only has one word\u2014where.</p><p>I use her for \u201ccandid\u201d shots of myself, of course. That\u2019s how I got her hooked originally. I convinced her to give me her number, and then I\u2019d call when I stopped by Starbucks for a Frappuccino with a hunky costar. I\u2019d text where I\u2019d be shopping with my mom. Since I control the scenarios, I appear how I want to appear, and Rowena looks like she knows how to catch hot celebrities out on the town, trying to be inconspicuous. Now the gossip rags eagerly take her calls, and I stay in the public eye\u2014looking like a normal (attractive) person, rather than a bag lady flashing her underwear\u2014or lack thereof\u2014to the world.</p><p>Some celebs think they\u2019re above such maneuvering, or they\u2019re just too stupid to comprehend how to work it to their advantage. I\u2019m not high and mighty, and I\u2019m not stupid.</p><p>When I called Rowena this morning and told her to get her ass to LAX for a Reid Alexander and Emma Pierce exclusive, she asked the gate number and was off like a well-trained greyhound.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about looking for her,\u201d I told Reid last night. \u201cShe\u2019s a pro. You probably won\u2019t even see her until she\u2019s already gotten the shot, if you see her at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a devious little bitch, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take much offense because there was admiration in his voice.</p><p>\u201cFYI, I\u2019m not telling you to try anything that could backset our plan... but the more you look like you\u2019re dropping your lover at the airport after a torrid night, the better.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, yeah, I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>His kiss on her cheek was brilliant. He and Emma both know it was quick and innocent, but the photos that started popping up a few hours later could be interpreted a million ways, and very few of those interpretations are innocent.</p><p>Me: I just found out I\u2019ll be in nyc the week of your graduation. I don\u2019t want to invite myself...but can i invite myself? Would your family hate me to intrude?</p><p>Graham: No, i\u2019m sure that would be fine, if you\u2019re sure you want to go. Might be a long boring ceremony.</p><p>Me: Is that a jab at my sometimes limited attention span? Cuz i promise i\u2019m proud of you and can sit still for the WHOLE THING.</p><p>Graham: Haha, ok sure. That would be cool.</p><p>I am not content to wait a week and a half to pop up in New York... With Emma safely stuck on an LA publicity tour with Reid, it\u2019s the perfect time to pay a friendly impromptu visit to Graham\u2019s home turf. The romantic comedy I\u2019m filming there in the fall calls for a short-term apartment, I think. One that could become long-term. My stated purpose for being in town will be meetings with producers\u2014entirely feasible, so it won\u2019t be questioned.</p><p>If I\u2019m going to be with Graham, I\u2019ll have to win over his mother, his condescending sisters and his kid. I\u2019ve only seen Cara once, and it was a couple of years ago so there\u2019s no way she remembers me. That trip also included a disastrous, drunken kissing incident that (luckily) Graham decided to play off as though it never happened.</p><p>Life\u2019s a Beach was filming an episode where several characters go to New York. (LA beach characters in New York\u2014what the hell, right? But hey, it was ratings week, and I do what I\u2019m paid to do.) I\u2019d somehow contrived to stay with Graham while I was in New York, so when I got word of a party in a Union Square penthouse apartment owned by the friend of one of my costars, I invited him along.</p><p>We\u2019d been dancing and got hot and ended up on the rooftop, stargazing. Or he was. I was gazing at him. I was accustomed to guys like Reid, who take advantage of opportunities like girls drinking themselves stupid, or pretending to, in order to land some hot guy. I should have known Graham wouldn\u2019t respond to that.</p><p>Not that he was unresponsive. When I moved into his arms and kissed him, for a few mind-blowing seconds, he kissed me back. I thought I was going to melt, it was so good. And then he grabbed my shoulders and held me away, saying, \u201cBrooke, no.\u201d I was just wasted enough that I didn\u2019t realize what he was doing, at first... and once I figured it out, I was just sober enough to be humiliated. And pissed.</p><p>God, I was pissed. I stormed back inside, shaking and furious, and grabbed the first decent looking guy I encountered. Backing him against a wall with the thump of the music pounding through the sheetrock and into us both, I closed my eyes and pretended he was who I wanted. I don\u2019t remember much about that part, just that I couldn\u2019t fool myself, no matter how hard I tried. Moments later, Graham separated me from the guy, who nearly slid to the floor because I hadn\u2019t really allowed him to breathe. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, his hand gripping my arm.</p><p>I yanked loose, crossed my arms and glared. \u201cI\u2019m not finished with this party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d he said, leaning in so I could hear him. \u201cYou\u2019re completely trashed, and you\u2019re going to do something you\u2019ll regret if we don\u2019t leave now.\u201d His proximity was killing me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI already did,\u201d I mumbled, my eyes filling. I blinked back the tears and pinched my own forearms, determined to stay enraged.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I snapped my arms straight, fists at my side. I felt hard, but brittle, like I was made of concrete. One solid whack and I\u2019d crumble into dust. \u201cI said I already did. You\u2019re going to hate me now, and I\u2019ve ruined our friendship.\u201d My voice broke again and I realized I was more angry at myself than I was at him. \u201cI just want someone to care about. Why is that so wrong?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not wrong.\u201d When he put his arm around me and led me to the door, I didn\u2019t fight him. We walked a couple of blocks before I pulled to a stop and whined that my feet hurt and I was tired, and he hailed a taxi to take us back to his parents\u2019 house.</p> <p>It was late, and the house was quiet. He stopped outside the guest room door, his voice hushed. \u201cBrooke, you haven\u2019t ruined anything.\u201d He sighed. \u201cCan we just forget this happened? You mean a lot to me. You\u2019re one of the few friends I have who even know about Cara. You had a lot to drink. It was a silly mistake. And I could never hate you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, before I call my travel agent and make reservations for a Tuesday flight, I mull over that sentence: I could never hate you. What it meant to me at the time. What it means to me now. And I almost chicken out.</p><p>But I\u2019m right for him. I know it. I just need the chance to prove it.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>REID</p> <p>No matter how many times we\u2019ve woken up hungover, or how many times we\u2019ve mumbled I will never do that again to ourselves and each other, John and I tend to slam back drinks until we can\u2019t see straight the next time we go out. The exception is when we get high instead.</p><p>We didn\u2019t even bother with a hangover Saturday morning\u2014we just went straight into the next binge, making Sunday\u2019s hangover a real bastard. It\u2019s late afternoon before either of us can move, and somewhere in the back of my mind is the nagging philosophical question of the moment\u2014was it fun if I don\u2019t remember it?</p><p>There\u2019s some chick passed out on John\u2019s couch, and neither of us remember who was responsible for bringing her back to his apartment, or what was done with her once she was here. For all I know, we all fell asleep. Her makeup is smeared to hell and she\u2019s lying on her stomach with her skirt and top weirdly twisted, lots of skin exposed, and all four limbs extended as though she was tossed there.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s kind of tall. Probably yours,\u201d I say, due to John\u2019s known weakness for models.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s kind of blonde. Probably yours,\u201d he returns. He prods her hip with his foot. \u201cHey. Wake up.\u201d She releases an annoyed grunt but otherwise doesn\u2019t react.</p><p>This is really, truly wrong, and insanely hilarious. Unfortunately, it hurts my head to laugh. \u201cShit, John, she\u2019s not a bum.\u201d</p> <p>He exhales and blinks slowly, his eyes squinting at her in the not-that-bright light of day\u2014the blinds are still shut tight. \u201cDude, I beg to differ. She\u2019s unconscious, somewhere she doesn\u2019t belong, where nobody knows who she is. That\u2019s pretty much the definition of a bum.\u201d He leans over and tries nudging her shoulder\u2014with his hand this time. She moans again and he recoils. \u201cOh for chrissake, her breath sure smells like a bum\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I dig my phone out of the jeans I was wearing last night, which I find slung over the back of a nearby chair. \u201cI\u2019ll call a cab. You find some ID. We\u2019ll load her in, throw some twenties at the cabbie and send her on her way.\u201d</p><p>Holding his head, John casts around for a purse while I make the call. \u201cWallet!\u201d He says finally, his hand emerging from between the sofa cushions. \u201cOkay, who are you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe taxi will be out front in five.\u201d I collapse into the chair just as John utters a string of curse words at a much too elevated volume. \u201cDammit John, shut the hell up,\u201d I hiss, pressing my palms to my temples.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Look.\u201d He hands me her ID.</p><p>I don\u2019t recognize the name or address, but the taxi sure as hell won\u2019t do any good. \u201cShit\u2014San Diego? We can\u2019t send an unconscious girl to San Diego in a cab.\u201d</p><p>John shakes his head minutely. \u201cNo man, that\u2019s not the problem.\u201d He lets loose with another string of curses, softer this time, staring at her like she\u2019s a zombie and any second she\u2019s going to wake up and attack.</p><p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d I ask, and he hands me another ID. I didn\u2019t really look at the photo of the first one, or the age. I do now. The photo could be her\u2014twenty-one year old Amber Lipscomb... Until I look at the second ID, which is clearly the girl on the sofa\u2014seventeen-year-old April Hollingsworth. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d I knew the club was a bad idea. I knew it.</p> <p>\u201cWe are so screwed.\u201d He stares at zombie girl, no longer making any effort to wake her up.</p><p>My phone launches into its ringtone, startling us both. \u201cYeah?\u201d I croak, mouth parched and heart rate spiked. And I thought my head was pounding before. Ha. \u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d I look at John. \u201cThe taxi\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>His eyes swing to me. \u201cPut your pants on and get out of here, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s staring at her again, wary. \u201cI\u2019m nobody. She can\u2019t prove shit about who she was with last night, and there\u2019s only so far she can get with a damned good fake in her possession, and being in a 21-up club. We\u2019re nineteen, which makes this a misdemeanor at worst. No one will do anything to me for such a minor offense\u2014but someone would find a way to make you pay for it. So get out of here.\u201d</p><p>John and I have been in tight spots before, but this is probably an all-time low. If this goes poorly, his father will torch him. I never could have imagined John throwing himself on that grenade for me. I can\u2019t wrap my brain around it. \u201cLook, you woke up in your room, I woke up in the guest room, and clearly she hasn\u2019t budged from the sofa since she landed there. Maybe nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he snorts. \u201cReid. Take that taxi and go home. And perform some sort of ritualistic sacrifice once you get there, man. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>Emma</p><p>Derek and Emily picked me up at the airport Friday afternoon, and almost forty-eight hours later, they\u2019re dropping me back off.</p><p>Riding in Derek\u2019s Jeep gives me a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of my excursion to Griffith Park with Graham. I pull my hair into a ponytail and recall the pleasure of huddling together to watch the sunrise, and the feel of his mouth on my neck as he murmured you\u2019re so beautiful. I\u2019ve reread his note several dozen times, and only the fear of it being ripped from my grasp by a gust of wind keeps me from pulling it out now. Our three weeks are counting down.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know, last fall, in my back-and-forth skirmishes with Reid, that this is how it\u2019s supposed to feel. Not relentless internal questions of should I give in or am I ready yet, not a constant feeling of defending my borders\u2014but yearning for this next step, this connection. An inherent trust that it means everything it should mean.</p><p>From the back seat, I watch Derek and Emily communicate without speaking, something they\u2019ve probably learned to do of necessity in this open-air vehicle. Their hands are clasped over the center console\u2014his strong, tan forearm brushing against her paler, fragile-looking skin. I can\u2019t help but smile. Thanks to the Jeep and a host of new outdoor activities, Emily has actual tan lines. They\u2019re the faintest tan lines ever, due to her liberal all-over use of sun block, but still.</p><p>Derek has gotten my best friend into rock-climbing recently\u2014something that made Mrs. Watson stop speaking to him for a week except for under-her-breath asides about danger and her baby girl and imminent death. Emily says he finally made a concerted effort to explain all the details of the pulley system and the fact that as a novice Emily was always hooked up to it, in the end convincing her mother that he would allow absolutely nothing to happen to the girl he loved.</p><p>\u201cIt was all very sitcom-sappy,\u201d Emily told me Saturday morning as we lounged in her bed. \u201cI told Derek he wasn\u2019t allowed to speak to my mother that way\u2014all that mushy stuff\u2014which of course bonded them immediately.\u201d Her sly smile made me laugh out loud, and I wondered how Dad and Chloe would handle the news of Graham and me.</p><p>By Friday night, photos of me with Reid outside LAX were plastered all over the Internet, along with rampant speculations about our possible relationship. \u201cI figured that this crap falls under need-to-know,\u201d Emily sighed, turning her monitor to face me. The time of day he dropped me off, some sites insisted, confirmed the probability of our having spent the night together.</p><p>I texted Graham so he wouldn\u2019t be caught unaware, again, of a seemingly intimate photo of me with Reid. He texted back: Vultures. Thanks for letting me know.</p><p>Emily wasn\u2019t the only one who kept an eye out for incriminating photos of me. I should have known right away from Chloe\u2019s patronizing questions over dinner last night that she\u2019d discovered them, too, but my mind was so occupied with thoughts of Graham and his promises for our Skype-time later that I was running on auto-pilot answers and all but ignoring her.</p><p>When she passed the vinaigrette, she said, \u201cEmma, you sneaky thing ... how was LA?\u201d</p><p>I dribbled dressing over my salad, vowing to squeeze in a long run in the morning. \u201cIt was fine. Pretty clear this trip, actually,\u201d I said, alluding to LA weather and the always-welcome lack of haze.</p><p>As I passed the bottle to Dad, Chloe gave him a self-satisfied see there? sort of look, which made him frown.</p><p>\u201cEverything is definitely clearer lately.\u201d This was a Chloe attempt at being cryptic, but nothing about my stepmother is ever obscure or even vaguely mysterious. Her thoughts and designs are transparent, unconstrained by silly social constructs like tact or poise. I\u2019ve learned to count this as one of her positive traits, in the same way you know a shark is capable of biting your arm off because you can see the teeth.</p><p>First, I registered the fact that she called me sneaky. And then the clearer comment.</p><p>Recognition dawned. \u201cAh. You\u2019ve seen photos.\u201d I turned to Dad\u2019s concerned eyes. \u201cYou know how Dan said that the studio wants Reid and me to look like a couple until the premiere? Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing\u2014just so you know. Nothing is actually going on between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the world not?\u201d Chloe was incredulous. \u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s frown turned into a scowl. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Chloe, I don\u2019t want my daughter hooking up, or whatever, with that adolescent Casanova.\u201d</p><p>I almost choked on a tomato hearing my father say hooking up, which he air-quoted.</p><p>Chloe sighed heavily and rolled her eyes like she was twelve. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that since she\u2019s abandoning the film industry, she\u2019s not likely to get a shot at anyone like him ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the better!\u201d Dad countered, following that with a harrumph as he stabbed a forkful of salad and stuffed it in his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glared at both of them. \u201cExcuse me. I\u2019m sitting right here. And in case you\u2019ve both forgotten, I\u2019m a legal adult, and I\u2019m perfectly capable of conducting my own affairs... such as they are.\u201d My face warmed, matched by Dad\u2019s. Now probably wasn\u2019t the time to bring up my new relationship with Graham. I cleared my throat. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, going to finish my salad in my room.\u201d</p><p>Graham devoted time to me late each evening, but he was otherwise engaged in being a dad to Cara and studying for finals. He warned me that he\u2019d be busy reviewing for exams and finishing up final edits on research papers over the coming week, and then his mouth quirked adorably. \u201cBut as of Friday, I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m content to have something to distract me, even if it means hotel rooms, getting up before dawn, and spending time with Reid, driving around LA and the surrounding areas. There are a lot of hours to fill outside of the hour or so I\u2019ll spend each night, swapping life stories with Graham and asking him in whispers to compose his alternate stories of us\u2014fairytale lives we would have had if we\u2019d met under different circumstances, or if we\u2019d never been actors at all.</p><p>The story he devises tonight, my first night back in LA, supposes that we\u2019d met as regular high school students\u2014something neither of us had ever been.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have been a senior at seventeen, instead of a college sophomore. And you\u2019d have been fourteen\u2014so, a freshman\u2014wide-eyed and innocent. Though I guess that sort of describes you now, too.\u201d His smile is teasing, but warm. \u201cSo maybe it isn\u2019t so difficult to imagine.\u201d</p><p>I lean my head in my hand, my eyes drinking in his face on my laptop screen. \u201cYou would have been popular, though. Why would you be interested in a freshman when you could have had your pick of any girl in the school?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI would have seen you the first day, trying to get your locker open.\u201d He\u2019s referring to the first time he saw me, in the hallway of the hotel in Austin. \u201cImmediately intrigued, I\u2019d have walked over, acting all cool but shaking inside, thinking who is this beautiful girl? \u2018Need some help?\u2019 I\u2019d say, and you\u2019d look at me, all suspicious. I\u2019d brush your fingers aside, gently, and say, \u2018What\u2019s your combination?\u2019 but you\u2019d be too smart for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would?\u201d I laugh. \u201cI think maybe I\u2019d just forget it on the spot, if you talked to me.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, too. \u201cNah, you\u2019d say, \u2018But I\u2019m not supposed to tell anyone my locker combination.\u2019 And then I\u2019d say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m safe.\u2019\u201d His smile is positively wicked. I\u2019d have melted to a puddle on the floor if he\u2019d said any such thing to fourteen-year-old me.</p> <p>\u201cAfter more assurances and against all better judgment, you\u2019d give me the combination and I\u2019d open the locker for you. Then I\u2019d lean on the adjacent locker and say, \u2018I require a small fee for damsels in locker-opening distress, you know.\u2019 Your suspicion would come back full-force, your eyes narrowing, waiting for me to tell you this supposed fee. I\u2019d tell you that you had to go out with me Friday, because there\u2019s a mandatory orientation party. And since you have to go, so you might as well go with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, smooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d get that little pensive frown you get sometimes, and you\u2019d say, \u2018Huh. No one said anything about a mandatory orientation...\u2019\u201d He taps his finger against his chin and I laugh at his reference to my favorite habitual word.</p><p>\u201cSo then I\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s only for special freshmen\u2014you have to be invited by a senior.\u2019 Now you\u2019re completely convinced that I\u2019m full of crap. \u2018Sounds like a hazing charge waiting to happen,\u2019 you\u2019d say. \u2018No, no\u2014would I lie to you?\u2019 I\u2019d say, oozing seventeen-year-old boy charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you this cheesy when you were seventeen?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He grins. \u201cEmma. I\u2019m trying to tell a story here. And I plead the fifth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then you\u2019d floor me. You\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t know. Would you lie to me?\u2019 And I would look into your eyes and see everything I could ever want. I\u2019d say, \u2018Let\u2019s skip the party. I\u2019ll take you to dinner. And then I\u2019ll take you somewhere private and kiss you until you tell me to quit.\u2019 What would your answer be, Emma?\u201d</p><p>I could barely breathe. \u201cOh... I think, for the sake of the story, I\u2019d probably be okay with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d His mouth turns up on one side and I can tell he\u2019s watching me on his screen as closely as I\u2019m watching him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I need more information about the kissing.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles softly. \u201cLet\u2019s say you tell me yes, and we go to dinner. We talk, and we\u2019re both surprised at how comfortable we feel. And then we get into my car and drive to a secluded spot overlooking our sleepy little suburban town. Totally private, dark but for a sky full of stars... and tomorrow, I\u2019ll tell you what happens next.\u201d</p><p>The noise that comes from my throat is half-growl and half-whimper, and he hmms. \u201cI need to study a bit more tonight\u2014if I even can, now\u2014and you have to get up before five a.m. and be animated and personable on camera.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t care less about being animated or personable. \u201cMmm. More tomorrow? You won\u2019t forget?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell no, I won\u2019t forget,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019ll be lucky if it doesn\u2019t work its way into my essay on the Lost Colony of Roanoke during my final for Early Settlements of Colonial America. I can see it now: No evidence of what happened to the 114 colonists was ever found... but in my dream last night I took Emma parking and got to third base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham!\u201d I laugh, hands over my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding. I wouldn\u2019t go for third on the first date\u2014maybe second?\u201d He laughs softly when I cover my face completely. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just as well you didn\u2019t meet me when I was seventeen. I was kind of a horn dog. But I think I\u2019d have known enough to be careful and slow with you. At least, I will in this story, to be continued tomorrow...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll never get to sleep now.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Brooke</p><p>Rowena and I don\u2019t make eye contact as she shuffles through first class on her way to coach, her bag of camera equipment weighing her skinny shoulder into a sharp downward slope. She looks like a lop-sided scarecrow. I can easily imagine her slipping into narrow, impossible spaces, getting shots the large, aggressive men of her kind\u2014the ones who scare the crap out of celebs with their obnoxious belligerence\u2014could never get. The only thing unnerving about Rowena is her eyes. They\u2019re not empty like some psycho killer\u2014they\u2019re just flat-out ruthless.</p><p>Not that I can talk.</p><p>She generally doesn\u2019t have to leave the LA area to make a living, but she understands the strategic part of doing personal favors for the right people, and I\u2019m one of those people. Graham and I may not be A-listers, but we\u2019re close enough to make news if the story is juicy, especially with the movie premiere a couple of weeks away. I\u2019ve made it clear to Rowena that this favor is non-negotiable if she expects a continuance of tips like the Reid-n-Emma bonus that probably paid several months\u2019 rent. I\u2019m paying her airfare and hotel, plus she\u2019ll be compensated for the photos themselves.</p><p>Now all I have to do is get Graham into the picture.</p><p>I hate long flights alone because there\u2019s nothing to do. God knows I\u2019m not going to chat up the middle-aged CEO or whatever he is sitting next to me. He reminds me of my dad\u2014from the stereotypical Rolex and custom-made suit to the trainer-maintained body and bleached teeth.</p><p>Daddy dearest is on his fourth marriage to someone too young for him. As I get older, they\u2019re getting closer and closer to my age. I just turned twenty\u2014how can he be okay with the fact that his newest Mrs. Cameron is five or six years older than his youngest daughter? I think my oldest sister is actually her same age. You\u2019d think he\u2019d at least have the awareness to be embarrassed.</p><p>My mother was the idiot second wife\u2014the younger woman who attracted a powerful married man away from his wife and two daughters and got knocked up with me, probably on purpose. By the time his divorce was settled and the pre-nup my unwitting mother agreed to was inked, I was a month old. Inexplicably, I was in their farcical wedding photos (which my mother filed through the shredder when my father left her for wife number three\u2014hello, who didn\u2019t see that coming?). Why didn\u2019t either of them think I\u2019d eventually grow old enough to look at those framed photos and figure out that I\u2019m beyond illegitimate, or that my friends wouldn\u2019t come to the same conclusion?</p><p>Mom is currently prowling for Husband Number Four. Number Two, Rick, was actually okay. I sort of miss him. Number Three was a huge douche and I was more than happy to get my own apartment in LA when Mom moved back to Texas with him\u2014good riddance. She now says that her third marriage was the \u201cfifteen minute\u201d variety. In actuality it lasted around a year, but maybe fifteen minutes just refers to how long either of them remained faithful.</p><p>Mr. CEO keeps peering at me, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because of my hot little LA body or if he actually recognizes me. I don\u2019t particularly care. Grabbing the satin sleep mask, I shove it on, lean my seat back and settle in to pretend sleep. I don\u2019t want to contemplate forty-something lechers, or my parents and their meaningless relationship histories. I just want to think about Graham.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to screw this up. I know I\u2019m about to manipulate him in deplorable ways, but I\u2019m a practical girl. The ends justify the means. This is something my parents have never, in either of their pathetic lives, done\u2014plan for the future, rather than living in the moment. Graham is not a momentary whim, though I admit he was at first. But that was a very long time ago. I\u2019ve known for a while now that he\u2019s exactly the kind of stable guy I need. He\u2019s one of only two people in the world I can comfortably talk to about what happened with Reid.</p><p>God, Reid. What a tortuous mess that was.</p><p>When we met, he was fourteen, and I was fifteen. Both of us were recurring extras on the set of a soon-to-be-canceled sitcom. I\u2019d catch him staring at me sometimes and he\u2019d blush, or vice versa. I thought he was the most beautiful boy I\u2019d ever seen. We talked a few times, but in short, nervous sentences on meaningless subjects\u2014not in any substantial way.</p><p>Then, a month later, we both managed to land minor parts in the same movie. It was like fate, in a way\u2014though to what purpose, I have no idea.</p><p>The cast was on location in Idaho, living in trailers. With no one else our age around, Reid and I had our tutoring sessions together, and we grew close fast. Our parents were too uninvolved to be around much, and the notion that production babysits underage kids is ludicrous. Yes, we were somewhat separated from the older cast mates because that sort of slipup would spell legal disaster, but for Reid and me the situation was akin to being thrown into the same playpen. We could mess around with each other all we wanted to. And we did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d moved to LA with Mom when she married Rick, and the sitcom had been my first acting job. When the movie Reid and I were filming was over and we were back in LA, we kept seeing each other. Neither of us was old enough to drive, but we were privileged kids of clueless parents. We hired cars and hung out frequently at each other\u2019s houses, which weren\u2019t too far apart.</p><p>We were too young and irresponsible to be sexually active, but eventually, going all the way felt like a natural progression. Reid looked at me like I was a goddess come to life in his bedroom. He was reverent and adoring. I loved the feel of my hair spread across his pillow and his weight pressing into me and the expression on his face when he stared into my eyes and whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>God, we were stupid. We used protection most of the time, but occasionally we\u2019d forget, especially if we\u2019d been drinking. Reid resisted drinking with me most of the time, or he\u2019d have one beer or one shot and quit. Something to do with his mother. And then came the night of the screwdrivers. We must have downed half a bottle of vodka between us, and we were both violently sick most of the night. The next morning, his dad discovered us in his room, passed out and hungover. After delivering a harsh parental lecture, his dad called my mom.</p><p>Loving mother that she is, she sent a car around to collect me. (Had she even noticed that I never came home the previous night? Who knows.)</p> <p>When I staggered through the door, the only thing she asked\u2014derision in her tone, not concern\u2014was if I needed a morning-after pill. The last thing I wanted to appear was dumber than my mom. \u201cOf course not,\u201d I told her, trailing my hands along the hallway walls on the way to my room. \u201cWe use protection.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at me, and if she\u2019d had any sense she\u2019d have never believed me. Instead, she snapped, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be all high-and-mighty just because you know how to use a rubber, missy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d I returned, my head throbbing. \u201cIf you\u2019d known how to use one, I wouldn\u2019t be here to bother you.\u201d</p><p>She slapped me then, and it wasn\u2019t like seeing stars, it was like sparks erupting and everything blacking out at the edges. Rick rushed in and said That\u2019s enough, Sharla and steered her out of my room as I stumbled onto the bed. He came back minutes later with ice chips and pain pills. My ears were still ringing when he sighed, \u201cJust sleep it off, Brooke. You\u2019ll feel better later.\u201d In his kind eyes was the concern missing in my mother\u2019s. He was weighing something he never got a chance to say, because Mom began calling his name in that petulant tone. Patting my arm, he sighed and left the room.</p><p>She preferred me to be invisible to him. I was starting to look like a woman, and all of a sudden, I was a rival, or at least something conceivably prettier than her. She didn\u2019t like it.</p> <p>I don\u2019t remember what Reid and I fought over the night we broke up. We\u2019re so similar that if we both happened to be in a pissy mood at the same time, we would inevitably end up in a vicious argument. At first, he seemed shocked at the things I\u2019d say, trying to hurt him, to get a reaction. But his temper was as bad as mine\u2014he just had a longer fuse. When he\u2019d finally lose it, we would say cruel, spiteful things to each other and accuse each other of all manner of sins.</p><p>I confess that making him that angry was a turn-on at times. If I could get him to lose it and then rein him in at just the right moment, the passion he unleashed was insane. He\u2019d pin me to the bed and kiss me so hard it hurt, choking back his anger and redirecting it gratefully to something more satisfying than screaming obscenities at each other.</p><p>Sometimes I missed the mark and pushed him too far. That night was one of those. And then, for the first time, he didn\u2019t call me an hour later, crying. That reaction from him always made me cry, too, and we\u2019d blubber apologies and reaffirm our love and the need to see each other even if it was 3 a.m.</p><p>I waited, but he never called. Two days later, I was in a panic. I didn\u2019t want to call first and appear weak, but I was breaking down. I missed him. I wanted his forgiveness. I also wanted him to need me more than anything, and if he was staying away, that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>So I went out to a club with a couple of costars from the last film\u2014girls in their early twenties who felt sorry for my little fifteen-year-old breakup woes. I had no problem passing myself off as legal with the right makeup, clothes, attitude, and a top-notch fake ID. Being fawned over by older guys didn\u2019t help like I thought it would, though.</p><p>I was close to grabbing a taxi to Reid\u2019s house and begging his forgiveness when I noticed a guy with a camera. Failing in his attempt to be subtle, he was hiding behind a post that didn\u2019t quite conceal his girth. I knew he\u2019d be spotted and shown the door any second. As he zeroed in on my friends, I decided on a different, stronger course of action. I would make Reid crazy with jealousy, and then he\u2019d come back to me.</p> <p>I found a hot guy, pulled him onto the dance floor and performed every degrading dirty dancing move I could think of on him. I incorporated things I\u2019d seen my mom do on the stripper pole she had installed in the extra bedroom for \u201cexercise,\u201d and the photog recorded it all. Reid and I weren\u2019t big time, but we were cute together, and Hollywood liked us. I had no idea that being idolized also meant people were salivating over the moment we\u2019d split up and how it would happen. I was just desperate to make Reid cave first.</p><p>The article online the next day made me out to be the biggest whore imaginable\u2014so sad, she\u2019s so young\u2014while Reid was cast as the na\u00efve boy who had no idea what his slutty girlfriend had been doing behind his back.</p><p>Out that night, and the next, and the next, Reid was photographed leaving clubs, parties and hot spots with a swarm of different girls until there was no doubt in my mind that we were done and he was over me.</p><p>I cried for two weeks. I barely ate. I couldn\u2019t sleep. I wanted to call and tell him I hadn\u2019t been with anyone else, that it was all a ruse. But I was hurt and resentful, knowing that was no longer true for him. My mother, fresh into her separation from Rick, sat me down and told me that the only way to get over a guy like that is to get a new one. I heeded her advice, but couldn\u2019t settle down to any one guy. And I couldn\u2019t exorcise Reid from my head.</p><p>That\u2019s when I met Graham, who resisted and spurned me. No one rejected me, not when I was offering straight up no-strings screwing around. We were on location not too far from LA, just beginning to film a movie. I\u2019d known Graham for a week, and I already detested him for his high-handed dismissal.</p><p>And then I figured out that it had been a while since I\u2019d had a period. I peed on a stick and was stunned to find out I was pregnant. Abortion? No problem. Sign me up. Until the doctor said how far along I was\u2014almost ten weeks.</p><p>Which meant it was Reid\u2019s. Absolutely Reid\u2019s. I told them I couldn\u2019t do it. Not when my mother pleaded with me not to ruin my career. Not when my father was called in to order me to comply (because yeah, that\u2019s always worked on me).</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made the appointment, and we\u2019re going tomorrow,\u201d Mom said, as though I had no opinion in the matter.</p> <p>\u201cBe a good girl and listen to your mother,\u201d my father added.</p><p>I hated them both.</p><p>Graham heard me crying in my trailer that night, and knocked on the door. I don\u2019t know why, but I took one look at those warm brown eyes and I told him everything.</p><p>Holding me while I cried, he told me that he and his ex-girlfriend were having a baby in a few months. She was planning to hand it to him and walk away, but he was hoping for a reconciliation.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, this might be the most important decision you ever make. It doesn\u2019t matter if you didn\u2019t plan this\u2014there\u2019s a choice to make, and you should make it. Decide what\u2019s right for you, whatever that is, and then do it.\u201d</p><p>No one had ever said that to me before, and here was this boy, who wasn\u2019t quite a year older than me, sounding so wise and sure. Of course, I know now that in that moment, Graham still had completely undeserved faith in Zoe, so he wasn\u2019t exactly the soul of discernment he appeared to be. Still, he had a point about taking over the decisions for your own life. That was the moment I started doing just that.</p><p>If I\u2019m capable of loving anyone, it has to be Graham.</p><p>The ends justify the means, right? The ends justify the means.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m in town for a couple of days. Meetings over that fall project. Dinner?</p><p>Graham: Bad week. I\u2019ve got finals and papers due through friday. When are you leaving?</p><p>Me: Early friday. :(</p><p>Graham: Damn, not the sad face! I could maybe get away for an hour or so tomorrow?</p><p>Me: Yes please! :) Text me your address and I\u2019ll pick you up at eight.</p><p>REID</p><p>Brooke: We\u2019re having dinner tomorrow night. Photos should be up thursday. Make sure she sees them.</p><p>Me: Yep</p><p>Brooke: That answer doesn\u2019t leave me with warm fuzzies</p><p>Me: Are you capable of warm fuzzies? I\u2019m thinking cold ice shards.</p><p>Brooke: Do you ever STFU??</p><p>Me: Quit freaking out. I\u2019ll handle it.</p><p>Emma and I are on our second day of local television morning show interviews. These are like an annoying, unnecessary rehearsal for the ones that matter\u2014the nationally syndicated talk shows, the late night network and cable shows.</p><p>Most of these local morning anchors will never make it out of their thirties in front of a camera, especially the women. Not because they can\u2019t do the job, but because there\u2019s always some fresh-faced, ambitious twenty-something who wants that job, will take less to do it, and will look hotter doing it. No wonder some of them look at Emma and me like they\u2019d give anything to just punch us in the face.</p><p>I may be exaggerating a bit.</p><p>This morning, though, the female anchor is interrogating Emma as though she\u2019s personally responsible for a host of swept-under-the-rug hate crimes. Leaning so far forward that Emma moves closer to me, Wynona narrows her overly-lined, heavily-mascaraed eyes. \u201cEmma, you can\u2019t tell me there isn\u2019t something going on between you two. Look at the photographic evidence!\u201d</p><p>Without her eyes ever leaving Emma\u2019s face, she points to a huge monitor in between her chair and our small sofa. I stifle a laugh. The cell phone photo I suspect Brooke of taking during Walt\u2019s show? Really? Everyone saw and picked apart that photo, months ago. \u201cUm...\u201d Emma says, and I lean up, chuckling slightly.</p><p>\u201cWynona.\u201d My voice is like honey and her attention swings to me. Professional thirty-something women aren\u2019t quite sure how to react when I take such a familiar, somewhat condescending tone. \u201cThat\u2019s a really old, really fuzzy photo.\u201d I shrug. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said in previous interviews, the whole cast got along really well during filming. We were all very close.\u201d When Emma almost turns to look at me, I press my knee against hers and she freezes in place. Good girl.</p><p>\u201cReid, I believe you had an old flame in the cast, as well?\u201d Wynona clicks the device in her palm and the photo on the wall is suddenly a four-years-younger me, leading Brooke by the hand as we leave some LA hotspot. Both of us are smiling\u2014me, right into the camera, and Brooke, looking at me. I haven\u2019t seen this photo in a very long time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d My smile is similar to that of the boy on the screen, if Wynona doesn\u2019t look closely enough. That boy is not yet the uncaring bastard sitting in front of her.</p><p>She scoots an inch closer. \u201cWere you and Ms. Cameron in contact between your tween romance and the filming of School Pride?\u201d I can tell from her cold eyes she knows damned well we weren\u2019t tweens in that photo, but I ignore her pointless taunt.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I lie.</p><p>Ignoring me, she asserts, \u201cBecause there are rumors that the two of you had\u2014issues\u2014on the set of your recent film.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh complacently and match her icy gaze. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason they\u2019re called rumors, right?\u201d</p><p>She looks like she wants to bite me. And not in a good way. \u201cWhat about now? Do you consider yourselves to be\u2014friendly\u2014now?\u201d</p><p>What a bitch. I decide to throw her a fast ball, which turns out to have perfect timing. \u201cYeah. We hung out this past weekend, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Thank God I\u2019m occasionally truthful, because just as I admit this, she click-clicks and up pops a photo from three days ago in which I\u2019m entering Brooke\u2019s apartment. She\u2019s clearly visible in the doorway, admitting me. I wonder if Brooke knows about this. I wonder if she even set it up with that photog girl she has on payroll. How else would this shot get into the exclusive hands of a common local news station when Star or Us would have paid a shitload of cash for it?</p><p>Wynona\u2019s fa\u00e7ade crumbles a little at the edges at losing the element of surprise, but she rallies and turns back to Emma. \u201cSo if you and Reid aren\u2019t involved... is this due to your involvement with a\u2014\u201d she glances at a card \u201c\u2014Marcus Hoffpauer?\u201d</p> <p>The photo on the wall changes to Emma looking bored to death, arms crossed, standing next to that conceited prick at his prom. That must have been a pity date.</p><p>Emma is speechless, so I laugh and gesture to the photo, grinning conspiratorially at her. \u201cAh, I remember this\u2014the community theatre guy, right?\u201d</p><p>Emma nods, her lips compressing when she glances at the photo. \u201cYes, at his prom.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, smiling and staring daggers into Wynona. \u201cIf he wanted to score points, he could have\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014introduced her to his friends? That\u2019s what we do when we invite non-celeb friends to our parties.\u201d A glance at Emma makes it clear that she\u2019s grateful for my interruption.</p><p>I turn and give Wynona a mesmerizing smile. \u201cSo, about School Pride. We\u2019re both really excited about the upcoming release and ready to talk about the film. We brought several clips\u2014I assume we can show your viewing audience a couple of them now?\u201d</p><p>Emma breathes out a deep sigh the moment we shut the car doors and I start the engine, letting it idle and purr for a moment. \u201cWow, her face...\u201d Her mouth turns up on one side. \u201cI kind of expected her head to start spinning around at one point.\u201d</p> <p>Wynona was tough, but I\u2019ve had more hostile question-answer sessions than that. No need to pass that info on to Emma, though. \u201cCourtesy never works with people like her, so I don\u2019t bother. If you want to shift topics, you have to force it. With a smile and an angelic look, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>We pull into traffic and I\u2019m glad for the heavily tinted windows. The last thing either of us needs right now is more public scrutiny. \u201cYou looked miserable at that prom. Anyone talk to you at all?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, she says, \u201cThe waiters were nice.\u201d I laugh and she gives me a grim smile in return, her head angled. \u201cHow did you know? I mean, practically everyone fell for the story that I\u2019m so conceited that I wouldn\u2019t lower myself to speak to regular people.\u201d</p><p>I make a disgusted sound. \u201cPlease. You\u2019re one of the least conceited people I know. Your best friend is a non-celeb girl\u2014that\u2019s evidence enough that you\u2019re not above mingling with commoners.\u201d</p><p>She smirks and I smirk back.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess\u2014you told him you\u2019re moving across the country to go to school, so you can\u2019t imagine a relationship between you going anywhere\u2014something like that\u2014and he got pissed. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he wanted you to give him a leg up in the industry and he saw his chance at that falling away.\u201d</p><p>She blinks in surprise, and her hands open on her lap. \u201cI can\u2019t blame him for being disappointed about that, if that was the case.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m shaking my head before she stops talking. \u201cWhy should he put forth no more effort than cozying up to the right girl? Yes, there\u2019s a lot of luck and who-you-know, but we both had to work like hell to become successful actors. We didn\u2019t just get it handed to us. Even if you are planning to toss it all aside to become an ordinary little co-ed.\u201d</p><p>She clears her throat, a light blush across her cheeks.</p><p>In the silence, I begin ruminating over John\u2019s usual phenomenal luck holding steady with that under-aged girl. Once I was gone and he got her to wake up, she was more than happy to be given cab fare to get to a friend\u2019s house so her parents wouldn\u2019t find out she was at some strange guy\u2019s apartment overnight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m 99 percent sure we all passed out when we got to my place,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other one percent?\u201d</p><p>John sighs, passing on a rare piece of insight. \u201cDude, I hope we never have daughters.\u201d</p><p>My best friend doesn\u2019t know about the possible kid with Brooke. I love John, but unlike Brooke, I don\u2019t trust anyone with that information. Thanks to her, Emma and Graham both know about it.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I ask you about your relationship with Brooke?\u201d Emma asks. I\u2019m glad she can\u2019t see my eyes behind these shades. I mean damn, does she read minds? \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything. It\u2019s not my business. But you guys weren\u2019t friendly a few months ago and now you\u2019re, uh, hanging out together.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, exiting the freeway in a split-second decision that will keep her with me a little longer today. \u201cYou know that old photo of us that Wynona put up this morning?\u201d She nods. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t blame either of those kids for what they did back then. Growing up in the spotlight, as you know, isn\u2019t all that easy to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re what\u2014friends\u2014now?\u201d I can\u2019t blame her for being incredulous. The idea of Brooke and me ever being friends is ludicrous. She glances out her window and adds, \u201cAnd where are we, by the way?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cWe\u2019re stopping for breakfast tacos at this very authentic place I know. And let\u2019s just say Brooke and I have reached an understanding.\u201d</p><p>Her brow knits as she takes in the East LA scenery. \u201cIs this a safe spot for us to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis car is like the Batmobile. It\u2019s bulletproof.\u201d</p><p>She peers at me. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I laugh at her gullibility and she swats my arm.</p><p>Pulling into a patchy, fissured parking lot and trying to avoid the potholes, I park and pull out my cell. Emma stares at the row of multi-ethnic businesses while I make a short call. With a limited Spanish vocab stemming from a lifetime of Hispanic caregivers and housekeepers, I request my usual order, doubled. Five minutes later, a tattooed guy in a wife-beater and a loosely-tied apron exits the restaurant storefront with a paper bag and two coffees. He makes a beeline in our direction. The Lotus would stand out in this lot even if it wasn\u2019t yellow.</p><p>My window slides down noiselessly. \u201cGracias, Raul,\u201d I say, passing the coffees to Emma and swapping a twenty for the bag.</p><p>Raul pockets the money and tips his chin up once, murmuring, \u201cDe nada,\u201d before sauntering back inside.</p><p>Handing off the cream containers and sugar packets to Emma, I unwrap one of the small stuffed tortillas, suddenly starving. I\u2019ve already finished one and am starting another while she\u2019s mixing her coffee. By the time I\u2019m backing out, I\u2019ve finished a second burrito and Emma is taking her first tentative bite.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cPotato? And\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCabrito.\u201d I hope she doesn\u2019t know what that is.</p><p>Her brow furrows. \u201cIs that... goat?\u201d</p><p>Damn. \u201cI said it was authentic...\u201d She doesn\u2019t look too disgusted. \u201cNot as bad as tuna, huh?\u201d I remind her of our first official onscreen kiss. MiShaun had admonished me for eating tuna sandwiches beforehand, and I\u2019d played cool about it in front of them and then sprinted to my PA and demanded a toothbrush and toothpaste before we did the scene.</p><p>Emma laughs while finishing her bite, holding a hand over her mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you remember that.\u201d</p><p>My answer is an indirect smile and nothing more, because all I\u2019m remembering right now is the sweetness of her kiss. Brooke can\u2019t get her half of this insane arrangement completed quickly enough for me.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>My research paper boasts a formidable title concerning Flannery O\u2019Connor and didacticism... and not another complete or coherent thought. I\u2019ve completed the research and bits of draft, but my deductions and conclusions are a jumbled mess. Thank God this one isn\u2019t due until Friday\u2014I still have 48 hours to finish it.</p><p>I decide to take a break and see what Mom and Cara are doing when I catch myself staring at nothing and composing a new story for Emma. She seems fond of the steamy narratives I\u2019ve been feeding her every night.</p><p>After which I take freakishly chilly showers.</p><p>I committed to dinner tonight with Brooke, and I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014not with everything I have to do. I suffer from a vague sense of guilt where she\u2019s concerned. At times I sense that she wants more from me, but she never says so. Leading a girl on isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve ever knowingly done, and that\u2019s exponentially true for someone I consider to be a friend. But she\u2019s only pushed me for more once during the course of our friendship, and she was very drunk at the time. Ignoring that whole episode seemed like the best way to deal with it.</p><p>Brooke regards her hard shell as strength. In reality, it\u2019s nothing more than a shield, though I can\u2019t say I blame her for it. I\u2019m one of the few people she allows behind that barrier, and I\u2019ve always felt the need to prove to her that relationships, including friendships, can survive without manipulation or exploitation. Whether I\u2019ve been successful at that attempt is debatable.</p><p>Until last fall, I was sure Brooke\u2019s damage was mostly Reid\u2019s fault. I still believe their relationship had a lot to do with it, but having met him and watched them interact, I think they\u2019re just too similar. Like their impairments run parallel, and some subliminal recognition of that similarity was the reason they were originally drawn to each other.</p><p>Mom always warned my sisters and me that having been raised by a psychologist, we\u2019d all know just enough to be dangerous; I guess I should lay off the amateur analysis. In reality, I have no clue how to help Brooke beyond preserving our friendship. So that\u2019s what I do.</p><p>I meet Mom and Cara on the staircase. My daughter is obviously ready for a nap; when I pick her up, she drops her head on my shoulder after one huge yawn. Mom continues up the stairs and I turn and follow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got that emergency client in about fifteen minutes, and then I have to start grading these damned finals.\u201d The stack of Blue Books in her arms is at least four inches thick. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget I have that faculty retirement party tonight, and I\u2019m dragging your father along with me.\u201d</p><p>Crap. I forgot about the party, and the client appointment\u2014which I\u2019m not telling her since it looks like I was on my way down to retrieve Cara because of it. \u201cUm, I\u2019m supposed to go out to dinner tonight... I totally forgot to ask about that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She hands me Cara\u2019s bunny. \u201cCall Brynn. Maybe she\u2019s free.\u201d Watching me from the doorway as I lay Cara in her bed, Mom tries to pretend like she\u2019s not dying of curiosity. So not working. \u201cEr... who did you say you\u2019re having dinner with?\u201d</p><p>I tuck Cara under her nap blanket with the stuffed toy. \u201cI didn\u2019t. It\u2019s Brooke.\u201d</p> <p>Mom\u2019s face falls. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh as soon as we\u2019re out of the room. \u201cCome on, Mom. You haven\u2019t even seen her in what, two years?\u201d</p><p>She harrumphs. \u201cHas she made positive changes in her life since then? Started therapy? Gained some maturity or had a personality adjustment?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I tap out a text to Brynn to see if she can watch Cara. \u201cMom\u2014try to remember that you\u2019re a professional therapist.\u201d</p><p>She takes my arm, a tactile connection she\u2019s always used when she wants to make sure I\u2019m listening. \u201cI\u2019m also a mother, and I can\u2019t help wanting what\u2019s best for my children.\u201d</p> <p>I frown down at her, knowing exactly what she\u2019s implying. \u201cMom, I\u2019m not dating her.\u201d</p><p>One of her eyebrows crooks up in the expression we share.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing Emma now. I could have sworn Cassie would spill the details of that.\u201d When we get to my room, I start reorganizing the mess of books, journals and paper on my desk and bed as she leans on my door frame.</p><p>\u201cOh, she did. I was just waiting to see if you\u2019d tell me about her.\u201d I crook an eyebrow back at her and she sighs. \u201cCassie liked Emma quite a bit.\u201d A smug smile creeps across my face, and then she adds, \u201cBut watch out for Brooke. I think she has an agenda, whether you see it or not.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying really hard not to roll my eyes like a ten-year-old girl. She makes it sound like I\u2019m incapable of seeing Brooke in a realistic light. \u201cMom, I know you think I\u2019m awesome, but not every girl I meet wants me. Plus, I\u2019ve known Brooke for four years. Don\u2019t you think I\u2019d have seen some evidence of scheming if it was there?\u201d I never told her about that drunken mistake of a kiss, of course, and I don\u2019t plan to.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you haven\u2019t?\u201d She inclines her head as though she knows I\u2019m withholding.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I say, in the interest of placating her.</p><p>She sighs, walking up to me. \u201cIt\u2019s your life, honey.\u201d Frowning again, she pushes the hair off my face, something she\u2019s been doing to me for about a dozen years now. She likes it styled short, but has always deferred to whatever style I prefer\u2014usually a little shaggy, unless I\u2019m required to cut it for a film role. Cupping my chin, she stares up into my eyes. \u201cJust don\u2019t make me say I told you so, because you know I can\u2019t resist saying it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and smile. \u201cDuly warned, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Brooke</p><p>Graham: Can\u2019t do dinner tonight. No babysitter. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>A million things pound through my brain, starting with Goddammit. And then I recognize what an opportunity this is. I can\u2019t freak out at a kid-related set-back or I might as well give up now. I have Rowena all set to go. If Cara tags along, we\u2019ll look like a charming little family. The speculations could be even better than photos of us alone.</p><p>And Graham\u2019s secret would be outed\u2014which will happen as soon as he gets the slightest bit more well-known, but doesn\u2019t need to be tonight. Tonight is about how level-headed I can be about his daddy obligations. Rowena will just have to work a little harder for her photos.</p><p>Brooke: Why don\u2019t I come over? We can order in, and I can help with Cara so you can get back to studying sooner.</p> <p>Graham: That would be cool. You sure?</p><p>Brooke: Absolutely.</p><p>\u201cHey you.\u201d I smile up at him when he answers the door.</p><p>His eyes are warm and his smile is genuine, as always. He pulls the door wide, saying, \u201cHey, Brooke, long time no see.\u201d Such an adorable nerd.</p><p>He probably napped earlier in his jeans and slightly rumpled navy v-neck t-shirt. That one little strand in front sticks up from his disheveled mop of hair. Smiling, I reach up and make it blend with the rest. I\u2019m wearing heels, but he\u2019s still inches taller, even barefoot. He looks good enough to eat, and my stomach flutters when I note his eyes scanning me head to toe. These jeans fit me like a second skin, and the silk top is fluid enough to flash curves and cleavage without explicitly doing either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019re staying in,\u201d he says. I move past him into the foyer, and he shuts the front door and leads the way across the slate flooring. \u201cI\u2019m sure you had hopes of showing off that outfit.\u201d He takes my bag and light scarf, our fingers brushing\u2014sending a zap all the way to my toes. When he turns to hang them on a brass hook in the entryway, I draw in a deep, silent breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat, this? You know me, Graham\u2014heels and silk are comfort clothes.\u201d I haven\u2019t been in this house in two years, but it hasn\u2019t changed. His family is fond of cozy d\u00e9cor, a warm color palette and natural elements. Pretty much the direct opposite design of my place. This setting suits Graham, though\u2014a fact I\u2019ll keep in mind while apartment hunting tomorrow. I want him to feel at home when he\u2019s there.</p><p>Without warning, Cara pops up at my feet and stares up at me, all huge dark eyes. I know from posing the question years ago that his family insisted on a paternity test when she was born, but those eyes are unmistakably Graham\u2019s. Her strawberry blonde hair must be from her mother. It\u2019s in need of a trim. And a flatiron.</p><p>\u201cAre you a Gossip Girl?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cUm, no. I wish! They\u2019re all very pretty.\u201d</p><p>She nods, her eyes never leaving mine. \u201cSo are you. And you dress like them. You could be one if you want.\u201d This kid is as observant and direct as her father.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, thank you. Maybe if I let the producers know that you said so, they\u2019ll let me be on the show. Hmm.\u201d I tap my finger to my chin. \u201cWhich boy should I date?\u201d</p><p>Nose scrunched, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t like the boys. Boys are kind of yucky.\u201d She glances at Graham, who\u2019s trying not to laugh. \u201cExcept for Daddy.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs as I arch a brow and smirk at him. \u201cI agree completely. Boys are yucky, except for your daddy.\u201d</p><p>We order Chinese, and I\u2019m impressed when Cara rattles off what she wants and then eats her whole meal with chopsticks, as though she was born with them in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWow. I don\u2019t think I ever even had Chinese until I moved to LA.\u201d As far as Mom had been concerned during my first fifteen years of life, ethnic meant either Tex-Mex or a jar of Ragu. Dad made a failed effort to broaden my cultural borders during obligatory weekends and parts of summers that I detested giving up for him. I resisted anything he suggested just to spite him, and arrived in LA with a hopelessly unchic palate. Reid was the one who introduced me to the broad array of the ethnic foods I\u2019d missed growing up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get, growing up in Manhattan\u2014a multi-cultural appreciation and an innate knowledge of take-out.\u201d Graham steals a snow pea from Cara\u2019s bowl, and without missing a beat, her chopsticks snatch a broccoli floret from his. Chewing, they smile at each other and I marvel that even this interaction makes me want him.</p><p>By the time I leave, we\u2019ve put Cara to bed and Graham and I have had all the chitchat I can stand. Unfortunately, now isn\u2019t the night for me to slide onto his lap and beg him to carry me to his bedroom. The signals he\u2019s sending are still wholly friendship-based, and I know what comes of pushing him for something he doesn\u2019t know he wants. Patience is one virtue I have in abundance, when I have a target on which to focus. My goal with Graham isn\u2019t just sex and morning-after guilt (on his side\u2014I\u2019d feel no such thing). I want it all.</p><p>Without warning, I hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, referring to a man she recently started seeing: I\u2019m not gonna be some quick lay in the hay. If I want the cha-ching! lifestyle, I have to be patient. I want it all.</p><p>I lay my head back against the taxi seat and close my eyes. I\u2019m. Not. Her.</p><p>I support myself. Entirely. I have my own money. I make my own money. Unlike my mother, who hops from one man\u2019s bank account to another\u2019s, I don\u2019t now and won\u2019t ever need a man for financial support.</p><p>I\u2019m not her. I\u2019m not her. I will never be her.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cI had no idea how often you eat.\u201d After this morning\u2019s interview in San Bernardino, Reid and I set off for San Diego. We\u2019ll do our last early-morning interview of the week there tomorrow, and somehow he talked me into letting him drive us instead of flying.</p><p>He\u2019s already claimed to be starving to death twice, though he admits to having eaten breakfast. First stop: two hash browns, three eggs and orange juice at McDonald\u2019s; second stop: a grande caramel macchiato from Starbucks and a protein bar from the glove compartment. Now we\u2019re keeping our eyes peeled for an In-N-Out somewhere just off I-15, right before we get into San Diego, and it\u2019s not even noon.</p><p>\u201cI need a few thousand calories a day or I\u2019ll start losing muscle. Right after I pass out.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at him. I haven\u2019t so much as looked at a fast food burger in three months, and I\u2019ve already planned a room-service salad for my lunch. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get something this stop, right? Burger? Chocolate shake?\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cAre you serious? We\u2019re going to be on Ellen next week. Don\u2019t you remember what the media did to me last fall when I ate bread one day?\u201d</p><p>Crap. I can\u2019t believe I just reminded him of that.</p><p>He gives me a wicked grin. \u201cAh, yeah, the infamous baby bump week.\u201d He chuckles when I roll my eyes and cross my arms. \u201cEmma, you can\u2019t take that stuff personally\u2014it\u2019s just meaningless gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I not take it personally when people all over the world are discussing which cast hottie knocked me up?\u201d</p><p>He makes a psshh sound, dismissing my argument. \u201cA bunch of stupid speculation, all proved to be fictional in the end.\u201d</p><p>I sigh heavily. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I mean\u2014why should I have to prove that sort of thing to anyone? It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s staring straight out the windshield and I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s going to respond when he points and says, \u201cHa! There it is.\u201d As he exits the highway, he opens the center console, pulls out a Lakers cap and shoves it over his trademark dirty-blond hair. He grins, his blue eyes well hidden behind his mirrored Ray-Bans. \u201cWhaddaya think\u2014regular guy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course\u2014because a Lakers cap and Ray-Bans are automatic regular-guy camouflage. We\u2019d been lucky on the other two stops\u2014the person at the window each time was older and hadn\u2019t recognized him. \u201cReid, we aren\u2019t in Beverly Hills or even Long Beach, and you\u2019re driving a yellow\u2014whatever this is.\u201d</p><p>Pulling into the parking lot, he shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a Lotus. And we\u2019re cruising around So-Cal, not Kansas.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, suppressing a laugh, wondering if he\u2019s actually this clueless about regular people or if he\u2019s just screwing with my head. \u201cWhatever you say, Mr. Regular Guy.\u201d</p><p>Once he lowers his window, the aroma of fries is overwhelming, and my stomach gurgles in protest. I haven\u2019t eaten fries since the last time Emily forced half of hers on me in her typical manner: Get your ass back, would ya? It\u2019s practically nonexistent back there. Reid orders a burger with three meat patties and no cheese, wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun, and a gigantic vanilla shake. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want something?\u201d</p> <p>Clenching my jaw, I shake my head, willing myself not to breathe through my nose.</p><p>When we pull up to the window, the girl working the register tells Reid the total as she turns towards him, and then she nearly stops breathing. He hands her a fifty and her hands shake as she pulls bills and coins from the cash drawer. She has to start her tally over three times. Finally, she hands him his change, but forgets to count it back. Wide-eyed, her hands still trembling, she just shoves the money into his hands all at once.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he smiles, and she looks as though she might faint.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she squeaks, backing away from the window before disappearing around a corner.</p><p>Reid stuffs wadded bills into the front pocket of his jeans and tosses the coins into a cup holder as we wait for the food.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just a guess, mind you\u2014but I think she may have seen through your elaborate Regular Guy disguise.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twists up on one side. \u201cSmart ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Three girls and one guy, all four of them stuffing into the tiny window space, deliver his food, which consists of one small paper bag and one large Styrofoam cup. Our original cashier hands him the shake as four pairs of eye shift back and forth between us, and the guy hands him the bag. It doesn\u2019t take long for them to figure out my identity, too\u2014I hear my name whispered amongst them.</p><p>\u201cWould you like extra napkins?\u201d a second girl asks, handing out a stack two inches thick without waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your straw!\u201d the third girl waves it out the window, blinking rapidly as Reid reaches to take it from her hand.</p> <p>\u201cWill there be anything else?\u201d the boy asks, beaming.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, this is perfect.\u201d Reid turns his smile on them again, and four sighs come from the window. I roll my eyes behind my sunglasses, not that anyone notices.</p><p>We park near an exit, windows down, so he can wolf down the unwieldy beef and lettuce burger. He tries to hand me the shake. \u201cHave some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Toggling it back and forth, he turns on the full-wattage Reid Alexander smile. \u201cI got the large so there would be enough to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He takes a sip, peering at me over the top of his sunglasses, his blue eyes full of amused mischief. \u201cMmm, so good. No?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cAt least hold it for me while I eat, then.\u201d</p><p>With the cup holders full of change and empty Starbucks cups, I\u2019m tricked into taking the shake by my own courteousness. Crap. His stupid bunless burger smells good, coupled with the heady aroma of fresh fries from the restaurant behind us, and my mouth is watering from full awareness that the cup I\u2019m holding is filled with several hundred calories of evil.</p> <p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he says, his tone coaxing, \u201ca sip isn\u2019t going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>By the time a couple of shifty-looking guys pull into the parking lot in a beat-up sedan, eyeballing not so much the Lotus as who\u2019s in the Lotus, Reid has lured me into taking a couple of bites of his burger (which isn\u2019t bad) and sipping enough of the shake that I just told him he\u2019s the devil.</p><p>He watches the two men for about twenty seconds before murmuring, \u201cHmm. Time to go.\u201d I barely have time to rebuckle before he\u2019s revved the engine, reversed out of the end spot and accelerated straight out of the lot with the sedan in pursuit.</p><p>I look back and they\u2019re right behind us. A maniacal smile spreads across the passenger\u2019s face right before a large black camera obscures it. The last thing we want to do is lead the paparazzi directly to the hotel. I spin forward. \u201cThey\u2019re right behind us.\u201d</p><p>Reid glances in his side mirror, smirking. \u201cNot for long.\u201d We hit the entrance ramp and he\u2019s going ninety before we\u2019re fully on the freeway. Gliding around slower-moving cars\u2014by which I mean all other cars\u2014he loses the sedan in the thickening traffic. Reaching for the shake, he curls his hand, still warm from holding the burger, around mine, and leans close to sip from it rather than taking it from me. \u201cMmm. Damn that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat and try to slip my hand out from under his, but he transfers his hand back to the wheel, releasing me. Checking his mirrors, he grins. \u201cRule number one of tailing a Lotus: don\u2019t attempt it in a Hyundai.\u201d</p><p>REID</p><p>We\u2019re almost to the hotel when I get a text from Brooke. It\u2019s a link and nothing more, and I\u2019m pretty damned sure I\u2019ll find photos of Brooke and Graham getting cozy when I click on it. I\u2019ll check it out once I\u2019m in my room.</p><p>\u201cSo, dinner tonight?\u201d I say to Emma, noting that she\u2019s checking her phone as well, and frowning. She doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She glances up, worry in the downward slope of her brows and the unfocused gaze of her gray-green eyes.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>Blinking, she shutters her distressed expression. \u201cOh. Yeah. Fine.\u201d</p><p>My lips twist. \u201cConvincing.\u201d</p><p>She blinks again and shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really. Just... it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>Someone must have alerted her to the photos. I haven\u2019t talked to Brooke in a couple of days, so I have no idea how successful she and Rowena were last night\u2014but if Emma\u2019s response is due to those photos, Brooke\u2019s personal paparazza must have nailed it.</p><p>The traffic is bottlenecking as we get into town, so I can\u2019t do any more than glance at Emma a couple of times to gauge her level of turmoil. Staring out the window, her reflection is no longer scowling. While I don\u2019t get any pleasure from upsetting her, she\u2019ll need to be upset enough to break things off with Graham for this to go down as planned.</p><p>Speed-dialing my manager, I tell him we\u2019re almost there. \u201cAccording to the Garmin, we\u2019ll be there in five to ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. A bodyguard is waiting in the lobby. I\u2019ll have him move outside, just in case.\u201d George is always cautious, which I appreciate. Very little sneaks up on him. The exceptions to that are my occasional dumbass activities... like that under-aged girl I didn\u2019t have to mention to him (thank God and John for that). I hate disappointing George.</p><p>At the hotel valet stand are a couple of bored-looking guys in red vests. A dozen feet behind them, our bodyguard for our stay in San Diego exits the hotel\u2014big and badass, arms crossed over his chest and wearing the characteristic intimidating scowl. He could be one of those Ultimate Fighter competitors. I don\u2019t see any paparazzi or fans\u2014a relief after the hasty departure from the In-N-Out.</p><p>The valets perk up when they spot the Lotus. Normally, I feel possessive of my wheels and hate turning it over to valets, but I\u2019m so over this car that I don\u2019t care. I told Dad to arrange available funds for me to car-shop as soon as the premiere is over. I definitely want a Porsche. John suggested a 911 GT3.</p><p>As Emma and I exit the car, the bodyguard steps up ahead of the valets. They hang back, daunted by his tank-like size. \u201cMr. Alexander, Ms. Pierce, I\u2019m Alek. I\u2019ll be joined by another security team member within the next hour, in case either or both of you need to leave the hotel for any reason, separately or together. Otherwise, we\u2019ll occupy rooms near your suite and are at your disposal during your time in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s eyebrows rise. \u201cUm, thank you, Alek. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d He shakes her hand, giving us each his card and telling us to call him before leaving the suite, so he or his colleague can accompany us wherever we want to go.</p><p>The valets exchange looks, clearly unsure if they\u2019re even allowed to approach us. \u201cHeads up,\u201d I call before tossing the Lotus keys to the one nearest me.</p><p>Alek has all of the luggage except Emma\u2019s laptop bag, which she\u2019s sliding onto her shoulder, and mine, which she hands me as she shuts the trunk lid. \u201cWhat does he mean, \u2018your suite\u2019?\u201d she asks as after I pass a couple of twenties and instructions to the valets and follow her inside.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out in a minute. Production set up the reservation.\u201d I don\u2019t plan to tell her I was contacted for the specific arrangements of said reservation, so I know exactly what \u2018your suite\u2019 indicates.</p><p>The chrome and glass entry doors slide open soundlessly as we walk up to them, and the concierge meets us just inside. \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Pierce. Right this way, please.\u201d</p><p>The suite is a two-bedroom penthouse. A bellhop transfers the luggage upstairs while we\u2019re getting our keys and I\u2019m signing my name and halfway listening as the concierge rattles off the various rider-required items he\u2019s handled for us ahead of time.</p><p>For me: grilled chicken and hardboiled eggs from room service available at any time, a shower with a clear glass door\u2014not a curtain, minimum 1200 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets, ten goose down pillows, two 700-fill down comforters, fresh flowers daily, dry cleaning picked up and returned twice daily, a full gaming system and games (type TBD), wireless controllers and batteries, minimum 52\u201d flat screen television, four new toothbrushes per day (different colors), a lint roller, and a box of Crown condoms.</p><p>Emma\u2019s list: cold bottled water and a bowl of fruit. Shit. In comparison, I come off sounding like J. Lo. Fortunately, she doesn\u2019t seem to be listening, staring at the key in her hand and looking apprehensive.</p><p>Once we\u2019re in the penthouse elevator\u2014which requires one of our room keys to enter\u2014I lean against the pebble-flecked wall, arms crossed loosely. \u201cAre you okay with us sharing a suite? I guess production fell for their own buzz. Just so you know, I\u2019ve stayed here before, and the bedrooms inside the suite are completely separate.\u201d</p><p>The elevator deposits us directly into the living area, the wall of windows opposite displaying an unobstructed ocean view. \u201cWow,\u201d she says. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to object to the suite.</p><p>\u201cCome look.\u201d I walk to the window. When she follows and looks, I point left. \u201cMexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she repeats. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat time do you want to have dinner? We can go out, or have a chef come up and cook for us.\u201d I have to laugh at the look on her face\u2014eyes wide and mouth slightly ajar. \u201cAre you sure you want to give all of this up to go to college, Emma? I\u2019ll bet your agent is already getting daily requests for roles someone wants you to consider...\u201d</p><p>She turns and walks into the Asian-d\u00e9cor seating pit, plopping onto a sofa. \u201cHe is. And I admit it\u2019s tempting.\u201d She gazes around the room, her fingers brushing the soft leather under her hand. \u201cThis is tempting. But there are things I don\u2019t want to give up, even for all of this.\u201d I sit opposite her. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to choose my own direction. My own future. What I wanted was assumed, based on other peoples\u2019 opinions. My dad meant well, but meaning well isn\u2019t really good enough, you know?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t follow her reasoning about wanting to study theatre instead of becoming a huge film star, but it\u2019s easy enough to understand the motivation to direct her own destiny. \u201cThere\u2019s only one problem with making all of your own decisions,\u201d I say, and she waits for me to elaborate. \u201cIf you make a mistake, whether career, relationship or wardrobe-related,\u201d I smile and she does, too, \u201cit\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but your own. You take all of the responsibility, all of the consequences.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo. Dinner. I vote for trying the chef. Like, soon.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cHow can you be hungry enough to think about food again? I\u2019d look like a side of beef if I ate like you do.\u201d</p><p>I flex a bicep at her. \u201cAre you saying I don\u2019t look like a side of beef?\u201d</p><p>The text from Brooke is almost exactly what I thought it would be\u2014photos of her with Graham. But instead of the two of them out together, she\u2019s standing on the stoop at his house, smiling up at him and running her fingers through his hair. And then they go inside. The accompanying article is all conjecture about what they were doing for the three hours and fifteen minutes she was there. There\u2019s a perfect shot of her leaving the apartment with her Cheshire cat smile.</p><p>Me: So operation graham went as planned?</p> <p>Brooke: His kid was there</p><p>Me: Um, what</p><p>Brooke: Shit</p><p>Me: He has a kid??? Calling you.</p><p>\u201cDoes Emma know? Of course she knows... what the hell, Brooke?\u201d My head is spinning. I\u2019m trying to keep my voice down since Emma is somewhere in the suite with nothing more than my flimsy bedroom door between us, but I\u2019m pacing like crazy.</p><p>\u201cReid, you cannot say anything about this to anyone,\u201d Brooke hisses.</p> <p>\u201cHe knows he can\u2019t keep this a secret right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but you have to promise me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything. He knows about our secret indiscretion, after all. That\u2019s why you told him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Obviously. It even makes a weird sort of sense. \u201cWhat about your photographer flunky? No way would she not reveal this.\u201d</p><p>She releases a sigh. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know and I\u2019m not telling her\u2014yet. I want the first public photos of Cara to be the three of us, together.\u201d</p><p>I come to a solid stop. She has this more intricately planned out than I gave her credit for. \u201cYou are beyond frightening. You realize that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She knows exactly what I mean.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Nothing except I\u2019m glad she\u2019s not manipulating me\u2014without my knowledge. \u201cEmma and I are in San Diego. Next week we do a couple of San Fran stations and Ellen, and the week after that Conan, and then the premiere. She\u2019s a little too comfortable at the moment. I\u2019m going to throw her off balance a bit, make sure she knows I\u2019m still interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrooke, you know I don\u2019t kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReid\u2014don\u2019t you f\u2014\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I don\u2019t really need to hear that tirade.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Emma</p><p>Over grilled ciabatta and brie, Reid asks me about Marcus. I admit that we were dating, and that he was correct in assuming I\u2019d broken things off with him right before the disastrous prom night.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you even go with him, then?\u201d He tops off our wine glasses and sets the bottle back into the ice bucket. A chef arrived to make our dinner. She\u2019s in the small gourmet kitchen, so we\u2019re sitting close together on the sofa and talking quietly.</p><p>\u201cI felt guilty.\u201d</p><p>His mouth turns up on one side and he lowers his chin\u2014a look that would have melted me not so long ago. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, concentrating on spreading the brie evenly over the surface of the bread. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to break things off with someone.\u201d</p><p>He takes the cheese spreader from my hand when I\u2019m done. \u201cWhy not wait until after his prom to do it, then? You gave him too much of an opportunity to be an asshole, and he took it.\u201d</p><p>My face warms. \u201cI was worried that he was expecting... things to become more serious.\u201d I glance up to see that he\u2019s mulling over the back and forth that occurred between us. \u201cI thought it was better to be honest up front.\u201d</p><p>He laughs softly. \u201cThe honesty policy doesn\u2019t always work out so well, huh?\u201d</p><p>I purse my lips. \u201cWell, actually, it did. I didn\u2019t feel guilty any more after that. I knew from how he reacted that I\u2019d made the right decision about him, even if it was a wretched night.\u201d</p><p>My words apply to him last fall as well as they do to Marcus two weeks ago, and his eyes tell me he knows it.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, you know,\u201d he says. I swallow and ignore it when his gaze dances to my mouth and back.</p><p>The server who arrived with the chef exits the kitchen and stops several feet away. \u201cPlease excuse me. Dinner is served.\u201d He indicates the small table adorned with linen, china, and a romantic cluster of candles. I worry again that Reid arranged all of this while pretending that production was responsible, and the repetition of his apology from March does nothing to contradict that concern.</p><p>Just when I think he\u2019s dropped the subject, Reid leans back in his chair, twisting the wine glass in his hand and watching me, his eyes as dark as Graham\u2019s in the low light. \u201cSo why\u2019d you break it off with Marcus so suddenly?\u201d He tilts his head. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>Graham thinks I have an effective poker face, but that\u2019s not the case tonight with Reid. Either he\u2019s been spying on me, or my thoughts are as clear as glass to him. I could lie right now, but he\u2019d know. He\u2019s already smiling as though he does. \u201cWho is it?\u201d He leans up, waiting.</p><p>I\u2019m saved by the server again as he removes our salad plates and delivers the main course of pappardelle pasta and roasted mushrooms, but the reprieve is short-lived and Reid isn\u2019t letting this go.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s Graham.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen slightly and fall away from mine momentarily. \u201cReally.\u201d And then those eyes flash to mine and away, as though he knows something I don\u2019t. \u201cHmm. Interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting, why?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head minimally, his attention on his plate as he slices a bite. We dine in silence and I wait for him to elaborate, but he says nothing more. Finally, he rests his silverware on his plate, folding his arms in front of it. He stares at me. \u201cI have one request.\u201d</p><p>Request? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he fucks it up, I want another shot.\u201d Before I can sputter a reply, he holds up one hand and adds, \u201cI don\u2019t want an answer. I just want you to know where I stand. And I\u2019m not going to interfere with whatever you two have going on,\u201d he smiles then, his expression far from angelic, \u201cunless you ask me to.\u201d</p><p>Graham told me two days ago that Brooke was visiting New York\u2014meeting with people about the movie she plans to film late summer. They had dinner together last night, and he was late Skyping with me because of it\u2014but he was completely open with the fact that she\u2019d come over and had spent a couple of hours with him and Cara. And I was fine with it.</p><p>Until I got a text from Emily earlier today, with a link to the paparazzi photos of the two of them. Suddenly his devoted friendship with her isn\u2019t as easy to stomach. On one hand, they\u2019ve known each other for years and have a mutually supportive history I can\u2019t hope to challenge. On the other hand, my best friend is spitting nails and telling me he\u2019s no better than Reid. Her last text asks the question I can\u2019t answer: He never told you he had a KID. What else is he hiding?</p><p>It\u2019s true\u2014I know only what he tells me, and my heart has no problem trusting every word he says. But I was stupid about Reid. I was stupid about Marcus. What if I\u2019m being stupid about Graham, but I just don\u2019t know it yet?</p><p>All I could hope was that the photos wouldn\u2019t look as bad on a full-sized screen as they did on my phone. Once Reid and I checked into the hotel and I shut myself into my room, I brought up the links on my laptop. On my 15-inch screen, they\u2019re definitely worse. Graham stands in the doorway to his home\u2014a place I\u2019ve never been\u2014smiling down at Brooke as she runs her fingers through his hair, her breasts brushing against his chest. There\u2019s no awkwardness or irritation on his face. He seems fine with her touching him that way.</p><p>I\u2019m not fine with it.</p><p>Knowing I had hours before our appointed Skype time, I spent the afternoon napping, reading, and watching Reid play video games, followed by dinner and ending with Reid\u2019s out-of-nowhere declaration. He\u2019d asked me not to answer, and I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He seemed almost confident that Graham would screw up. At best, he\u2019s seen the photos; at worst, his new and improved relationship with Brooke makes him privy to information I don\u2019t have. His indirect allegation planted a seed of doubt that I can\u2019t reject entirely, as much as I want to.</p><p>At 9:00, I sign on and am so happy to see Graham\u2019s face that I almost want to ignore the whole confrontation. \u201cHey,\u201d he smiles.</p><p>At 9:01 I get a text from Emily: You are not allowed to ignore this btw. ASK HIM.</p><p>\u201cHi. All done with finals?\u201d</p><p>He heaves a deep sigh. \u201cYeah. One more paper to wrap up and I\u2019ll be finished. How are you? Snug in your hotel room, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m so ready to get up after sunrise again. I\u2019ve been up before 5:00 every day this week.\u201d</p><p>At 9:02, Emily proves how well she knows me with another text: I\u2019m serious, Em. ASK. HIM.</p><p>I bite my lip, debating the words to use. \u201cGraham, um, Emily sent me a link to some photos...\u201d I hope he knows about them already, that he can explain them away.</p><p>\u201cWhat photos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf you and Brooke?\u201d I hate the inflection of my voice\u2014like this is a harmless question.</p><p>\u201cBrooke? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know. Damn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending you the link.\u201d My heart is pounding as I watch him pull up a browser and click on the link, no sound but the tapping of his laptop keys.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious when the link is loaded\u2014his brows knit and he looks pissed. \u201cWhat the hell. This was last night.\u201d He examines the three photos closely, and then his eyes scan side-to-side as he reads the accompanying story. I wait silently for his response. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally he pulls up the Skype screen, and my first instinct is to hide my face. \u201cEmma, you know none of this is true, right?\u201d</p><p>This is what I want him to say. Exactly what I want him to say. The last thing I want to be is a clingy girl who\u2019s so insecure that she can\u2019t handle her boyfriend talking to another girl, but I can\u2019t brush aside the uneasiness. \u201cBut the pictures\u2014the way she\u2019s touching you...\u201d A knock sounds on my door, and I\u2019m glad for the escape. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d</p><p>When I pull it open, Reid stands there with the room service menu in his hand. \u201cHey, did you want some\u2014what\u2019s the matter, Emma?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, feeling like an idiot and trying not to cry. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>He tosses the menu in a chair and his hands go to my shoulders. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I repeat, stepping back and grabbing the menu. I hand it back to him. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry, but thanks.\u201d</p><p>He spots the open laptop on my bed and arches a brow. His voice lowers to a whisper. \u201cTalking to Graham?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>He takes my chin in his hand, looks into my eyes, and in the same low tone tells me, \u201cCome talk to me when you\u2019re done, if you need to.\u201d Fantastic\u2014he\u2019s definitely seen the photos.</p> <p>I nod again, so he\u2019ll leave, and I shut the door behind him once he does.</p><p>Graham\u2019s expression is shuttered when I return. \u201cWas that Reid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he coming to your room?\u201d</p><p>My answer slips out before I consider the implications of it. \u201cWe\u2019re in a suite.\u201d</p><p>He gazes at me silently, sitting back slowly from the webcam, becoming blurry. His hand lays curved across his mouth as though he\u2019s literally preventing himself from speaking. His fingers shift and two words escape. \u201cA suite?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are two bedrooms.\u201d My tone is defensive. He\u2019s questioning Reid sharing a living room with me for one night, while the whole world is viewing photos of him with Brooke pressed to his chest as she gazes up at him, her fingertips grazing his forehead in an intimate caress.</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you implying, Graham?\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m not implying anything. I just don\u2019t trust him.\u201d He stares away from the screen, silent after this pronouncement, and my screen\u2019s image of him is still too distant for me to guesstimate his theories. His physical withdrawal is easy enough to read, though, even from thousands of miles away.</p><p>The constricted sensation that keeps me from swallowing prevents me from replying as well. Not trusting Reid shouldn\u2019t affect Graham\u2019s confidence in me.</p><p>Finally, he looks at the screen and leans closer, and I gulp at the lump in my throat, sliding down like a grapefruit in my windpipe.</p><p>\u201cI have a research paper to finish and turn in tonight, so we\u2019ll talk tomorrow, all right?\u201d he says, and I nod and whisper goodnight.</p><p>GRAHAM</p> <p>What did I tell Emma before\u2014that I\u2019m not possessive? Screw that.</p><p>During the past three weeks, we\u2019ve spent an hour or more on Skype every night that we weren\u2019t together. She\u2019s relayed stories about her stepmother, childhood acting gigs and Emily, and I\u2019ve strummed my guitar and sung her lines of songs that I might or might not have written, which might or might not be about her.</p><p>Tonight we were off in fifteen minutes. Her naivet\u00e9 about Reid Alexander was pissing me off and I was about to unleash a whole string of assertions that can\u2019t be unsaid.</p><p>I\u2019ve watched my parents when they argue. Their disagreements seldom become elevated enough to include raised voices, but whenever my father\u2019s jaw is so clenched that he could grind diamonds between his teeth, he goes for a walk around the block. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of weather it is, either\u2014I\u2019ve seen him take off in tempest conditions and come back soaked to the bone with an inside-out umbrella. The point is to never say words you can\u2019t take back.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were supposed to communicate with each other?\u201d Cassie asked Mom once, years ago, after Dad stomped rigidly out the front door. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what your whole, like, career is based on telling people to do?\u201d</p><p>Brynn and I eavesdropped from around the corner. We stared at each other in mute acknowledgement of Cassie\u2019s direct hit. Cassie was often Dad\u2019s advocate, though Mom usually told her to stay out of it. This time she merely sighed. \u201cYes, but there are exceptions. When you find yourself about to say something that crosses a line, something that could cause irreparable harm, sometimes the best you can do is just not say that thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad would never say something like that,\u201d Cassie huffed.</p><p>Mom laughed once, no amusement in the sound. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I do have a paper due tomorrow, but the body of the paper is done; only the citations page remains. Inadvertently, I\u2019ve instituted my own version of walking around the block, because there are a load of words threading through my skull right now and none of them are easygoing or objective.</p><p>I don\u2019t fault Reid for his multitude of casual hookups. I\u2019m a guy\u2014I\u2019ve had plenty of my own and I\u2019m not that big of a hypocrite. What I fault him for are the two times I know of that he actively encouraged a girl to fall ass over elbows for him\u2014as Brooke would say\u2014when he had no intention of sticking around. I could excuse what he did to Brooke as immaturity, if he hadn\u2019t done the same thing to Emma recently. As soon as he doesn\u2019t get what he wants, he\u2019s out screwing as many girls as he can run through.</p><p>Emma seems to think that because he\u2019s playing nice at the moment, he\u2019s above suspicion. Like he took no for an answer where she was concerned. But I watched him that night everyone went out\u2014the calculating gaze he leveled on her. If this was two hundred years ago, I\u2019d have contemplated taking him outside and beating the shit out of him for looking at her like that\u2014and that pinky swear thing he did with her would have guaranteed it.</p><p>My paper submitted, I\u2019m unofficially finished with college. At one time, I considered pursuing graduate degrees and becoming a professor like my parents, but that was a year or so ago, before I began getting more steady work as an actor. Standing in front of a class droning on about analytical symbolism and rhetorical theory while striving for tenure and churning out research? Strangely, some of that is appealing. But I enjoy acting more, and I don\u2019t need to reach Reid Alexander status to feel successful doing it.</p><p>It\u2019s almost 11:00 p.m. in San Diego, but Emma has to be up early to get to the studio. As sure as I am of her, as sure as I want to be, I don\u2019t want to think about the fact that I left her hurt and angry tonight, with no one to talk to but Reid Alexander. Not my brightest move.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask her about her interview in San Bernardino. I didn\u2019t find out if the drive to San Diego in Reid\u2019s bright yellow Matchbox car was as uneventful as he\u2019d predicted. I didn\u2019t tell her the end of the story where I\u2019m the TA in her literature class, and she\u2019s the student who forgot to turn in her paper on time...</p><p>I hadn\u2019t batted an eye at the photo and story of Reid kissing her at the airport. She told me it was on the cheek (the photo angle made it impossible to tell), and over so quickly that she didn\u2019t even feel it.</p><p>I know how the paparazzi play their games.</p><p>And I do trust her.</p><p>So she should trust me when I tell her there\u2019s nothing between me and Brooke but a strong, committed friendship.</p><p>I pull up the photos again, and read the short blurb.</p><p>Is another undercover romance blooming inside the School Pride cast? Brooke Cameron (of Life\u2019s a Beach fame) was spotted cozying up to costar Graham Douglas late Wednesday in the doorway of his Manhattan brownstone. They spent a long evening catching up, we presume, as Ms. Cameron left the home alone and none the worse for wear after a visit lasting a bit over three hours. Cameron and Douglas play Caroline Bingley and Bill Collins, respectively, in one of the most highly anticipated teen hits of the summer.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m sorry for bailing on you so early. Skype tomorrow at 9?</p><p>Emma: Okay</p><p>Me: Miss you</p><p>Emma: Miss you too</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Brooke</p><p>Reid: Bullseye. She was pretty much in tears.</p><p>Me: Goooooal!</p><p>Reid: You are completely deficient in empathy, aren\u2019t you?</p><p>Me: When required, yes. So did you comfort her?</p><p>Reid: Offered. She stayed in her room.</p><p>Me: Losing your touch?</p><p>Reid: My touch is as intact as ever, thx.</p><p>Growing up in the suburbs of Austin meant playing soccer. I got stuck in the goal far too often during the first couple of seasons, and since my team sucked ass, I was repeatedly scored on. I often left the field crying and wiping snot onto my sleeve. My coach\u2014another player\u2019s father\u2014took my tears as typical feminine weakness, patting my shoulder and telling me not to cry\u2014all we\u2019ll show \u2019em what-for next time.</p><p>Coach Will missed the point. I wasn\u2019t dejected; I was pissed as hell that my team didn\u2019t have a single player who deserved to call herself a defender, including his incompetent, stuck-up daughter. What my coach failed to understand was that as much of a girl as I appeared to be\u2014fat blonde curls tumbling from my ponytail, the ribbons in my hair and threaded through my shoes perfectly matching my uniform\u2014I was in actuality a carnivorous monster who wanted to chew up the field with my custom-ordered pink cleats.</p><p>I was six.</p><p>By age seven, my father had me enrolled in summer soccer camps run by actual adult soccer players, and my natural abilities began to shape into skilled aggression. When fall rolled around, Dad demanded that they put me on a better team with a coach who wasn\u2019t \u201can inept dumbshit who couldn\u2019t tell his ass from a hole in the ground.\u201d The first game of the season was against my old team. I scored three goals and fouled my ex-coach\u2019s daughter with a perfect ankle-hooking trip that left her face-planted in the middle of the recently muddy field.</p><p>I had to sit out the rest of the game, which we won because of my pre-halftime scores. I was the star forward from that point on, and the only time I played dirty was when it was called for. People would be surprised how frequently playing dirty is called for when you\u2019re the prettiest, fastest player on a competitive first-place team, especially when that team is named the Butterflies.</p><p>Dad stopped coming to my games once he had a new wife, a new family, and new-and-improved soccer players to half-raise and discard. I don\u2019t know why I gave a shit whether or not he came, but I did. Maybe because the soccer field was the only place I ever felt like he got me, so it was like I didn\u2019t exist for him anymore. When I started high school I quit cold turkey, which was fine with Mom. She never understood Sporty Girl-Power Brooke anyway.</p><p>She submitted my picture to a modeling agency and I got a print ad, and then I got a commercial, to be shot in LA. Mom had always staunchly refused to be a soccer mom; stage mom was more her speed. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, eh?\u201d I hand Emma the pull-handle to her carry-on, and she holds it, and her laptop bag, firmly between us. Her tense smile tells me she expects me to respect the not-so-subtle barrier she\u2019s erected. Unless I\u2019m willing to breach a wall of luggage, there won\u2019t be a repeat of the kiss on her cheek that showed up all over the Internet a week ago, giving the impression of more than it was. Much more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you in a couple of days?\u201d she says, holding out her hand.</p><p>I\u2019ve kissed this girl. Made out with this girl. Still remember her breathless, \u201cYes,\u201d from that afternoon when I told her I wanted her in my bed, before everything fell apart. Somehow, though, none of those memories feel connected to her\u2014this girl standing in front of me, extending a hand for me to shake like we\u2019re respectable business colleagues and I\u2019ve never had my tongue in her mouth or my hands up her shirt.</p><p>I\u2019ve gotten way too good at my own ability to disengage.</p><p>I take her hand, but instead of merely shaking it, I lean forward and pull it up to my lips, kissing her just behind the middle knuckle. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll be meeting me in San Fran after all, huh?\u201d</p> <p>She inclines her head and smirks, pulling her hand from mine and readjusting the laptop strap. \u201cI guess. But I get the feeling that meeting Monday and Tuesday mornings at 5:00 a.m. for more morning show interviews isn\u2019t what you had in mind.\u201d</p><p>Correct. \u201cCome on, Emma. We have to go somewhere cool Monday night.\u201d I turn to walk back around to the driver\u2019s side, because we\u2019re getting some attention from other departing passengers who\u2019ve begun to figure out who we are. She\u2019s flying home to Sacramento while I\u2019m driving back to LA alone. \u201cSan Francisco is a culinary heaven. And I\u2019ll have you back to your room in time for your Skype appointment.\u201d I wink at her and she rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh-kay,\u201d she says, as though she\u2019s exasperated and I\u2019ve worn her down.</p><p>I feel as though she just moved a game piece that puts her that much closer to check mate, and I can\u2019t help thinking what a bastard I\u2019ve turned into.</p><p>All\u2019s fair in love and war. A fine sentiment\u2014if this was either.</p> <p>\u201cJohn. Please tell me you have something stimulating on tap for tonight.\u201d</p><p>I-5 is two hours of spotty cell service with occasional ocean views, until it veers away from the Pacific and loses all aesthetic appeal, becoming frequently punctuated with snarls of traffic in heavily populated areas. I\u2019m already bored out of my mind and I still have at least another hour to go, probably two, because of traffic anywhere near LA this time of day.</p><p>\u201cThat depends what you mean by stimulating, man. On a scale of one to porn, where do you wanna be?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a car full of girls next to me, all of them trying to see through the nearly opaque window tint. Right before the light turns, I roll the windows down and glance over, watch their mouths all turn into \u201cO\u201d as the signal switches to green and I\u2019m gone. \u201cOne to porn. Hmm. I\u2019d say a solid eight or nine would do.\u201d</p><p>John yawns into my ear. \u201cEight isn\u2019t out of the question. This girl who was on my econ project team is having a dinner party tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner party? What the hell man\u2014we\u2019re not thirty-five.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I thought, until she dragged me to one last week that her sorority sister was hosting. Basically everyone sits around being all pseudo-intellectual and getting stoned. All I had to do to seem like the smartest guy there was shut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo pretty much your natural state when stoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Less than two weeks until the premiere\u2014at which point one of two things will happen. Most likely: Brooke will succeed with Operation Graham, and Emma, in her emotionally defenseless state, will fall into my arms with one good pull. Less likely: Brooke will fail, Graham and Emma will run off into the sunset holding hands and making everyone within a ten-mile radius vomit, and I\u2019ll be free to go back to the openly hedonistic life that other nineteen-year-old guys would kill to have. It\u2019s win-win, if I can just get to it.</p><p>When we arrive, John\u2019s girl answers the door, pressing herself into him. \u201cYou\u2019re late. I thought you weren\u2019t coming,\u201d she chides. She\u2019s one of those squeaky-voiced girls, which fits her tiny size. Standing behind him, I can\u2019t actually see her. I only know she\u2019s on the other side of him because I can hear her.</p><p>He hitches a thumb over his shoulder. \u201cI had to pick Reid up. You said you needed another guy for the boy-girl balance, so I delivered.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes peek over his shoulder then, and immediately widen. \u201cYou brought\u2014Reid Alexander?\u201d she squeaks. \u201cThat\u2019s who you meant when you said you were bringing Reid?\u201d</p><p>John isn\u2019t usually one to keep our friendship secret, our relationship being a major part of his social resume. Then again, he sometimes savors other people\u2019s shock when he introduces me as a friend in person. I don\u2019t mind. I actually sorta like it.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that already?\u201d His voice is all blas\u00e9 and it\u2019s an effort for me not to laugh. He glances back at me with the same laugh-evading expression I\u2019m wearing. \u201cI\u2019m almost sure I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no. I\u2019d have remembered that. Ohmigod.\u201d</p><p>I step up to stand next to John, handing over a bottle of wine I took from Dad\u2019s collection right before we left. Hopefully it\u2019s something old and expensive, but not old enough to taste like shit.</p><p>John makes the introductions, epitomizing the perception of no big deal. \u201cReid, Bianca. Bianca, Reid.\u201d</p><p>She takes the bottle with a strangled, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d John chuckles when she tosses a small glare at him, mixed with newfound appreciation, before turning and walking into the open room and announcing, \u201cHey guys, this is John, and, uh, Reid...\u201d</p><p>Five people\u2014three girls and two guys\u2014sit mashed around a table that looks thrift-store shabby but upon closer inspection was just made to look that way. The chairs and dishes are mismatched, too, as though this in itself coordinates with the cinderblock walls and exposed pipes. Pretend grunge annoys the shit out of me for some reason, but I\u2019m not here to pass judgment on the d\u00e9cor.</p><p>Four people stare at me, open-mouthed. The other guy looks at me, then John, then the others, and back around full-circle, confusion etched on his face. He says something to the girl near him, who says something back. \u201cOhhh,\u201d he says, and then his expression catches up with everyone else\u2019s: slack-jawed awe at a celebrity, in the flesh, at their intimate little dinner party. I glance at John. He eats this shit up.</p><p>Bianca and one of the other girls share the open-loft apartment. Everyone attends USC, where John is, shockingly, still on track to complete the business degree his CFO father expects. We\u2019re lingering over the barely-edible pasta the girls made and John is opening our fourth or fifth bottle of wine, and the talk has strayed to classic hipster topics\u2014philosophy and music\u2014neither of which will ever have a definitive answer. Animated conversation ensues, and John and I follow his earlier edict for dealing with this kind of bullshit: shut up and stay that way.</p><p>Bianca\u2019s roommate, Jo, has turned narrowed eyes on me several times. So far, I\u2019ve been ignoring her. Finally, while the others all talk over each other, I lean up, catching her pointed stare and hold it. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d I ask, and she laughs without a trace of humor.</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought you celebrity types were above lines, especially something so pass\u00e9.\u201d Her voice is a direct contrast to her roommate\u2019s\u2014husky and almost masculine.</p><p>\u201cYou think that was a pick-up line?\u201d I laugh once and shake my head. \u201cSorry, sweetheart, but no. I was just wondering what I\u2019d done to earn the death-stare. I figure either I screwed you at some point and I don\u2019t remember\u2014and you\u2019re pissed... or I didn\u2019t bother\u2014and you\u2019re pissed. So which is it?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth drops open and her eyes blaze. Grabbing two of the empty wine bottles, she stomps into the kitchen. I think about following her, but decide against making the effort. At least now she has a reason to hate me.</p><p>A couple of hours later we\u2019re like a heap of puppies on the floor, heads on thighs, feet in laps, arms draped over abdomens. People get a lot friendlier when they\u2019re high, though not necessarily more interesting. Bianca\u2019s reclining halfway on one of the guys, who\u2019s delivering an address about what constitutes a lie, philosophically speaking, and quoting Kant and Augustine. John is caressing Bianca\u2019s calf, making her moan and then giggle once he gets to her ankle. She sits up and swats his hand, and then they\u2019re kissing. Easy enough to see where this party is going.</p><p>When I look away from them, I catch Jo giving me that same glare from the other side of the circle. Hell, even being high doesn\u2019t calm her inner bitch. She would incinerate me on the spot if she could, and I have no idea why. I give her a hooded smile.</p><p>When Bianca takes John\u2019s hand and pulls him down the hall, one of the other couples breaks off into a recliner in the corner, leaving Jo, me and two other people who look like they\u2019d rather mess around with us than each other. We ignore them and they eventually take the hint, twisting around each other on the sofa, and then Jo gets up and walks to her room down the hall. I get up and follow.</p><p>I wonder if she\u2019ll bite my tongue if I go for it, if she\u2019ll draw blood. She\u2019s standing in the middle of her room and I walk up to her, leaning down to kiss her, nothing touching but our mouths. I trace her lips with my tongue. When she opens and I thrust my tongue in her mouth, pulling her closer, it\u2019s good for a few seconds... and then she\u2019s shoving her tongue in my mouth, pulling my hands down to my sides and taking charge.</p><p>I don\u2019t mind aggressive girls\u2014hell, Brooke had no problem telling me what she wanted and how she wanted it, and some of my older partners have been the same way. Telling me what to do, where to go? No problem. Sticking a tongue down my throat? No thanks. What\u2019s arousing and what isn\u2019t is individual, and there\u2019s no changing it.</p><p>This will require as little kissing as I can manage.</p><p>I close the door and pop the lock as she\u2019s unbuttoning her blouse, and I\u2019m still curious about the earlier animosity. Especially now. \u201cYou have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs off her shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything. Just shut up and get undressed.\u201d</p><p>For half a second, I consider. It\u2019s no-strings sex, and she is attractive. Most guys don\u2019t generally turn down sex in these circumstances.</p><p>I\u2019m not most guys.</p><p>I turn and unlock the door, pulling my phone from my pocket to call a taxi. This situation is close enough to humorous that I\u2019m smiling. Before I get the door open, she\u2019s pushing it closed, taking a deep breath. \u201cOkay, wait. Yes.\u201d</p><p>My hand is still on the doorknob. \u201cYes what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the second one. We were at a party, making out, and some blonde whore walked up and grabbed your hand and you just went off with her.\u201d She says all of this in such a rush that the words run together. \u201cIt was years ago. Before anyone knew who you were. I remembered, though, because no guy had ever humiliated me like that. No one\u2019s done it since, either.\u201d</p><p>The blonde was undoubtedly Brooke. This was one of her favorite little games\u2014she\u2019d pick some random girl at a party or a club, and tell me to go get her mindless. And then she\u2019d just walk up and take me away. I was so hot for Brooke that I never really thought of how the other girls felt, being deserted like that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you want from me now, to make it up to you. Send me packing tonight? The only guy in the house not getting any?\u201d I give her half a smile, hoping for that outcome. I\u2019m so not in the mood right now.</p><p>\u201cNo. Make it up to me there.\u201d She points to her bed and lays her hand on mine\u2014the one on the doorknob.</p><p>Shit. I\u2019m trapped. I guess I\u2019ve been stuck in worse encounters than having sex when I\u2019m not really motivated to. \u201cAs long as you know it\u2019s just tonight.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cYeah, I know all about your little romance\u2014is it real, or publicity?\u201d</p> <p>It takes me a second to realize she\u2019s talking about Emma. \u201cYeah, not discussing that.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cSure. Okay. I get it.\u201d</p><p>I drop my hand from the doorknob. \u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hand, pulls me back across the room. \u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p> <p>Emma</p><p>I called the hotel this morning to make sure Reid and I were booked into separate rooms for our two nights in San Francisco. Not because I don\u2019t trust Reid, but because Graham doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Which bothers me, but I understand it. The relationships we\u2019ve had with Reid and Brooke trigger that small voice of what if in each of us. He thinks what if she\u2019s not over Reid, and I think what if he\u2019s really in love with Brooke.</p><p>Thursday night, after Graham texted and said he missed me, I answered that I missed him, too. And then I lay in bed, scrolling through our old messages to each other, all the way back to the one where I asked him to meet me that morning before Dad and I left New York. He hadn\u2019t answered, but he\u2019d come. That morning, I wanted him in my life so much that I was willing to accept friendship-only terms, willing to swallow my desire, even if the thought of him with someone else induced a soul-deep ache.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that now. I\u2019m in too far. I want too much.</p><p>I think, too, about Reid\u2019s request. I ignored it, because of course Graham\u2019s not going to screw this up. And then I picture Brooke, pressed against him, touching him, and I tell myself for the hundredth time that he isn\u2019t lying to me. But I\u2019m worried that he\u2019s lying to himself.</p> <p>I wish I\u2019d never seen that paparazzi photo. The thing I fear most would be so much easier to dismiss if it hadn\u2019t been burned it into my eyeballs in living color. While I\u2019m at it, I wish Emily had never seen it. She won\u2019t drop the fact that he was secretive about Cara, even when I tell her that he isn\u2019t secretive, he\u2019s guarded, and yes, there\u2019s a difference. \u201cEmily, I trust him,\u201d I say, and she harumphs. Maybe she hears the fear in my voice. Because that\u2019s what it is\u2014this isn\u2019t distrust. It\u2019s fear.</p><p>When I sign into Skype, Graham is waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cTen more days,\u201d I say, and he smiles.</p><p>We talk about our days. He took Cara to the park. I got my first slightly traumatic, very awkward airport pat-down.</p><p>\u201cStrangely enough, the fact that she snapped on latex gloves beforehand didn\u2019t make me feel any better. She kept stopping and saying, \u2018Sensitive area,\u2019 when she was about to go somewhere I don\u2019t let anyone touch me.\u201d I blush when I realize that isn\u2019t quite true, and even if my webcam doesn\u2019t reveal redder toned skin, I must be giving something away, because Graham arches a brow.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head slowly. \u201cI think maybe you\u2019ve been a very naughty traveler, Emma.\u201d</p> <p>I fall over onto the mattress laughing, embarrassed and turned on. \u201cNo more blue gloves! Please!\u201d I say from my prone position. At most, he can see the edge of my hip.</p><p>\u201cYou know the rules,\u201d he says. \u201cNo glove, no love.\u201d</p><p>I sit up. \u201cI cannot believe you just said that after what I went through today.\u201d</p><p>He laughs again while I pout. \u201cI couldn\u2019t resist. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He tells me he\u2019s been through the pat-down and a couple of body scans while traveling, and whenever he wears one particular band t-shirt to fly, it seems to provoke a random luggage search. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre. Radiohead t-shirt equals luggage search. Every. Time. I\u2019m a little worried they\u2019ll go for body cavities at some point.\u201d</p><p>We talk a few minutes more, and then he clears his throat and says, \u201cUm, I need to tell you about something.\u201d</p><p>His tone tells me this isn\u2019t a good something. For a couple of seconds, I can\u2019t breathe. My heart is thudding in my chest. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath. \u201cYou know I\u2019m graduating on Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes.\u201d I sense he\u2019s not going for congratulations.</p><p>\u201cBrooke is coming to the ceremony.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair. \u201cI would have told you before, but I honestly forgot about her plans to come whenever we were talking, and I didn\u2019t want to just text it to you.\u201d</p><p>Brooke is attending Graham\u2019s graduation. I frown. \u201cWhen did you invite her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, really, she just offered, last week. We met right before I started at Columbia, and I guess she just wants to show her support\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d I stop him before he offers more details about their years-long, dedicated friendship. \u201cYou\u2019re really close and you have been for years before you met me, so there\u2019s nothing for me to be concerned about.\u201d Jealous about. Jealous is what I want to say. But I am concerned. I am jealous. I am Emma the green-eyed monster.</p><p>\u201cEmma, I don\u2019t want to upset you...\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on between Brooke and me\u2014any more than there\u2019s something going on between you and Reid.\u201d</p><p>I gasp. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s not. You\u2019ve actually been intimate... with him.\u201d He realizes mid-sentence what he\u2019s stepped into, but it\u2019s too late to extricate himself from it.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not looking at my face on his screen. His eyes are turned away. So I wait. Finally, they blink back at me, dark and unreadable. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t know what I mean. And I know it\u2019s none of my business, and I have no right to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk what? Ask if I\u2019ve slept with him?\u201d</p><p>A muscle clenches at his temple. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you, Emma. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he sits back against his pillows. I hate it when he does that, because I can\u2019t see his face clearly at all. \u201cOf course I care.\u201d His voice is so soft, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s speaking softly or if it\u2019s just because he\u2019s moved away from the laptop microphone.</p><p>\u201cOkay. So it\u2019s not your business. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d I don\u2019t tell him how very close we came. He doesn\u2019t need to know that. His eyes close and he breathes another sigh. \u201cYour turn,\u201d I say.</p><p>A crease appears between his brows. \u201cMy turn for what?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head. \u201cYou. And Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d There\u2019s no hesitation. \u201cI\u2019ve never slept with Brooke. I thought I told you, the morning we first talked about all of this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you didn\u2019t love her. You never said you hadn\u2019t slept with her.\u201d</p><p>We fall silent after this exchange, and the huge space between us feels electrically charged. My throat closes up and even though I\u2019m relieved, I feel like crying.</p><p>\u201cEmma, what\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d He\u2019s never called me that before. Close to the webcam now, his eyes are worried. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t want you to feel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsecure?\u201d A tear winds down my cheek and I thumb it away.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t insecure. This is new for both of us\u2014this relationship. And we\u2019re trying to build it from a distance, after months of separation...\u201d He runs a hand through his hair again and makes a frustrated sound. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult. But not impossible. I\u2019m sorry about Brooke, and for asking you about Reid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I want you to know.\u201d My voice lowers. \u201cYou need to know, right? That it will be the first time for me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so, yeah. I hadn\u2019t... really thought of it that way. I\u2019ve never, um...\u201d He chews his lip, eyes shifting down and then back up to watch my face on his screen. \u201cI\u2019ve never been with a virgin.\u201d</p><p>My mind is racing, but coming to no conclusions at all. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>His hand rubs over his face. \u201cGod,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you want nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham,\u201d I say, and he moves his hand down to his mouth, uncovering his eyes, watching me. \u201cTrust me. That\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>REID</p><p>Emma and I are meeting in the lobby at 5:00 a.m. for the first local station interview. We have a second one Tuesday, followed by a live radio interview in the afternoon. Thursday, we\u2019re taping Ellen.</p><p>When I tell Brooke what I said to Emma\u2014that I wanted another shot if Graham fucked up\u2014she freaks. \u201cOh my God, Reid. Shit. That was a huge risk... but maybe she\u2019ll automatically turn to you when she realizes he\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my thought.\u201d I\u2019m clicking through muted television channels, reclining against a mound of pillows on the hotel bed. Emma is just down the hall. I texted her earlier, told her I was here, and suggested that we meet in the lobby tomorrow morning. I\u2019ve made plans for us tomorrow night, so I\u2019m giving her unpressured space tonight.</p><p>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t answer you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I didn\u2019t want one. That I just wanted her to know where I stood.\u201d Leaving the television tuned to music videos, I set the volume on low, like white noise. Emma plays videos in the background in her hotel room like some sort of soundtrack to her life, and I\u2019ve wondered but forgotten to ask her if she does this at home, too. \u201cSo what makes you think you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her voice is confused.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I inherited the capacity for debate or I just picked it up as a result of growing up with an attorney, like self-preservation. I\u2019m already imagining what Brooke might say, and what I\u2019ll counter with. \u201cYou\u2019ve said a couple of times now that you\u2019re \u2018right\u2019 for Graham. Do you think you love him?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s silent for a long moment and I think she\u2019s about to tell me that how she feels about him isn\u2019t my business and by the way go to hell. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what, Reid?\u201d Exasperation saturates her words. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want to know, not that it\u2019s your business anyway. But I\u2019m in the mood to humor you. So why what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think you love him?\u201d Accent on think. Which she catches.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a weird way to put that,\u201d she muses. \u201cWhy do you think you love him rather than why do you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t believe in love.\u201d Whoa\u2014that came out a little bitter. Wounded, even. Shit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s quiet again. And then, \u201cYou used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. You know how that ended.\u201d Dammit. Why am I saying this to her of all people? She grows quiet again and I wish I\u2019d never asked the question.</p><p>\u201cKathryn told me once that loving someone means you want what\u2019s best for them. And I\u2019m what\u2019s best for him.\u201d Kathryn is Brooke\u2019s stepmother\u2014one of them. She\u2019s the one Brooke is closest to. Ironically, they didn\u2019t have to have any relationship at all, because Kathryn was her father\u2019s first wife\u2014but for some reason, they\u2019ve always been close. Which is good, because Brooke\u2019s mother is one crazy bitch.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like convoluted logic to me. My father would say it\u2019s a conflict of interest for you to decide that you\u2019re what\u2019s best for him.\u201d And there\u2019s my alter-ego again.</p> <p>\u201cAre you trying to talk me out of this? Because you\u2019ll never get Emma away from him if I don\u2019t succeed.\u201d</p><p>Wow\u2014complete avoidance of my argument and a below-the-belt insult. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Ever heard of devil\u2019s advocate? And what the hell, Brooke? I mean shit, I know you think he\u2019s better than me. I get it. You don\u2019t have to fucking underscore it every time we talk.\u201d</p><p>She huffs a sigh. \u201cThis conversation has gotten way out of hand. Look, we\u2019re allies on this little venture, but we aren\u2019t friends. When this is over, I don\u2019t care if I ever talk to you again and I\u2019m sure you feel the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s stop pretending we\u2019re BFFs and focus on what we\u2019re doing. This week is all about me winning his family over\u2014God, what a pain in the ass that\u2019ll be\u2014and you continuing to be emotionally available for Emma. While keeping your dick in your pants.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou really have a way with words. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m blunt. Sue me.\u201d</p><p>I knew Emma would love the seafood place in Union Square, with its century-old architecture and an interior resembling an underwater fantasy. One look at her face as we entered confirmed my assumption. We\u2019re escorted to the glass-walled semi-private room I reserved, where we can observe the rest of the place while the bodyguard who accompanied us blocks the door and any possible intrusions.</p><p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019re inside an aquarium,\u201d she says, leaning closer. \u201cI keep expecting someone to tap on the glass or make fish faces at us.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve had caviar and oysters on the half shell and tomato bisque soup, with the main course and dessert still to go. Emma has vowed to be on her stair-stepper from the moment she gets home tomorrow afternoon until Thursday morning, when we meet in Burbank to tape Ellen.</p><p>I lean up on my elbows after the waiter clears the second course dishes. \u201cSo when did this thing with Graham begin?\u201d I expected to startle her with this question, but I didn\u2019t foresee the full-on blush that floods her face. My eyes narrow. \u201cWait... was it before that night in the club?\u201d The night Graham threatened to kick my ass if I hurt Emma. Which I\u2019m not telling her, because girls love that shit.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The blush surges until she looks sunburned.</p><p>I had no idea she had such an overactive conscience. Of course, I didn\u2019t know she was capable of what that blush entails, either. She and Graham were screwing around while I was pursuing her? Holy shit. She\u2019s staring into her lap and I\u2019m torn between amused as hell and seriously ticked off. \u201cSo you guys were messing around before you broke it off with me?\u201d</p><p>On second thought, I\u2019m not all that amused. Controlling my expression is abnormally challenging, and the aquarium-like walls are suddenly the worst idea ever.</p><p>\u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d She looks up, straight into my eyes. Still tomato-red from her hairline to the neckline of her sweater, she seems sincere, though I\u2019m probably the last person qualified to judge honesty or lack thereof in anyone. \u201cWe kissed once, before you kissed me. I mean, before you kissed me, outside of our Will and Lizbeth roles. Nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Like a slideshow through my head, I recall those photos of the two of them in Austin, running together or preparing to. And then the looks they shared that Brooke and I both noticed, and the protective way he sometimes acted around her. I all but missed that because he seemed even more so with Brooke. Now it all looks like evidence, and I\u2019m not sure I believe her.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the unavoidable question\u2014especially given the fact that you two are a thing now\u2014why did you begin a relationship with me, instead of him?\u201d</p><p>Eyes dropping to her lap, her voice is low. \u201cIt was that photo of you and me at the concert. He thought we were already involved.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cAfter that went viral, he decided not to intrude.\u201d</p><p>So he just backed off and let me have a shot at her with no competition. Interesting. \u201cHmm. That seems a little... sacrificial.\u201d</p> <p>The anticipated crease appears in her forehead. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I lean closer, staring into her eyes in the muted light, my voice restrained, but with an underlying edge I know she\u2019ll detect. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell I would have given him the same consideration, if our positions had been reversed.\u201d I watch my words sink in and then I back up a bit, reducing the physical tension just enough to convince her that I\u2019m speaking in past tense. Probably.</p><p>She clears her throat. \u201cI guess he\u2019s just not that, um, competitive.\u201d</p><p>Spoken like a true hetero-feminist\u2014the girl who says she admires guys lacking that aggressive alpha gene, while dreaming of a guy who\u2019ll push her up against a wall and kiss her breathless before telling her to shut up and hold on.</p><p>\u201cSo you and he got together\u2014when\u2014after you and I broke it off last fall?\u201d</p><p>If that\u2019s true, they were together when I voiced that groveling apology and asked for another chance. I\u2019m not sure which would be worse\u2014if I said those things with no chance at all, or if I said them when she was free and clear, but got shot down anyway.</p><p>\u201cNo. I ran into him in a coffee shop in New York when I was there a month ago, visiting colleges.\u201d She leaves out the Graham-has-a-kid part, predictably better at keeping other people\u2019s secrets than Brooke, though I suspect Brooke lets slip only what she means to disclose.</p><p>We\u2019re silent while the third course is laid out and our glasses are refilled. \u201cWould you like anything else now?\u201d the waiter asks, and we look at each other and shake our heads.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, man, we\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>I picture Emma spotting Graham in some overcrowded Manhattan coffee shop, with his kid next to him, and I itch to ask her what she thought when she found out. Like, how is that not an instant deal-breaker? What eighteen-year-old girl wants her boyfriend to have a secret kid? And how the hell did he end up saddled with it? I can\u2019t imagine my parents\u2019 reaction if they\u2019d have found out Brooke was pregnant (they didn\u2019t) and then I said Oh and by the way, I want to keep it. I\u2019d have been under psychiatric observation before I could whimper one more word.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bizarre coincidence\u2014running into someone in New York,\u201d I prompt.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSo when are you planning to move there? In the fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... maybe before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>She takes a bite of her pan-seared Alaskan halibut, as much to stall as anything else, I think. I take a bite of maitake mushroom and wait her out.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Emma</p><p>I\u2019m never sure how Reid gets me to reveal information that might not be hush-hush, but is still personal. He has this way of posing questions\u2014like he\u2019s just curious and we\u2019re old friends, no big deal, and then boom, I\u2019m blurting out stuff about Graham and our relationship. Then I catch myself and I think crap, how did that happen?</p><p>I haven\u2019t even broached the subject of moving to New York early with Graham, and I just mentioned it to Reid, who\u2019s forking bites of grilled ahi tuna while waiting for me to make another unbridled announcement about my private life. The silence stretches taut between us, and finally I glance at him. His dark blue eyes regard me closely, and his compressed lips tell me he\u2019s amused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, realizing you\u2019ve said more than you meant to.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, and laugh, and he laughs, too. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, unashamed, as always. \u201cI was raised by a master cross-examiner. Plus, I\u2019m sneaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are. I have an idea. Can we talk about you?\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cAll right. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>I prop my chin on my fist, Thinker style. \u201cHmm. Okay\u2014you said a few days ago that you and Brooke had reached an understanding.\u201d Last fall, I\u2019d have never thought the two of them could coexist in the same room for long. Now they\u2019re exchanging pleasantries and acting normal. It\u2019s freaky. \u201cWhat did you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows quirk up. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call us friends.\u201d I stare at him and he knows I\u2019m waiting for more of an answer. \u201cBut like I said, we decided to call a truce of sorts. What happened between us was a long time ago. We were kids.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not as good at this as Reid, because when he stops there, I don\u2019t know how to press him further. More than that, I\u2019m face to face with the knowledge that my true reason for prying has everything to do with Graham. He\u2019s tangled up in their history, and I\u2019ve felt left out. Until this moment, that feeling of being excluded was unconscious. As if I\u2019d have wanted to be any part of that train wreck.</p><p>\u201cWhat, no other questions, counselor?\u201d</p><p>My thoughts are full of Graham, and I fight clicking my phone to check the time. Reid did promise to have me back in time. His smirk is too superior to ignore, even if he is playing at condescension.</p><p>\u201cI do have one more critical inquiry,\u201d I say, and he leans up, all ears. Suppressing the urge to laugh, I fix a puzzled expression on my face. \u201cSo... is yellow your favorite color, or what?\u201d</p><p>He growls good-naturedly. \u201cI swear, I\u2019m getting rid of that car next week\u2014right after the premiere. I\u2019d tell you what I\u2019m considering to take its place, but you probably aren\u2019t interested in talking makes and specs. Suffice it to say, it won\u2019t be yellow.\u201d</p><p>I arch a brow. \u201cIs that a nice way of saying I wouldn\u2019t have the faintest idea what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>He laughs, turns one palm up. \u201cWell... unless you\u2019ve become a closet car aficionada in the past few months...\u201d</p><p>It took Stan, the on-set mechanic for School Pride, half a day to teach me to unlatch the hood of that car for a scene. \u201cEr, no, I wouldn\u2019t say that. But I can drive, as long as it\u2019s an automatic\u2014um\u2014motor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransmission.\u201d He\u2019s chuckling again. \u201cYeah, Emma the car enthusiast\u2014not-so-much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m moving to New York, where I won\u2019t need a car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His smile falters, but he recovers quickly. \u201cIf you object so strongly to yellow, how will you put up with taking taxis everywhere?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI was thinking I might actually learn to use the Metro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one of those normal, everyday things I\u2019ll never be able to do\u2014use public transportation,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not, especially with your I-heart-Reid-Alexander stalkers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>Crap. I forgot he wasn\u2019t aware of Jenna\u2019s term for his fans. \u201cEr, nothing. You seem to like being recognized everywhere you go, though.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIt has its benefits. And it\u2019s part of the job. Anyone who doesn\u2019t understand that going in is unrealistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But not everyone gets as famous and well-recognized as you are\u2014most actors aren\u2019t. Graham and I didn\u2019t have much of an issue, jogging in the mornings, but you couldn\u2019t even step outside the hotel without being mauled by fans.\u201d</p><p>He toys with his spoon, rotating it through his fingers, over and under. \u201cPeople love what I do, and I love doing it. Those are the most important parts of the equation. And I\u2019m rich enough to buy more seclusion, if I feel the need for privacy, so I can\u2019t really complain.\u201d He tilts his head, watching me closely. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a surge of recognition once School Pride is out. But if you don\u2019t do any more movies, it\u2019ll probably die down. Is that why you wanted out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not afraid of fame, though I\u2019d never be as comfortable with it as you are. But I do crave some normalcy. I\u2019m excited about going to college. Scared, but excited. And I love the idea of acting on a stage instead of in front of a camera. After college, I guess I\u2019ll do what everyone else does. Weigh my options and make the best choice I can at the time.\u201d</p><p>He nods his head. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>My family couldn\u2019t be less thrilled that Brooke will be attending my graduation ceremony with them, and staying over two nights. I\u2019ve already endured and ignored Cassie\u2019s and Brynn\u2019s opinions on the matter; I finally had to bite the bullet and tell Mom. Her reaction: \u201cWell, shit.\u201d</p><p>Luckily, Cara\u2019s in bed. She\u2019s at that age where she mimics everything. Brynn can\u2019t get through a conversation without at least one inappropriate word, even when she bleeps herself... which Cara has also picked up. A couple of days ago I got all sorts of looks when our line at Dean &amp; Deluca stalled and Cara demanded loudly, \u201cWhat the bleep is going on up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t exactly ask her go to commencement by herself,\u201d I say. Behind my mother\u2019s eyes the gears turn furiously, trying to figure out how to make that exact thing happen.</p> <p>Dad recognizes the distracted look on her face for what it is\u2014plotting. \u201cAudrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Pulled from her reverie (where she is no doubt personally loading Brooke on a flight to Uzbekistan or somewhere equally distant), Mom blinks innocently. Dad and I know better than to fall for her angelic expression.</p><p>\u201cAudrey, Graham\u2019s friend is coming to watch him graduate. He\u2019s invited her; we aren\u2019t going to uninvite her.\u201d</p><p>This probably isn\u2019t an ideal time to admit that Brooke invited herself.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we at least put her up in a nice hotel, where she\u2019ll be more comfortable?\u201d Mom\u2019s voice is sugary with a veiled edge of for-the-love-of-God-please.</p><p>Brooke was a demanding guest two years ago\u2014questioning the thread count of the guest bed sheets, asking where we kept the new toothbrushes and razors for visitors, and even putting in an order for a specific brand of bottled water. Mom spent the duration of Brooke\u2019s visit seething, and she hasn\u2019t forgiven or forgotten.</p><p>\u201cBetween Columbia and NYU commencement ceremonies, the hotels are all booked and have been for months.\u201d Dad\u2019s voice of reason falls on deaf ears.</p><p>\u201cShe could stay nearby. In Jersey, say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom!\u201d Torn between amusement and exasperation, I\u2019m not sure what to add to the exclamation.</p><p>Dad sighs. \u201cShe\u2019s staying here, Audrey. We\u2019d better get the guest room set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd alert the servants,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cOh wait. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>I slide an arm around her shoulders as she rinses dishes and I prepare to load the dishwasher. \u201cMom, Brooke has matured over the past two years. I doubt you\u2019ll have the same issues you had with her as before.\u201d I should be crossing my fingers behind my back.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be holding my breath, Graham.\u201d</p><p>Emma is a few minutes late signing in, and I assure her it\u2019s no big deal, even though she was out to dinner with Reid. In San Francisco. One of the most romantic cities in the US. When she can\u2019t help but gush about the renovated 1920s building, the glass jellyfish chandeliers and the amazing food, I listen patiently. Thank God for the fuzziness of webcam technology, which allows my tight smile to feign rapt appreciation.</p><p>I\u2019ve never in my life had this kind of issue with jealousy. Watching Zoe with other guys after we broke up (and a few heavy flirtations before we broke up, because I think she liked to keep me off balance) was frustrating and unpleasant, but that was nothing compared to this slow, deep burn. Even what I felt during filming last fall, when I watched Reid with Emma, wasn\u2019t like this. I feel like I\u2019ve swallowed a meteor.</p><p>I can\u2019t talk to Mom, or Brynn, or Cassie about it.</p><p>Possessiveness is nothing more than insecurity, Mom would say.</p><p>That macho protective bullshit is just some asshat man pissing on his territory so the other dogs will stay away, Brynn would say.</p><p>Graham, you aren\u2019t that chauvinistic type of guy. You\u2019re better than that, Cassie would say.</p><p>They\u2019re all right... and they\u2019re all wrong. In this moment, if I could physically keep Reid away from Emma, I would do it. And if that makes me that type of guy, I don\u2019t give a goddamn.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you had a perfect night,\u201d I tell Emma. Tightly.</p><p>She shakes her head, giving me that subtle smile of hers\u2014her mouth turned up on one side like she\u2019s trying to contain it, while it steals out on one side. \u201cIf it had been perfect, you\u2019d have been there with me,\u201d she says, and the meteor in my gut melts to a more manageable size.</p><p>When I mention Brooke arriving in New York tomorrow, I do so unmindful that I hadn\u2019t told Emma where she would be staying. \u201cI\u2019ve warned her that I\u2019ll be holed up in my room with you by nine p.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s staying with you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, I forgot to tell her. \u201cWith my family, yes.\u201d As though that makes it better. \u201cThe hotels are always booked during the week of NYU and Columbia commencements.\u201d I never intended to send Brooke to a hotel, but I\u2019m keeping that to myself. \u201cAnd several smaller colleges have their ceremonies the same week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I wish there was some way to assure her that Brooke is no threat to her. I hate seeing that look on her face, the uncertainty that I know all too well. I was going to tell her that Brooke said, TMI on the cybersex details! when I told her about our nightly Skype ritual, but suddenly that isn\u2019t so funny, and I\u2019m scrambling for something to say.</p><p>\u201cSo Ellen on Thursday, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her voice is strained. Damn this distance. If I could kiss her she\u2019d know exactly how I feel about her.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Emma.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure, but it looks like her eyes tear up. \u201cI was fine for months without you,\u201d she says, the words hushed and forlorn. \u201cWhy does it hurt now?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sighing and shoving a hand through my hair, which I know from experience leaves strands of it stabbing out in numerous directions, defiant and crazy-looking. Maybe crazy is exactly how I feel. \u201cBecause now we have hope of something more.\u201d</p><p>She takes a shaky breath and sighs. I\u2019ve said the right words, for now.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Brooke</p><p>I remembered to pack a toothbrush and a razor this time. I thought Graham\u2019s mother would blow a gasket the last time I visited, when I asked if they had those things. I admit I was being a bitch, because I\u2019m used to mothers hating me. Or at least not trusting me to leave their baby boys uncorrupted. I couldn\u2019t stand another failed attempt at being sweet, only to be treated like an STD-carrying skank. So I just bitched up right off the bat.</p><p>Probably not the smartest move on my part, given that now I have to backtrack and make her like me, when I\u2019ve already shot myself in the foot.</p><p>Dr. Douglas is a licensed therapist as well as a professor of psychology. She analyzed me the whole time I was there two years ago\u2014I could tell. I don\u2019t want to know her conclusions. I just have to make her believe they\u2019re no longer valid. No big deal, right? As my plane touches down at La Guardia, I\u2019m trying to forget how her eyes looked like they might shoot lava when I questioned the thread count of the guest bed sheets.</p><p>Kathryn, my father\u2019s first wife, taught me this saying: When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve never been good at following that bit of common sense. I blame that on my parental role model\u2014my mother\u2014who\u2019s never met a hole that can\u2019t be just a little deeper.</p><p>When I first arrived in LA, not only was I all knees and elbows awkward, but I had that vile drawl. It marked me wherever I went, and there was nothing I could do about it short of keeping mute. If I walked into an upscale boutique with Mom, the salesgirls were courteous and attentive until one of us opened our mouths, and then the sidelong glances would start. I knew what they were thinking. Hicks. There was no way to combat their prejudice.</p><p>Just before Mom and Rick got married, he took us out to dinner. Trying to butter me up to get on her good side. He didn\u2019t know that she couldn\u2019t have cared less if I was happy with her matrimonial choices. We went to a trendy place that served burgers for fifteen bucks and boasted hundreds of domestic and imported beers from all over the world. The beer was the attraction\u2014if some remote brewery made it, they had it. That sort of thing.</p><p>Rick (who thought Mom sounded like Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2014like that\u2019s a compliment?) got up mid-meal to fetch a side of pickles for Mom and get himself another imported beer. When he was a dozen or so feet away, my mother called to him. She was just loud enough for our entire half of the restaurant to hear her: \u201cHey, Rick, git me another Currs Light!\u201d</p><p>There was a long beat of silence, because the request for a cheap domestic beer in her trailer park twang paused all conversation. And then laughter erupted. My face flamed. I wanted to dive under the booth rather than sit across from my uncouth hillbilly of a mother. I was positive that this was the Most Embarrassing Moment of my life.</p><p>But Mom wasn\u2019t finished digging her hole, with me right there, praying for invisibility. As she glanced around at all the pretentious, sniggering patrons, her face twisted into a haughty demeanor. \u201cWell, fuck all y\u2019all!\u201d she declared. The wave of laughter crashed over me, and invisibility wasn\u2019t good enough. I think I prayed for death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few months later, my new manager strongly suggested speech therapy to rid me of my accent. I jumped at the chance. The most puzzling thing was Reid\u2019s objection. \u201cI like the way you talk,\u201d he said, running his fingers through my hair as I lay with my head on his lap while we watched a movie. \u201cIt\u2019s different. It\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPshh! No it\u2019s not. I sound like a redneck with a fifth grade education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I sound like, so it\u2019s what everyone thinks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho gives a shit what everyone thinks?\u201d he said. I see now that this has long been some sort of mantra for him. I\u2019ve never been that free. I want to be, and sometimes I pretend to be, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m forever chained to giving a shit about what someone thinks.</p><p>\u201cIs she your girlfriend now?\u201d Cara\u2019s idea of whispering is anything but.</p><p>I\u2019ve made it a habit to avoid my younger half-siblings when possible\u2014all too simple, living in another state, especially after passing the age of mandatory visitation. So I don\u2019t spend much time in the company of small children. I\u2019m not used to the way a kid Cara\u2019s age just blurts out indelicate questions. In the middle of dinner, no less.</p><p>Every eye at the table shifts to Graham, who chuckles at his daughter. \u201cNo, Brooke is a really good friend\u2014like Daniel or Rob.\u201d These two are classmates of Graham\u2019s. We\u2019re going to a party tomorrow night that one of them is hosting. I\u2019m not so sure I want to be grouped with a couple of guys in Graham\u2019s head. Talk about the friend zone.</p><p>Audible exhalations of relief come from his mother and his sister, Brynn, who came over for dinner tonight because she can\u2019t take off work for the ceremony tomorrow morning. I plaster a rigid smile on my face at their oh-thank-God sighs. What the hell.</p> <p>The kid taps her fork against her plate, her head angled like a puppy hearing an unfamiliar noise. \u201cSo Emma is your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Graham sighs. \u201cCara, it\u2019s time for dinner, not twenty questions.\u201d</p><p>She gives him a cheeky look. \u201cThat was two questions, Daddy. Two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, just because you ask a question\u2014or two\u2014doesn\u2019t mean you get an answer.\u201d He winks at her and she rolls her eyes like she\u2019s heard that before and digs into her lasagna. Then Graham turns to his family and says, \u201cBrooke is going to be filming a romantic comedy here in New York, starting\u2014when is it, Brooke, mid-August?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019s letting his family know I\u2019ll be around in the future. This is good. I\u2019m closer to being able to tell him that I\u2019ve sublet an apartment with a lease running from the beginning of August through December.</p><p>\u201cAre they still talking to Efron about the male lead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I think he\u2019s had some other contract he can\u2019t get out of. I\u2019m not sure who they\u2019re considering now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Brooke,\u201d his father says as his mother and Brynn mumble vague acknowledgements.</p><p>On the outside, I thank them graciously and smile obliviously, like the vacant little bimbo they seem to think I am\u2014totally unaware of their disdain.</p><p>On the inside, I\u2019m snarling fuck all y\u2019all.</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>Cara gets a case of the giggles when she sees me in my graduation garb, and I haven\u2019t even donned the cap yet. I shake my head as she collapses onto the bottom stair, sliding into a prone position and laughing like she does when Brynn tickles her. Finally, she pauses long enough to tell me that I look like Cinderella, before she dissolves into another round of unreserved laughter.</p><p>\u201cShe has a point, Graham,\u201d Cassie says, juggling Caleb. \u201cYou are rockin\u2019 the baby blue satin in that commencement dress.\u201d</p><p>Cara slaps the wooden step with her small hand, howling with laughter. I\u2019m afraid to put on the cap and tassel in front of her, because she might lose the ability to breathe. Mom insists, though, because the ceremony is outdoors and unless she pins it beforehand, one gust of wind could send it flying. Once the cap is affixed to my head, Cara is beside herself for another five minutes, and I wonder how she\u2019ll react when confronted with several thousand graduates in light blue caps and dresses.</p> <p>Brooke\u2019s eyes are sparkling, and for a split second I realize how rare it is to see them free of her guarded cynicism. She seems like she\u2019d be the last person on earth to censor herself, when in actuality, that\u2019s all she does.</p><p>A few hours and a long, strangely exhilarating ceremony later, I text Emma to tell her I\u2019m an official college graduate. We arrange an early Skype time because of the graduation party tonight and her flight from Sacramento to Burbank tomorrow morning. Neither of us mentions the fact that Brooke will be tagging along to the party, meeting my school friends and possibly inciting more photos and stories for the rumor mill.</p><p>\u201cSo... do I look smarter as a college grad? Or at least hotter?\u201d I smooth my hands over the light blue Columbia t-shirt before shrugging into a plaid shirt, leaving it open over the t-shirt and dropping into the desk chair. I angle the monitor so that Emma\u2019s face is clear.</p><p>She laughs and looks me over. \u201cDefinitely both. I like the baby blue on you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you in that color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do tend to prefer black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should meet Emily. Black is ninety percent of her wardrobe.\u201d She gnaws her lip for a moment. She\u2019s been a bit pensive the past few of days when we talk, and I find myself wishing I knew her better, so I\u2019d know if she\u2019s worried or upset, or if she\u2019s just got something on her mind.</p><p>\u201cI definitely need to meet Emily,\u201d I say. Wanting me to meet the childhood friend, the best friend, the like-a-sister friend is the equivalent of me taking her to meet Cassie. \u201cMaybe after the premiere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>We both stop. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d I urge, hoping she\u2019ll tell me. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>She sighs and looks down, probably picking at her fingernails\u2014something she does when she\u2019s nervous. \u201cI was thinking I could... maybe...\u201d She sighs, and I wait.</p><p>Out with it, Emma. Just tell me.</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel if I move to New York early? Like, before the end of summer?\u201d</p><p>My answer comes in a rush, uncontainable. \u201cI would love that.\u201d I try to remain calm, as though we\u2019re discussing some mundane order of business. \u201cHow early are we talking about?\u201d I\u2019m envisioning her here, in my city, in all the places that\u2014five minutes ago\u2014were just familiar landmarks of my life.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe next month? I don\u2019t know how long it would take to find an apartment...\u201d</p><p>I almost tell her I can start looking tomorrow. Tonight. Screw the party.</p><p>But then I recall scraps of our conversations about her desire to do the normal-girl thing, and I wonder if getting an apartment has too much to do with me. I don\u2019t want her to give up a single thing she wants or needs, because she\u2019s had to do that for far too long. I swallow my selfish excitement and say, \u201cI thought you were determined to live the whole dorm experience?\u201d</p><p>A slight crease mars her forehead. \u201cSince NYU doesn\u2019t really have a campus, the dorms are all over Manhattan anyway. I thought having my own apartment would be more private...\u201d This is because of me. Because of us. \u201cYou don\u2019t agree?\u201d</p><p>My inner Graham is roaring just say \u2018yes, I agree,\u2019 you dumbass, but I shove what I want aside. What I want doesn\u2019t matter. This is her college experience. She\u2019ll only do it once, and then it will be over. Having graduated today, I know this. Cara was born two months before I began college, so I never even considered leaving home. I was lucky that home was New York City, and my academic record got me into the Ivy League school I wanted to attend.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Emma.\u201d I force a contemplative expression onto my face. \u201cYou should definitely think this over. Even if the dorms aren\u2019t clustered on a traditional campus, there are all-night study sessions, pillow fights in the hall, roommate quarrels, someone sneaking in a keg for a floor party... essential components of the full college experience.\u201d I smile, but her eyes are downcast again and she doesn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a tap at my door and when I look up, Brooke is standing in the doorway holding two tops on hangers. I could have sworn I\u2019d closed the door all the way, but I must have left it ajar.</p><p>\u201cHey, I need your assistance in choosing what you want me to wear tonight.\u201d She glances at the screen in front of me. \u201cOh, Emma! Oh shit, I\u2019m totally interrupting\u2014so sorry!\u201d Emma blinks, looking at Brooke, who is no doubt appearing behind me now on her screen. \u201cYou might as well give me your opinion, since you\u2019re almost like right here. What do you think\u2014this one?\u201d She holds up short-sleeved, dark purple, cleavage-baring cashmere sweater. \u201cOr this?\u201d She switches to a silky baby blue top that matches her eyes and the t-shirt I\u2019m wearing.</p><p>Emma clears her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s a Columbia graduation party, so the blue, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re so right!\u201d She turns to me, her fingers grazing my chest. \u201cAnd it coordinates with what you\u2019re wearing, Graham.\u201d The sparkle in her eyes from earlier today gone. Her shields are back up. She couldn\u2019t have known I\u2019d be Skyping with Emma now, or I\u2019d think she planned this interruption.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready in like, half an hour.\u201d She turns to go and I see that she\u2019s wearing a tiny bathrobe that just barely covers her butt.</p><p>I turn back to Emma, whose eyes are on Brooke\u2019s retreating, scarcely-clad backside. \u201cI\u2019m getting ready to go out with Emily, so I should probably get ready, too,\u201d she says.</p><p>We\u2019d planned to talk for another half an hour, until it was time for me to leave. She\u2019s clearly upset, and Brooke\u2019s untimely appearance in my bedroom wearing a skimpy robe has to be the reason. I clench my jaw. Tomorrow, Brooke will be back in LA, and Emma will return home from her last interaction with Reid for the week. Everything will work itself out.</p><p>\u201cHave fun with Emily,\u201d I offer, and she nods.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy the party. Talk to you tomorrow.\u201d Her smile appears forced, and before I can say a proper goodbye, she signs off.</p><p>\u201cSo you guys are a couple, huh?\u201d Daniel hands me a beer and clinks his bottle to mine. Half the eyes in the room follow Brooke as she winds through the crowd on her way to the bathroom.</p><p>I glance in her direction and back at him. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He arches a brow. \u201cDude. Have you told her that?\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be awkward. \u201cUnnecessary. We\u2019ve been good friends for several years. It\u2019s never been like that.\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s roommate confers with him about a beer run while I think about Emma, wishing she was here with me instead of Brooke. That line of thinking leaves me feeling guilty. Brooke is taking time from her life to be supportive to me, and I should be more appreciative. I watch the mouth of the hallway where she disappeared. She\u2019s had a couple of beers, but she seems fine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she reappears, several girls stop her, and within seconds she\u2019s wearing her genial talking-to-fans face.</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d Daniel is staring again, not that I blame him. Brooke is a beautiful girl. Her eyes find me then, and she smiles an apology before turning back to her fans. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he adds. Brooke hasn\u2019t left my side for long all evening, which I attribute to the fact that she knows no one else here.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, because Daniel\u2019s not really listening. He\u2019s wearing the same bewitched expression I\u2019ve seen on guys a hundred times. Some she\u2019ll play with, some she won\u2019t, but none of them have ever mattered to her for long.</p><p>I try, unsuccessfully, to suppress a smirk as Daniel separates from me and meanders closer. He\u2019s a good guy, but not for her. Brooke needs someone larger than life. Larger than her life, certainly. She needs a guy who can see through that spellbinding fa\u00e7ade of hers, see her for what she is, and accept it.</p> <p>Chapter 26</p><p>Brooke</p><p>Graham has kept tabs on me all night, but whenever some guy hits on me and I send him a telepathic oh brother look, he seems amused. Amusement is not my preferred reaction\u2014not since watching him nearly lose his shit while observing the photo shoot with Reid and Emma. That\u2019s the reaction I want.</p><p>When his friend Daniel joins the girls who recognized me from Life\u2019s a Beach, I welcome the interruption. I\u2019ve spent ten minutes listening to the three of them discuss my alter ego, Kristen Wells, like she\u2019s a real person, going so far as to apologize to me when one of them refers to her as a bitch. People always think Kristen was a bitch\u2014because she was scheming, manipulative, and willing to do whatever it took to get the guy or the job she wanted. So yeah, a bit like me.</p><p>I\u2019d love to say, \u201cYou do realize she\u2019s a fictional character, right? I\u2019m not actually her.\u201d But no. My career is comprised of striving to bring fictional characters to life, so I shrug and laugh it off.</p> <p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Graham\u2019s friend, Daniel.\u201d Charming and confident, he sticks his hand out. \u201cAnd you must be Graham\u2019s friend, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>I give him my hand with a smile. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>His hazel eyes are glued to mine, which tells me he\u2019s already taken the time to examine me head to toe before coming over. His strawberry blond hair is perfectly style bed-head, and when he leans closer I catch the masculine scent of his cologne.</p><p>\u201cWell, Brooke, you look like you could use another beer.\u201d</p><p>My five-second assessment: this boy has spent four years tearing through girls like finish line ribbons.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, rude. We\u2019re talking to her!\u201d One of the girls punches him in the arm, lightly. She gazes up at him, far more earnestly than she should. She would give anything for him to look at her like he\u2019s looking at me.</p> <p>Aww, honey. It\u2019s not going to happen. Guys don\u2019t suddenly wake up one day and get interested in girls they\u2019ve never noticed before. Unless you\u2019re watching a sitcom or a movie of the week.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Daniel, do you even know who this is?\u201d one of the others huffs. \u201cThis is Brooke Cameron. She was Kristen on Life\u2019s a Beach. You probably don\u2019t even know what that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. She made me jealous of every drowning victim on that show.\u201d</p><p>Game point to Daniel. Almost.</p><p>\u201cIncluding the ones Xavier gave mouth-to-mouth to?\u201d I ask, arching a brow. (Xavier: my gorgeous costar, who, sadly, proved to me that the large hands correlation doesn\u2019t necessarily hold true.)</p><p>Daniel mirrors my smartass grin. \u201cNo. As hot as Xavier was, his mouth-to-mouth technique was lacking in some crucial way I can\u2019t quite put my finger on.\u201d His eyes flick to my mouth and back. \u201cLet\u2019s get you that beer.\u201d Taking my hand, he heads for the kitchen. I glance across the room where Graham stands surrounded by a fresh group of friends. He\u2019s watching. I roll my eyes, and he smiles and rolls his in response. Not a hint of jealousy crosses his face.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>When the taxi drops Graham and me at his front door, it\u2019s almost 3:00 a.m. Inside, Cara\u2019s cat is the only one awake, and it begins meowing like a small siren the minute we get the door open. \u201cNoodles, shhh!\u201d Graham says, which it ignores. To shut it up and stop it from winding around his legs, Graham gives it a snack before we tiptoe up the stairs.</p> <p>I pull him into the guest room with me. \u201cI\u2019m totally wired. Come sit and talk.\u201d</p><p>He kicks off his shoes and collapses on the bed, leaning back on the pillows. I slip out of my heels, remove my earrings and slide the bracelets off of my arms.</p><p>\u201cSo. Daniel?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cTotal player.\u201d Lifting and dropping one shoulder, I dismiss any thought of Daniel.</p><p>Graham chuckles. \u201cYeah. But I thought you liked that, sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I turn towards at him. \u201cI\u2019m growing out of that phase.\u201d When I start unbuttoning my blouse, he cuts his eyes away.</p><p>\u201cI should go to bed, I guess.\u201d He starts off the bed.</p><p>This is not a problem I would have had with Daniel.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay. I\u2019m just taking this uncomfortable stuff off. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Okay.\u201d He shuts his eyes, leans his head back again and folds his hands over his perfectly flat abdomen.</p><p>I remove the shirt, unhurried and facing him, slipping buttons out of buttonholes as though he\u2019s watching me like I wish he was. Willing him to open his eyes, I let the silky fabric whisper over my shoulders, leaving them bare, and drop the shirt to the floor. A moment later, the ice blue bra follows. Standing a scant ten feet from him, I\u2019m wearing nothing but a miniskirt. There\u2019s no response, no movement, nothing. Obviously, he\u2019s not even peeking.</p><p>I strip all the way down, cloth rustling as I shimmy out of the skirt. Deliberating, I\u2019m immobile. And then, inexplicably, I\u2019m not sure enough of what his reaction will be if he opens his eyes. Shit. I\u2019m never apprehensive about this. Seduction is a strategic maneuver at which I excel. Except with Graham.</p><p>I pull a nighty short set out of my suitcase and put it on. \u201cAll clear,\u201d I say, but he doesn\u2019t stir. Stepping closer, I see that he\u2019s fallen asleep. As carefully as I can, I curl up next to him. His arm curves around me, but he doesn\u2019t wake.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he breathes. Fantastic. He thinks I\u2019m her. And I\u2019m just pathetic enough to lie here and accept that.</p><p>For the first time in the past month, it occurs to me that I may not succeed. Once the premiere is over, the need for a pretend romance between Reid and Emma will go away. Nothing will stand in the way of Graham and Emma establishing a relationship that threatens everything I want. I\u2019ve known Graham for four freaking years. He belongs to me\u2014and I don\u2019t give a shit how that sounds. I can\u2019t lose him now, and I\u2019ll do whatever I have to do to make sure I don\u2019t.</p><p>The light from the corner streetlamp just outside is bright, blocked by the dark blinds except for tiny pinstripes that lay across our bodies. I trace them with my fingers, coming to the end of me, tracing onto Graham. Up. Over. Back again. And then I slither to the end of the bed and find my bag in the dark, digging through it for my phone. After angling the blinds so that they cast wider bands of light on the bed and across Graham, I climb back in beside him and lay my head on his shoulder, our faces turned slightly towards each other.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he murmurs, his arms pulling me closer. Before I can change my mind, I click the phone to camera mode. I have to take three pictures to get one that\u2019s clear enough. It\u2019s fuzzy, but it will do.</p><p>Me: DON\u2019T transfer this to her, just show her, then delete it. That way she has no evidence.</p><p>Reid: Finally bagged him, did ya?</p><p>Me: I told you it\u2019s not about that.</p><p>Reid: Yet you didn\u2019t send me a photo of you two immersed in conversation</p><p>Me: Shut up.</p><p>REID</p><p>Thursdays are long for the crew at Ellen because they tape Friday\u2019s and Monday\u2019s shows that day. Emma and I are lucky, because we\u2019re on Friday\u2019s show, so we go first and get the host and the audience fresh.</p><p>Waiting backstage, we have some time before our segment. Emma is sipping chai tea and attempting every stress-relieving, deep-breathing technique she can think of. She\u2019s in the middle of some sort of yoga pose, eyes closed, and I\u2019m considering whether showing her the photo now would freak her out too much. But I\u2019m probably not going to see her again until next week\u2014the day of the premiere.</p><p>With a final, slow inhale/exhale, she opens her eyes, unfolds her leg and lowers her arms. Her cheeks glow pink when she realizes I\u2019ve been watching her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head slowly. \u201cI\u2019m just weighing whether or not to show you something that might upset you.\u201d</p><p>She glances at the phone in my hand. \u201cAn unflattering paparazzi photo or another baby bump watch? Uh, no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, no. I don\u2019t think this one will make it to the tabloids.\u201d Now that I think of it, I\u2019m not sure about that. I wouldn\u2019t put it past Brooke to leak it to the tabloids, if she was so inclined.</p><p>Emma\u2019s features fall and she sighs. \u201cLet me see.\u201d She sits next to me on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cBrooke is probably just trying to yank my chain. This kind of thing goes back a long way between us.\u201d There. That\u2019s as much softening of the blow as I can do. Some circumstances can\u2019t ever be made soft. Like: Your boyfriend is hooking up with someone else.</p><p>I pull up the picture, full screen, and hand it to her. She sucks in a breath, her opposite hand pressed to the center of her chest. \u201cWhen? When was that taken?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s asking, but she knows. I see it in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLast night, I guess.\u201d I take the phone back, glance at the photo again, hit delete.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry\u2014too late. I don\u2019t want to keep that crap on my phone. Seriously, I\u2019m sure she staged that for my benefit. Brooke has a warped sense of humor. Maybe it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>She slumps next to me, wearing that Lost Girl look, not buying my attempt at tempering the shock of seeing a close-up of her boyfriend sleeping with Brooke\u2019s head on his shoulder. I turn the phone off and stow it in my pocket, take her hand. \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have shown you.\u201d</p><p>She stares at her hand, intertwined with mine, but makes no move to withdraw it. When her eyes meet mine, I squeeze her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it right now. Brooke is all about these little games. I should know. I\u2019ve known her even longer than he has.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a rap at the door before it cracks open. \u201cYou guys are on in five,\u201d says a guy with a headset. His eyes immediately fall to our close positions and clasped hands. He smiles and pops back out, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Emma is slightly distracted during the taping, giving an impression of shyness. She\u2019s too professional to let anything personal throw her completely off. She does, however, allow me to be more suggestive of a hidden relationship when it comes to the inevitable questions about our possible involvement. Where for months we\u2019ve only smiled and denied, today I\u2019m giving silly but full-of-insinuation answers, and she\u2019s laughing bashfully. The audience loves it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before we go our separate ways, we have a moment alone offstage. Now that the cameras are off of her, she\u2019s unfocused and preoccupied. \u201cEmma.\u201d Tipping her chin up, I lean quickly and kiss her, just a whisper of my lips on hers, and pretend not to notice that she\u2019s already withdrawing when I pull away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next week.\u201d</p><p>Premiere night, I\u2019ll likely have Emma where I want her\u2014where I\u2019ve wanted her since I first laid eyes on her. But I can\u2019t assume she\u2019ll come to me when she breaks it off with Graham. She\u2019s just self-sufficient enough to slam the door on us both\u2014she proved that well enough last fall. On the other hand, she\u2019ll be more receptive if for no other reason than to thumb her nose at Graham over what he\u2019s doing with Brooke.</p><p>Am I okay with being exploited like that and then tossed aside?</p><p>Hell. Yeah.</p> <p>Chapter 27</p><p>Emma</p><p>When Reid showed me that image of Graham and Brooke, everything came to a stop. I asked him when, when, but I knew, because Graham was wearing the Columbia t-shirt and the unbuttoned plaid shirt he had on when we Skyped last night. Right before the party.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe. I couldn\u2019t think. My life didn\u2019t feel real.</p><p>Perfect time to appear on a hugely popular Emmy-winning talk show for the first time, huh? Reid was charming and flirty with me, with her, with the audience\u2014and they ate it up. When Ellen suggested we use her show to clear up any rumors floating around, he grabbed my hand and kissed it (the audience screamed, \u201cWoooo!\u201d while my face overheated).</p> <p>And then he looked at me and said, \u201cWe might as well come clean.\u201d I wondered what we were coming clean about and the whole audience shifted forward in anticipation. He assumed a very serious look. \u201cEmma\u2019s pregnant with triplets.\u201d The audience gasped. My mouth gaped. I don\u2019t know what Ellen did, because I was staring at Reid and thinking that maybe I had just dreamed this entire day, and there was no photo of Graham sleeping next to Brooke. For one heartbeat I was so relieved.</p><p>And then Reid said, \u201cAfter the premiere next week, we\u2019re getting married in a hot air balloon, and then we\u2019ll honeymoon on our private island until the babies come. Oh, and we\u2019ve decided to name all of them Reid, with numbers for middle names. But in French\u2014un, deux, trois\u2014so it\u2019ll be classy.\u201d Everyone laughed. Ha, ha, so funny.</p><p>We showed clips of School Pride and discussed the Jane Austen novel that inspired it. I smiled tightly and kept my opinion on the script\u2019s inane dialogue to myself for the hundredth time. Reid plugged the movie he\u2019ll be filming next fall in Vancouver, I talked about my college plans, and then it was over and Reid and I were backstage. He kissed me goodbye, sort of, but I didn\u2019t really respond, and I couldn\u2019t feel it. I don\u2019t think I realized until that moment that I\u2019d spent the whole hour and a half taping numb.</p><p>I was supposed to text Graham after the show, before my flight. I didn\u2019t. Just before I powered it down, my phone buzzed with a new text. I didn\u2019t look at the message.</p><p>Now I\u2019m in the air between Burbank and Sacramento, and the anger has made a tornado of the rest of my emotions, tossing and twisting them until all I can feel is the destructive point where the indignation touches the landscape. I haven\u2019t felt this angry since I confronted my dad about wanting to make my own decisions. Does that mean I should confront Graham now? Just because I\u2019ve learned to stand up for myself doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s appropriate in every situation. Or easy. I stare out the window and consider possible scenarios of truth-telling.</p><p>Emily and Derek pick me up when I land. Her hair is newly hot pink and pixie-cut. \u201cLike it?\u201d she asks, and I tell her I love it.</p> <p>Derek is Abercrombie-boy gorgeous from the top of his head to just above his ankles\u2014he\u2019s wearing high-top Chucks in the same shade of neon fuchsia as Em\u2019s hair. I point at the shoes and smile. He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m a supportive guy.\u201d</p><p>In the Jeep, I power up my phone and read the messages\u2014all from Graham. He goes from asking if I was at the airport yet to wondering why I wasn\u2019t calling. He left one voicemail: \u201cEmma, I know you\u2019re upset over Brooke staying at my house the past two days. She\u2019s gone, and I\u2019ve already told her she can\u2019t stay here again. Please call me when you land... Okay. Talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>I message Dad to tell him I\u2019ve landed and I\u2019m on my way to Emily\u2019s. Tomorrow is Senior Skip Day, so I\u2019m staying over at her place. When the phone rings, my heart stops, but the photo smiling up from the display is my agent.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was Ellen? So exciting!\u201d Dan has a habit of answering his own questions.</p><p>\u201cIt was awesome. Reid told everyone we were having triplets and getting married next week. I think there was something about a balloon. Anyway. It went well.\u201d</p><p>Emily twists in her seat, staring back at me open-mouthed, and Dan is either speechless or we\u2019ve been cut off.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmma, there\u2019s no need to be snarky. I\u2019m still trying to manage what\u2019s left of your film career, in case you ever want to come back... You haven\u2019t changed your mind, by any chance? Because I got a call today from Paramount\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m still going to college. And I wasn\u2019t being snarky\u2014Reid actually said that stuff.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for two seconds. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but I think I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not that boy\u2019s agent.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, and the phone beeps in my ear. Graham. \u201cUm, I\u2019ve got another call. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow after Ellen airs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. Talk tomorrow. Ciao!\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath before hitting talk. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma. Are you okay? Why didn\u2019t you call?\u201d His voice is guarded.</p><p>I tell myself that confrontation is good when it means standing up for what I need. When it means getting everything out in the open. \u201cIs there something you want to tell me?\u201d Crap. Vague, Emma. So much for confrontation.</p><p>He\u2019s quiet. \u201cEmma, just tell me what you want to know. I\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m not good with games or ambiguous questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game, Graham.\u201d Emily and Derek exchange a look in the front seat. I swear I can feel the adrenaline shooting through my bloodstream. Heart hammering, hands shaking. \u201cI saw a photo of her and you. In bed.\u201d</p><p>Emily turns all the way around in her seat, her eyes shooting flames. Derek lays a hand on her leg and they have a fierce, low-level conversation. I think he\u2019s telling her to stay out of it and she\u2019s telling him where to stick that recommendation.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Graham says, but I don\u2019t answer or elaborate. He\u2019s cursing, but not at me\u2014he\u2019s holding the receiver away from his mouth. \u201cWhere did you see this photo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Reid\u2019s phone.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. \u201cOn Reid\u2019s phone,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe deleted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell isn\u2019t that convenient.\u201d When I don\u2019t reply, he sighs. \u201cEmma, this wasn\u2019t something I wanted to talk about over the phone.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I hang up. I can\u2019t do this. Waiting for the phone to power down, I bite my lip and fight useless tears. Emily reaches back with her left hand, which I take and hold in a cemented grip all the way to her house.</p><p>Emily and Derek try their best to take my mind off of my disastrous love life, but my brain has a sort of three-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out mentality about the whole thing, and Graham is strike three.</p><p>With Reid, I was too mesmerized by his super-celebrity to embark on any equal sort of relationship\u2014if he even wanted a relationship. Reid Alexander was that guy on the magazine covers and movie posters. The guy with pages and pages of images on the web.</p><p>Marcus was a rebound, pure and simple. An attempt at something \u201cnormal.\u201d I thought he was someone I could be friends with first. A theatre person, like me. The only thing good about that relationship was that I wasn\u2019t all that into him, so he was easy to get over.</p><p>Graham is simply threaded through everything. I trusted him. I still want to.</p><p>After pizza and mini-golf, Derek drops us off at Em\u2019s house. I go inside and help Mrs. Watson make cookies while Em and Derek say goodbye for half an hour in the Jeep until her dad flicks the driveway lights on and off a couple dozen times.</p><p>She breezes in a few minutes later. \u201cThanks, Dad\u2014we felt like we were at a rave! I\u2019m getting glow sticks for next weekend.\u201d</p><p>He growls and stomps upstairs.</p><p>Emily and I watch our favorite movie, The Philadelphia Story, which is always good for short-term distraction because Kathryn Hepburn and Cary Grant can take my mind off of anything, even if we\u2019ve seen it fifty times. Emily is vehemently Team Jimmy Stewart, so we have a long history of good-natured arguments during and after.</p><p>Tonight, I decide that what Tracy Lord (Hepburn) really needed was some time alone.</p><p>\u201cNot a traditionally admired concept in romantic comedies, or, let\u2019s face it, in real life,\u201d Em says, gesturing with a Twizzler.</p><p>\u201cTrue that,\u201d I answer in the voice of Em\u2019s dad, who attempts to relate to his kids by picking up their lingo. The fact that he\u2019s always five years behind the curve (and that he uses the word lingo) pretty much ruins the effect. We bump fists before dissolving into muffled laughter.</p><p>After the movie is over, we lie in the dark as we have hundreds of times before. \u201cWhy did you hang up on him, if he was about to tell you the truth about her?\u201d Between us, Emily links her hand with mine.</p><p>\u201cI guess I just wasn\u2019t ready to hear him confess it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re expecting a confession.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and look at her. \u201cWhat else follows those words? I didn\u2019t want to talk about this on the phone.\u201d My voice breaks.</p><p>Hector jumps on the bed then, walking over our clasped hands and flopping between our shoulders, purring and kneading my bicep with his cotton-ball paws.</p><p>\u201cAnd Wednesday, when I talked to him about moving to New York early and getting an apartment? He didn\u2019t seem to think that was a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I hear the frown in her voice. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said something about me having a normal college experience... and then Brooke walked into his room wearing a bathrobe sized for a small child, wanting help picking which sex-kitten top to wear to the party they were going to together!\u201d I bite my lip. I\u2019m pissed. I will not cry. \u201cIt all looks connected now. And I feel like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Emily raises herself on her elbow so I can see her face over Hector\u2019s mound of white fur. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to feel like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there is.\u201d I\u2019m not going to start bawling, but that doesn\u2019t keep tears from trickling out. They seep into my hair as I stare up into her concerned eyes. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot because I still want to trust him. My instincts are all screaming at me to trust him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emily purses her lips and lies back down, still holding my hand like we\u2019ve been doing since we were five. \u201cWow. That sucks ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>Yesterday morning, I woke up in bed with Brooke. Dressed and on top of the covers, but still. Not exactly the sort of thing I\u2019d want my mother, my daughter or my girlfriend to walk in on, no matter how innocuous it was.</p> <p>She woke when I was starting to move out from under her leg (imprisoning my thigh) and her hand (on my chest, gripping my t-shirt). Smiling up at me, she said, \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>I froze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess I was pretty wiped last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. It\u2019s no problem. I liked sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>What the hell could I say to that?</p><p>And then she shifted up and kissed my jaw. I was fully awake by the second kiss, which landed just under my ear. She made a disappointed noise when I sat up, while I scrambled for something to say. Sitting up behind me, she pressed her chest to my back, her fingers trailing down my arm, and I stood and spun around to face her.</p> <p>\u201cBrooke, I hope falling asleep next to you didn\u2019t give you the wrong impression, but nothing\u2019s changed between us. You\u2019re one of my oldest friends\u2014but that\u2019s what we are. Friends. You understand that, right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled with those shuttered eyes. \u201cYes, I know, Graham. And I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d</p><p>I know Brooke has different relationship parameters than I do, but she\u2019s going to have to defer to mine. Kissing? Sleeping together? Not things I do with friends. \u201cUm. Okay.\u201d</p><p>She swung her legs to the ground and took my hands in hers. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m blind to how great you are, or that I don\u2019t sometimes, you know, think about you in other ways...\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cBrooke\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, shh, I\u2019m just talking. No danger, see?\u201d She dropped my hands, still smiling. \u201cEmma better take good care of you, though, or she\u2019ll have to answer to me!\u201d Her tone was so lighthearted that I felt almost silly for the warning I sensed under the words.</p> <p>\u201cIt would probably be better if you don\u2019t stay here anymore\u2014and I know you\u2019ll be in New York while you\u2019re filming this fall\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand. \u201cI\u2019m getting my own place. No worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured I was going to be here three or four months, and I\u2019ve recently considered moving to New York, so I thought I\u2019d sublet a place, see how I like it.\u201d</p><p>While I was trying to imagine Brooke\u2014every inch a California girl\u2014living in Manhattan instead of Hollywood, she tossed her empty suitcase on the bed and gave me a gentle push. \u201cNow scoot. I have to get packed and ready to go back to LA.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s phone has been off since late yesterday, right after she hung up on me. She never signed in to Skype last night, I don\u2019t know her home number, and it\u2019s unlisted. I don\u2019t have Emily\u2019s number, either. My choices were limited to watching her on Ellen or getting on a plane.</p><p>I opted to do both.</p><p>I\u2019m not a guy who makes rash decisions. Yet, I boarded a cross-country flight five hours ago with no thought in mind but see Emma.</p> <p>I still don\u2019t understand the whole photo-in-bed thing, and Brooke never answered my text asking her about it. If such a photo exists, Brooke must have taken it... and texted it to Reid? In what universe does that make any sense?</p><p>Watching Emma and Reid on Ellen supplied my final incentive to do something, anything. When he took her hand and kissed it, I had to stand and pace the room to keep from destroying the TV. And when he said, \u201cWe might as well come clean,\u201d I think my heart actually stopped beating. He then proceeded to take every bit of tabloid gossip ever written about them and weave it into one insane story, but the way he looked at her said more than his words.</p><p>I know he wants her still. Why wouldn\u2019t he? Even if I doubt his capacity to comprehend what a loving, compassionate person she is. He\u2019s shallow and he has access to beautiful girls everywhere he goes, but it\u2019s rare when one turns him down. He may want her for no other reason than to clear up that misstep in his perfect record, and that rouses the protective, possessive thing in me like nothing ever has.</p><p>I get a taxi straight to the hotel I booked, since even gaining three hours between New York and California didn\u2019t get me here early enough to casually stop by her house. It\u2019s almost 11:00 p.m. When I\u2019m checked in, I try calling her again. Her phone is still off. That, or she\u2019s blocked my number. My God, she\u2019s stubborn. I can\u2019t help smiling at that, because her obstinacy is what kept her from sleeping with Reid last fall.</p><p>I hit Brooke\u2019s speed-dial number. If she\u2019s not answering texts, maybe she\u2019ll answer a call.</p><p>\u201cGraham! Hi, baby.\u201d Great. She\u2019s more than a little trashed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brooke. Quick question\u2014I texted you last night about a photo you may have taken of the two of us...?\u201d</p><p>The blaring pop music and voices yelling back and forth in the background tell me she\u2019s at a club. \u201cA photo? What? I can barely hear you.\u201d She giggles and says something about another round to someone. \u201cOh, do you mean the one I took of us sleeping? Oh shit\u2014I deleted that! How did you get it?\u201d Well, that answers one question.</p><p>\u201cWho did you send it to, Brooke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh. I think just Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think\u2014\u201d I stand and pace. Inhale. Exhale. \u201cWhy in hell would you send him that? In fact, why in hell did you take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad, Graham. I\u2019m really sorry. I was still a little hammered when I did it. It was stupid. I\u2019m really, really sorry!\u201d My teeth grit and I almost hang up, because I\u2019ve got the information I need and she\u2019s so out of it she probably won\u2019t even remember this conversation.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll see you next week, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Graham, please don\u2019t be mad, okay? I\u2019ll tell him to delete it. I\u2019ll threaten him. I\u2019m soooo sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay. Later.\u201d I hang up and sit on the hotel bed, staring out at the Sacramento skyline, the sprawling suburban neighborhoods so unlike New York.</p><p>This situation is far from okay. Brooke wasn\u2019t drunk when we got home from Daniel\u2019s party. A little buzzed\u2014maybe. But drunk? No. I can\u2019t fathom what gave her the idea to stage that photo, and even more confusing\u2014why she sent it to Reid Alexander. I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on between the two of them, but I\u2019m quickly progressing to not giving a shit.</p><p>Emma\u2019s feelings are all that matter. I don\u2019t really have a plan. I feel like I just leapt from a plane without checking to see if there\u2019s a parachute strapped to my back. I\u2019ve always been the guy who analyzes and evaluates everything. I consider pros and cons. I weigh options. I make informed decisions. These precautions don\u2019t eliminate mistakes, but they certainly reduce the likelihood of them.</p><p>And then I met Emma, and as logical as she is, she makes me feel reckless. I\u2019m heedless of consequences. My plans and targets and goals and common sense go out the window in the face of what she makes me want. She scares the hell out of me and calms my soul at the same time. Maybe that\u2019s what love is\u2014a total contradiction that somehow balances out.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Emma</p><p>Emily is dropping me off at home just before noon. She has a twelve-to-six shift at the mall, so she\u2019s decked out in Hot Topic gear. Today\u2019s version is oddly similar to Chloe\u2019s Madonna circa Like-a-Virgin costume from last Halloween.</p><p>I\u2019m so not going to mention that thought to Em.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick you up at 7:00. Be ready, and be hot. Because Joe is tssss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, I really don\u2019t feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh-eh-eh!\u201d She holds up a hand and closes her eyes, like these things will keep her from hearing my objections to being set up with another of Derek\u2019s friends.</p><p>I try a different approach. \u201cI\u2019ve intruded on the last two nights with you guys... Don\u2019t you want some time to yourselves?\u201d</p><p>She lowers her chin and levels a look at me over her purple-lensed sunglasses. \u201cYes. That\u2019s why we\u2019re pawning you off on Joe for the night. Now be a good girl and play nice. I\u2019ll see you at 7:00.\u201d</p><p>I pull my overnight bag onto my shoulder in defeat. I know she and Derek are only trying to dissuade me from wallowing in depression over Graham, but it took me months to get over him last time, and there wasn\u2019t even a significant relationship to get over. I\u2019ll probably be twenty-five before I get over this. I can\u2019t divulge such a pathetic outlook to my best friend, though, because she\u2019d likely answer, \u201cChallenge. Accepted.\u201d And then I\u2019d be subjected to a parade of boys all summer long... Although it appears that strategy has already begun. Ugh.</p><p>She cranks her stereo and pulls away as I trudge up to the house, where I\u2019ll no doubt be assaulted by the smell of Pine Sol and bleach. Saturday is housecleaning day, and Chloe loves Pine Sol. When I was eight or nine, I asked her why, and she said, \u201cIt smells so clean!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt smells like a hundred car air fresheners hanging in a hospital,\u201d I retorted before Dad said my name in his stop-taunting-your-stepmother voice. I\u2019ve been cleaning my own bathroom since then, using the same non-toxic, environmentally safe stuff Mom used. I\u2019ve heard that the sense of smell is more powerful where love is concerned. I don\u2019t remember if my mother wore perfume or if her shampoo was scented like flowers or fruit, but I remember the minty smell of the kitchen after she\u2019d wiped down the countertops.</p><p>I unlock the front door, and surprise, Pine Sol. Blech. \u201cDad, Chloe, I\u2019m home!\u201d I call, closing the door and heading for the stairs and the sanctity of my room, inside which no Pine Sol is allowed.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Dad calls from the living room. \u201cCome in here, sweetheart. You\u2019ve got a visitor.\u201d</p><p>I still smile when Dad calls me sweetheart.</p><p>And then I register the other part, and turn back from the staircase. I have a visitor? Dan, maybe? He\u2019s only been here a handful of times, but Reid and I are doing Conan on Monday, so maybe\u2014</p><p>Graham is sitting on the sofa.</p><p>Graham. Is sitting. On the sofa.</p><p>I\u2019m frozen on the opposite side of the room. Staring at him. Speechless.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on, Chloe, we\u2019ve got cleaning to do.\u201d Dad hustles her from the room.</p><p>His eyes never leaving mine, Graham stands, smoothing his hands down his thighs in a nervous gesture. He seems taller, standing here in my living room. He\u2019s wearing his thick-soled boots, barely laced, jeans haphazardly rolled at the bottom, t-shirt inscribed with (of course) the name of the band Emily was just introducing me to in her car.</p><p>Graham runs a hand through his hair and takes a deep breath. Finally, with a determined scowl, he crosses the room. My flip-flops leave me more than a head shorter and craning my neck to look at him, because he doesn\u2019t stop a safe distance away. His hands grip my shoulders. \u201cWe are not,\u201d his voice is a gentle tremor, \u201cbreaking up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d I say, still stunned. Graham is standing in my living room.</p><p>\u201cI fell asleep next to her. That\u2019s all. I don\u2019t know why she took that picture. I don\u2019t know why she sent it to him. But it\u2019s nothing. And I will not lose you over it.\u201d</p><p>I take a huge, shuddering breath, as though I haven\u2019t been able to breathe fully in two days. Maybe I haven\u2019t. He\u2019s getting blurry from my tears. I blink them away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, one hand sliding to the small of my back while the other moves to cradle my face. He kisses me, lightly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The second kiss is deeper, longer. I lean into him, on my toes as he pulls me closer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers, and I shake my head, my arms knotting behind his neck, pulling him to me. His tongue sweeps through my mouth as I hum my surrender.</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d my stepmother exclaims from the kitchen door.</p><p>Chloe. Ruins. Everything.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry! Um. Coffee in the kitchen. If you want it.\u201d She scurries away. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen her scurry before. I laugh, muffling the sound by leaning into Graham\u2019s chest. He\u2019s laughing quietly, too.</p><p>\u201cThat must have been a pretty good kiss,\u201d he says. I look up into his dark eyes. One eyebrow angled up, he\u2019s every inch a very self-satisfied boy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know if it was?\u201d</p> <p>He leans closer, his breath in my ear. \u201cOh, I know it was, all right. Let me prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I say.</p><p>He chuckles, the tip of his tongue touching the skin behind my ear. When I shiver and melt into him, his arms surround me, pulling me in tight before he claims my mouth again.</p><p>Me: Change in plans...graham is here.</p><p>Em: Brooke\u2014&gt;bed\u2014&gt;photo\u2014&gt;not speaking to him???</p><p>Me: Misunderstanding</p> <p>Em: What about joe? ARGH. Calling you when I get off.</p><p>With a sigh, I cram the phone into my front pocket and reach for Graham\u2019s hand as we stroll the last half-block to the park.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not happy, huh? If you want to go without me tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going without you.\u201d I stop walking and pull my hand from his, crossing my arms over my chest and scowling at him.</p><p>He turns back, his eyes that rich caramel they become in the sunlight. God, he\u2019s beautiful. But I wish he\u2019d stop being so... complacent. Taking in my posture, he grins towards his feet and releases a pent-up breath. His expression is hypnotic when he raises his eyes to mine. \u201cEmma.\u201d He steps close, tracing his fingers from my shoulders to my elbows. \u201cAre you upset that I\u2019m not more... possessive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No\u2014that\u2019s the last thing I\u2019d want.\u201d My arms loosen. The memory of Meredith and Robby last fall makes me shudder. When I talked to her a couple of weeks ago, things weren\u2019t going well. The enraged phone calls and accusations had started up again, and her emotions were a mess. I can only hope that Robby\u2019s angry verbal outbursts never become physical.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes a little\u2014Graham\u2019s notion of possessive would probably consist of a sharp glare and terse answers. \u201cWell. Maybe not the last thing...\u201d</p> <p>He laughs. \u201cOh yeah? What would be last?\u201d</p><p>I chew my lip, not meeting his eyes, until he tips my chin up. He\u2019s wearing a cocky grin that I\u2019m about to make cockier. \u201cDisinterest. Goodbye.\u201d I shrug. \u201cThose would be last.\u201d</p><p>Instead of a smug look, he shakes his head and slides his arms around me, resting his forehead against mine. My hands come to rest on his chest. \u201cNever, Emma.\u201d</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>\u201cI forgot to ask\u2014when did you get here, and how long can you stay, and are you staying with me?\u201d Her questions are rapid-fire, shading her cheeks a little pink.</p><p>We\u2019ve been sitting on a park bench, people-watching. Emma\u2019s neighborhood park boasts a man-made pond with a fountain in the center. It\u2019s about half the size of Turtle Pond in Central Park, and it contains a collection of fat, lazy ducks. When small children toss bits of bread on the water, the ducks only gobble it up if it\u2019s within a close enough range. Anything thrown outside of a four-foot sphere surrounding any duck just gets soggy and sinks.</p><p>\u201cI landed in Sacramento late last night. I leave tomorrow at noon\u2014which gets me to JFK around eight New York time. And I\u2019m staying in a hotel downtown.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes follow an elderly couple who amble by on the paved sidewalk, holding hands. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call when you got in town last night?\u201d I give her a hooded look and wait for her to remember her powered-down phone. \u201cOh. Right. But you can\u2019t stay later tomorrow, or another night?\u201d</p><p>Chuckling at a small boy whose goal appears to be nailing the ducks in the head with hunks of bagel, I allow myself a private smile at the barely-discernible sulk in her tone.</p><p>\u201cCassie has to take Caleb for a checkup, and everyone else is working Monday, so I\u2019ll have Cara. And I promised her a trip to the zoo since I\u2019ve been gone or studying so much lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course.\u201d I watch her face as she pretends to watch the ducks and roller-bladers while she contemplates my responsibility to my daughter. I sense, too, the other question she isn\u2019t asking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love for you to stay with me tonight,\u201d I say, and her eyes shift up to mine. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather have your dad like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather him to continue to like me.\u201d</p><p>Emma stares at the ducks again, which have all paddled just out of bagel-hurling range. \u201cI talked to him about getting an apartment instead of a dorm.\u201d The wind kicks up and sends a strand of hair across her face, and I automatically reach to tuck it back behind her ear. She turns to me, her forehead creased, her eyes searching mine. \u201cI know you think living in a dorm would be more normal-girl or whatever, but I want an apartment. I\u2019ve wanted a cat ever since Chloe made me give Hector up, and no dorm will allow that. And I want the plants Chloe said would suck up all the oxygen.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes, sure she\u2019s making that up. \u201cShe did not.\u201d</p><p>She nods, laughing. \u201cShe did. She also said they would ruin the floor, which might be true, but I don\u2019t care. I want to try to grow things. I want to cook. And make non-flavored coffee. And leave my shoes in the living room, and bowls in the sink. And never, ever, ever use Pine Sol.\u201d</p><p>I pull another strand of hair from her face. Her skin is soft, and she\u2019s so beautiful. My fingers are restless, pushing into her hair, stroking behind her ear. \u201cAnd Graham, I told him I wanted more privacy than I\u2019d get in a dorm... because of you.\u201d</p><p>My hand freezes. Her father hadn\u2019t punched me in the face or tried to kill me this morning when I showed up at his door, unannounced. He hadn\u2019t even been rude. My thumb strokes across her lower lip. \u201cWhat I said before about moving into a dorm, I said because I don\u2019t want to be one more person who hinders you living your life as it should be. I want you to be free to make the choices that are best for you, without regard to me.\u201d</p><p>Her small hands close over my forearm, and she leans her face into my palm. \u201cThen you have to trust me to make those decisions. Even if some of them have everything to do with you.\u201d When she speaks, the vibrations of her voice travel through my hand. \u201cJust because I consider you when I\u2019m deciding doesn\u2019t make it any less my choice.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. I don\u2019t deserve this, I don\u2019t deserve her, and yet here she is.</p><p>She kisses me once\u2014a swift, shy brush of her lips. \u201cI\u2019d like to come have breakfast with you tomorrow, before you fly home, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tonight, you\u2019ll meet my best friend, and she will love you, or she will rue the day.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly and she does, too. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better make sure she loves me, then. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for you losing your best friend.\u201d</p><p>When Emily calls, Emma walks into the hall with her cell, leaving me sitting on her bed perusing old photo albums her mom put together before she died. Emma\u2019s side of the hallway conversation is still perfectly audible, even if executed almost completely in coarsely hissed tones.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t bring Joe for comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, I turned my phone off. He had no other choice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get a vote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nothing like him at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you in an hour.\u201d</p><p>She walks back into the room, her mouth screwed into a grimace. \u201cYou could probably hear all of that, huh?\u201d</p><p>I subdue a grin and pat the space next to me. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shadowed with worry, she tosses her phone on the bedside table and comes to stand next to me. I pull her onto the bed and kiss her until she relaxes into me. \u201cStop worrying. It will all work out.\u201d</p><p>A slight pucker remains on her forehead. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be determined. But it will.\u201d Picking up the photo album, I point to a series of photos she\u2019d told me about\u2014the ones taken in Griffith Park. \u201cYou look like your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for her eyes.\u201d She leans her head back against my shoulder. \u201cMom\u2019s eyes were very dark brown, like yours. Mine are like my dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I use this excuse to examine her eyes again. If I was painting them, I would use a base of stormy gray, with flecks of green layered on top, and miniscule slivers of gold. \u201cI remember thinking that when we met in the caf\u00e9\u2014how you look nothing like him, except for your eyes. I\u2019ve never met anyone with eyes like yours, and they\u2019re the exact likeness of his\u2014the beautiful color, the slightly tilted shape. Based on eyes alone, anyone would know you\u2019re his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara has your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cShe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her mother\u2019s hair?\u201d I nod again, watching her confusion build. \u201cBut she\u2019s never met Cara, or called, or requested a picture, anything?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cIs Cara okay with that? Does she ask about her mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s great, in fact. Mom, Cassie and Brynn more than fill that vacancy.\u201d</p><p>Emma stares at the photos of the mother she lost at six. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad.\u201d I watch her face from above, the way her cheeks raise a fraction with her smile. \u201cMy grandma and Emily\u2019s mom did an okay job filling in, I think. Teaching me how to be a girl.\u201d</p><p>My fingers trail down the side of her face. \u201cThey did an incredible job.\u201d I tilt her chin up and bend my face to hers, silently praising every woman who\u2019s had a hand in making her who she is. Even Chloe... though I\u2019ll never tell Emma that. A truth learned from four years of literary study: nothing beats an antagonist for character-building.</p><p>Emily is so directly opposite of Emma in looks that I have to give myself a mental shake. Pink hair. Combat boots. Darkly-lined eyes. Emo girl with an anime bent. And a preppy boyfriend? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course this girl is her best friend.</p><p>When we\u2019re all seated in a booth at Chili\u2019s, Emily gestures to my t-shirt. \u201cSo, you, uh, like them?\u201d Sneaking into her offhand tone is a note of fangirl enthusiasm.</p><p>I glance down at my chest and back up. \u201cOh, yeah. They\u2019re brilliant. Have you seen them perform live?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cNot yet, but I definitely will. You?\u201d</p> <p>I nod. \u201cA couple times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d So much for indifference. She clamps her lips together to try to rein in her interest while Derek and Emma exchange suppressed smiles.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know the bassist and the drummer\u2014they were classmates of mine at Columbia. Cool guys.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth drops. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re supposed to do Unplugged later in the summer, I think. I could probably get you into the taping, if you\u2019re going to be in New York.\u201d Emma\u2019s hand slips into mine and she pulls it onto her lap. I squeeze her hand and she squeezes back.</p> <p>Emily blinks, stunned. I would guess she doesn\u2019t stun easily. Or often. \u201cUh, yeah, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>Derek clears his throat to hide a laugh. \u201cSo you went to Columbia, man?\u201d he asks. I nod. \u201cTheatre, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Literature.\u201d I expect him to react like Reid: Ah, and nothing else to say. But no, he plans to study English at CSU Long Beach, where Emily plans to major in anthropology. When we start to discuss literary theory and writing programs the way some guys discuss sports stats, the girls mock our academic jargon, but they grin at each other, covertly.</p><p>And just like that, I\u2019m in.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>REID</p> <p>The last expression I expect to see on Emma\u2019s face Monday afternoon is joy.</p><p>After makeup does their damage, we wait backstage to be called onto the Conan set. At first, I think she\u2019s faking happy to get through the interview. Then I realize it\u2019s legit. Four days ago, I showed Emma a photo that should have devastated her, and wrecked any would-be relationship she\u2019d begun with Graham. Instead, she looks like sunshine.</p><p>\u201cThis is an unexpected transformation.\u201d I smile tightly into her glowing face. The green room sofa is small and our knees touch, lightly. She doesn\u2019t seem to notice. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that her current state of mind has nothing to do with me.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about that picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey fell asleep next to each other, but nothing else happened. You must have been correct about her playing mind games with you or whatever, because it looks like you\u2019re the only one she sent it to.\u201d</p><p>So Graham didn\u2019t own up, even after that photo\u2014and he managed to convince her that nothing happened? I\u2019m in awe. The guy has bigger cojones than I thought. I consider the two possibilities: either he intends to string them both along... or he considers Brooke a one-time hookup\u2014a mistake that he doesn\u2019t intend to repeat.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Emma says.</p> <p>Doubtful. \u201cWhat am I thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s lying to me. But I know he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievable. Practically everything I did last fall earned Emma\u2019s distrust, but this she\u2019s willing to overlook? \u201cSo even after a compromising\u2014some might say incriminating\u2014photo of him in bed with Brooke, you aren\u2019t worried that he might be cheating. I gotta hand it to the guy\u2014he\u2019s a god, if he can get away with that one.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cNot every guy is a player, Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>I look steadily back at her, and don\u2019t ask what other way she could possibly mean it. The possible responses are a jumble of pithy and serious and harsh and flirtatious, and in the end nothing works so I say nothing. After a few seconds, she looks away.</p><p>A set assistant pops in to tell us we have five minutes. We can\u2019t go out there like this\u2014awkward and avoiding eye contact. Intending to make small talk and bring us back to center, I ask what she did over the weekend.</p><p>\u201cI hung out with Emily. And, um, Graham was in Sacramento Saturday and Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The hell? My brain is whirring with the reasons why Graham would travel cross-country to make sure of her. I suspect Brooke is unaware of this little development.</p><p>\u201cWe saw a movie Saturday night, and they played the trailer for School Pride. I know it\u2019s routine for you, but watching myself on that huge screen felt so strange. The movie looks pretty good, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound surprised.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI guess I am, a little. The last time a Jane Austen novel was modernized well on film was Clueless.\u201d</p><p>I smirk at her. \u201cBook snob.\u201d</p><p>She smirks back. \u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d</p><p>Before I can wrap my brain any further around Graham in Sacramento, the door opens and the set assistant reappears. \u201cYou guys are on.\u201d</p><p>Conan goes well\u2014the combination of the comedic venue and the fact that it\u2019s our last interview help make it the best one we\u2019ve done. When asked about the stories I ad-libbed on Ellen, I embellish them with help from Emma, who offers to let Conan feel the babies kick. The audience thinks we\u2019re hilarious. I introduce a couple of clips from the movie\u2014one of which includes a scorching kiss between Emma and me that gets everyone hot and bothered, and we\u2019re out.</p><p>Before we part, I give Emma a swift hug and brush a kiss on her cheek\u2014because the side of her face is what she offers when I lean towards her. Then she\u2019s in a limo to the airport and I\u2019m in my car, dialing Brooke\u2019s cell.</p><p>\u201cAre you aware that Graham was in Sacramento this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no. He\u2019s obviously playing both of you. Emma showed up to the Conan taping happy as shit. She was blissed out, and completely convinced that nothing happened between you guys. He\u2019s more like me than I gave him credit for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nothing like you.\u201d Her tone lashes me.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Brooke, seriously? He\u2019s got you snowed, too? Or is he planning to screw you on the side\u2014with your blessing\u2014while he keeps Emma for a public relationship\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have sex, okay?\u201d Her words are angry, like she\u2019s spitting them at me. \u201cWhat he told her was true. He fell asleep, and I fell asleep next to him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m driving in a state of shock. I actually have to snap my mouth closed. \u201cOkay, wait. Are you telling me he hasn\u2019t nailed either of you? You\u2019re right. Forget the like me comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>My hands tighten on the wheel. \u201cNow what?\u201d A more pointless question has never been asked. There is no now what. This is done. We\u2019ve lost. On the other hand, neither of us has actually lost anything. We just managed to land right back where we started, like that damned board game with the ladders and slides that Mom played with me when I was a kid, before she decided to become a full-time drunk.</p><p>\u201cPremiere night,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cPremiere night what? Are you planning to drape yourself over the buffet table naked and hope that gets his attention? Sounds like he\u2019s made his choice to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens between Graham and me is my business, not yours,\u201d she shoots back. I imagine her frothing at the mouth, because frankly, that\u2019s how she sounds. \u201cYours is to be there to console Emma when she needs it, because she\u2019s going to need it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, incredulous at how confident she is in the face of failure. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring me, she strategizes out loud, and I listen in spite of my misgivings. \u201cGo to her room before we all leave for the premiere. Discuss walking the red carpet together, the seating arrangements at the theater, hanging out at the party, whatever. While you\u2019re there, leave something in her room, somewhere not very visible\u2014like your phone. Turn it to silent and lock it, of course. And delete all the messages, just in case.\u201d</p><p>Brooke has gone off the double agent deep end.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Emma\u2019s the sort to break into my phone and read the messages\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and let me think.\u201d Goddamn I\u2019ll be glad when this is over. I\u2019d love to tell her to go to hell, but she\u2019s still dangling Emma as a possibility, so I bite my tongue. \u201cAs soon as we\u2019re all in our rooms after the party, call her from your room phone. Tell her you left your cell in her room, and ask her if she can bring it down the hall to your room, because you aren\u2019t feeling well. When you hang up with her, call my cell. Be ready to come out and handle her. Think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, I can handle her. What exactly am I going to be handling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have to think. Just be ready. When I hang up, give it a few seconds and then come into the hallway and find her.\u201d</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>I fly into LA with Tim Warner\u2014Mr. Bennet in School Pride\u2014who also lives in New York. We discuss future projects and chat about Reid\u2014specifically, Reid and Emma\u2019s fake relationship. I find myself drumming the arm of the seat and not making eye contact when he mentions that they\u2019re cute together.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Tim says with a small tilt of his head.</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d I try to appear confused by the question, shaking my head and giving a small shrug.</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d He\u2019s not falling for it. \u201cGraham, I was a gay boy in Alabama in the early eighties. In the interest of saving my own ass, I learned how to be enigmatic, and how to outright fib, so I know it when I see it. You have the mysterious part down, but son, you can\u2019t lie worth a crap. Confession is good for the soul, I hear. So, what\u2019s got you coming out of your skin?\u201d</p><p>Like Brooke, he has no accent. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re from Alabama,\u201d I hedge.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI shot off to New York when I was seventeen, determined to separate myself from my past in every possible way. A good thing overall, but also a little tragic. But we\u2019re not talking about me. We\u2019re talking about you. Since we have a five-hour flight ahead of us, you might as well start talking.\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019ll wear you down eventually.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, conceding defeat. \u201cHave you ever had to pretend to be in a relationship with a costar, because production wanted you to?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a pointed look. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ve certainly had to pretend not to be in a relationship with a costar because production didn\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>I stare at my hands. \u201cYeah? Well, me too. Though production doesn\u2019t actually know about it. It\u2019s more an unspoken clause, under the edict that Emma and Reid look involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they were? They had a tiff or something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they broke up last fall.\u201d</p><p>We both accept coffee service and a warm cookie from the flight attendant. Say what you will\u2014flying first class is a shocking illustration of dissimilarity between the privileged and the non-privileged. While Tim and I will enjoy a catered meal, several snacks, hot towels and all the attention we could want, hundreds of people in the back of the plane are lucky to get a bag of pretzels and a can of soda. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh... Well, as my gaydar is going pbbbt where you\u2019re concerned, I\u2019m guessing your secret lover is Emma, not Reid. For how long is this edict in place?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle at the mere thought of Reid and me in a relationship, but my blood runs molten at the notion of Emma as my lover. \u201cUh, yes, Emma. And until after the release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe premiere is tonight, and the release is Friday\u2014that\u2019s only two days away! What\u2019s with the mopey puppy face?\u201d</p><p>I run a hand through my hair. Gay or not, Tim is a guy. \u201cI can\u2019t stand watching the two of them pretend. Maybe because they did have a thing going last fall\u2014I keep imagining them together, which is senseless and asinine. But it\u2019s driving me nuts. I\u2019ve never felt like this.\u201d</p> <p>He nods, lips compressed. \u201cThe caveman,\u201d he says finally.</p><p>\u201cThe who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery man has an inner caveman. Unless he\u2019s a flaming queen, in which case he has an inner wild-eyed, jealous bitch\u2014as in the case of an ex of mine. But I digress.\u201d He starts to eat his cookie and I think maybe that\u2019s the extent of his reflections on Neanderthal impulses, until he looks me in the eye. \u201cImagine you and Emma are alone. She looks deep into your eyes and declares: you\u2019re mine. How does that make you feel?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s freaking obvious how that makes me feel\u2014my fingers curl into my palms, my pulse hammers, my breathing speeds and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if my eyes just dilated.</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cIn private, between the two of you, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little... caveman sentiment. Or cavewoman, as the case may be. It\u2019s natural.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d practically driven Emma across her hotel room and onto her bed the first time I saw her after we decided to be together. The chance that will happen again, as soon as I get to the hotel this afternoon, is high. I want to touch her so badly that my skin tightens at the thought of her, nerve endings sensitive and raw. These reactions are visceral\u2014primitive, and I\u2019ve been trying to repress them ever since the first moment I saw her. What a waste of energy that has been.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to be of service.\u201d He waggles his brows once, pulling Bose headphones on and leaning his seat all the way back.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>Emma</p><p>I\u2019m about to text Graham to see if he\u2019s checked in yet when there\u2019s a knock at the door. Glancing in the mirror as I pass it and wishing I\u2019d had two minutes to check my hair and brush my teeth, I take a deep breath and make myself walk to the door. I want to run to it.</p> <p>I pull the door open and feel my smile falter and resume half-heartedly. \u201cReid.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cGod, woman, at least try to look like I\u2019m not the last person on earth you\u2019d like to see at your door. My self-image might never recover. You don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying my career, do you?\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes at Reid\u2019s exaggeration\u2014as if I could deliver any kind of blow to his sense of self\u2014I ignore his silly speech, backing up to let him in. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I shouldn\u2019t have expected Graham. I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s arrived at LAX yet.</p><p>Reid drops onto the small sofa. \u201cWe should talk about tonight\u2019s logistics. The red carpet, the seating during the showing, whether or not you\u2019ll need a paper bag to breathe into while you watch an entire film full of Emma Pierce on the huge screen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha,\u201d I say with a nervous flutter in my stomach at the thought of that. Discomfort at watching yourself onscreen isn\u2019t unheard of\u2014some big-name actors even refuse to do it, which keeps me from feeling like a complete weirdo. I won\u2019t need the paper bag if Graham is sitting next to me. He can unwind me with a look, or the smallest touch.</p><p>Rather than joining Reid on the sofa, I go back to unpacking, calling the concierge to have my dress for the premiere steamed for tonight. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be walking in together, sitting next to each other during the showing. But... I\u2019d like to have Graham on the other side of me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightens a fraction with a smile that doesn\u2019t quite meet his eyes. \u201cShould be fine. If anything, it will just add to the drama. I take it production doesn\u2019t have any clue about you and Graham?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, pulling out the pretty silver stilettoes I\u2019m sure to hate by the end of the night. Chloe helped me shop for the shoes, and the dress. She was ecstatic when I agreed to let her assist, and she would have earned the Emily stamp of approval for the withering rebuke she sneered at a clerk at the boutique who wasn\u2019t accommodating enough:</p> <p>\u201cThis is Emma Pierce, and we\u2019re choosing a gown for the worldwide premiere of the film School Pride, in which she stars alongside Reid Alexander! Fetch someone who can figure out what that requires, or we will take our business elsewhere!\u201d</p><p>The snooty clerk, wide-eyed with panic by the time she heard Reid\u2019s name, sprinted to the back. Minutes later, we were shown to a private dressing room and offered champagne while dozens of dresses were presented for our inspection. After narrowing these as though she was choosing weapons for battle, Chloe had me try on the few that made the cut. The green and silver dress we chose\u2014our agreement my second shock of the day\u2014is backless and flows to mid-calf.</p><p>I can hardly wait for Graham to see me in it.</p><p>Reid watches me remove the dress from my suitcase and hang it on the door. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be stunning on you, with your beautiful green eyes.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat and murmur, \u201cThank you,\u201d recalling what he said a couple of weeks ago\u2014that if Graham screwed up he wanted another chance. And that kiss on Monday\u2014what was that? Even if I didn\u2019t feel it or respond to it, the fact that he did it was disconcerting.</p><p>When I turn away from the door, he\u2019s standing close enough that I startle, my heart galloping under my hand. \u201cGod, Reid.\u201d Instantly recognizing his heated expression, I brace my hands against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He presses no closer, but he doesn\u2019t step back, either. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re in love with him, too?\u201d His voice is very soft, his eyes almost navy blue in the entry alcove of my room, away from the windows and light.</p><p>\u201cToo?\u201d</p><p>A knock at the door sends me stumbling into him. He steadies my shoulders under his firm grasp as my heart races from the hard, unexpected knock.</p><p>\u201cThat must be laundry pickup, for the dress.\u201d My voice is breathless, and he smiles.</p><p>Reaching behind me, he retrieves the dress from the hook and hands it down, and then he opens the door. On the other side is not a hotel employee. The forceful knocker is Graham, his smile fading when he sees Reid standing right behind me, in my room. I\u2019m still holding the dress. I turn and shove it into Reid\u2019s hands, and he rehangs it without comment.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I push the door further open, to let Graham in. To let Reid out.</p><p>Moving into the doorway, Reid turns back to me. \u201cThe concierge will call when the limos get here. I suggest you and I share one of them on the ride to Grauman\u2019s, so the exit will be simple. There will be too many flashes to be able to see. You\u2019ll never locate anyone who isn\u2019t already right next to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Reid turns to Graham. They\u2019re standing two feet apart\u2014the tension rocking between them like punches thrown. And then suddenly Reid is completely at ease. \u201cGraham,\u201d he says.</p><p>Graham\u2019s jaw remains rigid. \u201cReid.\u201d</p><p>Boys.</p><p>REID</p><p>I learned years ago that the most defenseless you can ever be is when you believe yourself to be in love. I say I don\u2019t believe in love, but that\u2019s not really true\u2014love is just the name of an emotion. It\u2019s like on steroids. It\u2019s lust with ethics. And emotions\u2014fear, hate, whatever\u2014come and go.</p><p>What I don\u2019t believe in is the notion of being in love.</p><p>People talk about falling in love as though it\u2019s accidental. As though it surprises the hell out of them. I understand those impressions, because that\u2019s how I felt with Brooke. Unlike most people, though, once it was over and I got some emotional distance, I saw it for what it was\u2014an obsession.</p><p>Consequently, believing myself to be in love isn\u2019t a high I crave\u2014it was a total loss of control that I hope to never experience again. I\u2019m attracted to Emma. I\u2019m amused and distracted by her. I can even say I care about her. But I\u2019m not in love with her. There\u2019s no need to sacrifice my metaphorical heart on a platter when all I want is a temporary diversion.</p><p>With the whole cast assembled along the red carpet en masse, the paparazzi are like barracudas in a feeding frenzy. Between their usual catcalls and the screaming fans, the noise level is insane. The bodyguards have their hands full keeping people from jumping the velvet cords. I take Emma\u2019s hand as we exit the limo, and she accepts the support, clutching my hand so tightly I\u2019m worried she\u2019s about to freak out. Every time I glance down at her face, though, she\u2019s smiling and seems perfectly calm.</p><p>The dress, as I predicted, is stunning on her\u2014the green of her eyes more potent next to the silky emerald fabric, the silver threads shimmering with every flash. I can\u2019t resist the thought of trailing my fingers down her bare back, or slipping the straps from her shoulders. She looks like a goddess, and I\u2019d be content to worship at her feet. She eclipses everyone here, even Brooke in her predictable little black dress.</p><p>My ex-lover is jealous. Posing for photos between Graham and Tadd, she smiles charmingly, but when she directs one unguarded look in Emma\u2019s direction, the resentment is palpable. When her gaze shifts to me, my deliberate grin makes her eyes blaze.</p><p>Yeah. She\u2019d still definitely kill me if she could.</p><p>None of us can see for five minutes after we finally complete the extended fifteen-minute walk from the limo to the theater doors, and we\u2019re half-deaf as well. I take the seat next to Emma, and Graham takes her opposite side. Her body language is clear. When he leans closer to make a comment or observation, she sways towards him like gravity is involved. Brooke takes the seat on the opposite side of Graham.</p><p>The movie isn\u2019t perfect, but none of them ever are. It\u2019s a little sugary, trying too hard to be like the classic novel on which it was based. That will carry box office sales, though, and girls will gobble it up like candy. Sorry, boyfriends everywhere\u2014you\u2019re doomed to sit through an hour and forty-seven minutes of syrupy drivel. The payoff? Between my face, Tadd\u2019s abs and Quinton\u2019s biceps, your girl will be ready for takeoff as soon as the credits roll. You\u2019re welcome.</p><p>The official after-party is being held on the third-floor terrace of the hotel. Some of us take the opportunity to change outfits, some don\u2019t. I\u2019m glad to see Emma doesn\u2019t. All the guys remain in dark suits and ties, though jackets are ditched, ties loosened, buttons undone and sleeves rolled. Tadd\u2019s wearing the bolo tie and cowboy hat he bought in Austin, and next to him is MiShaun in the silky white and gold number she wore to the theater. Meredith and Jenna switched to jeans, and Brooke swapped her black gown for a powder blue micro-dress that matches the frosty blue of her eyes and shows off her runway-smooth legs. Her effort yields striking results, but not enough to surpass Emma. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice dress,\u201d I say when Brooke joins me at the table. No one else is sitting there at the moment, everyone either admiring the buffet with its ice sculptures and chocolate fondue setup, or rubbing elbows with other Hollywood elite. \u201cMatches your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I laugh when she narrows those eyes at me.</p><p>She glances around to make sure no one\u2019s near. \u201cYou know where the rooms are located, right? Graham\u2019s is in that alcove area on the other side of the elevators, and Emma\u2019s and mine are in between yours and his.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I\u2019d checked out the locations she\u2019d given me before leaving. \u201cDid you have something to do with where our rooms are, Brooke?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugs, and I wonder if she didn\u2019t miss her calling as a CIA operative.</p><p>\u201cYou left your phone in her room?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cIngeniously wedged between sofa cushions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave when they do. As soon as you get to your room, call and convince her to bring your phone to your room. When you hang up with her, call me. I\u2019ll be in the hallway between your rooms, and she\u2019ll overhear my conversation. When we hang up, come out of your room and find her. Keep her faced towards you\u2014that\u2019s really important. Are you listening?\u201d</p><p>Something about her superior way of giving instructions just makes me want to pay no attention. \u201cYeah. Ask her to bring my phone. Then call you. Then come into the hallway. Real complicated.\u201d</p> <p>Her jaw sets. \u201cReid, I swear to God, if you screw this up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReid Alexander!\u201d A woman appears next to our table with a girl of twelve or thirteen, who\u2019s staring at me with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Johanna and this is Christina Noel and may I say that we are such huge fans of yours!\u201d She sticks out a clammy hand for me to shake, barking, \u201cChristina Noel, shake his hand!\u201d The girl complies, her hand trembling. \u201cWe won tickets to the premiere and this after-party shindig and traveled 1421 miles to be here!\u201d The woman says, leaning closer to stage whisper, \u201cThis hotel costs a fortune!\u201d Straightening, she adds, \u201cWorth every penny\u2014but it\u2019s a lot of pennies!\u201d She hoots with laughter while the girl turns bright red. \u201cAnyhoo, we are just speechless with delight to be here!\u201d</p><p>Speechless is not the word I would have chosen for her, though it appears fitting for her unfortunate kid.</p><p>\u201cOh, and look!\u201d Staring at Brooke, she elbows the girl. \u201cIt\u2019s Caroline.\u201d I feel Brooke stiffen beside me at the condescending tone. \u201cYou were in that little cable series\u2014what was it called\u2014Life\u2019s a Beach? We don\u2019t let Christina Noel watch trashy stuff\u2014no offense\u2014so we haven\u2019t seen it. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just peachy, for what it is.\u201d</p> <p>Oh shit. Cleanup at Table One in three, two...</p><p>\u201cDo you have a camera?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow about a photo of me and Christina, er, Noel.\u201d I gesture to the girl to stand next to me, since we\u2019re about the same height if I remain seated. She inches closer, visibly shaking. Her mother tears through her bag hunting for her camera, tossing tissues, celebrity maps, and bottles of lotion and hand sanitizer on the table, oblivious to the fact that Brooke is giving her a marked-for-death stare.</p><p>\u201cAh-ha!\u201d She produces a cheap camera and turns it on, but instead of lining up the shot, she thrusts it into Brooke\u2019s hands. \u201cBe a dear and take our picture, will you?\u201d She squeezes herself on the opposite side of me from her daughter, all but knocking Brooke off of her chair.</p><p>Brooke snaps one photo before giving me a piercing glare as though I had anything to do with the insulting speech. \u201cCall me. Later.\u201d Shoving the camera back into Johanna\u2019s hands, she spins and strides towards MiShaun and Tadd, disaster somewhat averted.</p><p>\u201cWell, gracious me, what bee got into her bonnet?\u201d Johanna mutters.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>Brooke</p><p>My phone buzzes. When I answer, Reid says, \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p> <p>Emma is in the corridor, about to turn the corner. My heart is thumping so hard I can barely hear her footsteps. I face the window, like it\u2019s normal to be taking in the 3 a.m. courtyard view while talking on the phone, no big deal. Here we go.</p><p>\u201cGraham\u2019s supposed to call me soon, but I wanted to let you know the soon-to-be-news,\u201d I say, listening for Emma\u2019s footfalls. She hears Graham\u2019s name and stops at the corner, just as I knew she would.</p><p>\u201cSo am I going to get the dirty details?\u201d Reid says, determined to make this artificial conversation miserable, just because he can.</p><p>I concentrate on saying what I want her to hear. \u201cYou know how impatient I am. I\u2019ll be happy when he\u2019s taken care of this so we can be together openly. All we have are stolen moments when she\u2019s not around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cruelty knows no bounds, does it?\u201d Reid says. I want to tell him to shut the hell up. He\u2019s only on the line to know when to exit his room, the jackass.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to hurt her, but we\u2019re meant to be.\u201d I try to sound casual, but Reid\u2019s comments are making my teeth grind. \u201cMy God, that night we spent\u2014I mean, I\u2019ve been with a lot of guys\u2014\u201d Reid laughs softly in my ear, the bastard \u201c\u2014but he was mind-blowingly hot. Better than anyone, ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only it were true...\u201d Reid says. I\u2019m going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cWe should have given in to this thing between us years ago instead of putting so much effort into remaining friends only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s never, in four years, made a move?\u201d Reid laughs. \u201cMan, what that must have done to your colossal sexual ego.\u201d</p><p>Son of a\u2014ignore, ignore, ignore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll tell her soon. He knows I\u2019m better for him\u2014I\u2019m even ready to be a step-mommy to Cara, and he knows Emma\u2019s too young for that. Hey, he\u2019s calling in\u2014gotta go.\u201d</p><p>I pretend to flash over. I imagine Emma around the corner, pressed to the wall, listening to every word I say. Time to step it up.</p><p>\u201cHey gorgeous.\u201d My voice is a purr. \u201cWhen are you going to tell her?\u201d She\u2019s probably leaning against that wall, stunned. I shove the guilt away. I\u2019m right for him. \u201cGraham, I know it seems brutal, but you\u2019ve got to rip the bandage off. I want to be with you, out in the open.\u201d</p><p>Reid murmurs, \u201cBrutal indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can come down there now.\u201d I start to turn in Emma\u2019s direction. \u201cI want you, too. You\u2019ll see just how much when I get to your door.\u201d</p><p>Reid starts to make another comment and I hang up on him.</p><p>Emma scrambles into the alcove labeled Ice and Vending just before I round the corner. Hearing one small, audible sob, I hesitate, but I force myself to glide towards Graham\u2019s room without looking back. I\u2019m right for him. I turn into the short hallway where his room is located and wait. I would say now comes the tricky part, but this whole damned thing is tricky. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll come to his room to confront us. I gambled on the fact that she wouldn\u2019t confront me, ten seconds ago, but who knows. Which is why Reid is about to inadvertently intercept her.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d I hear his voice around the corner, on cue. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>I creep quietly towards the corner, not daring to peer around yet. I hear her gasping and hope she doesn\u2019t start hyperventilating or something, because that would screw up our plans right quick. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d she says, the sob in her throat breaking free.</p><p>I edge around the corner, carefully. Reid is facing me, Emma facing him. Perfect. There\u2019s no betraying glance from him, though I know he\u2019s aware of me. He takes her face in his hands and stares down into her eyes with the most compassionate look I\u2019ve ever seen on his face. My God, he\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk out here in the hall.\u201d She sobs again as he pulls her close, one hand gentle on the back of her neck, the other flat at the small of her back. Bending his head to hers, he murmurs something I can\u2019t decipher, and she nods. They turn, his arm around her, and walk to his door. They go inside.</p><p>I pull back around the corner and walk to Graham\u2019s room, scrolling through the photos I\u2019ve just taken, making sure each one is clear.</p><p>This may be the most underhanded thing I\u2019ve ever done, and the guilt is a bit crushing. I console myself with the knowledge that Reid really does seem to care about her. He\u2019ll take care of her well enough. For a little while.</p><p>Pushing Emma\u2019s tears from my mind, I focus on the goal at hand. My mother used to be fond of archaic sayings like: Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket and You can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs and I\u2019m always walking on eggshells around you. The last time she declared one of these I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the damned egg wisdom? Is this all You can take the girl off the farm...\u201d reminding her of her hog-slopping, chicken-chasing, Neiman Marcus-free past. She never said anything about eggs again.</p><p>Now, for some unfathomable reason, those clich\u00e9s are pouring into my head\u2014because my eggs are all in one basket. And I just broke them all to make one giant-ass omelet. And every step to Graham\u2019s room is on eggshells, because this has to work. This has to work.</p><p>I\u2019m right for him.</p><p>I knock on his door and he opens it with a smile, which fades a bit when he sees me. My heart falters. He was hoping for Emma. I drink in the jealousy because it obliterates any feeling of remorse. His head angles the tiniest bit. \u201cBrooke?\u201d he says. I push myself to stand taller and look him in the eye with an expression of pity.</p><p>\u201cGraham. I have... something to show you.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move from the doorway. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I indicate his room. \u201cCan we go inside, please? I need to show you in private.\u201d</p><p>He frowns, noting that I\u2019m holding nothing but my phone, and stands back so I can enter.</p><p>I perch on the edge of his bed and pat the space next to me. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>He sits, still frowning. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s about damned time, I think. \u201cIt\u2019s about Emma. And... Reid.\u201d His frown deepens and I pull up the photos on my phone. \u201cI was going to get some ice, so I could chill a little Patron. I overheard them in the hall, whispering. And when I looked around the corner...\u201d I hand him my phone, with the first photo pulled up.</p><p>He scrolls through them, slowly. One. Two. Three. Four. And again. And again. He hands my phone back to me, silent. A wild pulse vibrates at the base of his throat, and he\u2019s so quiet I\u2019m afraid to breathe.</p><p>\u201cGraham\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be alone, Brooke.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>I swallow. The key to this working is no confrontation, no communication between them, just like last fall. \u201cI can\u2019t leave you alone, Graham.\u201d I place my hand on his arm, carefully. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk. But I\u2019m not leaving you alone with this.\u201d</p><p>Covering his eyes with both hands, he lies back on the bed, knees still bent at the end, feet on the floor. I lean next to him without touching him, prop myself beside him on my elbow as he inhales, exhales, inhales, exhales. Finally, his hands drop and stares at the ceiling. He\u2019s not crying. He doesn\u2019t look angry. His face is nearly devoid of expression, as though someone took an eraser to it. Except his eyes. In his eyes, thoughts are rolling like a searchlight, scanning dark corners. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I reach and lightly turn his face towards me. \u201cGraham,\u201d I say, and then I lean down and kiss him.</p><p>REID</p><p>I take her to the loveseat, not the bed. We sink into it, and she\u2019s boneless and crying, easy to pull into my arms, onto my lap. Sobbing, she curls into the smallest possible Emma, her face turned to my chest as I hold her. She\u2019s still wearing the goddess dress, barefoot and so undeniably lovely. My fingertips whisper over her back, her skin warm and soft.</p><p>At the outset, I thought this was simple. Not necessarily simple in execution, but simple in potential conclusions. Brooke would seduce Graham, and I would reap the benefit when Emma needed comfort and a shoulder to cry on. And here, literally in my lap, sits my hoped-for conclusion.</p> <p>It\u2019s the execution I\u2019m having issue with.</p><p>I fully assumed Brooke would succeed in seducing Graham, but that has not been the case. The fake phone call was, for some reason, a deception I can\u2019t slip past as easily as I\u2019d like. Thanks to Brooke\u2019s clever scam, Emma and Graham each believe the other is cheating. And having exclusive knowledge of the entire scheme makes me an accessory to purposefully breaking Emma\u2019s heart. As my father would say in closing arguments\u2014there is no other verdict to be reached.</p><p>I know how this feels\u2014to think you love someone, to think you\u2019re loved in return, only to be slammed breathless by betrayal. Brooke did that to me.</p><p>Absently stroking her, I notice that she\u2019s grown quieter, still dragging in shuddering breaths. I grab a tissue box off the side table, pull a few tissues out and hand them to her. She blows her nose and dabs at her eyes, which somehow starts the whole process over again. It\u2019s a full ten minutes before she\u2019s calm.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d I say, the sound of my voice like the crack of a rifle. An alarm is going off in my head, telling me not to say what I\u2019m about to say. I ignore it. \u201cLast fall, you never asked me about Brooke, or the pregnancy. You never asked if there were extenuating circumstances, or how I felt at the time, or if I wished I\u2019d made a better decision.\u201d</p> <p>Her tears start to flow again, but she says nothing.</p><p>I close my eyes, inhale the familiar herbal scent of her shampoo, memorize the feel of her in my arms. I can\u2019t say I love this girl. But I know someone who might. \u201cYou need to ask the questions this time, Emma.\u201d My voice is soft and low.</p><p>She looks up at me, silent, and I\u2019m staring back. Amazingly, her eyes are trusting, and I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t deserve her trust. I can\u2019t and won\u2019t tell her everything.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Her voice is raw, her face streaked with tears, and she has never, in my presence, been more vulnerable.</p><p>I press my lips to her temple, her cheek, the corner of her mouth, and her eyes close. She doesn\u2019t protest. Fucking hell, it would be so easy. So easy. It\u2019s been ten, maybe fifteen minutes. Graham may or may not have succumbed to Brooke\u2019s lies and misleading photos. I\u2019m positive she\u2019s pulled out all the stops. As much animosity as there is between us, I\u2019d have a difficult time refusing her under those circumstances\u2014and Graham has naively trusted her for years.</p><p>\u201cGo. Ask him the questions you need to ask. Now. Before I change my mind.\u201d Cupping her face in my palm and pressing another tissue into her hand, I add, \u201cAnd if you need to come back, come back. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 32</p><p>GRAHAM</p><p>Brooke hasn\u2019t kissed me in two years\u2014not since the one drunken endeavor that went nowhere, which we both pretend never happened. I\u2019m not counting the kisses along my jaw a week ago. Maybe I should.</p><p>I am numb. Lying motionless under her practiced hands and mouth, there\u2019s nothing but the memory of kissing Emma, just a few hours ago. Before she entered Reid\u2019s room, with his arm around her. It\u2019s like last fall all over again except much, much worse. My heart squeezes so tight I think it might stop beating. For the barest second, I don\u2019t care if it does.</p><p>And then the shock begins to fade. When my brain begins to power up, it does so sluggishly, like a cold engine that might or might not catch and turn over. I register the fact that Brooke is kissing me, and that I\u2019m sort of responding, on autopilot. Taking her by the shoulders, I push her away, gently, and sit up.</p><p>She clutches my arms, moving onto my lap, and the sensation is like having a tub of ice water dumped over me. Clarity rushes in.</p><p>Brooke sent the photo of Reid and Emma kissing last fall, taken with her phone. She sent a photo of me, asleep with my arms around her, to Reid. Now, the current batch. Again, on her phone. Something more nags at the edge of my consciousness. I shove her away and stand.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to confront them.\u201d Brooke holds onto my wrist as though she can anchor me here, in this room. \u201cMaybe the studio edicts just made it too difficult. All of that onscreen chemistry they have\u2014it just translated too easily into real life.\u201d</p> <p>I close my eyes because all I see with them open is red. Everything, everything awash with red, like a fine spray of blood across a window pane. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, my eyes flashing open. She blinks, hard.</p><p>She moves in front of me, grabbing and holding both of my hands, which still feel numb. \u201cGraham, stay here with me. I\u2019ll make you forget her. I\u2019m right for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say again, louder, and then I look down and see the naked hunger on her dazed, upturned face and the needling detail clicks into place in my brain. \u201cWhere\u2019s your ice bucket?\u201d</p><p>She frowns, shakes her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were getting ice. Where\u2019s your ice bucket?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen, shift away and come back to mine in the space of two seconds. \u201cI\u2014I forgot it... Graham\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brooke pleads that she doesn\u2019t want me to get hurt any further. Ignoring her, I focus on a building resolve: I have no idea how long Emma has been with Reid, or what they\u2019re doing, but by God, if she\u2019s disregarding every murmured longing of my heart and soul, she\u2019s going to do it to my goddamned face. I leave my room and head for Reid\u2019s, Brooke following. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s still talking. I can\u2019t hear anything over the monster roaring in my head.</p><p>At the intersection of the hallways, I collide with Emma, grabbing her shoulders, hard, unable to slow quickly enough to avoid plowing into her. I\u2019ve lifted her and propelled her forward a yard by the time we come to a stop. My first thought: her face is a wreck.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen her cry. I\u2019ve witnessed her grief over memories of losing her mother, and her misery over a spat with Emily last fall\u2014tears I\u2019d thought were over losing Reid. But nothing did this to her. She\u2019s lost and hollowed out.</p><p>Her eyes dart over my shoulder, where, I assume, Brooke has come up behind me.</p><p>\u201cDid you... did you sleep with her?\u201d Emma says, voice hoarse and breaking, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>I feel as though she\u2019s slapped me. \u201cNo. No! Why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>The anguish in her eyes is unbearable. \u201cI heard her talking on the phone to someone... about it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him? You went into his room, Emma\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cJust now. Ten, fifteen minutes ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I heard her say...\u201d She closes her eyes, unable to look at me. \u201cI heard her say you were the best she\u2019s ever...\u201d Releasing one sob, her hands fly up to cover her face.</p><p>I tug her to me as everything begins to fall into place and fit, like footage of something breaking into hundreds of pieces, played in reverse. \u201cEmma.\u201d I pull her hands from her eyes and hold them. \u201cYou went into his room because you thought I\u2019d betrayed you?\u201d I feel sick. I can\u2019t look at Brooke or even think about her proximity, because I have never and will never in my life be physically violent with a woman, but right now I want to hurt her. \u201cDid you\u2014ah, God, I don\u2019t want to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened. He told me to come ask you about... about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Brooke says, storming around us. My eyes narrow on her as she charges around the corner and bangs on Reid\u2019s door. And then I just don\u2019t give a shit about her or what she\u2019s doing.</p><p>Emma starts to tremble, biting her lip so hard to keep from crying that I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll split it. A door across the hall creaks open an inch. No telling how many people are glued to their peepholes. Screw this.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I take her under my arm and lead her to my room.</p><p>Once inside, the rest of the world locked out, I hold her close and murmur the words I could have blurted out the first time I saw her, because I fell in love with her in those few seconds, months ago. I just didn\u2019t know it yet.</p><p>Her arms loop around my neck. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she answers, her voice raw from the battle we\u2019ve just waged, and won.</p><p>I sweep her up and we fall onto the bed, and I kiss her so hard that I know I must be bruising her mouth, but she\u2019s responding in kind, our teeth tapping against each other, our fingers digging into flesh and scraping skin and pulling at the maddening layers of clothing between us. I\u2019m trying to slow down, to savor her and this moment, but I need this, need her, need us, too much. I rise above her. \u201cLook at me, Emma.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are full, the lids heavy. \u201cGraham,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>\u201cI need you to hear me.\u201d Cradling her head in my hands, thumbs sweeping her tears away, I stare into her eyes. \u201cI belong to you. There is no one else. All I want is to be where you are.\u201d</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d I say, touching his face.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice is husky and strums some deep new chord\u2014the kind you feel more than you hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d I repeat, whispering into his mouth. \u201cAnd I belong to you, too.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me, restraint evident in the tremor along his arms, under my palms. He closes his eyes and rests his forehead against mine. \u201cI want to read this right, Emma. I don\u2019t want you to feel pressured by the emotion of this night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham.\u201d I wait until his dark eyes open, his body motionless and pressing mine into the mattress with very little between us. \u201cI know what I want. And I\u2019m not nearly as principled as you are. Because if I have to pressure you right now, I will.\u201d I run my hands down his back, sliding my fingertips lower, skimming under the minimal fabric remaining between us. Arching into him, I watch his resolve travel from control to something altogether opposite.</p><p>When his mouth crashes down on mine again, I know I won\u2019t have to say another word. His decision made, he begins to slow everything down\u2014every kiss, every movement tender and careful\u2014but his apprehension is gone. The pace he sets is excruciating and perfect, allowing me time to realize, over and over, exactly what I want him to do seconds before he does it.</p><p>Sometime later, our hands are intertwined just above my head and he\u2019s kissing me gently. At my sigh, he whispers, \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d His lips are soft against my neck, and I tilt my head towards my shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Smiling, my eyes close as he ignites my desire for him all over again. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to hurt a little, you know,\u201d I whisper back. \u201cThis time.\u201d</p><p>He props himself on one elbow, releasing my hands to stroke his fingers over the side of my face. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can be cavalier about it. I can\u2019t stand the thought of hurting you.\u201d</p><p>I mimic his caress, my fingers cataloguing the contrasts between us\u2014the short hair at his temple, the closely cropped sideburns, the faintly rough expanse of stubble across his jaw. His concern is unwarranted. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever felt this whole. \u201cIt will never hurt again. Or so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles softly and shakes his head.</p> <p>I clear my throat. \u201cSo... do you have another... erm...\u201d My face warms, but timidity is silly at this point. \u201cBecause Emily made sure I came to LA with a ginormous box of them stuffed into my luggage, which I didn\u2019t know about until I unpacked...\u201d</p><p>I was so, so grateful that I hadn\u2019t been selected for a random luggage search at the airport on this trip when I unearthed the box of condoms that had stowed away in my suitcase. A sticky note was attached, reading: Happy \u201cPREMIERE\u201d!!! luv, em.</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow up and locks his lips together, trying not to laugh at my pointless embarrassment. \u201cAre you suggesting we take this celebration to your room?\u201d</p><p>At his words, I imagine confetti falling all around the bed. \u201cIs it a celebration?\u201d</p><p>His fingers journey down my side, keeping me close as he lifts his weight from me and lies on his side, positioning us face to face. \u201cHell yes it is.\u201d</p> <p>My hands curl against his chest. \u201cWhat are we celebrating?\u201d</p><p>Closing his eyes, he presses his face to mine and hums a warm breath past my ear. \u201cThat we will be doing this\u2014\u201d he skims my face with his and then kisses me until I\u2019m breathless with want \u201c\u2014for the rest of the night, and most of tomorrow, and however long you\u2019ll consent to be mine.\u201d</p><p>When I can breathe again, I ask how long he\u2019s got.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Sixty, seventy years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that will have to do,\u201d I laugh, pushing him onto his back.</p><p>Chapter 33</p> <p>Brooke</p><p>The sun\u2019s not quite up when I check out. No one comments on the fact that I\u2019m wearing my sunglasses. Not the bellhop, not the front desk, not the valet. They all assume I\u2019m masking the hangover I would welcome in place of this aching emptiness.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to get Reid to open the door last night. He had the gall to appear utterly indifferent, standing back to allow me into his room as though I\u2019d rapped politely rather than cursing and banging on it with both fists. As though I was expected. Which I guess I was.</p><p>\u201cWhat the goddamned hell, Reid? You lying bastard!\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted with amusement and my hands became hard fists at my side. The door shut behind me and he followed as I stormed into his suite. \u201cAre you sure you want to fling that particular insult, Brooke?\u201d</p><p>I hit him. Or I would have, if he hadn\u2019t dodged so that it barely glanced off of his shoulder, harmless. I tried again. Grabbing my wrist, he just shook his head like he was sort of sorry for me, but not really. I swung my other fist at him and he caught that one, too.</p><p>\u201cIt was a house of cards, Brooke. You had to know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her. You told her to go talk to him!\u201d</p> <p>He peered at me, still holding my wrists. \u201cI know you think I\u2019ve got no morals, but I seem to have at least one you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I tried to yank my arms free but he held them fast. I knew what he was going to say. I didn\u2019t want to hear him say it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied to get a girl into bed with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I sneered, \u201cbecause you\u2019re the almighty Reid fucking Alexander and you don\u2019t have to lie to get whatever girl you want. How well did that work with her, though? She didn\u2019t want you.\u201d</p><p>There. He still had my hands imprisoned but he looked like I\u2019d slapped him. Eyes widened. Mouth slightly ajar. He recovered too quickly for my liking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d His expression transformed from shock to contempt right in front of me. He didn\u2019t just release my wrists, he threw them down. Turned and walked to the minibar. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want me.\u201d He grabbed a bottle and twisted the cap, leaning a hip against the bar. \u201cJust like he didn\u2019t want you. The difference is, I\u2019m not willing to lie to get her, or I\u2019d have told her last September that I was falling in love with her. How fast would she have fallen for that? How persuasive do you think I could have been?\u201d His mouth lifted on one side. So charming. So beautiful. Damn him. She\u2019d have melted on the spot, and don\u2019t I know it.</p><p>My body was on fire. I hated him, standing there like he was better than me. Again. \u201cYou say you\u2019ve never lied to get a girl? You lied to me. You said you loved me.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me a long minute. Drank the contents of the bottle down, his eyes never leaving mine. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Did what? Did lie to me? Did love me? Does it even matter now? I will never ask him.</p><p>\u201cI hate you, Reid.\u201d</p><p>He laughed\u2014no amusement, just insolence. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>That was when the reality of what had just occurred hit me. What I\u2019d done. What I\u2019d lost. I\u2019d made an all-out play for Graham, and it had failed. Crash-and-burn failed. But it was more than that. After years of friendship between us, I\u2019d betrayed that relationship. Completely. Betrayed him. And now, he knew it.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d My legs collapsed under me and I sank to the floor, my nails anchoring into the carpet. \u201cOh my God.\u201d I\u2019d lied to him. Tricked him. The full impact of what I\u2019d just lost crushed me. Our friendship was over. I\u2019d been so sure I was prepared to gamble it away on the prospect of getting more. Such an absurd, senseless risk. I started sobbing and couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Reid heaved a sigh and came closer. Squatted down in front of me. \u201cGive him some time. Maybe he\u2019ll forgive and forget.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe\u2019ll never speak to me again.\u201d</p><p>Reid had no answer to this. I struggled to stand, ignoring the offer of his hand. \u201cBrooke, I just couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. Please stop talking.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to blame Reid, but I couldn\u2019t. Graham had already figured something out when he left his room. The conclusion might have been different had Emma not been on her way to him at the same time. If they hadn\u2019t met in the hallway. If Graham had been the one to slam his fist against Reid\u2019s door instead of me. If Reid had taken her to his bed instead of obeying the one sliver of ethical principle in his body. But no, Graham would have forgiven her, no matter what, because the deceit was all me.</p><p>My friendship with Graham was over the moment he trusted Emma over every bit of circumstantial evidence I could throw in front of him. The moment he left his room. The moment he saw her tear-streaked face.</p><p>Reid\u2019s lips flattened and he didn\u2019t say another word. I was grateful for that. But he could afford to be generous, couldn\u2019t he? He was no worse off than he was when we started, while I\u2019d just lost the best friend I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>REID</p><p>Jesus, what a night. I\u2019m a bit hungover this morning. Or this afternoon. Whatever the hell it is now. Drinking myself into a stupor alone isn\u2019t generally my thing, but the confrontation with Brooke called for a certain level of private oblivion.</p><p>The valet will deliver my car to the back exit. The paparazzi are aware of that alternative way out, of course, but it\u2019s a tighter squeeze, with more vegetation providing cover, making the fine art of hounding people for photos more challenging. With my personal bodyguards and the hotel security standing watch, it\u2019s an easier escape. I\u2019m not in the mood to be hassled or adored\u2014which often feel like the same thing.</p><p>The door to Brooke\u2019s room is propped open, a housekeeping cart in the doorway. I\u2019m not surprised she checked out early, maybe even right after she left my room. There was no reason for her to hang around. I thought she was prepared to deal with the consequences if her play for Graham didn\u2019t work. After last night, I\u2019m not sure she even considered the consequences.</p><p>A Do Not Disturb tag hangs on Emma\u2019s door latch.</p><p>Pulling into the driveway, I scroll the window down and punch in the security code. Wait for the heavy wrought iron gate to open. Pull in and park the car that bores me. Walk into the house, so familiar that I could jog through it blindfolded without running into anything.</p><p>The hum of a vacuum comes from Mom\u2019s room, along with the maid\u2019s voice\u2014singing along with her iPod. Her vocals are bookended by the drone of lawn service equipment out back. The rest of the place is quiet. I\u2019m sure Dad\u2019s at work, given that he practically lives there, and Mom must be out.</p><p>Just as I toss my bag on the bed, my cell starts playing Just the Way You Are. Fishing it from the deep front pocket of my jeans, I check the display needlessly; I knew it was Emma by the second note. She asked me a couple of weeks ago why I\u2019d kept that song as her ringtone all these months. I just shrugged and said it fits her.</p><p>\u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d I clear my throat, wondering at her calling me, in view of the tag on her door this morning.</p><p>\u201cI stopped by your room to talk to you, but you\u2019d already checked out.\u201d Through the raspy evidence of last night\u2019s tears, she sounds content. Happy.</p><p>\u201cDo you need something from me, Emma?\u201d My careful tone doesn\u2019t match the terse words. I shove my opposite hand into my pocket to keep from punching a wall or throwing something.</p><p>\u201cNo... but I want to thank you. And tell you that I was wrong. There is more to you, Reid. You just never let me see it.\u201d She sighs. \u201cNot like you did last night.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. It figures that in giving her up, I earned her approval. \u201cEmma, last night was just a confirmation of your effect on me.\u201d</p><p>Tonight, I\u2019ll go out and get wasted with John, and tomorrow night, Quinton. Sometime during the next week, I\u2019ll ditch the Lotus, buy a new Porsche and squeeze a meeting with my PR guy and manager between hangovers and social obligations. And before filming starts this fall, Tadd and I will engage in an exhaustive tour of Chicago nightclubs.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe that. Evidently, there\u2019s more to you than you know, too.\u201d</p><p>I drop onto the end of my bed, rub my palm back and forth on my thigh, like I\u2019m scrubbing away a stain. \u201cWell. Don\u2019t tell anyone. I\u2019ve got a rep to maintain, you know.\u201d</p><p>She laughs softly and I picture the roll of her eyes, her lingering smile. \u201cThis is where I jokingly say you\u2019re hopeless. But you\u2019re not.\u201d Her voice catches, and my hand curls into a fist atop my leg.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll be happy, Emma. That he\u2019ll be good to you.\u201d My voice is gruff with conflicting emotions, but I don\u2019t care if she hears it.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She sighs. \u201cAnd he is.\u201d Ah, there\u2019s that trace of satisfaction in her voice again\u2014a jagged bit of torture she\u2019s unaware of inflicting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d I murmur, caught somewhere between meaning it and not. \u201cWhat I said about coming back, if you need to\u2014that didn\u2019t expire last night.\u201d As certain as Brooke was that she was right for Graham, I\u2019m more sure that I\u2019m not right for Emma. But that awareness wouldn\u2019t keep me from taking her if she showed up at my door. I\u2019m not as noble as she thinks I am. \u201cGoodbye, Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d John answers when I ring his cell.</p><p>\u201cNot happening. And I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d It\u2019s not even 5:00 p.m. and I\u2019ve just downed a Jack and Coke. Maybe there\u2019s a luxury rehab place with a mother-son option. But rehab would never work; I\u2019d have to actually quit drinking while I was there.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool, man. No problemo. What about the Porsche? You still trading up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Soon as possible.\u201d Dad already cashed out one of my investments; the money is sitting in my account. All I have to do is choose a car.</p><p>\u201cRest up, bro. We\u2019re going out tonight. Time to get you back to your pointless, pleasure-driven life.\u201d That sums it up. Back to the clubs, the parties, the hookups. New car. New project to train for this summer and film next fall.</p><p>\u201cIs that all it is\u2014a pointless, pleasure-driven life?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cShit, Reid. I don\u2019t know. If you\u2019re lucky. It\u2019s either that or aspire to be some Dark Lord asshole like my father, with a boring-as-shit trophy wife like Elise, who has nothing to do but work out, get plastic surgery and have sex with my dad. I\u2019d fucking kill myself if I was her.\u201d</p> <p>My parents: Dad works, Mom drinks. Besides that, what? I think I\u2019m nothing like them\u2014as though my career and celebrity will make my existence more significant, but that\u2019s bullshit and I know it. \u201cGuess I\u2019m feeling introspective.\u201d</p><p>John makes a sound of dismissal. \u201cDude, forget that shit. Talk about pointless.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what it will take to forget Emma Pierce\u2019s belief that there\u2019s more to me.</p><p>Maybe I don\u2019t want to forget. </p> </body></html>"]
