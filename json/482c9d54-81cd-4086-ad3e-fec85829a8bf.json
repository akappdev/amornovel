The concentration required to learn a new stitch or technique is good for both our hands and our brains.</p><p>\u2014Bev Galeskas, Fiber Trends Patterns and U.S. distributor of Naturally New Zealand Yarns. www.f ibertrends.com</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p> <p>Wednesday morning, a not-so-perfect June day, I turned over the Open sign at my yarn store on Blossom Street. Standing in the doorway I breathed in the sweet scent of day lilies, gladiolas, roses and lavender from Susannah\u2019s Garden, the f lower shop next door.</p><p>It was the beginning of summer, and although the sky was overcast and rain threatened to fall at any moment, the sun shone brightly in my heart. (My husband, Brad, always laughs when I say things like that. But I don\u2019t care. As a woman who\u2019s survived cancer not once but twice, I feel entitled to the occasional sentimental remark. Especially today...) I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, enjoying the earlymorning peace. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyplace more beautiful than Seattle in the summer. All the f lowers spilling out of Susannah\u2019s Garden are one of the benef its. The array of colors, as well as the heady perfume drifting in my direction, makes me so glad A Good Yarn is located where it is. Whiskers, my shop cat, as Brad calls him, ambled across the hardwood f loor and leaped into the window display, nestling among the skeins of pastel yarns. He takes up residence there most days and has long been a neighborhood favorite. The apartment upstairs is an extra storeroom for yarn at the moment; perhaps one day I\u2019ll rent it out again but that isn\u2019t in the plans yet. The French Caf\u00e9 across the street was already busy, as it is every morning. The windows were f illed with pastries, breads and croissants warm from the oven, and their delectable aroma added to the scents I associate with summer on Blossom Street. Alix Turner is usually there by f ive to bake many of these wonderful temptations. She\u2019s one of my dearest friends\u2014and was among my f irst customers. I\u2019m so proud of everything she\u2019s accomplished in the past few years. It\u2019s fair to say she reinvented her life\u2014with a little help from her friends. She has an education and a career now, and she\u2019s married to a man who seems completely right for her.</p><p>Blossom Street Books down the street was ready for business, too. Anne Marie Roche and her staff often leave the front door open as a welcoming gesture, inviting those who wander past to come inside and browse. She and her daughter, Ellen, would be coming home from Paris later today.</p><p>Nearly every afternoon Ellen walks their Yorkie past the window so Whiskers and Baxter can stare f iercely at each other. Ellen insists it\u2019s all for show, that the cat and dog are actually good friends but don\u2019t want any of us to know that. I grinned at Whiskers because I couldn\u2019t resist sharing my joy and excitement\u2014even with the cat. In fact, I wanted to tell the whole world my news. Yesterday, we found out that we\u2019d been approved for adoption. I hadn\u2019t yet shared this information with anyone, including my sister, Margaret. We\u2019ve been through the interviews, the home test and f ingerprinting. And last night we heard. We\u2019re going to adopt a baby.</p><p>Because of my cancer, pregnancy is out of the question. While the ability to conceive has been taken from me, the desire for a baby hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s like an ache that never quite goes away. As much as possible I\u2019ve tried to hide this from Brad. Whenever thoughts of what cancer has stolen from me enter my head, I try hard to counter them by remembering all the blessings I\u2019ve received in my life. I want to celebrate every day, savor every minute, without resentment or regret.</p> <p>I have so much for which to be grateful. I\u2019m alive and cancerfree. I\u2019m married to a man I adore. His son, Cody, now nine years old, has become my son, too. And I have a successful business, one that brings me great pleasure and satisfaction. When I f irst opened A Good Yarn, it was my way of shouting to the world that I refused to let cancer rob me of anything else. I was going to live and I was going to do it without the constant threat of illness and death. I was determined to bask in the sunshine. I still am. So A Good Yarn was the start of my new life. Within a year of opening the store, I met Brad Goetz and we were married the following spring. Because of what I\u2019d been through in my teens and again in my twenties, I didn\u2019t have a lot of experience with men or relationships. At f irst, Brad\u2019s love terrif ied me. Then I learned not to reject something good just because I was afraid of its loss. I learned that I could trust this man\u2014and myself. How blessed I am to be loved by him and Cody. Each and every day I thank God for the two men in my life. Even with all I have, my arms ached to hold a baby. Our baby. Brad, who knows me so well, understood my need. After discussing the subject for weeks on end, after vacillating, weighing the pros and cons, we\u2019d reached our decision. Yes, we were going to adopt.</p><p>The catalyst for all this happened when Anne Marie Roche adopted eight-year-old Ellen.</p><p>I realized the wait for a newborn might be lengthy but we were both prepared for that. Although we\u2019d be thrilled with an infant of either sex, I secretly longed for a little girl. I heard the back door close and turned to see my sister, Margaret. She\u2019s worked with me almost from the f irst day I opened the shop. Although we\u2019re as different as any two sisters could be, we\u2019ve become close. Margaret is a good balance for me, ever practical and pragmatic, and I think I balance her, too, since I\u2019m much more optimistic and given to occasional whimsy.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d I greeted her cheerfully, unable to disguise my happiness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to pour,\u201d she muttered, taking off her raincoat and hanging it in the back storeroom.</p><p>My sister tends to see the negative. The glass would always be half-empty to Margaret. Or completely empty\u2014if not shattered on the f loor. Over the years I\u2019ve grown accustomed to her attitude and simply ignore it.</p> <p>When she\u2019d f inished removing her coat, Margaret stared at me, then frowned. \u201cWhy are you so happy?\u201d she demanded. \u201cAnybody can see we\u2019re about to have a downpour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Happy?\u201d There wasn\u2019t much point in trying to hold back my news, even though I knew Margaret was the one person who wouldn\u2019t understand my pleasure. She\u2019d disapprove and would have no qualms about imparting her opinion. It\u2019s her pessimistic nature, I suppose, and the fact that she worries about me, although she\u2019d never admit that.</p><p>Margaret continued to glare. \u201cYou\u2019re grinning from ear to ear.\u201d</p><p>I made busy work at the cash register in order to avoid eye contact. I might as well tell her, although I dreaded her response.</p><p>\u201cBrad and I have applied for adoption,\u201d I blurted out, unable to stop myself. \u201cAnd our application\u2019s been accepted.\u201d</p><p>A startled silence followed.</p><p>\u201cI know you think we\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d I rushed to add.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Margaret walked slowly toward me.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to say anything,\u201d I told her. Just once I wanted Margaret to be happy for me, without doubts and objections and concerns. \u201cYour silence said it all.\u201d</p><p>Margaret joined me at the counter next to the cash register. She seemed to sense that her reaction had hurt me. \u201cI\u2019m only wondering if adoption\u2019s a wise choice for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d I began, sighing as I spoke. \u201cBrad and I know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Although Margaret hadn\u2019t said it openly, I could guess what concerned her most. She was afraid the cancer would return. I\u2019m well aware of the possibility and have been ever since its recurrence ten years ago. It was a serious consideration and one that neither Brad nor I took lightly.</p><p>\u201cBrad agrees?\u201d My sister sounded skeptical.</p><p>\u201cOf course he agrees! I\u2019d never go against his wishes.\u201d</p><p>Margaret still didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cYou\u2019re sure this is what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I was adamant. Sometimes that\u2019s the only way to reach her. \u201cBrad knows the risks as well as I do. You don\u2019t need to spell it out, Margaret. I understand why you\u2019re afraid for me, but I\u2019m through with living in fear.\u201d</p><p>Margaret\u2019s eyes revealed her apprehensions. She studied me and after a moment asked, \u201cWhat if the adoption agency doesn\u2019t f ind you a child?\u201d</p><p>This was something Brad and I had discussed and it could certainly happen. I shrugged. \u201cNothing ventured, nothing gained. We\u2019ll take the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want an infant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I pictured a newborn, wrapped in a soft pink blanket, gently placed in my waiting arms. I held on to the image, allowing it to bring me comfort, to f ill me with hope. To my surprise Margaret didn\u2019t immediately voice another objection. After a thoughtful minute or two, she said in low tones,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be a good mother...you already are.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure my jaw fell open. The shock of Margaret\u2019s endorsement was almost more than I could take in. This was as close as Margaret had ever come to bestowing her approval on anything regarding my personal life. No, that wasn\u2019t fair. She\u2019d been partially responsible for Brad and me getting back together when I\u2019d pushed him away\u2014a reconciliation that led directly to our marriage.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered and touched her arm. Margaret made some gruff, unintelligible reply and moved to the table at the back of the store. She pulled out a chair, sat down and took out her crocheting.</p><p>\u201cI put up the poster you made for our new class,\u201d I told her, doing my best to conceal the emotion that crept into my voice. The last thing I\u2019d expected from Margaret had been her blessing, and I was deeply touched by her words.</p><p>She acknowledged my comment with a nod.</p><p>The idea for our new knitting class had been Margaret\u2019s. \u201cKnit to Quit,\u201d she called it, and I loved her suggestion. Since opening the yarn store five years earlier, I\u2019d noticed how many different reasons my customers\u2014mostly women but also a few men\u2014had for learning to knit. Some came looking for a distraction or an escape, a focus to take their minds off some habit or preoccupation. Others were there because of a passion for the craft and still others hoped to express their love or creativity\u2014or both\u2014with something handmade.</p><p>Four years ago, Courtney Pulanski, a high school girl, had signed up for my sock-knitting class, which contributed to her successful attempt to lose weight. Hard to believe Courtney was a college senior now and still a knitter. More importantly, she\u2019d kept off the weight she lost that summer.</p><p>\u201cI hope Alix takes the hint,\u201d Margaret said, cutting into my thoughts.</p><p>I missed the connection. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix is smoking again.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if I\u2019d missed that. She smelled of cigarettes every time she walked into the store. There was no disguising the way smoke clung to her clothes and her hair. And yet Alix seemed to think no one noticed, although of course everyone did.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is she\u2019d like to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she should sign up for the class,\u201d Margaret said emphatically. \u201cShe could use it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How typical of Margaret to feel she knew what was best for everyone. Currently, though, I was more amused than annoyed by her take-charge attitude.</p><p>My f irst customer of the morning\u2014a woman I\u2019d never met before\u2014stepped into the shop and f ifteen minutes later, I rang up a hundred-dollar yarn sale. A promising start to the day.</p><p>As soon as the door closed, Margaret set aside her project, an afghan for our mother who resides at a nearby assisted-living complex. \u201cYou know what\u2019s going to happen, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappen with what?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cThis adoption thing.\u201d</p><p>I froze. I should\u2019ve known Margaret wouldn\u2019t leave the subject alone. At least not until she\u2019d cast a net of dire predictions. I understood that this impulse was one she couldn\u2019t resist, just as I understood that it was motivated by her protectiveness toward me. But I didn\u2019t need to hear it right now.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, hoping my irritation didn\u2019t show.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to a social worker yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course.\u201d I\u2019d spoken to Anne Marie, and she\u2019d recommended Evelyn Boyle, the social worker who\u2019d been assigned to Ellen and had handled her adoption. Anne Marie and Ellen f it so perfectly together that their story had inspired me to look beyond my fears. So Brad and I had approached Evelyn. Margaret shook her head, which annoyed me even more.</p> <p>\u201cAnne Marie gave me the phone number of the woman who helped her adopt Ellen,\u201d I said.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s brows came together in consternation and she tightened her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked, trying to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s too late anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis social worker deals with foster kids, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d I knew so, but didn\u2019t see how that was relevant.</p><p>\u201cWhy should it matter?\u201d</p><p>My sister rolled her eyes, as though it should be obvious.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s got children in her case f iles,\u201d Margaret said with exaggerated patience. \u201cShe probably has lots of kids and nowhere to place them. Mark my words, she\u2019ll f ind a reason to leave some needy child with you. And not a baby, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d I said pointedly, \u201cBrad and I are going to adopt an infant. This social worker, Evelyn, is helping us through the process, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Margaret didn\u2019t respond for several minutes. Just when it seemed she was prepared to drop the subject, she added, \u201cFinding an infant might not be that easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d I agreed, unwilling to argue. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see what the adoption agency has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be expensive, what with lawyers and everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrad and I will cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d</p><p>Margaret looked away, frowning slightly, as if she needed to consider every negative aspect of this process. \u201cThere are private adoption agencies, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>I did know about them, but it made better f inancial sense to approach the state agency first.</p><p>\u201cWhat about adopting from outside the country?\u201d</p><p>Margaret was apparently trying to be helpful, but I wasn\u2019t convinced I should let down my guard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re holding that in reserve,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI hear it\u2019s even more expensive than private adoptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, it\u2019s another option to investigate....\u201d</p><p>Margaret\u2019s shoulders rose in a deep sigh. \u201cAre you going to tell Mom?\u201d</p><p>With our mother\u2019s fragile health and declining mental condition it wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d considered doing. \u201cProbably not...\u201d</p><p>Margaret nodded, her mouth a tight line.</p><p>\u201cMom has a hard enough time remembering that Cody\u2019s my stepson,\u201d I reminded her. On our last visit she\u2019d asked copious questions about the \u201cyoung man\u201d I\u2019d brought with me.</p><p>My sister swallowed visibly. \u201cMom didn\u2019t recognize Julia when we went to see her a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>I felt a jolt of pain\u2014for Margaret, for her daughter, Julia, for Mom. This was the f irst time Margaret had mentioned it. Our mother\u2019s mental state had declined rapidly over the past two years and I suspected that in a little while she wouldn\u2019t recognize me anymore, either. Margaret and I shared responsibility for checking in on her and making sure she was well and contented. These days my sister and I had taken over the parental role, looking after our mother.</p><p>I could pinpoint exactly when that role reversal had taken place. It\u2019d been the day Mom\u2019s neighbor found her unconscious in the garden. She\u2019d collapsed while watering her f lowers. Everything had changed from that moment on. Our mother had ceased to be the woman we\u2019d always known. Living in a care facility now, she was increasingly confused and uncertain. It broke my heart to see Mom struggling so hard to hide her bewilderment at what was happening to her.</p><p>\u201cMom will be happy for you,\u201d Margaret mumbled. \u201cAt some point her mind will clear and she\u2019ll realize you have an infant.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and hoped this was true, although I had my doubts...</p><p>and I knew Margaret did, too.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed before we could discuss it further, and I glanced up at an attractive young woman who\u2019d entered the shop. I hadn\u2019t seen her before.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said, welcoming her with an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded and toyed nervously with the cell phone in her hand. \u201cYes...I saw the notice in the window for the Knit to Quit class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to knit?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo...well, some. I learned years ago but I\u2019ve forgotten. Would this class be too advanced for someone like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll pick it up in no time. I\u2019ll be happy to help you refresh your skills.\u201d I went on to explain that there\u2019d be seven sessions and told her the price of the class. She nodded again. \u201cYou can sign up for the class no matter what you want to quit?\u201d She stared down at the f loor as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She set her bag and cell phone on the counter. \u201cI\u2019d like to pay now.\u201d She handed me a credit card and I read her name\u2014Phoebe Rylander.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our very f irst class member,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cSo the class starts next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sign said Wednesdays from six to eight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m keeping the store open late. It\u2019ll be my f irst night class.\u201d</p><p>I processed her payment and wrote her name on the sign-up sheet. \u201cWhat are you trying to quit?\u201d I asked in a friendly voice.</p><p>\u201cNot what, who,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d Her answer took me by surprise.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man I need to get over,\u201d she said with tears in her eyes. \u201cA man I...once loved.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Phoebe Rylander</p><p>Clark made their breakup far more difficult than it needed to be. Phoebe had just stepped out of A Good Yarn when her cell phone chirped again. She didn\u2019t have to check Caller ID</p><p>to know it was Clark Snowden, her f ianc\u00e9. No...ex-f ianc\u00e9. The man she still loved, despite everything. She\u2019d had no choice except to end their engagement, no matter how much her heart ached. When she thought about what he\u2019d done, she knew she couldn\u2019t allow him to dissuade her again. Not this time. It was f inal. She told herself that nothing he could say or do would change her mind. But soon she\u2019d be walking into an empty condo and it would feel so lonely and isolated that she was afraid her resolve would weaken. This afternoon she\u2019d felt stronger and more in control of her emotions. The knitting class would help, too.</p><p>Knowing what she had to do didn\u2019t make it easy. Clark\u2019s efforts to win her back turned the whole ordeal into an even bigger mess. He\u2019d gone so far as to involve their families. But she couldn\u2019t, she simply couldn\u2019t, let herself give in. Her cell phone continued to make its little chirping noises, announcing his call. If Phoebe didn\u2019t answer, Clark would just leave a message and then try again. She f lipped open her phone. \u201cDon\u2019t call me anymore,\u201d she said emphatically, surprised at the conviction in her voice. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoebe, please...don\u2019t. Let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis conversation is over.\u201d She started to hang up.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe, please, the least you can do is hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClark, I returned your engagement ring. It\u2019s over. We\u2019re through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry and you have every right to be. But if you\u2019d give me five minutes, just five minutes, I could explain everything.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was good\u2014as plenty of juries had discovered. \u201cNo, Clark, I fell for that the f irst time. This is it. I\u2019m done. As of a week ago we are off icially unengaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that! You can\u2019t. You love me and I\u2019m crazy about you.... You know that, Phoebe. You have to know that. I\u2019d never, ever do anything to hurt you. I\u2019d rather die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that was the case, I\u2019d be picking out a coff in for you because you have hurt me, Clark.\u201d Her voice faltered and she hated the fact that she\u2019d shown even this small weakness. Rather than continue the conversation, she closed her cell. Walking at a clipped pace, she hurried down Blossom Street, her vision blurred by tears. At the intersection, she swiped one hand across her cheek, sniff ling despite herself. She\u2019d gone for a walk on her lunch hour and ventured much farther than she normally did. In fact, she\u2019d never set foot on Blossom Street before today. But by now she was late; she had to get back to work. Her boss at Madison Avenue Physical Therapy was understanding, but he wouldn\u2019t appreciate it if she kept a patient waiting.</p><p>When she got to the clinic, Phoebe was breathless. She hadn\u2019t eaten lunch and her stomach was already in knots. Well, there was nothing she could do about that.</p><p>Mrs. Dover was in the clinic\u2019s waiting room as Phoebe rushed in the front door. Her patient lowered the magazine and smiled at Phoebe, who did her best to smile back. Caroline Dover had undergone a complete knee replacement and she had a regularly scheduled appointment at one o\u2019clock every Wednesday. She\u2019d been seeing Phoebe for the past six weeks; they were making progress, although it was slow.</p><p>\u201cCome on back,\u201d Phoebe told the older woman. She hurried ahead of her and drew in a deep breath. It would take a lot of resolve to get through the afternoon.</p><p>By concentrating strictly on her patients, she made it to the end of the day. At f ive-ten, she pulled on her jacket and grabbed her purse, eager to escape. Because she couldn\u2019t resist, she checked her cell phone. Clark had left three messages. Refusing to be swayed, she erased each one without listening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She dared not let herself hear his voice; she was too susceptible. The problem was, she wanted to believe him.... She so badly wanted all of this to go away. That was why she\u2019d impulsively signed up for the knitting class. Knit to Quit. The sign in the yarn shop window had been like a f lashing neon light. If she was going to convince Clark that she was serious\u2014and she was\u2014she\u2019d need a distraction to help her through the next few weeks.</p><p>Her hand tightened on her cell phone. Even as her f ingers pushed the buttons to erase Clark\u2019s messages, she yearned to talk to him. She wanted to be reassured of his love, wanted him to offer some plausible reason that would explain his need to seek out other women. However, there were no reasons. No excuses. Nothing he could say would change what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cDid you and Clark have another spat?\u201d Bill Boyington, her boss, asked as she started out the door.</p><p>The question caught her unawares.</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d Phoebe had done her utmost to remain professional and therefore unemotional all week. She hadn\u2019t revealed to anyone at work that she\u2019d ended her engagement.</p><p>\u201cThere were f lowers delivered for you.\u201d He motioned to the receptionist\u2019s desk.</p><p>Sure enough, a huge f loral arrangement sat on the corner. She wondered how she\u2019d missed seeing it. Orchids, lilies and roses were interspersed among white hydrangeas; obviously Clark had spared no expense. It occurred to her that they were more f itting for a funeral than a reconciliation. But in many ways this was a funeral and Phoebe felt like weeping all over again. Determined to be strong, she squared her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t want them.\u201d</p><p>Bill looked at her oddly.</p><p>\u201cTake them home to Louise,\u201d she suggested, knowing Bill\u2019s wife would enjoy them.</p> <p>Her boss didn\u2019t seem convinced. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he spent two hundred bucks on that.\u201d</p><p>For a second Phoebe was tempted to forgive him. Clark was so determined, so intent on overcoming her resistance. Still, she couldn\u2019t allow even a small crack in her defenses. She shook her head. \u201cI...I don\u2019t want them. Either give them to Louise or throw them away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d Bill asked, frowning as if this was some weird joke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over between Clark and me,\u201d she said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cNo patching it up this time?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe blinked back tears. \u201cNo...I really don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p> <p>Her boss patted her shoulder gently. \u201cDo you want to talk about it with anyone? Me or...\u201d He nodded at the receptionist\u2019s desk. Claudia was around the same age as Phoebe\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but...I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m still feeling pretty raw.\u201d</p><p>Again Bill patted her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know how much you loved him.\u201d</p><p>With a trembling hand, Phoebe reached into her purse for a tissue and blew her nose. Anger and indignation would only carry her so far and then the regrets would take over. Experience had taught her that she needed to be prepared, that she needed an action plan to combat the depression she knew would follow.</p><p>\u201cBill, would you do something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His unquestioning allegiance and willingness to help made it harder to hold back the emotion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you told Claudia to refuse anything else Clark Snowden has delivered here.\u201d Her voice broke just a bit when she said it. If she forgave Clark this time she\u2019d lose all selfrespect. Shunning him would take real effort. She\u2019d have to work at it, just like Caroline Dover worked at making her knee function properly. But eventually Phoebe would learn to stop loving Clark. Eventually her heart would stop aching. Bill hugged her as she left, and that brought fresh tears to her eyes. On her way to the parking garage her cell phone chirped again. She didn\u2019t bother to see who it was. A cheery jingle announced that she had a message. As she walked, her feet slowed. Clark wouldn\u2019t give up easily.</p><p>He would hound her, send her gifts, plead with her until she weakened. And she just might. She had before. It was hard to turn away from the man you loved, hard to f ight the desire to accept his excuses. This was familiar ground\u2014territory she\u2019d sworn she\u2019d never travel again and yet...here she was. No, she couldn\u2019t give in. She couldn\u2019t falter. Walking by the phone shop, the same shop she passed f ive days a week, she really noticed it for the f irst time. After a short hesitation, Phoebe turned back. Staring in the window, she saw the latest cell phone accessories.</p> <p>It went without saying that Clark would continue to call her until he made a dent in her resolve. She knew his plan and had fallen for it once before. If she was truly serious about avoiding Clark she had to send him the right signals. Stepping inside the store, Phoebe looked around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to take a number,\u201d a harried saleswoman instructed her.</p><p>\u201cI have a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll still need to take a number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She got a ticket that read 57 and leaned casually against the wall. There was no reason to rush home. All that awaited her was an empty apartment\u2014well, empty except for her cat, Princess. The cat had more common sense than Phoebe did. Princess had never cared for Clark and the feeling was mutual. He\u2019d said that when they were married, he wanted her to give Princess to her widowed mother. To her own disgust, Phoebe had tentatively agreed. The saleswoman called out \u201cFifty-seven!\u201d twice before Phoebe realized it was her turn. The process of changing her cell phone number was relatively easy, although it would be a nuisance to notify her family and friends.</p><p>Family.</p><p>One person she hadn\u2019t updated so far was her mother, who loved Clark and had championed him after the f irst...indiscretion. All Phoebe could do was pray that her mother would take her side this time around.</p><p>When she got home, she was feeling less vulnerable. Princess greeted her at the door of her condo, purring as she rubbed Phoebe\u2019s ankles.</p><p>Bending down and scooping Princess into her arms, Phoebe buried her face in the soft gray fur. \u201cYou were right all along,\u201d</p><p>she whispered. \u201cI should have trusted your character assessment. It would\u2019ve saved me a lot of grief.\u201d</p><p>The light on her phone blinked madly; Phoebe could guess who\u2019d made most of the calls. So she was surprised to discover that the f irst message was from her mother.</p><p>\u201cCall me as soon as you\u2019re home,\u201d Leanne Rylander implored.</p><p>\u201cThis is important, Phoebe. I have to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe rested her forehead against the cupboard door. Sooner or later, she\u2019d need to tell her mother, although from the tone of Leanne\u2019s voice, Phoebe suspected she\u2019d already heard. Taking a moment to gather her resolve, she reached for the phone.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Phoebe?\u201d Leanne asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cI assume Clark\u2019s contacted you?\u201d Phoebe asked with resignation.</p><p>\u201cHe did. Oh, Phoebe, he\u2019s beside himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be,\u201d she snapped. \u201cMother, please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re on his side.\u201d It was diff icult enough to withstand Clark\u2019s pleas\u2014and nearly impossible to ignore them when her mother\u2019s voice joined his.</p><p>\u201cWell, no... What he did was inexcusable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou have every right to be upset,\u201d her mother continued soothingly.</p><p>\u201cEvery right!\u201d Phoebe thought fleetingly that Clark had used the same words. She wondered if Leanne knew the full story.</p><p>\u201cMom, do you realize Clark was arrested for solicitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he told me. It\u2019s no excuse but he said he just didn\u2019t think being with a prostitute was really cheating.\u201d</p><p>The fact that Clark had told her mother the truth, or part of it, anyway, shocked her. \u201cBut...he tried to hire a hooker!\u201d</p><p>She heard sympathy in her mother\u2019s voice. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t his first arrest, either.\u201d</p><p>Her mother released a long sigh. \u201cI can only imagine how upset you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t!\u201d she cried. \u201cYou can\u2019t begin to imagine how upset and humiliated I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Phoebe, sweetheart, you don\u2019t understand. There are extenuating circumstances. Clark was set up. This is a clear case of entrapment. He assured me it\u2019ll never go to trial. In fact, Clark is considering a lawsuit against the Seattle Police Department for causing him this embarrassment.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe closed her eyes. \u201cMother. Please listen to what you\u2019re saying. It doesn\u2019t matter if this was entrapment. It doesn\u2019t matter that the girl he tried to hire was an undercover policewoman. It doesn\u2019t matter if this goes to court or not. What does matter is that the man I was going to marry has this...this weakness. This need for other women. Not even for a relationship. Just for sex. How humiliating is that? I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s excited by the danger of picking someone up on the street or what. All I know is that I can\u2019t and won\u2019t marry a man who\u2019s betrayed me like this.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed again. \u201cPhoebe, listen to me. You\u2019re my daughter and I want you to be happy\u2014but you should consider the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>The conversation was becoming painful. \u201cThe bottom line is that Clark was willing to pay another woman for sex. Can I say it any plainer than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Phoebe, enough of that kind of talk. There\u2019s no need to be crude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you like me to pretty it up?\u201d she cried. \u201cClark wanted to sleep with another woman? A woman he paid! Does that make it any less offensive to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. You are angry, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry? Angry?\u201d Yes, she was angry, and at the moment outrage was good therapy. \u201cI\u2019m furious, Mom. I\u2019m also hurt, disillusioned, humiliated, devastated and brokenhearted\u2014and that only scratches the surface.\u201d</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t immediately respond. \u201cYou should sleep on it before you do anything drastic,\u201d she f inally said.</p><p>\u201cSleep on what? The fact that the man I love is a cheat? Mom, do you actually believe this behavior will stop once we\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d she wailed, cutting her off. \u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for Clark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, honey, he explained it to me. I know it\u2019s bad but he really doesn\u2019t feel that being with a...you know, call girl is cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that makes it all right? You can\u2019t be serious!\u201d</p><p>Her mother paused. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Clark\u2019s so well-connected and his mother and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mother invited you to the country club and you met all the people you read about in the paper.\u201d It was hard to even say the words, but it was the truth. Leanne enjoyed being affiliated with the Snowdens. They were a wealthy, well-known family.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember how excited I was when you mentioned your new patient?\u201d her mother said, sounding as brokenhearted now as Phoebe felt. Phoebe did. Her mother\u2019s favorite section of the paper had always been the society pages. When Clark damaged his knee in a skiing accident, she\u2019d been his physical therapist. He\u2019d asked her out after their very f irst session. Phoebe had declined; it was against company policy to date a patient. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clark had courted her for weeks, sending her f lowers, bringing her gifts, charming her. Despite his efforts, she resisted every attempt he made and refused to see him outside the clinic\u2014until he\u2019d finished his therapy. She should\u2019ve learned her lesson then. Clark didn\u2019t take rejection well. She\u2019d broken off the engagement, and that had injured his pride. He wasn\u2019t about to let her walk away. In his view of the world, he was in control; he did the leaving.</p><p>The minute her mother had heard Clark\u2019s name, she\u2019d been ecstatic. Early on, Leanne hinted that it would be fine to bend the rules just a bit for someone of his stature. As soon as they\u2019d started dating, Leanne had told all her friends that her daughter was seeing Max and Marlene Snowden\u2019s only son. Clark was part of his father\u2019s prestigious legal f irm and destined to become a full partner within the next five years. As far as Leanne Rylander was concerned, Phoebe had struck gold.</p><p>And Clark had swept her off her feet. Just like a romantic hero. He\u2019d escorted her to parties and concerts. He\u2019d lavished gifts on her, flattered her\u2014and asked her to marry him. The f irst sign of trouble came when a woman from his office stopped by the clinic and asked to speak to Phoebe privately. Kellie Kramer warned her that Clark had a nasty habit of paying for sex. Phoebe hadn\u2019t believed it. Why should she?</p><p>This woman obviously had a vendetta against Clark. Then Kellie had provided proof, showing her a copy of the warrant issued when Clark was arrested\u2014the f irst time. She\u2019d risked her job removing it from the f ile because she felt Phoebe had a right to know. Kellie claimed, as well, that there\u2019d been plenty of other occasions. Clark just hadn\u2019t been caught. Stunned, Phoebe had confronted Clark, who seemed genuinely surprised that she was upset. According to her fianc\u00e9 this was something practically all men did. Sex with a prostitute didn\u2019t mean anything, he said.</p> <p>Phoebe had found it difficult to listen to these inadequate excuses. She\u2019d wanted to break off the engagement immediately. Clark had begged for a second chance. He\u2019d called her at all hours of the day and night. He\u2019d sent f lowers and left pleading messages, until she\u2019d weakened enough to agree. But the person who\u2019d really convinced her to give him a second chance had been her own mother.</p><p>Leanne felt Phoebe needed to let Clark prove himself. Now that he understood such behavior was unacceptable, she\u2019d argued, it would stop.</p><p>Clark had said all the right things. He\u2019d vowed with tears in his eyes that nothing like this would ever happen again. He loved her. If Phoebe walked out on him, his life would be ruined. He\u2019d also told her that Kellie Kramer had been f ired. She\u2019d overstepped her bounds, and her insubordination wouldn\u2019t be tolerated. Her motive had been to hurt Clark and his father. If Phoebe ended their engagement, Kellie would succeed. He\u2019d begged for another chance and, with her mother\u2019s encouragement ringing in her ears, Phoebe had let him convince her.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe? Phoebe, are you still there?\u201d her mother asked plaintively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll sleep on this,\u201d she said again. \u201cYour entire future is at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you, Mother. There\u2019s nothing to sleep on. Clark was with this other woman. He admitted it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she entrapped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. What does is that he broke his word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so afraid you\u2019re going to do something you\u2019ll regret for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>You mean something you\u2019re going to regret, Phoebe thought but didn\u2019t say. She closed her eyes. \u201cI...I can\u2019t talk about this anymore. Good night, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>She had to persevere, not only against Clark but against her own mother, who\u2019d rather see Phoebe sacrif ice her happiness and integrity than end a socially advantageous\u2014but emotionally corrupt\u2014relationship.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get to that knitting class fast enough, she told herself wryly. She had to banish Clark Snowden from her life and that meant she needed all the fortif ication she could get.</p><p>3</p><p>Bryan \u201cHutch\u201d Hutchinson</p><p>Hutch sat in Dr. Dave Wellington\u2019s off ice, waiting. His physician and former classmate wanted to speak to him and that couldn\u2019t be good. He\u2019d gone in for his annual physical, except that it wasn\u2019t so annual, and following a series of tests, Dave\u2019s nurse had ushered him into his off ice. Hutch and Dave had been friends for years; they\u2019d gone to high school and college together, both star football players. Before Hutch took over the family business, they\u2019d golfed together every Wednesday afternoon. Golf. Like so much else, he\u2019d given it up after his father\u2019s sudden death. Hutch had assumed the position of CEO at Mount Rainier Chocolates, and his life hadn\u2019t been the same since.</p><p>There was no longer time for golf in the middle of the day. And now, with the pending lawsuit...</p><p>Hutch didn\u2019t want to think about that because whenever he did he grew irritated. He f igured that was bad for his blood pressure, which the nurse had told him was elevated. Little wonder. So okay, he probably wasn\u2019t as f it as he\u2019d been in college. He didn\u2019t have time to work out. The company\u2019s demands made it impossible.</p><p>\u201cAm I going to live?\u201d Hutch joked as his friend walked in. Dave strode to the other side of his desk and pulled out the chair.</p> <p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d</p><p>The smiled died on Hutch\u2019s lips. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>Dave leaned toward him. \u201cYour blood pressure is far too high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d He frowned. These days his stress level was through the roof, thanks largely to a frivolous lawsuit recently f iled against the company. Some woman claimed that eating Mount Rainier Chocolates had made her fat. Oh, the lawsuit dressed it up with fancy words about \u201cpsychological dependence\u201d and \u201cexploitive advertising\u201d but the plaintiff \u2019s weight gain was the basis of her legal action. Talk about stupid! And yet it was just the kind of case he\u2019d often read about, in which a jury awarded huge sums as punitive damages. The plaintiff shouldn\u2019t have stood a chance of winning, but she had a crackerjack attorney who\u2019d charged Mount Rainier Chocolates with malicious and willful misconduct and obviously hoped to create a precedent that would make his name. Every time Hutch thought about it, he became more agitated. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? To common sense? To accountability?</p><p>Hutch didn\u2019t care what it cost; he wasn\u2019t caving in, not to blackmail, and that was what he considered this. Okay, so his blood pressure was high; he\u2019d deal with it. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll take a pill.\u201d</p><p>Dave shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that. You\u2019re working too hard, not exercising enough and I\u2019m well aware that your diet is atrocious. You have all the classic symptoms of a man headed for a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m only thirty-f ive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnmarried. And you know what the statistics say about the benefits of marriage\u2014especially for men.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he didn\u2019t have a wife was also an issue with his mother. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to meet women,\u201d he grumbled. Dave talked right over that. \u201cYou also have a family history of heart disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was your father when he died?\u201d</p><p>Hutch exhaled. \u201cFifty-eight.\u201d He\u2019d never forget the day he lost his father. He\u2019d been twenty-f ive, carefree, self ish and a little arrogant. Back in those days, he had time for golf and dating and friends. That had all changed, literally overnight. He\u2019d always accepted that eventually he\u2019d step into his father\u2019s shoes as head of the family enterprise. But he\u2019d f igured it would be years before Bryan Sr. retired and he hadn\u2019t concerned himself with details about the business. Although Hutch had showed up for work every day, he hadn\u2019t paid much attention. Certainly not enough to assume the company\u2019s leadership on such short notice. It had taken him two years to learn everything he needed to know about the business and the CEO\u2019s role. He\u2019d made mistakes and the company had f loundered. Not only did he have responsibilities to their employees, his mother depended on the income. Mount Rainier Chocolates had lost market share, and those lessons had been hard, but Hutch had slowly found his way. Over the next few years, the company did marginally better and then, gradually, there\u2019d been a turnaround. His conf idence increased. Hutch had encouraged the development of new products, which he wanted to test. He\u2019d switched distributors. He was involved in every aspect of the business, from research to hiring to advertising and everything in between. And because of all that, he worked twelve-and fourteen-hour days. This wasn\u2019t a good time to be sued, in other words. Then again, was there ever?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you a prescription,\u201d Dave said sternly, \u201cbut what you really need is a change in lifestyle.\u201d</p><p>Hutch resisted the urge to groan aloud. He couldn\u2019t add one more thing to his already crowded schedule. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiet.\u201d</p><p>Now, that rankled\u2014although he agreed that he skipped too many meals and ate too much junk food on the run. \u201cI\u2019m not overweight,\u201d he argued.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but you\u2019re close to being anemic, your potassium is low and you\u2019re putting your immune system at risk. That\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s taking your thumb so long to heal.\u201d</p><p>More than a month ago Hutch had sliced open the f lesh between his thumb and index f inger while he was trying to cut a rubbery, two-day-old piece of pizza. The injury had required several stitches. To this day it continued to bother him. His improperly healed thumb was what had prompted him to make the appointment for his physical. It\u2019d been a year and a half since he\u2019d last seen Dave in a professional capacity. Or any capacity, really, except for a drink at Christmas.</p><p>\u201cWhat about vitamins?\u201d Hutch asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to recommend one and put you on iron tablets, as well as blood pressure medication, but that isn\u2019t enough. You need to start taking better care of yourself.\u201d The unspoken words hung in the air between them. Otherwise Hutch would end up like his father\u2014prematurely dead of a heart attack. And this time, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone to take over the business.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll sign up for a gym.\u201d</p><p>Dave shrugged as if this wasn\u2019t a big enough concession.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do more than sign up. You\u2019ve got to work out at least three times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, f ine. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might also join a class or two.\u201d</p><p>There was more? \u201cWhat kind of class?\u201d</p><p>Dave leaned back, grinning as he studied Hutch. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to suggest you take up knitting.\u201d</p><p>Hutch shook his head. \u201cThis is a joke, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I had a male patient come in to my off ice with sky-high blood pressure. He decided to start knitting\u2014I think his wife talked him into it. I have to tell you I was shocked at the difference in him. I\u2019m not kidding. I saw the evidence myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What a ridiculous idea. \u201cLike I have time for... crafts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a suggestion, but it\u2019ll help your thumb, too.\u201d</p><p>Hutch jerked his thumb back and forth and felt it tighten. It was especially stiff in the morning. But knitting? Him? The gym he could handle, but knitting? If any of his friends or employees heard about that, he\u2019d be a laughingstock.</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d Hutch asked, suddenly suspicious. \u201cDo you knit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Dave grinned again. \u201cMy wife taught me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet outta here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works, Hutch. Give it a try.\u201d Dave reached for his pad, wrote out the prescriptions and handed it to him. Hutch stared down at the small sheet of paper. He never would\u2019ve believed he\u2019d be on blood pressure medication in his thirties. Dave was right; this didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you again in two months.\u201d</p><p>Hutch nodded. He stood and pulled a candy bar from his inside pocket. \u201cI brought you something.\u201d</p> <p>Dave accepted it and looked up expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to launch this nationwide. It\u2019s called the Mount Saint Helens bar.\u201d</p><p>Dave turned it over and read the description. \u201cCoconut covered with dark chocolate and a liquid chocolate center. An explosion of f lavor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been working on for the last eighteen months. We f inally have a national distributor willing to give us a shot.\u201d His friend couldn\u2019t appreciate how diff icult it was to get into the bigger markets when he was up against the huge candy companies. Hutch believed in this new product and was prepared to gamble on the future of the business. So far, everything seemed positive\u2014 if he didn\u2019t end up forking out millions over a frivolous lawsuit. Dave examined the packaging and Hutch could tell he was impressed. \u201cSugar\u2019s not too high,\u201d he murmured, \u201cand 70 percent cocoa is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractically health food,\u201d Hutch said with a smile. He began to turn away.</p><p>Dave stopped him. \u201cTwo months, Hutch. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He walked out of the off ice and galloped down four f lights of stairs instead of taking the elevator. He couldn\u2019t disagree with Dave about getting more exercise. But there just weren\u2019t enough hours in the day. He delegated whatever he could but so much still demanded his personal attention. By the time he returned to his off ice, Dave was f ifteen minutes behind schedule. Gail Wendell, his personal assistant, relaxed her anxious face the moment he walked in the door. She stood as if expecting him to need something right away.</p><p>\u201cMr. Williams is waiting in your off ice,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Hutch glanced at his watch. It was past one and he\u2019d skipped breakfast and was feeling light-headed. Hardly surprising, considering all the blood Dave had taken earlier. \u201cCan you order me lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeriyaki chicken?\u201d Gail asked.</p><p>It was one of his favorites. High sodium, though. \u201cCould you get me a salad with a side of cottage cheese?\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like cottage cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but it\u2019s supposed to be good for you. Doc said I need a more balanced diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, cottage cheese it is. Anything else?\u201d</p> <p>Hutch nodded. \u201cFind a gym close to my place and sign me up.\u201d</p><p>His assistant made a note on her pad.</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d He hesitated, feeling a bit embarrassed. \u201cI need a knitting class.\u201d</p><p>He watched, but Gail didn\u2019t bat an eye.</p><p>\u201cSee if you can f ind an evening class somewhere in the downtown Seattle area.\u201d His condo was in a central location and he didn\u2019t want to travel far for this craziness. Actually, he\u2019d be astonished if Gail found such a class, which would be f ine by him. He could tell Dave he\u2019d tried and leave it at that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into it right away.\u201d</p><p>Dave reached inside his pocket for the prescription. \u201cWould you please have this f illed for me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gail, you\u2019re the greatest.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYour father used to say the same thing.\u201d</p><p>She was a valuable asset to the company, and Hutch was grateful she\u2019d stayed on through this lengthy transition period. He knew, however, that it wouldn\u2019t be long before she retired.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t worked out what he\u2019d do then. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t a question he needed to answer that minute. The remainder of his day was routine, with meetings stacked on meetings, and it was nearly seven o\u2019clock when he left the off ice. Instead of driving to his condo, he stopped at his mother\u2019s house in Bellevue. She\u2019d tried to call him earlier in the afternoon but he\u2019d been tied up in a meeting with the ad agency. Gloria Hutchinson\u2019s face brightened the instant Hutch walked in the door. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came by.\u201d</p><p>He made an effort to visit and update her on what was happening at the off ice at least once a week.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten dinner yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I had a late lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You should eat.\u201d Hutch enjoyed the way she fussed over him and knew his mother needed to be needed. She\u2019d adjusted to widowhood with diff iculty. Fortunately his sister, Jessie, spent a lot of time with her, for which Hutch was grateful. The three of them had always been close and still were.</p><p>\u201cI called you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the message,\u201d he said as he followed her into the kitchen. Opening the refrigerator, his mother took out eggs and cheese and set them on the kitchen counter. \u201cI called to see how your physical went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was f ine.\u201d No reason to worry her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your cholesterol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d That was true, anyway.</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d The rest of his health was far from excellent, but he didn\u2019t plan to mention that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too thin.\u201d</p><p>Hutch didn\u2019t think so but he didn\u2019t want to argue. \u201cYeah, I could put on a few pounds,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>She added grated cheese to the eggs and whipped them together. Melting a pat of butter in the pan, she poured in the eggs and cheese and stirred.</p><p>Without asking, Hutch slid two slices of bread\u2014whole wheat, he told himself righteously\u2014in the toaster.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of nights I made your father eggs for dinner,\u201d his mother went on to say. \u201cThe two of you are so much alike.\u201d As if she suddenly realized what she\u2019d said, Gloria paused. \u201cDo take care of yourself, Hutch. You will, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She turned to cast him a pleading look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom,\u201d he said in a cheerful voice that took a bit of effort. \u201cI\u2019m f it as a f iddle.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew sad. \u201cI thought your father was, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a gym membership today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d She spooned the scrambled eggs onto a plate and set it on the breakfast bar.</p><p>Hutch pulled up a stool. \u201cI start an exercise program f irst thing in the morning.\u201d He\u2019d set his alarm an hour earlier and launch into his three-times-a-week regimen. The prospect of losing an hour\u2019s sleep left him feeling vaguely depressed. But that was nothing compared to how he felt about the knitting class....</p><p>The toast popped up; his mother buttered it and brought it to him. Hutch stood to get some of his favorite homemade raspberry jelly from the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cWhat you really need is a wife.\u201d</p><p>This was a frequent topic of conversation initiated by his mother. The truth was, Hutch would\u2019ve liked nothing better, but meeting the right woman wasn\u2019t easy. Not with his busy schedule. He\u2019d tried the Internet but that hadn\u2019t worked out. It was too complicated, too time-consuming. Neither had the dating service he\u2019d contacted. Whenever he\u2019d met a woman, who, according to the professional matchmakers, was perfect for him, the spark just wasn\u2019t there. It\u2019d happened repeatedly until he\u2019d f inally given up.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a candidate in mind?\u201d he asked. From her returning smile, he knew she did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a school friend of Jessie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d His sister had impeccable taste\u2014in everything.</p><p>\u201cDivorced?\u201d</p><p>His mother nodded.</p><p>\u201cKids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy and girl and they\u2019re both darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve met her?\u201d</p><p>His mother grinned sheepishly. \u201cYes, and I think she\u2019s delightful. Would you like her phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He had no idea when he\u2019d be able to meet this</p><p>\u201cdelightful\u201d woman, but that was a minor detail. The least he could do was try.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell the whole world, but I\u2019m taking a knitting class.\u201d</p><p>He offered this tidbit because he thought it would please his mother\u2014and to shift the conversation away from his marital status.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to help me relax and Dave said it might be good therapy for my thumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s on Wednesday nights. First class is next week.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cYou aren\u2019t pulling my leg, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I do that?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, then placed her hands on both sides of his face and affectionately kissed his cheek. \u201cI never guessed that my son would become a knitter.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cNot me, not my daughter, but my son.\u201d</p><p>His own laughter was a little forced. However, he\u2019d committed himself now. And how hard could knitting be, anyway?</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Alix Turner</p><p>Friday afternoon Alix Turner hung up her baker\u2019s apron in the kitchen of the French Caf\u00e9. Her shift had started at f ive that morning and now, at two-thirty, she was f inished. Jordan, her husband, was a youth pastor. He wouldn\u2019t be done at the church until close to six, which gave her time to take care of a few personal matters.</p><p>Standing in the alley behind the caf\u00e9, Alix lit her cigarette and took a long drag. She was down to f ive a day now, and was gradually working herself up to quitting completely. All f ive were smoked during breaks at work. Nights were the hardest, but she knew Jordan wouldn\u2019t appreciate her lighting up at home. Jordan didn\u2019t want her smoking at all. He was worried about the effects of cigarettes on her health, and he was right to be concerned. She worried about it, too. But all the dire warnings hadn\u2019t been enough to successfully break her addiction to nicotine. She was careful not to smoke in front of the kids in Jordan\u2019s youth group, since it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for the minister\u2019s wife to provide such a bad example.</p><p>Jordan was well aware that he wasn\u2019t getting any angel when he married her. But her past wasn\u2019t a problem between them, and she wanted to be sure the smoking wasn\u2019t, either\u2014or didn\u2019t become one. She\u2019d quit before, lots of times, and she could do it again.</p><p>Alix blamed the wedding for the fact that she was smoking now. Between her friend Jacqueline and Jordan\u2019s mother, the whole affair had turned into a circus. In the midst of all that pressure, Alix had to f ind something to settle her nerves. She\u2019d bought a pack of cigarettes on impulse and that was that. In the end, Alix and Jordan had a lovely wedding at Star Lake, on Grandma Turner\u2019s property. However, by then the habit of smoking had insinuated itself into her life and now, a year later, she was struggling to break it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although Alix had never told her husband or her friends about the cigarettes, they all knew. She couldn\u2019t hide the smell on her clothes, and the smoke clung to her hair, her hands. No one said anything. Jordan never chastised her or demanded she stop, but he wished she would, especially now that they were talking about starting a family.</p><p>Alix wanted to quit. It was important to give it up before she got pregnant. Jordan was due for a new job title and pay increase, and they\u2019d decided it was the right time to become parents. While she longed for a baby, her fears nearly overwhelmed her. She had so many concerns. So many doubts. It wasn\u2019t as if Alix had grown up with a good model of what a family ought to be. Her own mother was incarcerated at the women\u2019s prison in Purdy. This wasn\u2019t her f irst stint in jail, either. The mere thought of having a child thrilled her and terrif ied her in equal parts. Alix had no idea what kind of mother she\u2019d be. Her own parents had been drunk most of the time. And when they drank, they fought.</p><p>As a child, Alix had often hidden in a closet where she lived with an imaginary family. In her make-believe world, she had a mother and father who loved each other and cherished her. She\u2019d held on to that dream for years, escaping to a f ictional world because the real one had become increasingly violent. She was still in grade school when the state removed both Alix and her older brother from the family home. Between then and age sixteen, she\u2019d drifted from one foster home to the next. Some weren\u2019t so bad, but a few were dreadful. The only constant had been her brother. He\u2019d died of a drug overdose while she was in her teens. As much as possible, she tried to put those terrible years behind her.</p><p>Despite all her misgivings, the prospect of having Jordan\u2019s baby excited her. She decided she\u2019d knit a special blanket for their yetto-be conceived child. That would show Jordan she was serious about quitting, too.</p> <p>As she crossed the street to A Good Yarn, Alix noticed a sign in the window for a new knitting class. Knit to Quit. Alix had taken two of Lydia\u2019s classes previously and enjoyed them both. More than that, she considered Lydia one of her dearest friends. Other than Jordan and her mentor, Jacqueline Donovan, Lydia was the person she conf ided in.</p><p>\u201cAlix.\u201d Lydia\u2019s face lit up the instant Alix stepped inside. Whiskers, who\u2019d been asleep in the window, extended his front paws and stretched his sleek back as he yawned, showing his pink gums and needle-sharp teeth.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Alix walked over and gently scratched his ears. She loved Whiskers.</p><p>Lydia immediately hugged her. For a long time Alix hadn\u2019t been comfortable with other people touching her. It still made her a little uneasy. Lydia was different, though, and she brief ly hugged her back.</p><p>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t bring us any croissants,\u201d Margaret said, joining them at the front of the store. \u201cI\u2019m watching my weight and those croissants are my weakness. Especially the almond ones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to fear. We sold out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Margaret sighed with relief. \u201cWhat makes them so yummy, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Alix answered her with a single word. \u201cButter.\u201d</p><p>Margaret rolled her eyes. \u201cI should\u2019ve known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I came for yarn,\u201d Alix said. She was automatically drawn toward the DK-weight yarn in soft pastel colors. Lydia had displayed them in bins close to the cash register.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a project in mind?\u201d Lydia asked, following Alix\u2019s gaze.</p> <p>Alix felt funny telling others about the baby. But this was Lydia, so she f igured that made it okay. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a secret,\u201d she began, \u201cbut Jordan and I are talking seriously about getting pregnant and I thought I should knit something for the baby.\u201d</p><p>Margaret looked at Lydia. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose she happened to see the sign in the window.\u201d</p><p>Lydia\u2019s face f looded with irritation. \u201cMargaret!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Alix is smoking, isn\u2019t she? All the evidence says it\u2019s not good for a pregnant woman to smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Alix said, more defensively than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cYou can talk directly to me, Margaret. I\u2019m standing right here. Besides, I\u2019m not pregnant yet\u2014and I only smoke f ive cigarettes a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s f ive too many,\u201d Margaret said emphatically. Margaret made overcoming an addiction sound simple.</p><p>\u201cQuitting isn\u2019t easy,\u201d Alix said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of willpower, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never smoked,\u201d Lydia returned in that calming way of hers. \u201cBut I\u2019ve heard that cigarettes are as addictive as heroin. We\u2019d love to have you in the class, Alix, if you\u2019d care to join.\u201d</p><p>The thought tempted her; still, she hesitated. \u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>Lydia told her.</p><p>Alix decided to consider it. \u201cWhat\u2019s the project?\u201d</p><p>Lydia\u2019s classes were always interesting, not only the projects but the people who signed up. It was through that f irst knitting class that she\u2019d met Jacqueline, who\u2019d become both mentor and friend.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of having everyone work on a sampler scarf with a variety of patterns,\u201d Lydia explained. \u201cFrom what I can assess so far, everyone\u2019s at a different skill level. The scarf shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for a beginner but it\u2019ll offer a bit of a challenge for more experienced knitters, too. I think it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>A sampler scarf appealed to her. \u201cHow many people have signed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust two so far, so there\u2019s plenty of room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone quitting? Anyone else giving up smoking?\u201d</p><p>Lydia shrugged. \u201cNot that they said. And guess what? A man joined the class. His personal assistant found my ad in the phone directory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man?\u201d That was intriguing. Apparently plenty of men were knitters, although they didn\u2019t usually take classes. But then what did she know? She\u2019d never actually met any and they had to learn somehow. So, why not a class?</p><p>\u201cAccording to his assistant, he doesn\u2019t currently knit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he quitting?\u201d</p><p>Lydia looked uncertain. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, and I didn\u2019t speak to him personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady who stopped in on Wednesday seemed almost distraught,\u201d Margaret inserted. \u201cShe said something about a man, so I assume she\u2019s either just out of a relationship or trying to end one.\u201d</p><p>The group would certainly be varied, which made for a stimulating mix of ideas and personalities. \u201cYou know, it might not be a bad idea for me to do this. I\u2019m going to need a scarf for this winter and I can work on the baby blanket when I\u2019m f inished.\u201d</p><p>Lydia smiled. \u201cIt would be wonderful to have you in one of my classes again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure can\u2019t hurt, especially if you\u2019re sincere about giving up smoking,\u201d Margaret put in.</p><p>Rather than take offense at Margaret\u2019s attitude, Alix let her remark pass. Lydia\u2019s sister didn\u2019t have the ease with people or the engaging manner Lydia did, but she was a kindhearted person. A little critical, true\u2014not that she was wrong in this instance. No matter what it took, Alix was quitting cigarettes once and for all. Alix lingered a while longer and purchased what she\u2019d need for the class, then headed home to their cramped apartment. It was near the church, on a street off Blossom. They\u2019d have to make other living arrangements before the baby arrived, since the apartment was barely big enough for two. She made a Cobb salad for dinner, with grilled chicken strips, blue cheese, hard-boiled eggs and sliced pickled beets, one of her favorite vegetables. Jordan liked turkey bacon on his, but she\u2019d added that to the grocery list because they were out of it. Just as she was putting the f inishing touches on their dinner, Jordan walked in.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetie,\u201d he said, kissing her cheek. \u201cHow\u2019d your day go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d he told her. He sat down at their dining table.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a moment to chat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>A formal request like that wasn\u2019t typical, so this must be important. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. Jordan studied her as Alix left what she referred to as her alcove kitchen and sat down at the small table with the two chairs.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d she inquired, feeling slightly nervous.</p><p>\u201cNot really... It\u2019s just that I got a call from my dad this afternoon. I must\u2019ve spent an hour on the phone with him.\u201d</p><p>Jordan and his father kept in close contact and spoke often, so the call in itself wasn\u2019t unusual. \u201cAnd?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cThe family\u2019s been trying to sell Grandma Turner\u2019s house on the lake.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t new. After the funeral, the house had gone up for sale. The housing market was weak, and even lakefront properties weren\u2019t selling. Grandma\u2019s house was older, too. Alix felt the family was making a big mistake; she feared that in years to come they\u2019d regret ever letting go of that wonderful home where Grandma Turner had spent her entire married life. Alix loved the old house with its expansive front yard and wide f lower beds. Grandma Turner had worked in her yard until the day before she died. She and Alix had developed a special friendship. Much of their time together was spent gardening, and the smell, the feel, of sun-warmed earth was something Alix would always associate with Sarah Turner. The older woman was everything she hoped to be one day: generous, gracious, accepting and loving. Not only had Jordan\u2019s grandmother welcomed her into their family, but when Alix had been uncertain about going through with the wedding, Sarah had taken her in and sheltered her.</p><p>\u201cDid the house sell?\u201d Alix asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Her immediate reaction was a feeling of relief. The price had been lowered twice, but still no takers. What would\u2019ve sold quickly as little as a year ago lingered on the market now.</p><p>\u201cDad doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to leave the house vacant for so long.\u201d</p><p>Alix agreed, but she was worried about renting it out. \u201cIs he going to put it on the rental market?\u201d she asked warily.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Jordan told her. \u201cDad suggested you and I move there until a buyer\u2019s found.\u201d</p><p>Alix nearly squealed with delight. Not once had the thought occurred to her and yet it was the perfect solution. \u201cJordan, I\u2019d love that!\u201d Their apartment was so tiny they had virtually no storage space. Wedding gifts had to be kept at his parents\u2019 home because there was simply nowhere to put them. No similar enthusiasm showed in her husband\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe need to think this through carefully, Alix. It sounds like a good idea now. I know you love the house, but there are complications.\u201d</p><p>Alix was aware of those, but she didn\u2019t care. Any inconvenience would be minimal compared to the benef its. \u201cWell, sure, there are bound to be some changes,\u201d she said. \u201cFor one thing, we\u2019ll have to commute to the city every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d Jordan shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no telling how soon it\u2019ll be before someone makes an offer and the deal closes. Then we\u2019d have to pack up and move out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Alix said eagerly. They didn\u2019t have much furniture so it wouldn\u2019t take long to move again. No matter how many\u2014or how few\u2014months they had in the house by the lake, it would be worth the inconvenience.</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t seem to hear her. \u201cIn addition to that, there\u2019s no guarantee we\u2019d f ind another apartment as reasonable as this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we trust the Lord to look after the details?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it feel as if this is meant to be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlix, do you know how much work is involved in moving?\u201d</p><p>He had to be joking! She\u2019d moved almost every six months her entire life. Her parents could never manage to pay the rent and still afford booze. Eviction never seemed to faze them; there were always other houses, other neighborhoods. Later, as a foster child, Alix had never lasted long with any family. By sixteen she was essentially on her own.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d she said, reaching out to take his hand. \u201cI do know all the work involved in moving.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re serious about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am! I think it\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>He squeezed her f ingers. \u201cI know you loved Grandma Turner and she loved you, but I didn\u2019t believe you\u2019d actually be willing to move into her house. I mean, because of the distance and the fact that we\u2019d have no guarantees...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...what about rent?\u201d Their budget was tight because they\u2019d been saving every extra penny for a down payment on a house. Unfortunately, it couldn\u2019t be Sarah Turner\u2019s house with its extensive property. She\u2019d seen the asking price and it was way beyond what they\u2019d be able to afford. Jordan shrugged. \u201cThe one advantage is that we\u2019d be living rent-free.\u201d</p><p>Alix threw her arms in the air. \u201cThat\u2019s so generous! It\u2019s perfect, Jordan! Just perfect. We\u2019ll be able to save for our own house and when you get your raise, we can put that money aside, too.\u201d</p><p>Another advantage was Sarah\u2019s furniture; much of it was still there. Whatever the family wanted had already been taken. The rest was left for whoever purchased the house.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to remember that utilities will be higher, and then there\u2019s the cost of the commute.\u201d He made these sound like monumental issues.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the bus,\u201d Alix said happily. The house was on a bus route and she could always read or knit while traveling into the city, even if she had to leave extra-early in the morning. The afternoons wouldn\u2019t be so bad. She actually looked forward to riding the bus.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take public transportation, too, but there are certain days I\u2019ll need the car and with the price of gas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who just said we should leave the details to God?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cNo, you did.\u201d</p><p>Alix giggled. \u201cThen I heard it from you f irst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought you\u2019d go for this,\u201d he said in a wondering tone.</p><p>\u201cJordan, we were married at the lake house. Aren\u2019t you the romantic one in the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another benef it you\u2019re forgetting,\u201d she whispered seductively.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about me getting pregnant, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight...when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>That was his subtle reminder that she had to quit smoking f irst.</p><p>\u201cI should be soon. And Jordan, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we conceived our baby in a home that\u2019s been in your family for generations?\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s gaze held hers. \u201cThat does sound like a wonderful idea....\u201d</p><p>Alix grinned. \u201cI knew you\u2019d think so.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>Anne Marie and Ellen Roche hauled their suitcases up the stairs to the small apartment above Blossom Street Books. The f light from Paris had landed them back in Seattle midafternoon but it felt like the middle of the night to Anne Marie.</p><p>Nine-year-old Ellen had slept for most of the f light, but not Anne Marie. Instead, she\u2019d cradled her daughter with one arm and reveled in each and every precious memory of their twoweek vacation. Even after nearly eight months it seemed unbelievable that she was now legally Ellen\u2019s mother. A few words in front of a judge had made it so. In truth, the judge\u2019s proclamation had been a mere formality. Anne Marie had become Ellen\u2019s mother in her mind, in her heart, long before anything was off icial. Almost a year and a half earlier, on Valentine\u2019s Day, Anne Marie, together with three other widows, had made a list of twenty wishes. One of her wishes was to travel to Paris with someone she loved. That someone had turned out to be Ellen. A number of her wishes had come to pass, and some, like the Paris trip, had taken place in unexpected ways.</p><p>\u201cCan we get Baxter now?\u201d Ellen asked, racing out of her small bedroom, where she\u2019d deposited her suitcase.</p><p>\u201cIn a little while.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie missed her Yorkie, too. Her friend Elise Beaumont\u2014 one of the group of Valentine widows\u2014had looked after Baxter these past two weeks. Anne Marie had predicted that by the time they got back, Elise would recognize the benefits of canine companionship.</p><p>\u201cI want to teach Baxter French,\u201d Ellen said. The girl had picked up phrases with surprising ease and was determined not to forget a single word.</p><p>\u201cJ\u2019aime la France,\u201d Ellen said.</p><p>\u201cMoi, aussi.\u201d Anne Marie remembered that much French, despite her exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019il vous pla\u00eet, donne moi quelques bon-bons?\u201d Ellen asked next.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t have any candy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Mom...\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie returned to her unpacking. \u201cLet me put in a load of wash and then we\u2019ll go get Baxter.\u201d</p><p>Ellen went back to her bedroom and f inished unpacking her own suitcase. Then she stored it beneath her bed, which was littered with souvenirs she\u2019d purchased in Paris for herself and special friends.</p><p>Anne Marie was touched by the girl\u2019s generosity. Ellen had spent all the money she\u2019d saved from her allowance on trinkets for her school friends as well as Melissa, Anne Marie\u2019s stepdaughter, and her baby boy.</p><p>After dumping a load of clothes in the washer and setting the dial, Anne Marie called Elise and asked if it would be convenient to collect Baxter. She was told they could come anytime. While she was on the phone she decided to check her voice mail. With pen and pad in hand, she prepared to listen to two weeks\u2019 worth of messages. Among them, as she expected, were a number of calls from real estate agents.</p><p>The time had come to search for a home. The apartment above the bookstore had been f ine when it was just her, but she had a daughter to consider now. Anne Marie had started looking and hoped to f ind a place this summer. With Ellen\u2019s circumstances so changed, she\u2019d delayed the move, wanting the child to feel secure in her new life.</p><p>There were four or f ive calls regarding houses in the neighborhood Anne Marie had chosen. She wanted Ellen to be able to attend the same school. Unfortunately, the homes in that neighborhood were older, and many were badly in need of updating and repairs. Anne Marie would have to pay for the work, and that added extensively to the cost. To her surprise there were a number of hang-ups, as well. She generally didn\u2019t get more than one or two a month, if that. After the third, she began counting and tallied seven. Someone seemed to be trying hard to get hold of her, although she had no idea who it might be.</p><p>Well, no point in worrying about it. Anyone this persistent was bound to try again. However, the fact that this person hadn\u2019t left a message was a bit disconcerting.</p><p>\u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d Ellen murmured as she entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning,\u201d Ellen said, studying her, sensitive as always to her moods.</p><p>It meant that Anne Marie had to be careful not to overdramatize her emotions. \u201cEverything\u2019s f ine. Now let\u2019s go pick up Baxter,\u201d she said, grabbing Ellen about the waist and tickling her. The girl squealed delightedly.</p><p>Reaching for her purse, Anne Marie followed Ellen, who bounced down the stairs ahead of her.</p><p>Teresa, her full-time employee, looked up when Ellen burst into the bookstore. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you guys to go out so soon,\u201d</p><p>she commented. She stood behind the cash register, opening the latest order from Ingram\u2019s, a distributor. Cartons of books were stacked behind her, a good indication that business hadn\u2019t slacked off while Anne Marie was away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get Baxter,\u201d Anne Marie explained. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExhausted,\u201d Anne Marie told her.</p><p>\u201cEllen seems raring to go.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t unusual. But Anne Marie suspected jet lag would catch up with her soon.</p><p>\u201cCan we say hello to Susannah?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, but remember if she\u2019s with a customer we\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen held the shop door open for her. Susannah had two customers, but when she saw Anne Marie and Ellen, she smiled and waved.</p><p>\u201cLydia and Margaret don\u2019t look busy,\u201d Ellen said as she peered into the front window of A Good Yarn. Her small hands framed her face and she stared at the sleeping cat. \u201cWhiskers misses Baxter, too, don\u2019t you, Whiskers?\u201d she asked. \u201cCan we go in, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can only visit for a few minutes,\u201d Anne Marie cautioned.</p><p>\u201cElise is waiting and so is Baxter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they walked in, Lydia leaped to her feet. \u201cAnne Marie! Ellen! Welcome home. How was Paris?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie sighed luxuriously. \u201cWonderful! Everything I\u2019ve ever imagined and more.\u201d</p><p>Lydia clasped her hands together and smiled warmly. \u201cI knew it would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did the neighborhood survive without us?\u201d Anne Marie teased.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lot quieter,\u201d Margaret called from the back of the shop where she sat crocheting. Then she broke into a huge grin. \u201cAnd a lot less interesting, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Whiskers missed Baxter,\u201d Lydia said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get him right now,\u201d Ellen told her. \u201cI missed Baxter more than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d miss Whiskers, too.\u201d Lydia turned to Anne Marie, her eyes shining. \u201cListen, do you have a moment?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Lydia\u2019s joy was contagious. \u201cBrad and I are going to adopt. We\u2019ve requested an infant.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie clapped her hands excitedly. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard this morning that Brad and I have been approved by the state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you speak with Evelyn Boyle?\u201d She\u2019d been Ellen\u2019s social worker and Anne Marie had come to treasure the other woman, who\u2019d been so instrumental in facilitating the adoption. She\u2019d given Lydia Evelyn\u2019s phone number weeks ago and had been wondering if anything had come of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lydia nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s been so helpful. We really appreciate the referral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny word on how long it\u2019ll be before you can adopt a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Brad and I are prepared to wait, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope it happens soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Lydia smiled happily. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating tonight. Brad\u2019s taking Cody and me out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we come, too?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cEllen! No, we can\u2019t,\u201d Anne Marie chastened. \u201cIt\u2019s not polite to invite yourself along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I have a gift for Cody from Paris and I want to give it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time for that later,\u201d Anne Marie reminded her and then, despite her best efforts, yawned. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s mentioned jet lag to Ellen yet. I expect it\u2019ll hit her in a couple of hours.\u201d As for Anne Marie, her feet were dragging. Once they\u2019d returned with Baxter, she was planning on taking a nap. Ellen would be tired by then, too\u2014she hoped.</p> <p>\u201cI see you\u2019re starting a new class this week.\u201d The sign in the window had caught her notice and she found herself intrigued by the concept. Not that there was anything she needed to quit. She was satisf ied with her life at the moment\u2014more satisf ied than she\u2019d been since the early days of her marriage.</p><p>\u201cAre you interested?\u201d Lydia told her about the project she\u2019d chosen. Anne Marie liked the sound of it, but a night class would be too diff icult.</p><p>Maybe she could get the pattern from Lydia. She\u2019d bought some beautiful yarn in Paris and a scarf would be the perfect thing to knit.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to join the class?\u201d Lydia asked. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not trying to give up any bad habits. Alix already signed up because she wants to quit smoking\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to\u2014but I can\u2019t leave Ellen by herself. I want to make the scarf, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to help with the pattern if you run into any problems.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Lydia, I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>As Anne Marie and Ellen left the shop, the little girl pointed across the street to the French Caf\u00e9. \u201cAlix!\u201d she cried. \u201cI want to say hello to Alix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen, we\u2019ll have to do that later. Besides, Alix is probably off work by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I forgot....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for Baxter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>Ellen ran ahead of her to where Anne Marie kept her car in the alley behind the bookstore. She wondered if she\u2019d have any problems after leaving it for over two weeks unused, but the engine f ired immediately to life. Anne Marie backed carefully out of her parking space and onto Blossom Street. As they arrived at Elise\u2019s small condominium just north of downtown, Anne Marie called to let her know they\u2019d be up in a minute. Elise and Baxter were waiting, and the instant Baxter caught sight of them he nearly did f lips of joy. He barked and ran around, then leaped into Ellen\u2019s arms.</p><p>Ellen hugged him close as Baxter spread happy kisses across her face and yelped excitedly all over again.</p> <p>\u201cI think he missed us,\u201d Anne Marie laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, he certainly didn\u2019t lack for attention here,\u201d Elise said, smiling as she spoke. \u201cI enjoyed his companionship so much I\u2019ve decided to get a dog of my own.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie had hoped this would happen. Elise had gone through a painful grieving period after her husband\u2019s death. It had been different, in some ways, from Anne Marie\u2019s experience, since Elise\u2019s husband\u2014Maverick by name and maverick by nature, as he used to describe himself\u2014had died of cancer. He\u2019d lingered for several years, and Elise had said she was grateful for each extra day. Anne Marie\u2019s husband, Robert, however, had died suddenly, unexpectedly, of a massive heart attack.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a Yorkie like Baxter?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure just yet,\u201d Elise said in a pensive tone. \u201cI\u2019ll go down to the Humane Society and see what dogs they have available. It seems to me that Maverick would want me to adopt a rescue dog. He always believed in second chances....\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell lovingly on the portrait of her late husband. He wore his cowboy hat and smiled directly into the camera. There was an irrepressible quality about him, Anne Marie thought. As though taking risks was all part of life\u2014taking risks and accepting the consequences with a grin and a wink. Anne Marie and Ellen left soon after. They\u2019d brought Elise a gift of thanks for looking after the dog\u2014a lovely blue silk scarf with a f leur-de-lis pattern. Ellen cradled Baxter in her arms, murmuring to him as they walked to the car. When they clambered into the backseat, Baxter curled up on Ellen\u2019s lap and promptly went to sleep.</p><p>By the time Anne Marie pulled in behind Blossom Street Books, both Ellen and Baxter were napping soundly. It seemed a shame to wake Ellen, who looked up at her with drooping eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home?\u201d the little girl asked.</p><p>Anne Marie nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs and tuck you into bed, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie helped her climb the stairs as the dog scrambled up ahead of them. Ellen fell asleep again within minutes. Anne Marie wanted to do a few chores before she took a nap herself. After transferring the wash to the dryer, she noticed the light blinking on her phone. Checking voice mail again, she discovered another hang-up. Curious now, Anne Marie hurried down to the bookstore. Teresa glanced up from some new greeting cards she was arranging in the rack.</p><p>\u201cOh, Anne Marie, hi. I didn\u2019t expect to see you for the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are things?\u201d she asked, looking around. She saw nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>\u201cGreat. The summer releases are so good this year, I can hardly keep the new hardcovers on the shelves.\u201d</p><p>This was welcome news.</p><p>\u201cAnything...unusual happen while I was away?\u201d Anne Marie wasn\u2019t sure how to phrase the question.</p><p>Teresa bit her lip as if considering how to respond. \u201cNot really... What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a number of hang-ups on my personal phone. I\u2019ve never had that before. I just wondered if it was something to do with the bookstore.\u201d</p><p>Teresa shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I was just curious. It\u2019s a bit odd, that\u2019s all.\u201d Anne Marie collected her mail and turned away.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Teresa said, stopping her. Anne Marie turned back. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was someone here earlier in the week. A man. He asked to speak to you regarding a private matter.\u201d</p><p>A private matter? \u201cDid he leave his name or number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I asked, and he said he\u2019d contact you later.\u201d</p><p>Again, this was all rather odd. \u201cDid he say anything else?\u201d</p><p>Teresa\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cNo, not that I can recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d</p><p>A smile wavered on her lips. \u201cActually, he was pretty hot.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie grinned. \u201cDef ine hot. \u201d</p><p>\u201cTall\u2014about six-one, maybe six-two. In good shape. He\u2019s nice-looking. Very nice-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark hair? Or blond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark. And brown eyes. He seemed anxious to talk to you. Do you know who it might be?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your hang-ups? That might\u2019ve been him. Is there a number on caller ID?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie exhaled loudly. \u201cIt came up No Data.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see if he comes by again.\u201d</p><p>That was her thought, too. Well, a tall, dark and handsome stranger apparently wanted to meet her. Things could be worse.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Honey, knitting is so much more than just plain obsessive compulsive behavior...it\u2019s the healthiest addiction I know! \u2014Antje Gillingham, owner of The Knitting Nest in Maryville, TN</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>It\u2019s my habit to check each room before retiring for the night. Brad was already in bed, reading Michael Connelly\u2019s latest suspense novel. As I walked through the house, I checked the locks and turned off the lights in the kitchen. Then I looked in on Cody, who was fast asleep.</p><p>Chase, my stepson\u2019s golden retriever, slept on the braided rug next to Cody\u2019s bed. When I opened the bedroom door a crack, Chase\u2014ever vigilant\u2014raised his head. Seeing me, he lowered his head again.</p><p>All was well in the house and in my world. I had a new feeling of anticipation, a sense of excitement that stayed with me. It had begun the day I received a call from Evelyn Boyle regarding our approval as adoption candidates.</p><p>Just as I entered our bedroom, the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cGood grief, who\u2019d be calling after ten o\u2019clock?\u201d Brad asked as he set his book aside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d I reached for the telephone on my bedstand, half expecting this had to do with my mother. \u201cHello,\u201d I said tentatively.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lydia, it\u2019s Evelyn Boyle. I apologize for contacting you this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvelyn?\u201d My gaze automatically sought out Brad\u2019s. It didn\u2019t seem possible that they\u2019d have an infant for us so soon. Nevertheless my heart raced. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I wouldn\u2019t ask if I had any alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a foster child\u2014a girl. It\u2019s an emergency case and I need a home for Casey for two nights.\u201d</p><p>This was the very thing Margaret had said would happen, the very thing she\u2019d warned me about. \u201cTwo nights,\u201d I repeated, the hesitation in my voice impossible to disguise.</p><p>\u201cCasey is attending summer school and unless she f inishes, she won\u2019t be able to go on to the eighth grade in September. Sending her back to seventh grade would be a disaster. She\u2019s only twelve and this is a diff icult year for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought summer school just started.\u201d A friend of Cody\u2019s had gotten behind in math and was now attending a summer program that had recently begun and would go through the month of July.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but if Casey can spend tonight and possibly tomorrow night with you, that\u2019ll give me the necessary time to f ind her another long-term foster home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I bit my lip, uncertain what to say.</p><p>\u201cTwo nights, Lydia. Just two nights. It would make a world of difference to Casey. She really can\u2019t miss a single class.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Brad. \u201cI\u2019ll need to discuss this with my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I call you right back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I could stay on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure this is only for a couple of nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll ask.\u201d I held the receiver against my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s Evelyn Boyle.... She has a twelve-year-old girl who needs a bed for the next two nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it she wants to bring the girl here?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, ready to accept whatever Brad decided. He seemed as hesitant as I felt. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine Evelyn would ask if she had any other option,\u201d he said in a low voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe told me Casey, that\u2019s the girl\u2019s name, is attending math classes at summer school and can\u2019t afford to miss any or she won\u2019t be able to advance to the eighth grade.\u201d</p><p>Brad made the connection right away. \u201cIn other words, she needs to keep Casey in the same school district.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Brad met my eyes. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged, torn between generosity and fear. I wanted to help Evelyn, but I wasn\u2019t the least bit prepared to deal with a twelveyear-old. Still, it would only be for a couple of nights. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it would hurt.\u201d</p><p>Brad nodded. \u201cTell her to bring Casey over.\u201d He squeezed my hand. \u201cI hope we know what we\u2019re getting ourselves into,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d I lifted the receiver to my ear. \u201cBrad says we can take Casey for the next two nights.\u201d I made sure Evelyn understood that we were willing to f ill in, but just for the limited time she\u2019d requested.</p><p>The social worker\u2019s sigh of relief sounded over the phone. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough. I\u2019ll be dropping Casey off in the next half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait up for her,\u201d I promised. Thirty minutes would give me a chance to straighten the spare room and remake the bed. I\u2019d need to put a few things away, too. The sewing machine was out because I\u2019d repaired Cody\u2019s jeans earlier that evening. In addition, there were plastic tubs of yarn and knitting projects I\u2019d lost interest in for one reason or another. The closet was f illed with clothes I planned to donate to charity and some items from before my marriage that I hadn\u2019t f igured out what to do with. The room had become a catch-all, a storage area for anything that didn\u2019t have a f irm place in our lives.</p> <p>\u201cDo you need any help?\u201d Brad asked as I started toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to put some stuff in the closet and move the sewing machine,\u201d I explained. \u201cIt\u2019s only for a couple of days,\u201d I said again.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I could already hear Margaret\u2019s loud \u201cI told you so\u201d the moment she heard about this. Well, nothing I could do about that. I refused to allow my sister\u2019s ominous predictions to rule my life. I\u2019d been asked to help out and I\u2019d agreed. Nearly anyone would. It was part of the way we\u2019d been raised, and I suspected that if Evelyn had called Margaret, my sister would\u2019ve done exactly the same thing. When I\u2019d f inished with the bed, I threw a robe over my nightgown, then joined Brad in the living room. The doorbell rang and he unlocked the front door with me right behind him.</p><p>Chase immediately started scratching at Cody\u2019s bedroom door, ready to protect us against an intruder. Brad left to deal with the dog as I let Evelyn and Casey into the house. The f irst thing I noticed was how small Casey was for her age. Her backpack, hooked over one arm, was almost bigger than she was. Brad returned, clutching the dog\u2019s collar as Chase whined eagerly, his nails scrabbling on the hardwood. \u201cChase, sit,\u201d he said calmly, and Chase did.</p><p>\u201cLydia and Brad, this is Casey Marshall.\u201d</p> <p>The twelve-year-old refused to look at us. Instead she stared down at the f loor.</p><p>\u201cHello, Casey,\u201d Brad said. \u201cWelcome to our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d I echoed. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re exhausted. I\u2019ve got the bed made up for you.\u201d</p><p>Casey continued to stare at the f loor.</p><p>\u201cCasey,\u201d Evelyn murmured, her arm loosely around the girl\u2019s thin shoulders.</p><p>Reluctantly Casey looked up. Def iance f lashed in her cool dark eyes. I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d expected. Gratitude? Appreciation? Relief ? If so, all three were sadly lacking in Casey\u2019s expression and demeanor.</p><p>\u201cCasey will walk to class in the morning,\u201d Evelyn said. \u201cShe\u2019s at Carver Middle School.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive her,\u201d I volunteered. \u201cIt\u2019s on my way.\u201d</p> <p>Casey\u2019s eyes darted toward Chase and softened perceptibly until she saw me watching her. Quickly she diverted her attention, glancing around the foyer and into the living room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a ride, I\u2019ll walk,\u201d Casey insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d I said. This wasn\u2019t going well. It was almost as if Brad and I were intruding on the girl\u2019s life, although we were making every effort to accommodate her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you now,\u201d Evelyn said. She handed Brad her business card. \u201cThis has my off ice number and my cell. If you have any questions or problems, don\u2019t hesitate to phone anytime.\u201d</p><p>Brad accepted the card and studied it, although we already had Evelyn\u2019s contact information.</p><p>As Evelyn said her goodbyes, I stepped forward. She paused, a question in her eyes. I felt out of my depth here\u2014what did I know about dealing with a troubled young girl? I was afraid this wasn\u2019t going to work, but Evelyn offered me a reassuring smile, then turned to leave.</p><p>Well, we\u2019d agreed to do this, I reminded myself, and it was only for two days. We\u2019d muddle through and so would Casey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you to your room,\u201d I said as soon as Evelyn left. I tried not to reveal how nervous I was.</p><p>Casey raised one shoulder, implying that she really didn\u2019t care. She was slender for her age, with straight, badly cut hair that fell below her ears. Her jeans were tattered but not fashionably and the wording on her T-shirt was long since washed out. It had once been bright pink, I thought, but was now an off-white with reddish splotches here and there.</p><p>I led the way down the hall. \u201cThis will be your room,\u201d I said. I turned the light on. The bed was made and everything had been put in the closet or stacked on the dresser. I\u2019d brought in some fresh towels and extra hangers, which I\u2019d laid on the quilt. Casey looked around, then stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cOur son, Cody, is asleep next door. Chase is his dog. Cody named him that because he was always having to chase after him.\u201d She didn\u2019t smile. \u201cDo you like dogs?\u201d</p><p>Casey gave another one-sided shrug. \u201cThey\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get you anything?\u201d Brad asked, coming to stand behind me. He placed his hands on my shoulders.</p><p>Casey considered his question and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThe bathroom\u2019s at the end of the hall.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t want to leave the girl, but I didn\u2019t know what else to say or do. Casey obviously had no interest in conversation. She acted as though she couldn\u2019t be rid of us fast enough.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d Brad said.</p><p>\u201cYes, good night,\u201d I added with what I hoped was an encouraging smile. Casey nodded and closed the bedroom door. Brad and I were left standing out in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI hope we did the right thing,\u201d Brad whispered.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>I woke during the night and knew instantly that something was different. It took me a couple of minutes to realize what it was. Then I remembered\u2014a girl was sleeping down the hall. A girl we didn\u2019t know. Casey clearly didn\u2019t want to be in our home and revealed no appreciation for our hospitality. About seven, just before the alarm rang, Cody\u2019s voice boomed,</p><p>\u201cMom, there\u2019s a girl in the house!\u201d</p><p>Tossing aside the covers, I jumped out of bed. I grabbed my housecoat and hurried into the kitchen, where Casey sat at the table, eating a bowl of cereal. Cody stood in his pajamas with Chase at his side, tail wagging slowly. My son seemed to be in a state of shock.</p><p>\u201cThis is Casey,\u201d I said.</p><p>Cody\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDoes she talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasey, this is our son, Cody.\u201d</p><p>The girl went on eating her breakfast. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not bad for a boy,\u201d I told her and was rewarded with the glimmer of a smile.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Cody protested. \u201cShe\u2019s not staying, is she?\u201d</p><p>Whatever slight enjoyment had shown in Casey\u2019s eyes immediately disappeared. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be gone soon.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the words to tell Casey she was welcome to stay as long as she needed. To be honest, I didn\u2019t know if that was true. We\u2019d merely agreed to a short-term visit; I suspected that was all we could handle. This girl made me feel uncomfortable in my own home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be late tonight\u2014\u201d I said, reaching for the coffeepot. Brad worked for UPS and had left an hour before my alarm went off. He\u2019d made coffee, as usual\u2014for which I was profoundly grateful.</p><p>\u201cCan we go to the park?\u201d Cody asked as I f illed a mug and stirred in cream and sugar. \u201cYou said we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you and Chase there this morning,\u201d I told him after my f irst restorative sip. With the shop open until eight that night, I wasn\u2019t due at work until twelve. Margaret would open and Elise would arrive later in the afternoon.</p><p>Casey mumbled something I couldn\u2019t decipher. Cody bristled. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabies go to the park with their mommies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasey, that was uncalled for,\u201d I said disapprovingly. \u201cYou\u2019re a guest in our home, but I can\u2019t and won\u2019t put up with any form of disrespect. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Casey didn\u2019t respond. Instead she stood and carried her bowl to the sink. \u201cI need to leave for school now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with such def iance that I was hard-pressed to question her.</p><p>Casey disappeared into her room and returned a minute later with a book in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat time does school get out?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d We hadn\u2019t discussed this aspect of Casey\u2019s stay. \u201cBrad won\u2019t be home until after three.\u201d</p><p>Casey didn\u2019t seem concerned. \u201cI\u2019ll hang out with my friends,\u201d</p><p>Frankly I wasn\u2019t sure that was such a good idea. \u201cWould you like to catch the bus and come on down to my yarn store? I\u2019ll talk to Ms. Boyle and see about getting you signed up for day camp if you like. Maybe you could start tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA yarn store?\u201d Casey made it sound like the last place on earth she wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cI can teach you to knit if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>Casey ignored me.</p><p>I wrote out instructions about which bus to take and which stop to get off at and gave her the fare. Casey stuffed the coins in her jeans pocket and left soon afterward. As soon as the door closed, Cody whirled around to face me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not staying, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just for a couple of days,\u201d I promised him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a chance to get to know her,\u201d I said. In every likelihood that wouldn\u2019t happen, either.</p><p>No sooner had I spoken than the phone rang. A quick glance at the call display screen told me it was Evelyn Boyle.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I said as cheerfully as I could manage.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go last night?\u201d</p><p>Looking at the kitchen door, I wondered what to tell her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess,\u201d I f inally said. \u201cCasey went to bed almost right away.\u201d I couldn\u2019t prevent a sigh. \u201cUnfortunately, things didn\u2019t start off well this morning. I\u2019m afraid Casey and Cody don\u2019t have a lot in common.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive them both time to adjust,\u201d Evelyn advised.</p><p>\u201cTime?\u201d I echoed. \u201cCasey\u2019s leaving tomorrow, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Evelyn paused, and that short silence told me everything I needed to know.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is,\u201d Evelyn said with obvious reluctance, \u201cthe family that was going to foster Casey is on vacation. I can try to f ind another one, but that\u2019ll take a day or two, and we\u2019re always short of homes in the summer.\u201d She paused. \u201cI hate to ask this, but to be on the safe side could she stay with you for a week? I should be able to f ind a suitable family in that time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA week,\u201d I repeated, a little shocked. \u201cI\u2019ll need to check with Brad, of course.\u201d</p><p>Cody walked up and stood directly in front of me, hands on hips, his thin arms jutting out as he glared up at me. His thoughts on the matter were perfectly clear.</p><p>\u201cAnd of course Cody will have a say, as well.\u201d</p><p>At this rate I\u2019d need clearance from Chase, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d get back to me as soon as you can,\u201d</p> <p>Evelyn said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Slowly I replaced the receiver.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Cody wailed.</p><p>I looked down at him. \u201cCan we be kind enough to let Casey stay with us an entire week?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>My son shook his head. \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll call Ms. Boyle back and tell her it\u2019s impossible. Casey will have to pack her things and go.\u201d</p> <p>Cody studied his bare feet and shifted his weight from one leg to the other. \u201cJust a week, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Evelyn said.\u201d I didn\u2019t mention that a few hours before, the social worker had promised that it would be two nights at the most.</p><p>Cody chewed his lip. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I was of two minds, but compassion won out. It wouldn\u2019t be an easy adjustment for any of us. Casey wasn\u2019t going to make this pleasant. However, I\u2019d seen that glimmer of a smile in the young girl\u2019s eyes. When I\u2019d said Cody wasn\u2019t bad for a boy, Casey and I had connected for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Cody pressed.</p><p>\u201cIf your father agrees, I think it\u2019d be f ine for Casey to stay the week,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Cody muttered. \u201cBut only one week and she can\u2019t call me a baby ever again.\u201d He nodded emphatically, as if that settled the point.</p><p>Chapter 7</p> <p>Phoebe Rylander</p><p>At 5:20, forty minutes before her first knitting lesson, Phoebe left work. Clark didn\u2019t know about the class; her mother didn\u2019t, either. Phoebe couldn\u2019t explain why she preferred it that way; she just knew she did. It was hard not to answer the constant phone calls and messages, although she realized the sanest approach was simply to ignore them. She should have changed her home number, too, but that was more complicated, or so she told herself. She hated to admit that maybe, with one small part of her, she did want to hear from him. Still, she wasn\u2019t even sure whether Clark was calling because he wanted her back or because he couldn\u2019t tolerate what he saw as her rejection. Winning was everything to him. If their engagement was broken he wanted to be the one to call it off. He hadn\u2019t let up since she\u2019d returned his engagement ring. Phoebe badly needed a reprieve. The knitting class offered that. Although Leanne hadn\u2019t admitted it, Phoebe was fairly certain her mother had joined forces with Clark\u2019s parents and was doing everything in her power to repair the rift. What her mother, and more importantly, Clark, failed to understand was that Phoebe intended to keep the breakup permanent, no matter how much she wished it could be different.</p><p>Even now, knowing what he did, part of her yearned to believe that Clark didn\u2019t comprehend what he\u2019d done or why she was upset. But she\u2019d told him the f irst time\u2014she couldn\u2019t have been any clearer\u2014and this time she wouldn\u2019t give in. She couldn\u2019t. Phoebe knew his weakness for paid sex would continue after they were married. It was an addiction; it had to be. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t go on taking these ridiculous risks. Twice he\u2019d been arrested for solicitation, and heaven only knew how many other occasions there\u2019d been, occasions when he\u2019d been fortunate enough not to get caught. A woman off the streets, no less. If he was going to pay for sex, Phoebe would have assumed he\u2019d want a higher-class prostitute. Unless it was the danger that thrilled him? She sighed. None of this made sense to her. He\u2019d promised it would never happen again and she\u2019d reluctantly forgiven him that f irst time. She\u2019d believed he was sincere\u2014and yet he\u2019d succumbed again. She needed a man who\u2019d be completely committed to her and their relationship. Addiction, attraction to danger, whatever it was, Clark seemed either unwilling or unable to control it. She refused to put her emotional and physical health at risk because of his weakness. So far she\u2019d held out. Whenever she wavered, Clark seemed to sense that and bombarded her with notes and f lowers and gifts, all of which she\u2019d sent back. That didn\u2019t seem to bother him. If anything, he redoubled his efforts.</p><p>Rather than take her car out of the garage at work, Phoebe decided to walk the half mile or so to Blossom Street. She\u2019d brought her brand-new knitting bag, f illed with skeins of yarn in a restful sage-green color, her pattern and a pair of needles still in their clear plastic case. It was a lovely evening, but cool enough to require a sweater. Because she was early, she stopped at the French Caf\u00e9 and purchased a half sandwich, pastrami on rye with mustard, and a cup of coffee.</p><p>Since the breakup, her appetite had suffered and she\u2019d lost weight. This was the f irst hunger pang she\u2019d experienced in two weeks, which was an encouraging sign. It felt like years since she\u2019d been with Clark. That, too, was encouraging, and yet...</p><p>She struggled to hold back unexpected tears. The end of her engagement, the end of Clark\u2019s presence in her life, necessary though it was, had brought her such grief. This was so much harder than anyone else imagined, than anyone would ever know. To her friends and her mother she came across as determined and unshakable, but Clark lingered constantly in her mind. It would get better soon; she\u2019d told herself this so often that she\u2019d actually started to believe it. It had to.</p><p>Eventually this ache in her heart would lessen. However, right then, sitting by herself outside a caf\u00e9 on a perfect summer evening, watching couples wander past holding hands, made her feel ten times worse. Ten times as lonely...</p><p>She crossed the street to A Good Yarn at precisely six. While eating her meal, she\u2019d seen two other people walking into the yarn store and wondered if they were part of the Knit to Quit class, too. It didn\u2019t seem likely. One was a man and the other apparently a street-savvy teenager. The bell above the door jangled when she stepped inside, selfconsciously clutching her supplies.</p><p>\u201cHi, Phoebe,\u201d Lydia said, hurrying forward to greet her.</p><p>\u201cEveryone else is already here. Come on back and join us.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe followed her to the rear of the store. The teenager and the man had both taken places at a large table and looked up as she approached. So she was wrong\u2014these two were indeed part of the class. Well, it made for an interesting mix.</p><p>\u201cThis is Phoebe Rylander,\u201d Lydia said, slipping an arm around Phoebe\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, nervously wiggling her f ingers. The man stood and extended his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Bryan Hutchinson. Everyone calls me Hutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said. Normally Phoebe wasn\u2019t shy, but for some reason she felt awkward and unsure of herself. Maybe because this was a whole new venture for her, one that required skills she lacked. Although she\u2019d done a bit of knitting as a girl, she\u2019d never been very interested in any of the domestic crafts. Maybe that was about to change.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Alix, spelled with an I, \u201d the girl said. Her hair was black, probably dyed, and she wore it in a short, spiky fashion that suited her. She had on a leather jacket and jeans. When she\u2019d f irst noticed Alix-with-an- I, Phoebe had assumed she was a teenager, but on closer inspection she decided Alix had to be in her early twenties. The leather jacket was unzipped and revealed a cotton shirt with a lace collar in stark contrast to the rest of her appearance. She was obviously a bit unorthodox but that seemed rather charming to Phoebe. Smiling at Alix, who smiled back, Phoebe pulled out the chair next to her.</p><p>Lydia moved closer to the table. \u201cSince this is a Knit to Quit class, I thought it might be helpful if we each shared the reason we joined and what we\u2019re hoping to achieve by knitting.\u201d She looked at Alix. \u201cWould you mind starting us off, Alix?\u201d</p><p>The young woman shrugged. \u201cSure, why not. As you know by now, my name is Alix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith an I, \u201d Hutch inserted, grinning.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Alix gave him a cocky thumbs up. \u201cI assume Lydia asked me to begin because I\u2019ve taken classes here before. I learned to knit almost five years ago, when Lydia opened the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix was in my original class and has become one of my dearest friends,\u201d Lydia told them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed a lot since that f irst class,\u201d Alix went on to say.</p><p>\u201cBack then, I was pretty angry at the world. I\u2019d gotten a bum rap on a drug possession charge. I think the judge must\u2019ve realized that because he sentenced me to community service rather than jail.\u201d</p><p>Hutch leaned closer to the table. \u201cAnd you took up knitting as your community service? How did that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was knitting for charity. I got approval from the court to knit a baby blanket for Project Linus. I f igured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to learn something constructive for once in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Phoebe said, nodding. Alix certainly wasn\u2019t typical of other young women her age. But then again, maybe she was....</p><p>\u201cThe reason I signed up for this class is that I started smoking before Jordan and I were married. All the stuff going on before the wedding turned out to be pretty stressful and I decided I needed a cigarette. I told myself I\u2019d only smoke the one pack. As you might\u2019ve guessed it ended up being a lot more than that and now I\u2019m trying to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re married,\u201d Phoebe blurted out, then felt like a fool. \u201cI mean, you seem so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m older than I look.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cI hope it\u2019s my appearance and not my behavior that made you think I was younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Phoebe said.</p><p>\u201cDef initely,\u201d Hutch mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Jordan and I want to start a family. Before I get pregnant, I have to quit smoking. Knitting\u2019s helped me through other things and...here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re glad you are,\u201d Lydia told her. She turned to Hutch next. \u201cWhat about you, Hutch?\u201d</p><p>He was a nice-looking man, Phoebe thought, studying him across the table. It was diff icult to tell how old he was. Midthirties, she guessed\u2014although she\u2019d just proven she wasn\u2019t very good at judging age. He had pleasant, regular features and light-brown hair. Although she hated to admit it, he didn\u2019t possess the strong masculine appeal of Clark. He seemed like a regular guy, not that there was anything wrong with that. What Phoebe did like was how interested he was in what everyone had to say. Other than her boss, she didn\u2019t know many men who were good listeners. Hutch sat back in his chair. \u201cActually, my doctor\u2019s the one who suggested I try knitting. He\u2019s a college classmate of mine. I was in for my annual checkup recently and Dave lectured me about working too hard and not getting enough exercise. I\u2019m on medication for high blood pressure and, with a history of heart disease in the family, he felt I should f ind a method of relaxation. In fact,\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hutch said, \u201che told me he knits himself. I suppose that convinced me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour doctor\u2019s very wise.\u201d Lydia picked up the conversation.</p><p>\u201cVarious studies have shown the health benefits of knitting as a form of relaxation. And from personal experience, I\u2019d say that while our hands are at work on a project, we\u2019re able to quiet our thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Hutch nodded slowly. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve made an excellent choice. Obviously,\u201d she added with a quick grin.</p><p>\u201cDave also said knitting would aid the healing process with my thumb.\u201d He held up his right hand and showed where he\u2019d cut himself. The scar was red and ugly.</p><p>\u201cAnother good point,\u201d Lydia commented.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m here, but I have to tell you I\u2019ve never held a pair of knitting needles in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Lydia said. \u201cI\u2019ve taught people how to knit since I was a teenager. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll learn it easily.\u201d</p> <p>Hutch grinned. \u201cYour conf idence is reassuring.\u201d</p><p>Lydia turned to Phoebe and gestured toward her. \u201cPhoebe, can you tell us what prompted you to join Knit to Quit?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. Spilling her grief to strangers was more than she was ready to do. She stared up at Lydia. \u201cI was engaged and...\u201d</p><p>What came out next was a complete surprise. She certainly hadn\u2019t intended to lie, although the truth embarrassed and humiliated her. \u201cMy f ianc\u00e9 died.\u201d</p><p>Lydia\u2019s eyes softened with sympathy. \u201cOh, Phoebe, I had no idea. I...I thought\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I thought. I\u2019m so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get over him,\u201d she said and swallowed hard. Tears clogged her throat and she struggled to hide the fact that she was close to weeping.</p> <p>Thankfully no one asked for the details of Clark\u2019s supposed demise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Alix said. Leaning across the table, she gently squeezed her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to imagine what it would be like if I lost Jordan.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe avoided their eyes. It was bad enough that she\u2019d lied, but now she\u2019d be obliged to continue with the charade. Everyone\u2019s sympathy only added to her guilt. Although Hutch hadn\u2019t spoken, his gaze was caring, concerned.</p><p>Blindly Phoebe unwrapped her knitting needles, indicating she was ready for class to begin.</p><p>Responding to her cue, Lydia held out the scarf pattern. \u201cI chose this Bev Galeskas pattern because I feel everyone can knit this, no matter what level they are. It starts with the basic stitch.\u201d</p><p>She reached into a bag behind her and brought out a scarf in soft gray wool. \u201cI knit this up so everyone could see the f inished project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could knit that? \u201d Hutch asked, sounding shocked.</p><p>\u201cWe all will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure I can do that?\u201d</p><p>Alix laughed. \u201cI felt the same way in my f irst class when Lydia showed me the baby blanket. I guarantee you\u2019ll be impressed with yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll impress my sister, anyway.\u201d He smiled at Lydia. \u201cIf mine turns out even half as good as yours, I thought I\u2019d give it to her for her birthday.\u201d</p><p>His sister? If he\u2019d mentioned his sister rather than his wife, that probably meant he wasn\u2019t married. Phoebe wasn\u2019t in any mood to get romantically involved, but she felt increasingly curious about Hutch. His personality seemed the opposite of Clark\u2019s. He didn\u2019t need to be the center of attention and, instead, listened carefully to everyone else. As far as Phoebe was concerned, that was a rare quality. He might look ordinary but even on short acquaintance she could see that he was anything but.</p><p>Before they cast on stitches, Lydia described the pattern and explained that reading it over f irst prevented mistakes later. She also offered to photocopy their patterns to use as \u201cworking copies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat way the copied sheet can be marked up and carried with the project. Then if it\u2019s lost, the original is always available.\u201d</p><p>After that, Lydia demonstrated how to cast on stitches. The skill came back to Phoebe faster than she\u2019d thought it would. Sitting beside Hutch, Lydia reviewed the technique with him repeatedly. He followed her instructions carefully and although he found it diff icult to hold the needles and yarn and cast on at the same time, he never once lost patience. Phoebe couldn\u2019t picture Clark not throwing the needles and yarn down in disgust. Clark.</p><p>How easily he\u2019d slipped into her mind, despite her resolve. Forcing herself to concentrate, she knit methodically to the end of the row. Then the next one...</p><p>About an hour into the class, the phone rang. Lydia excused herself and moved to the front counter.</p><p>From what Phoebe could hear, this call was of a personal nature.</p><p>\u201cWater balloons in the house?\u201d Lydia gasped at one point, covering her eyes with her free hand.</p><p>When she returned a few minutes later, she looked troubled. Alix was the one who broached the subject. \u201cIs everything all right with Cody and Brad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure. We have a houseguest, and it appears that she\u2019s managed to ruff le a few feathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is your guest staying?\u201d Hutch asked.</p><p>\u201cA week.\u201d She frowned but didn\u2019t volunteer any further information. It was still light out when the class was off icially over. As Phoebe gathered up her knitting bag and her purse, the shop door opened and a clean-cut young man walked in.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d Alix said, her voice elevated. \u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>The man went over to Alix and slid his arm around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d stop by and pick you up.\u201d</p><p>Alix smiled at Hutch and Phoebe. \u201cThis is my husband, Jordan Turner.\u201d</p><p>Jordan exchanged handshakes with both of them. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Seeing the love between Alix and her husband brought an unexpected twinge of pain. Phoebe averted her eyes. She remembered when Clark\u2014 She immediately halted her thoughts.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t going to think about him. While it had been an outright lie to say he was dead, it was, in a manner of speaking, the truth. He was dead to her. The sooner that message went from her head to her heart, the sooner she\u2019d get over him. The sooner this agony would stop.</p><p>Phoebe wished everyone a good evening and hurried out the door. Hutch was right behind her. A couple of times in the past two hours she\u2019d tried to include him in the conversation. Hutch, however, had been so focused on learning the basic knit and purl stitches that he hadn\u2019t looked up even once. Phoebe admired his persistence.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, Phoebe,\u201d he said now, clutching the briefcase that held his yarn and needles.</p><p>They stood on the sidewalk facing each other. \u201cYou, too,\u201d</p><p>she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your f ianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know... I am, too.\u201d She glanced away, uncomfortable about perpetuating the lie.</p><p>\u201cAre you parked close by?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cRelatively close. I left my car at the parking garage where I work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I give you a ride there?\u201d</p><p>It was a kind offer, but Phoebe refused. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll enjoy the walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. See you next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe did enjoy the stroll. It\u2019d been an interesting class and she\u2019d look forward to spending time with Alix, Hutch and Lydia next week. This was the f irst night in a long while that she hadn\u2019t been consumed by the loneliness that haunted her evenings. Her one regret was the lie. Still, it had saved her from diff icult explanations that she preferred not to share. Phoebe entered the condo lobby and headed for the elevator, wondering about Lydia and her situation at home. She\u2019d obviously been disturbed by that phone call and\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>She whirled around to f ind Clark standing directly behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded. No way was she answering his questions.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing here? I\u2019ve been waiting for you for the last two hours. Phoebe, this can\u2019t go on. I\u2019m miserable without you. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClark...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out. Please.\u201d</p><p>She had to close her eyes for fear of being inf luenced by the expression on his face, the pleading in his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>To her great relief, the elevator arrived and she dashed inside.</p><p>\u201cJust go!\u201d</p><p>Clark stuck his arm between the doors, effectively keeping them open. \u201cAnswer me one thing and then I\u2019ll leave.\u201d His gaze beseeched hers. \u201cTell me that while I sat here for two hours, you weren\u2019t out with another man. I couldn\u2019t bear that, Phoebe. I could take anything but that.\u201d</p><p>What he couldn\u2019t take was losing, she thought. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she decided it was best to tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not seeing anyone else.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and whispered \u201cThank you.\u201d Then he stepped back as the elevator doors slid closed.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>They\u2019d been home for a week, but Anne Marie was only now rediscovering the routine of her life. She sat in her small off ice at the store and paid the bills that had accumulated in her absence, although her mind drifted frequently from the task at hand. Memories of Paris were still with her. Sainte Chapelle had taken her breath away. A visit to the magnif icent N\u00f4tre Dame had humbled her and the ride up the Eiffel Tower had thrilled her. Boat trips on the Seine, the Louvre, meals at charming little bistros... The trip had been everything Anne Marie had dreamed and more.</p><p>Ellen had barely been able to absorb it all, and Anne Marie felt the same mixture of awe and wonder. Now that she\u2019d had the experience, all she could think about was returning. Anne Marie was delighted by Ellen\u2019s ability to learn French. She picked it up with ease, hearing words once or twice and remembering them. Anne Marie wanted her to retain as much as possible and Ellen practiced every chance she got, especially on Baxter. Because of their special communication, the dog seemed to understand her, no matter what language Ellen spoke. It was the modulation in the child\u2019s voice that cued the dog, or so Anne Marie assumed. In any case, Baxter had quickly learned assis for \u201csit\u201d and parle for \u201cspeak.\u201d</p><p>During the remainder of the summer Ellen would be going to the day camp associated with the Free Methodist church around the corner. The program was reasonably priced and Ellen seemed to like it. Cody Goetz attended, too. So did Casey, Lydia and Brad\u2019s foster girl, although that was only supposed to be for just a few more days. The church camp sponsored frequent f ield trips, plus craft classes and sports activities. Jordan Turner, Alix\u2019s husband, headed the program, with the assistance of several young staffers.</p><p>Shortly after the adoption, Anne Marie and Ellen had started going to Sunday school and morning worship services. As a new mother, even if her baby was almost nine at the time, Anne Marie felt it was the right thing to do.</p><p>She\u2019d fallen out of the habit of church attendance after she\u2019d separated from Robert. Later, when the husband she loved had died\u2014as they were on the verge of reconciling\u2014Anne Marie had been angry with God. So angry... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>However, she knew that a strong religious upbringing was something Ellen\u2019s grandmother had wanted for her only grandchild. Dolores Falk had loved her granddaughter deeply, and Anne Marie felt a responsibility to do as Dolores had requested. Anne Marie understood that Dolores\u2019s love had protected the girl. Fortunately Ellen\u2019s birth mother, Dolores\u2019s daughter, who\u2019d fallen into a life of drugs and crime, had surrendered all parental rights. This had made it possible for Anne Marie to adopt the child.</p><p>Teresa stuck her head in the off ice. \u201cHe\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>Lost in her thoughts, Anne Marie glanced up. \u201cWho\u2019s back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who came by when you and Ellen were in Paris,\u201d</p><p>Teresa said, sounding a little impatient.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Anne Marie hadn\u2019t actually forgotten but she\u2019d relegated the matter to the bottom of her list. \u201cHas he asked to speak to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but I guarantee that\u2019s what he\u2019s here to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Anne Marie pushed away from her desk and rose to her feet.</p><p>Teresa remained standing in the doorway. She winked outrageously at Anne Marie, then lowered her voice. \u201cHe\u2019s still hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeresa! You\u2019re a married woman.\u201d</p><p>Her friend grinned from ear to ear. \u201cTrue, but I\u2019m not blind.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie came around her desk and stepped quietly out of the off ice. Sure enough, a man stood at the counter, a man whose gaze went instantly to her face. Over the course of her life, men had often looked at her. She knew she was reasonably attractive and yet the look this man gave her expressed more than casual interest, more than mere appreciation. His gaze was intent, meaningful, even expectant. Anne Marie felt confused by it.</p><p>She moved behind the counter by the cash register. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked, keeping her voice cool and yet polite.</p> <p>\u201cAre you Anne Marie Roche?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She wondered again why this strikingly handsome man was seeking her out. Most likely he was here to sell her insurance or to show her a new gift line. She\u2019d never seen him before, so it couldn\u2019t be anything personal. Which was just as well; attractive though he was, Anne Marie could only respond to him in an abstract way. Since Robert\u2019s death, she hadn\u2019t been interested in dating. And once Ellen entered her life, her entire world had begun to revolve around her daughter.</p><p>His demeanor changed. His eyes narrowed ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tim Carlsen.\u201d</p><p>What was that about? If he was a salesman, he hadn\u2019t bothered with a friendly approach. \u201cHello, Tim,\u201d she said, refusing to allow him to intimidate her. \u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Teresa, who\u2019d busied herself organizing a display of new children\u2019s books. She did her best to pretend she wasn\u2019t listening in on the conversation, although she couldn\u2019t avoid hearing it.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask what this is about?\u201d Anne Marie asked, trying again.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be better if we spoke privately,\u201d Tim said.</p> <p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened his shoulders. \u201cEllen,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThis is in regard to the child you\u2019ve recently adopted.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie felt the oxygen rush from her lungs. But rather than reveal her surprise, she gestured calmly toward her off ice. She felt paralyzed as she tried to f igure out what possible connection this man could have to her daughter. The birth certif icate hadn\u2019t named a father, and yet...</p><p>Inside the off ice, she took her seat behind the desk. Tim pulled up a chair across from her, not waiting for an invitation.</p><p>\u201cYou know my daughter?\u201d she asked, wanting to make sure he understood that no one else had any legal right to the child. Her visitor shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that I do not.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, this information reassured Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about Ellen, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only heard of her.\u201d Tim stared at the f loor. \u201cI\u2019m a recovering alcoholic with eight years\u2019 sobriety.\u201d</p><p>Heard of her how? was the f irst thing she wanted to ask. But she had no idea how to respond to his confession, nor did she understand why he felt it was necessary to tell her such a personal fact.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said tentatively, \u201cbut what\u2019s that got to do with Ellen or me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Candy Falk at probably the lowest point in my life,\u201d he continued, ignoring her question.</p><p>No one needed to remind Anne Marie that Candy Falk was Ellen\u2019s birth mother and a known drug addict.</p><p>\u201cBack then Candy and I were both using.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs?\u201d</p><p>Tim nodded. \u201cDrugs, all kinds of drugs, you name it. But also alcohol. It wasn\u2019t a good time.... Like I said, it was a low point for me.\u201d</p><p>A tingling spread down Anne Marie\u2019s neck. Her suspicion had been correct. She was starting to connect the dots and she didn\u2019t like the picture that was taking shape in her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me what any of this has to do with my daughter,\u201d she said curtly. Ellen was part of Anne Marie\u2019s life now. A very precious part, and she wasn\u2019t about to let some man\u2014 some stranger\u2014step in and make a claim.</p><p>Again Tim ignored her question. \u201cCandy and I broke up, and my family arranged for me to enter rehab. I\u2019ve been clean and sober ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI follow the twelve steps and traditions of AA. With my sponsor\u2019s support, I\u2019ve begun making amends wherever possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good of you, but I don\u2019t see what any of this has to do with Ellen or me.\u201d As far as Anne Marie was concerned, this conversation was over. She stood and motioned toward the door.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down, Ms. Roche.\u201d</p><p>Her resolve melted under the force of his gaze and Anne Marie slowly sank back into her chair.</p><p>\u201cAs part of my attempt to make amends, I tried to locate Candy,\u201d Tim said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t f ind her but I remembered where her mother used to live.\u201d He looked away. \u201cI needed her forgiveness, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDolores?\u201d</p><p>He spoke in a clear, even voice. \u201cCandy and I stole money from her mother and I wanted to return it.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie swallowed. This was only a fraction, a tiny fraction, of the pain Candy Falk had brought into her mother\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cI remembered the house where Candy had taken me, but it was empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to hear. \u201cThe neighbor was watering her rosebushes and we got to talking. She said Dolores had passed away some time ago and that her grandchild had been adopted.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cI asked where Candy was, but the neighbor didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>This was information Anne Marie was willing to pass along.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, either. Someplace in California, I think. I understand she\u2019s still an addict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected as much,\u201d he said with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad....\u201d In case Tim hadn\u2019t heard, she added, \u201cEllen\u2019s aunt, Clarisse, is in prison.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and there was a brief silence. \u201cI asked the neighbor a few more questions,\u201d he said a moment later, \u201cand found out that Dolores had custody of a little girl\u2014Candy\u2019s daughter. When I inquired about the child, the neighbor told me Ellen was eight when her grandmother died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nine now.\u201d</p><p>Tim looked directly into her eyes. \u201cIt was almost ten years ago that Candy and I lived together. We...didn\u2019t use any form of birth control. It hit me that there\u2019s a possibility Ellen might be my daughter.\u201d</p><p>This was what Anne Marie had feared he was about to say. She was ending his visit right now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken, Mr. Carlsen. Ellen couldn\u2019t possibly be your daughter,\u201d Anne Marie insisted. \u201cEllen is my child, and I have the paperwork to prove it.\u201d Bolting to her feet once again, she planted her hands on the edge of her desk. \u201cI think you should leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tim didn\u2019t move and his dark eyes burned into hers. \u201cI understand this comes as a shock and I apologize for that. All I\u2019m asking for is the truth. I want to know if I\u2019m Ellen\u2019s father. I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s an unreasonable request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it is unreasonable. Ellen has been adopted by me. As I just explained, Ellen is my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you adopted her did you receive parental consent?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie felt she owed him nothing more than the bare facts. \u201cYour name isn\u2019t on the birth certif icate and the state had no way of contacting you, even if it does turn out that you\u2019re Ellen\u2019s biological father.\u201d</p><p>Tim\u2019s features tightened. \u201cI haven\u2019t stopped thinking about her from the moment I heard Candy had a baby.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t know is that after we split and I was in rehab, Candy twice attempted to contact me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never read her letter or returned her phone call,\u201d he said, interrupting her. \u201cAs far as I was concerned, she was bad news and involved in a life I no longer wanted to live. It\u2019s stupid of me, I guess, but it never occurred to me that she might be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie spoke slowly, trying to ensure that everything was clear. \u201cCandy Falk rescinded all parental rights. Nothing can be done to change this. It\u2019s over and done with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then you also realize that you have no rights whatsoever with regard to Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have rights.\u201d He obviously wasn\u2019t willing to back down and glared at her unflinchingly. \u201cIf Ellen\u2019s my child, and I have every reason to believe she is, then I want to know her. She has a right to know me, too.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie shook her head. \u201cWhether Ellen is your biological daughter or not isn\u2019t the issue. Ellen has another family now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother father?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hesitated.</p><p>\u201cAre you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. It\u2019s very much my business. Perhaps I should speak with your husband,\u201d Tim said. He seemed to think he was calling her bluff or, worse, that he\u2019d be able to reason with another man. Either way, his suggestion infuriated her.</p><p>Anne Marie paused, unwilling to admit that she was widowed. She saw that he\u2019d noticed her silence and hurriedly added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s impossible just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of taking Ellen away from you.\u201d</p><p>She nearly laughed out loud. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try. As I keep telling you, Ellen is my child now, my daughter. Whether or not she\u2019s related to you is beside the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is to you. However, to me, it\u2019s vital. If I\u2019m Ellen\u2019s biological father, I should at least have the opportunity to meet my own daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that,\u201d Anne Marie said, refusing to bend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never knew Candy was pregnant,\u201d he told her again. \u201cI might\u2019ve been a lot of things over the years, but at no time would I have abandoned my own f lesh and blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very noble of you, Mr. Carlsen, but as I said, it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in the AA rules that will help you sort it all out. My advice is to let go of this. Ellen\u2019s happy. She has a good life with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with your husband?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cMy husband...\u201d</p> <p>Tim\u2019s eyes narrowed and she could tell he already knew she was widowed. His earlier remarks had been a bluff of his own. Continuing the pretense would be senseless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ellen\u2019s family now,\u201d Anne Marie said, sidestepping the question. She was finished with this conversation. \u201cI believe it\u2019s time you left, Mr. Carlsen, otherwise I\u2019ll have to call the authorities.\u201d</p><p>Tim slowly stood. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get an attorney involved, but I will if I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d</p><p>Tim waited a moment, as if undecided what to do next. After several seconds, he said, \u201cThank you for seeing me.\u201d</p> <p>Arms folded, Anne Marie nodded abruptly.</p><p>Tim walked out of the off ice, and Anne Marie sat down again, so shaken that she started to tremble.</p><p>A few minutes later, Teresa stepped into the off ice. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d she asked. Anne Marie managed a wobbly smile. \u201cNot really...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Teresa watched her carefully. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie braced her elbows on the desk and covered her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.... I need time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can help in any way, just let me know,\u201d Teresa urged.</p> <p>Anne Marie murmured a thank-you. It would take a while to f igure out what to do about this diff icult conversation\u2014</p><p>including the fact that Tim had threatened legal action. Fine, she\u2019d f ight him with every resource she possessed. First, however, she needed to f ind out what her own rights were. Her hand shook as she f lipped through the Rolodex on the corner of her desk until she came to Evelyn Boyle\u2019s name. Evelyn, as a social worker, knew adoption law. Evelyn would be able to tell Anne Marie her rights.</p><p>Her heart felt as though it might implode. She\u2019d already lost her husband, becoming a widow at the age of thirty-eight. Then life had taken a wonderful and unexpected turn and brought her Ellen. Anne Marie wasn\u2019t going to give the child up. Not for anyone.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>We don\u2019t knit to make things.

Casey had been with us for almost a week. Before I left the shop, I\u2019d gotten no less than three phone calls from Cody and had talked with Brad an equal number of times. Each and every one of those calls had been about Casey. The girl had created a complete upheaval in our peaceful family life. As Evelyn had said, there were a few adjustment problems. She\u2019d also predicted that the kids would accept each other in a day or two; it hadn\u2019t happened. Brad felt inadequate to deal with the conf lict between Cody and Casey on his own. He seemed to think I\u2019d handle it better, but I wasn\u2019t really sure what to do, either.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d I called as I entered the kitchen through the door that led from the garage. I realized an announcement had been unnecessary. Both Cody and Brad were waiting for me. The relief on their faces was comical and they released a collective sigh at my arrival.</p><p>I kissed my husband on the cheek. As he usually did, Brad had started dinner\u2014chicken and Spanish rice. Casey sat at the kitchen table with her head bent over one of my cookbooks, open to the section on baking. I found that interesting but knew better than to comment.</p><p>Cody scowled at her from the other side of the room. \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d he said, then added \u201cprivately\u201d in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agreed. I went over and hugged him, but he remained stiff and angry.</p><p>It took me a moment to divest myself of my purse and bag and to change shoes. \u201cHow was school?\u201d I asked Casey, coming back into the kitchen.</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d I decided to ask a question that required an actual response.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything.\u201d The words, as well as her body language, were def iant.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but let me know if you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you and Dad now? \u201d Cody asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay by me,\u201d Brad told him. He turned down the burner under the pan of rice. The chicken was in the oven, and it would be about half an hour before the evening meal was ready.</p><p>\u201cWould you excuse us for a few minutes?\u201d I asked Casey. Once again she didn\u2019t bother to respond. Brad and I left the kitchen. Cody led us into his bedroom with Chase a step or two behind. He waited until we were inside, then f irmly closed the door. Brad and I sat next to each other on Cody\u2019s sloppily made bed and my husband reached for my hand.</p><p>Before Brad could even ask what this was all about, Cody whirled around, frowning at us. \u201cI don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCody...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s rude and mean and she said I\u2019m spoiled and called me a baby\u2014right to my face!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCody\u2014\u201d Brad tried again, but our son was in no mood to be reasonable.</p><p>\u201cThe three of us talked about adopting, remember?\u201d Cody asked. \u201cAnd I said okay, and you said you\u2019d listen to what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll listen! But Casey will only be with us a couple more days\u2014at the most,\u201d I reminded him. It wasn\u2019t as though the girl was about to become part of our family.</p><p>\u201cShe was supposed to stay two nights and now she\u2019s here for a whole week.\u201d Cody\u2019s eyes f lashed with indignation.</p><p>\u201cSeeing that you let her stay longer than you said, I have a list of demands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA list? \u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cDemands?\u201d Brad arched his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and read us your list,\u201d I said. I felt we owed Cody that much. He was right; the situation had changed without warning and without real discussion. Granted, he was nine years old; he wouldn\u2019t be making decisions for the family. But this did affect him and we needed to acknowledge his feelings\u2014and accommodate them where we could. The fact that Cody had actually been thinking about the possibility of adoption pleased me. I wanted open communication among all of us, especially when it came to something as important as bringing a baby into our family.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will.\u201d Cody marched to the end of his bed, slipped his hand under the mattress and took out a folded piece of paper. Chase hovered near the door, watching him.</p><p>Brad and I exchanged a look of surprise and made an effort to hide our amusement. Apparently Cody was upset enough to reveal his secret hiding place without even realizing it. Chase settled on the braided rug beside the bed and rested his chin on his paws as his dark eyes followed Cody. He seemed a little uneasy, no doubt because he was so sensitive to our son\u2019s moods. Standing directly in front of us, Cody unfolded the single sheet of paper, then cleared his throat. \u201cDemand number one. If you\u2019re going to adopt another kid, I want a brother, not a sister.\u201d</p><p>Brad sighed. \u201cWe won\u2019t necessarily have a say in the matter, Cody. It would be the same as if Lydia were to get pregnant. We wouldn\u2019t know until much later if it was a boy or a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a brother, \u201d Cody insisted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best to get you a brother,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat else is on your, uh, list of demands?\u201d Brad asked in a serious voice.</p><p>\u201cI get to be the oldest kid in the family.\u201d He looked directly at us, his mouth a straight, angry line. \u201cI was here first, right? If you bring in some other kid, then that kid can\u2019t be the boss of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fair,\u201d Brad assured our son. I nodded. He seemed shocked by our agreement. \u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make it a real promise,\u201d Brad said, \u201cbecause we won\u2019t know the age until we decide on the child our family would like to adopt. But we\u2019re asking for a baby, so it\u2019s probably not an issue.\u201d</p><p>Cody seemed somewhat mollified.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cody looked at us again and his face tightened with determination. \u201cI\u2019m not giving in on this,\u201d he said, sounding as though he was engaged in some high-level diplomatic negotiation. Well, I guess from his point of view, he was. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t say yes, then I don\u2019t want anything to do with our family getting another kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear it,\u201d Brad said.</p><p>\u201cI want full approval.\u201d He spoke with such fervor his voice trembled. \u201cI get to say which kid we adopt. If I don\u2019t like \u2019em, they can\u2019t live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your dad said, we\u2019re hoping for a baby, so I think that should meet your demand. We\u2019ll request a boy...although it might take a while.\u201d I was discouraged by how long the list of potential parents already was.</p><p>Mildly appeased, Cody glanced down at the dog. \u201cChase gets approval, too.\u201d</p><p>I almost started to giggle, but Brad frowned. \u201cSon, listen, I know you\u2019re upset because Casey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to make sure you aren\u2019t going to adopt her, \u201d he cried.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brad said evenly. \u201cAs Lydia\u2019s explained, Casey\u2019s stay with us is temporary.\u201d</p><p>I heard a noise outside the door and I suspected Casey had been standing on the other side, listening to our conversation. When I returned to the kitchen, however, she was sitting at the table, exactly as we\u2019d left her.</p><p>I prepared the salad and asked Casey to clear the table so we could set it for dinner. Silently she removed the cookbook, returning it to the shelf. I wondered how she was doing in her math class, but she never volunteered any information and evaded my questions. She hadn\u2019t asked for help, so I assumed all was well. Casey took the plates down from the cupboard and added glasses and silverware. Although I tried to make conversation, she remained uncommunicative, even stoic.</p><p>\u201cCasey,\u201d I said gently. I placed my hand on her shoulder, hoping to reassure her. She shrugged it off as if she found my touch repulsive. I forged ahead, feeling I needed to say something just in case she\u2019d heard part of our conversation with Cody. \u201cI know being here is uncomfortable for you and I apologize. I feel we\u2019ve been exceedingly rude. You are most welcome in our home.\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and for an instant, for the briefest f licker of time, I saw pain in her eyes. It was quickly gone, replaced by anger and defiance.</p><p>Dinner was a miserable affair. Casey didn\u2019t utter a single word, nor did she bother to eat more than a couple of bites. Cody didn\u2019t do much better. Although Spanish rice was one of his favorites, his plate was practically untouched. A war of wills seemed to be taking place between Cody and Casey and they glared openly at each other across the table. Brad and I made several attempts to find a safe topic of conversation, but apparently there was none. Neither child responded to our comments about movies or my cat\u2019s clever antics or anything else, and by the time they left the table, I felt exhausted. As soon as they were excused, both kids disappeared into their bedrooms. Brad sighed and I shook my head, hardly knowing what to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was an unqualified disaster,\u201d he said, keeping his voice low. I could only agree.</p><p>\u201cIs there any chance Evelyn could f ind another foster home for Casey?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. I suppose I can call her.\u201d I hated the thought, but one more meal like this and we\u2019d be at each other\u2019s throats. Brad looked as discouraged as I did. \u201cI guess we should let her stay until the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d brief ly discussed keeping her until classes were f inished, but that was out of the question now. The current situation wasn\u2019t working. I\u2019d had no idea that two children could take such an immediate and uncompromising dislike to each other. Cody, I could understand. Casey had been thrust upon him without warning. If there\u2019d been time to talk to him beforehand, I was sure he would\u2019ve welcomed\u2014or at least accepted\u2014her. And I suppose Casey\u2019s attitude sprang from a natural defensiveness, given her background. Cody was in bed by nine and while Brad went in to say goodnight and hear his prayers, I decided to check on Casey. I hadn\u2019t heard a peep out of her since she\u2019d gone into her room and closed the door.</p> <p>I knocked quietly, waited a moment and when there was no response, I let myself in. \u201cCasey?\u201d I whispered. I could see that she was already in bed, facing the wall. Either she was asleep or pretending to be; I assumed it was the latter. Coming all the way into the room, I bent over and laid my hand lightly on her back.</p><p>She jerked away from me. I stood there for several minutes, wondering what I should say. A dozen possible remarks swirled around in my head. I felt terribly inadequate to console her, and yet I knew I had to try.</p><p>\u201cHow many foster homes have you been in?\u201d I asked her. She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cMore than f ive?\u201d</p><p>Casey nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI want you to meet my friend Alix. She was a foster kid, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>The question brought me up short. I hadn\u2019t really expected her to respond. \u201cAlix,\u201d I repeated. \u201cShe took a knitting class from me soon after I opened my yarn store. She knit a baby blanket in order to satisfy some community service hours she was assigned by the court.\u201d I\u2019d offered to teach Casey, too, but she\u2019d declined, claiming she wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>I waited for a comment or another question, and when none came, I said, \u201cAlix works at the French Caf\u00e9 across the street from me now.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Apparently that one-word question a few minutes earlier was all the response I was going to get. \u201cYou\u2019ll be with a new family soon and you can settle in there.\u201d</p> <p>Again nothing.</p><p>\u201cRemember, if you want to learn to knit, I\u2019ll be happy to teach you.\u201d</p><p>Casey scrambled closer to the wall as if the very idea of me teaching her anything disgusted her. After a few more minutes, I tiptoed out of the room, feeling frustrated and depressed. Brad met me in the hallway outside the bedrooms. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBadly. What about Cody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants her gone.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI feel terrible for her,\u201d I said. \u201cI just wish there was something I could say or do that would help. She\u2019s upset about being removed from her last foster home and the fact that she has to be with us.\u201d The home where she\u2019d been earlier had been closed by the state because of some code violations. Evelyn hadn\u2019t provided more than the scantiest details. I didn\u2019t know what the circumstances had been, and I couldn\u2019t ask Casey.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad kid,\u201d Brad murmured as he headed for our bedroom. \u201cUnfortunately, she just isn\u2019t a good f it for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a couple more days,\u201d I reminded him, not for the f irst time.</p> <p>While Brad showered, I slipped into my nightclothes and climbed into bed. I\u2019d been looking forward to teaching Casey to knit. I suppose it was naive of me to think I could initiate some sort of communication with her through knitting. I\u2019d seen it work so well with others that I\u2019d been hopeful, despite her unambiguous refusal. I picked up the book I was reading\u2014a biography of C. S. Lewis\u2014</p><p>which I thought was laudably ambitious. I generally read every night before I fall asleep; Brad does, too. I f ind it comforting to lie beside my husband, each of us with a book in our hands. I see it as a period of calm and intimacy, and as the perfect metaphor\u2014</p><p>together, yet individual\u2014for our marriage.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before Brad joined me, his hair still wet from the shower. I smiled at him and began to speak, then paused when I heard a noise.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d I asked in a low voice. He glanced up from his book. \u201cHear what?\u201d</p><p>I listened hard, then shook my head.</p><p>A moment later I heard it again. \u201cBrad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so sure and was just about to go and investigate when Chase started to bark.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone in the house,\u201d I said in a hoarse whisper, trying to hide my panic. There\u2019d been a rash of home invasions in the news lately and an intruder was the f irst thought that came to me.</p><p>\u201cI locked all the doors,\u201d Brad said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I told him, but he was already out of bed, reaching for his pants. \u201cStay here,\u201d he instructed me.</p><p>\u201cShould I call 9-1-1?\u201d I asked, surprised by how tightly my throat muscles had constricted.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He creaked open our bedroom door and turned on the hallway light.</p><p>Unable to remain passively behind, I followed him and quickly discovered the same thing he had. Casey\u2019s bedroom door was open.</p><p>\u201cCasey!\u201d</p><p>Brad called her name, hurrying down the narrow hallway. I rounded the corner into the foyer and saw that my husband had taken hold of the girl\u2019s arm, his face f lushed with anger. \u201cI caught her walking out the front door,\u201d he said accusingly.</p><p>\u201cCasey?\u201d I said. \u201cWere you running away?\u201d</p><p>She gazed down at the living room carpet. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me here and I don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would you go?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at me then, her eyes f lashing with anger. \u201cWhat do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d I insisted, stretching out one arm but careful not to touch her. \u201cRunning away never solved anything. Listen, we\u2019re all going to try harder. It would help if you gave us a chance, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>Cody was up now, standing blurry-eyed with Chase beside him, watching us. Casey stared at him and he stared back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only until Friday,\u201d Brad promised, and it was as much a promise to her as it was to us. \u201cCan you last that long, Casey?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She gave him the same silent treatment she had me.</p><p>\u201cYou should stay,\u201d Cody said.</p><p>I wanted to hug my son for his generous heart. I knew it had taken a great deal for him to say those words. I\u2019d never loved him more.</p><p>\u201cFriday\u2014another two days. If you can stick it out, so can we,\u201d</p><p>Brad said, trying again. \u201cCan you do that?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Casey nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, agreed.\u201d Brad sounded relieved. So was I.</p><p>\u201cNo more of this, right?\u201d I said.</p><p>Casey met my eyes, then Cody\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll stay, but I won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>With that Casey went down the hall, past Cody and Chase, and into her bedroom, closing the door hard. After she was gone, Cody returned to his own room, holding Chase by the collar. Brad slid one arm around my waist and I leaned against him as I tried to absorb what had just happened. I\u2019d noticed that Casey had made enough noise to alert us to her escape plans. That told me she didn\u2019t really want to go. She wanted us to stop her. For the f irst time since her arrival, I started to think I might actually understand this rejected child. I prayed we could prove to her that we did care.</p><p>All of us, even Cody.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>\u201cHutch\u201d Hutchinson</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Hutch hung up the phone after speaking with his attorney, John Custer. He could feel his blood pressure rising. John, who\u2019d been a longtime friend and conf idant of his father\u2019s, had suggested a settlement offer to the nuisance lawsuit. The woman who\u2019d f iled was in her forties. Her ridiculous claim was that Mount Rainier Chocolates had caused her to gain weight; furthermore, because she was overweight, she was viewed in a prejudicial light by prospective employers. But Hutch hadn\u2019t forced her to consume his candy. She was the one who\u2019d chosen to overeat.</p><p>What had happened to self-discipline? Hutch wondered as he often did these days. It wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d added an addictive element to his chocolate or crammed them into her mouth. As far as Hutch was concerned, if he gave in to this lawsuit he was making himself\u2014and every other candy manufacturer\u2014vulnerable to a thousand more. This lawsuit was an opportunistic attempt to repeat what had happened with the tobacco companies years earlier. What he really wanted, he decided as he leaned back in his off ice chair, was for this woman to withdraw her suit. But there was no chance of that, since the plaintiff\u2014no doubt encouraged by her attorney\u2014saw the suit as an opportunity for easy cash. Gail tapped politely at his door.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, far more waspishly than he\u2019d meant to. His assistant came into his off ice. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to know your mother just pulled into the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Hutch nodded and didn\u2019t hesitate to apologize. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to snap at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She forgave him with a faint smile. \u201cThat was John Custer on the phone, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt looks like this lawsuit\u2019s going all the way to court.\u201d His wasn\u2019t the only company that had been faced with nuisance suits, many of which were settled out of court, as John was quick to remind him. A settlement was easier than suffering through the ordeal of taking the matter to a jury. According to John, juries were f ickle and there were no guarantees. Hutch wished he knew what his father would\u2019ve done. Perhaps he was foolish not to listen to his attorney\u2019s advice.</p><p>\u201cOh, Hutch, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gail was saying.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d</p><p>If this lawsuit did end up in the courtroom, the media would inevitably come into play. They might not show him in a sympathetic light, either. His father had once told him there was no such thing as bad publicity, but Hutch wasn\u2019t convinced. And he could do without the stress of this ludicrous situation.</p><p>\u201cShould I send your mother in?\u201d Gail asked on her way out the door.</p><p>Hutch nodded. He felt protective toward his mother and, as much as possible, tried to spare her any worry. In return, she felt it was her duty to look after him, to enquire about his diet and whether he got enough sleep and had enough of a social life. In most instances Hutch didn\u2019t mind. Lately, however, she\u2019d been on this marriage kick. She said it was because she didn\u2019t want him to repeat his father\u2019s mistakes and bury himself in work.</p><p>Bury, in his father\u2019s case, had been the literal truth. The company had killed him, and after his latest medical checkup, Hutch could see that he was headed in the same direction. Well aware of his tendency to work too hard and too long, he was taking measures to prevent that. The knitting class was a good example, along with his gym membership. He cringed, remembering that he\u2019d only been there once, the day he\u2019d plunked down his membership fee. He resolved to start exercising that very afternoon\u2014no more excuses or delays. A few minutes later, Gail opened his door and his mother stepped inside, a frown on her usually serene face. She was dressed for a day on the town, in a crisp lavender pantsuit with a matching purse and shoes. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you all week,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had it actually been that long? \u201cSorry, Mom, I guess the time got away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been sick, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He glanced at his assistant. \u201cWould you bring us each a cup of green tea?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d Gail assured him with a knowing smile. He\u2019d asked as a way of distracting his mother and Gail knew it.</p> <p>His mother waited until Gail had left the room. \u201cGreen tea?\u201d</p><p>she asked, sounding surprised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve turned over a new leaf,\u201d he told her. Realizing what he\u2019d said, he added, \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d</p><p>His mother smiled. In her eyes, there was little he could do wrong.</p><p>\u201cI did mention I\u2019ve joined a gym, didn\u2019t I?\u201d There was no need to tell her he\u2019d only been once.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, and knitting classes, too.\u201d</p><p>As if to prove he was taking his physician\u2019s advice seriously, he reached behind his desk where he kept his knitting, although he hadn\u2019t picked it up since that initial class. \u201cI learned how to cast on last week,\u201d he announced proudly, waving the needle with its clumped stitches to show her. He\u2019d managed to knit three or four rows, although for every stitch he made he\u2019d had to unravel two. But, he reasoned, he was learning.</p><p>Gloria clapped her hands in delight as he shoved the needle, trailing its skein of white yarn, back in his briefcase. She made him feel there wasn\u2019t anything he couldn\u2019t tackle. Everyone needed a mother like his and in that sense Hutch considered himself one of the fortunate people of this world.</p><p>\u201cDid you make that phone call yet?\u201d she asked, looking expectantly at him as she took her place on the leather sofa. Phone call? Hutch was supposed to have made a phone call? He wracked his brain, but for the life of him he couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cBryan, you promised. \u201d</p><p>She was Bryan to him when he\u2019d disappointed her. Apparently his blank expression gave him away. \u201cRemind me again who you wanted me to phone.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully Gail\u2019s timing was impeccable and she chose just that moment to return with a small tray. The teapot was covered with a white cozy and she\u2019d arranged two cups, together with a small pitcher of milk and packets of sugar. She set it on the corner of his desk and quietly left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pour.\u201d His mother stood and moved toward him.</p><p>\u201cI take mine black...or green as the case may be,\u201d he said, thinking himself rather clever.</p><p>\u201cJessie\u2019s friend,\u201d Gloria said, handing him the f irst mug. His sister had lots of friends\u2014and then it hit him. \u201cOh, that friend.\u201d His mother had mentioned something about a woman, but it\u2019d been early last week and had completely slipped his mind.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Mia Northf ield.\u201d With her own tea in hand, she sat on the sofa and sipped delicately.</p><p>The fact was, Hutch didn\u2019t remember much of their conversation. Nor did he recall promising his mother that he\u2019d contact this Mia.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s divorced.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. That sounded vaguely familiar.</p> <p>His mother\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to nag, I really don\u2019t. All I want is for you to f ind some nice woman and settle down and have two or three children...or ten.\u201d</p><p>Hutch nearly choked on his tea. \u201cTen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d spoil every one of them, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know.\u201d The image of his mother with young children gathered around her was strangely appealing. The problem was, he hadn\u2019t dated anyone in quite a long time. He was embarrassed to admit just how long it\u2019d been. There didn\u2019t seem to be enough hours in the day for an active social life, not like the one he\u2019d had before his father\u2019s death.</p><p>All of a sudden Phoebe Rylander\u2019s face f lashed before him. A warm feeling came over him as he pictured her fragile smile and dark, lively eyes. \u201cAs it happens,\u201d he murmured, holding his cup with both hands, \u201cI have met someone.\u201d</p><p>His mother sat up straighter. \u201cWhen?\u201d she asked speculatively, almost as if she didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cLast week in my knitting class.\u201d He grinned and knew instantly that his mother had noticed.</p><p>\u201cTell me about her.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t really that much to say. \u201cThe class is called Knit to Quit,\u201d he began.</p><p>Gloria looked worried. \u201cShe\u2019s not a smoker, is she?\u201d Then before he could respond, she asked, \u201cDoes this girl have a weight issue?\u201d She seemed to regret that question. \u201cActually, that doesn\u2019t concern me nearly as much as the smoking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis woman doesn\u2019t smoke\u2014\u201d he hoped that was true \u201c\u2014and she\u2019s certainly not overweight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me about her. Why is she in the class?\u201d</p><p>Hutch reviewed the introductions Lydia had asked each of them to make. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember exactly what Phoebe\u2019s hoping to quit.\u201d What he did recall was a rather sad story. \u201cApparently she was engaged and her f ianc\u00e9 died shortly before the wedding.\u201d He raised one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cI guess she\u2019s trying to get over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoebe. What a lovely name.\u201d His mother\u2019s eyes clouded with sympathy. \u201cThe poor girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s as lovely as her name.\u201d Hutch didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d spoken the words aloud until he saw his mother\u2019s reaction. Gloria sipped her tea, sending him a thoughtful look over the rim of her cup. \u201cShe\u2019ll need time to heal, of course. Did she say when this happened?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe hadn\u2019t given the group many details. In fact, she seemed reluctant to talk about her f ianc\u00e9\u2019s death at all, which told him she was still dealing with the loss.</p><p>Hutch could understand that. He would never forget how he\u2019d felt when he\u2019d learned about his father\u2019s heart attack. That kind of trauma wasn\u2019t quickly laid to rest.</p><p>\u201cBe patient with her,\u201d his mother advised.</p><p>Hutch simply agreed. He\u2019d hoped Gloria would be satisf ied with a few remarks about Phoebe, but he could tell that wasn\u2019t going to be the case.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she look like?\u201d His mother pressed and then laughed. \u201cOutward appearance doesn\u2019t mean much, but she\u2019s obviously captured your fancy and that makes me wonder. She must be beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d At least in his eyes, Phoebe was strikingly attractive.</p><p>\u201cShe has big, dark eyes.\u201d In them he read her pain and determination to survive this and whatever else life threw at her. The woman had courage, and that appealed to him even more than her beauty. As for describing her features, all he could come up with was that she looked pretty.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s about your height,\u201d he said, turning to his mother. The fact that Phoebe had slipped so easily into his mind was actually surprising. He hadn\u2019t thought about her since last week\u2019s knitting class.</p><p>\u201cShort, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-o-o.\u201d Hutch didn\u2019t view her that way. \u201cPetite.\u201d Not a word he normally used, but it seemed to describe Phoebe.</p><p>\u201cHow does she wear her hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer hair,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s...\u201d He made several futile attempts to depict it with his hands and f inally gave up. \u201cShe wears it sort of...long. To her shoulders, I guess. It\u2019s uh, wavy.\u201d</p><p>That was the best he could do.</p><p>His mother laughed, apparently f inding his antics amusing. Finally Hutch shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet her soon enough, so all your questions will be answered.\u201d</p><p>His mother fairly beamed with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019ve already asked her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove slowly with her, Hutch. She\u2019s suffered a tremendous loss and the last thing she needs is to be rushed into a new relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d</p><p>The way he said it made his mother smile. \u201cI know, I know, you don\u2019t need dating advice from me.\u201d</p><p>She was right, but he wasn\u2019t willing to say so. His mother f inished her tea and left soon afterward. Hutch walked her to her car as she chatted about meeting his younger sister for lunch and the shopping trip the two of them had planned. As he returned to the off ice, Phoebe Rylander\u2019s image came to mind again. He thought of her sitting across the table from him, working quietly on her project while he struggled to learn the craft. He suddenly felt unnerved as he recognized how much attention he\u2019d paid to her. Until his mother\u2019s visit, he hadn\u2019t even realized it. That said a lot. He\u2019d been out of the dating world for so many years, he found it hard to remember what it was like to have a relationship.</p><p>Offering to walk Phoebe to her car after class had been a matter of courtesy. Only now did he acknowledge his disappointment when she\u2019d refused. He was completely out of his element with women these days\u2014that was an unavoidable conclusion\u2014but he was going to pursue Phoebe. In the gentlest possible way, of course. He\u2019d follow his mother\u2019s suggestion and take things slowly. For all he knew, Phoebe might already be in another relationship. Somehow he didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>The phone on Gail\u2019s desk rang as Hutch stepped into the off ice. He heard her answer, then say, \u201cJust a minute, Mr. Custer. I\u2019ll see if he\u2019s available.\u201d</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Holding her hand over the receiver, Gail said, \u201cIt\u2019s John\u2014want to talk to him again?\u201d</p><p>Hutch had been half expecting the attorney to call back. \u201cI\u2019ll take it at my desk.\u201d He hurried into his off ice, closing the door.</p><p>\u201cHutch,\u201d John said excitedly. \u201cListen, these people are ready to deal. They don\u2019t want to go to court any more than we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Naturally he hoped the plaintiff in this case could drop it entirely. That, however, was unlikely.</p><p>\u201cHer attorney said he\u2019d make everything go away for half a million dollars.\u201d</p><p>Hutch nearly laughed out loud. \u201cThere is absolutely no way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHutch, be reasonable,\u201d John said in a persuasive voice.</p><p>\u201cGetting rid of the aggravation factor is worth half a mil in itself. Be done with this once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Hutch hesitated, then decided to go with his gut. \u201cIn my opinion, this is blackmail, plain and simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but it can also turn around and bite you if you don\u2019t settle now. It\u2019s a take it or leave it proposition. They\u2019re insisting on an answer by this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Hutch had to admit he was tempted. He\u2019d like nothing more than to put an end to this whole mess. \u201cIf we pay them off, what\u2019s to prevent someone else from f iling the same suit two months down the road?\u201d</p><p>John didn\u2019t respond for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s unlikely. Let\u2019s deal with what\u2019s in front of us right now,\u201d he urged. \u201cThis can all be resolved today if we pay up. Don\u2019t you feel that\u2019s worth it?\u201d</p><p>Hutch desperately wanted this lawsuit to disappear. However, writing a cheque for half a million dollars meant he\u2019d be buying peace, and a tentative one at that. If he settled now, he was convinced he\u2019d be opening the door for other such lawsuits and he refused to let that happen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it, John.\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s old friend sighed loudly. \u201cI f igured you wouldn\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously think I should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say.

It\u2019s what your father would\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>Hutch replaced the receiver, pleased with the comparison\u2014</p><p>until he remembered that his father had died at the age of f iftyeight.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Phoebe Rylander</p><p>Phoebe hurried through the rain to the waterfront restaurant where she\u2019d agreed to meet her mother for lunch. She wasn\u2019t foolish enough to believe the invitation had been prompted by any desire for her company. In every likelihood, Clark would be the main topic of conversation.</p> <p>Her f irst instinct had been to beg off. Several convenient excuses readily presented themselves. For one thing, Phoebe only had an hour\u2019s lunch break and there was no guarantee she\u2019d get back on time. Second, she\u2019d seen her mother recently, although she\u2019d cut their visit short because of Leanne\u2019s insistence on discussing Clark. Yet, even though her mother would pressure her to forgive Clark and forget the entire unsavory mess, Phoebe had agreed to this lunch. She didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>Then again, she did.</p><p>A part of her, the part that missed Clark so much, that missed his kisses and larger-than-life energy, hungered for any word of him. If she couldn\u2019t have Clark\u2014and she couldn\u2019t\u2014then, fool that she was, Phoebe wanted to hear about him. Her mother would be more than willing to give her the details she secretly longed for.</p><p>The outrage had faded now, replaced with a burning sadness. She loved Clark. He\u2019d been a very important part of her life for nearly two years. It felt as if a giant hole had opened up in her everyday existence, a hole that seemed to grow deeper and wider every single day. Phoebe wavered between wishing Clark could be wiped from her memory and pathetically craving any scrap of information about him. Breaking off the relationship would\u2019ve been so much easier if she could just turn off her feelings. Or ignore them. But despite everything, she still wanted Clark. Although she had a job that meant a lot to her, the days seemed empty. Her evenings were listless as she looked for ways to f ill the time she would otherwise have spent with Clark. The waterfront restaurant, close to Pike Place Market, was one of the places often frequented by tourists. The hostess was busy seating patrons when Phoebe arrived. She removed the scarf that had protected her hair from the drizzle and glanced over at the bank of windows with their view of the murky green waters of Puget Sound. To her surprise, her mother was already seated. Leanne waved; Phoebe waved back, then made her way through the maze of tables.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d That was a rarity. Phoebe took off her raincoat, hanging it on a hook outside the circular booth, and slid in next to her mother.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get us a good seat.\u201d Leanne set aside the menu.</p> <p>\u201cI see you\u2019re right on time, as usual.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe didn\u2019t comment. Her mother spoke as if being prompt was a character f law.</p><p>\u201cThe special of the day is a squash risotto and the soup is tomato basil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey both sound nice,\u201d Phoebe said, although she didn\u2019t have much of an appetite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ordering the barbecued shrimp,\u201d her mother declared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be excellent. Marlene Snowden recommended it the last time we ate here.\u201d She paused, apparently wondering if she\u2019d done the wrong thing in mentioning Clark\u2019s mother.</p><p>Phoebe let the remark slide. \u201cI\u2019ll just have the soup.\u201d</p><p>Leanne continued, a bit cautiously. \u201cSpeaking of Clark\u2019s mother...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMust we?\u201d Phoebe asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Phoebe, I don\u2019t think you realize how upset everyone is. Marlene phoned me in tears. She can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Phoebe cried, arousing curious looks from the people seated close by. \u201cWhy does all the blame fall on me?\u201d she asked, lowering her voice. \u201cClark\u2019s the one who can\u2019t keep his pants zipped.\u201d</p><p>Her mother blanched. \u201cPhoebe, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to discuss Clark, his family or anything to do with them,\u201d she said, although that wasn\u2019t strictly true. \u201cIf you feel you have to bring his name into the conversation, it might be best if I left now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie, don\u2019t do that. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that this is painful for me, too. Marlene and I have become such good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if Clark and I are no longer engaged, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t still be friends with his mother,\u201d Phoebe whispered, although she already knew the relationship was doomed. Her mother and Marlene had little in common. Leanne had loved being included in the Snowdens\u2019 social circle, but with the engagement over, it was unlikely that Marlene would continue to invite Phoebe\u2019s mother to the exclusive events she\u2019d enjoyed so much. The waiter came for their drink order and to Phoebe\u2019s astonishment her mother ordered an expensive glass of white wine. Phoebe asked for coffee. The weather seemed to suggest a hot drink; besides, she had to work this afternoon. Minutes later, their server was back with their drinks and wrote down their lunch choices.</p><p>\u201cMy f irst knitting class went well,\u201d Phoebe said, trying to steer the conversation away from the Snowdens.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were learning to knit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, relearning...\u201d Phoebe had forgotten that she\u2019d decided to keep it a secret. \u201cI needed something...\u201d She left the rest unsaid. Her mother had to know how lost and lonely she must feel without Clark in her life.</p><p>Leanne sipped her wine. \u201cMax recommended this Sauvignon Blanc. It\u2019s from New Zealand and it has a nice, crisp citrus f lavor. You really must try it sometime.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe sighed. She genuinely liked Clark\u2019s father. He had a wonderful wit and charm. After Clark\u2019s f irst \u201cindiscretion,\u201d Max was the one who\u2019d come to talk to her, to plead his son\u2019s case. Although he was as disgusted and shocked as Phoebe had been, he\u2019d asked her to give Clark one last chance. To his credit, Max hadn\u2019t contacted her since she\u2019d returned Clark\u2019s engagement ring. She suspected he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIs Clark\u2019s family going to be part of every conversation?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe asked, struggling to keep her voice even.</p><p>\u201cOh, my, I did it again, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Her mother at least looked regretful.</p><p>How sincere her apology was, Phoebe couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cMom, you don\u2019t need to tell me how hard this is on you. I know, because it\u2019s even more diff icult for me.\u201d Her mother seemed to conveniently forget that.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. Forgive me for being so thoughtless, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe stared out the window and tried to force her thoughts away from Clark. It was practically impossible with Leanne dragging his parents\u2019 names into every topic imaginable. She\u2019d known that, but she\u2019d still come to lunch. As much as she despised her own weakness, Phoebe was eager for news. And yet she had to stop this, stop giving in to\u2014</p><p>\u201cLeanne, Phoebe, how delightful to see you here.\u201d</p><p>As if the mere thought of her ex-f ianc\u00e9 was enough to conjure him up, Clark appeared out of nowhere. Before she could object, he slid into the booth beside Phoebe, trapping her there. Phoebe stiffened and refused to glance in his direction.</p><p>\u201cClark!\u201d Her mother feigned surprise and frankly did a poor job of it. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was meeting a client for lunch, but he cancelled at the last minute. I was about to leave when I saw the two of you sitting here. I hope you don\u2019t mind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>How smoothly he lied, how easily the words rolled off his tongue, but Phoebe wasn\u2019t fooled. She knew this was a setup.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I do,\u201d she said f latly.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe, please, what will it hurt to have lunch with me?\u201d he asked. He sounded so calm and reasonable that for a moment she was tempted to agree.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll hurt a great deal, I\u2019m afraid. Please go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are your manners?\u201d her mother chastised.</p><p>Phoebe turned to face Leanne and didn\u2019t bother to disguise the betrayal she felt. \u201cYou arranged this. My own mother! I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get upset with your mother. This is my fault,\u201d Clark said softly. \u201cI\u2019m the one who put her up to it. I was desperate to talk to you and this seemed the only way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I ask,\u201d her mother pleaded, \u201cis that you hear Clark out. If you\u2019d listen, you might understand that the whole thing was police entrapment.\u201d</p><p>As far as Phoebe was concerned, how it happened was of no relevance. That it happened was everything. Still, she knew arguing would do no good. Clark was a master manipulator. He could turn the tables so quickly that it made her head spin. It was pointless to argue with him\u2014a losing proposition. Clark reached for her hand and while she wanted to resist, she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, baby,\u201d he said, his voice low and seductive. Phoebe could almost feel her resolve melting. For her own peace of mind, she refused to look at him, refused to make eye contact. Once she did, she\u2019d be lost....</p><p>The waiter scurried over with a menu, which he handed Clark, who gave it a perfunctory glance and quickly placed his order for a rare sirloin steak. Leave it to Clark to order steak in one of the f inest seafood restaurants on the west coast. He always seemed to take the contrary view, always stood apart. He waited until the server was gone before he returned his attention to Phoebe. His thumb gently rubbed the top of her hand in a manner that was almost sexual. Phoebe jerked it away, staring at the dark, swirling waters of Puget Sound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking,\u201d Clark told her, with Leanne listening avidly. \u201cYou have every right to be angry. If our situations were reversed, I can imagine how I\u2019d feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she couldn\u2019t resist asking. \u201cIf I were to pay for sex, that would bother you?\u201d</p><p>He blinked as if he found the thought completely discordant.</p><p>\u201cBut why should it?\u201d she went on. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything, does it? It\u2019s just...something people do and it really doesn\u2019t affect our relationship. Isn\u2019t that what you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wrong twice\u2014that I know of.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cSome of us are slow learners. But it\u2019ll never happen again. I swear by everything I hold dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you had with these women wasn\u2019t an emotional connection, remember? Only a physical one.\u201d This was another rationale of his. Presumably it was supposed to appease her. Clark closed his eyes. \u201cI was wrong,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cWhat excuse do you have for the same thing happening a second time?\u201d</p><p>At f irst she didn\u2019t think he was going to answer; when he did his voice was strained. It seemed to vibrate with pain, whether real or fabricated, she wasn\u2019t sure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was drunk. Drunk out of my mind. I had no idea what I was doing. If it makes any difference, you should know I didn\u2019t even f ind her attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d Phoebe snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s completely irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>Clark lowered his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She so badly wanted to believe him, and yet she knew she couldn\u2019t. \u201cBeing drunk doesn\u2019t excuse that kind of behavior.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t, but maybe it\u2019ll help you understand why it happened.

It won\u2019t happen. I give you my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe means it, sweetie,\u201d her mother said imploringly. \u201cListen to Clark. Every word is sincere. He couldn\u2019t be more repentant. Let him have one more chance. That\u2019s all he wants, all any of us want.\u201d</p> <p>Phoebe turned to Clark, meeting his eyes for the f irst time. He wore a woebegone look that would\u2019ve softened the hardest heart. Despite everything, Phoebe found herself on the verge of surrender. She was about to capitulate when the waiter arrived with their meals. The relief she felt at being interrupted, at not agreeing to yet another chance, nearly overwhelmed her. Winning was vital to Clark; she couldn\u2019t know whether he meant what he said or just needed to remain in control by persuading her to take him back.</p><p>Clark seemed to sense that her determination was f lagging because he reached for her hand, intertwining their f ingers. He held on to her while the waiter served them.</p><p>\u201cShall I order champagne?\u201d he asked her. \u201cTell me we have something to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her mother leaned forward. \u201cPhoebe, please. It would mean the world to Marlene and me if you and Clark were engaged again.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Clark took the solitaire diamond engagement ring from his suit pocket and set it on the table next to her bowl. \u201cI\u2019ve carried it with me from the moment you dropped it off,\u201d he confessed brokenly. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve looked at this diamond. I can\u2019t lose you, Phoebe. I can\u2019t. You\u2019re everything to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re drunk,\u201d she added. She knew she sounded bitter and angry, but didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019ll help, I\u2019ll quit drinking. You say the word and I swear I won\u2019t touch another drop.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe pulled her hand away. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>Clark enjoyed his drinks. To the best of her knowledge he rarely overindulged.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the only way I can have you back, then I\u2019ll give up alcohol for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying so hard?\u201d she demanded. She needed proof that this was more than his pride talking, more than his desire to be in control of their relationship. He blinked as though he didn\u2019t understand the question. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cYou honestly don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her,\u201d Leanne urged. \u201cTell her what you told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Clark stated emphatically. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want us to raise our family together and when we\u2019re old and gray, you\u2019re the one I want at my side.\u201d</p> <p>A lump f illed her throat. No woman could listen to those words and not be affected. \u201cI...I have to think.\u201d</p><p>Clark\u2019s gaze held hers, f illed with triumph at the f irst crack in her defenses. She suddenly realized it was what he needed, what he\u2019d been hoping to achieve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the ladies\u2019 room,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be right back?\u201d her mother asked. \u201cDo you want me to go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Clark slid out of the booth and she followed, leaving her raincoat behind. Taking her purse, she hurried across the restaurant to the restroom and quickly went in. Locking herself inside a stall, she leaned against the door and closed her eyes.</p><p>The f leeting look on Clark\u2019s face just then. She\u2019d seen it\u2014that small display of satisfaction that he could manipulate her. He assumed he\u2019d won her back...and he almost had. He\u2019d almost done it, but now that she was away from his inf luence, away from her mother, cool reason returned.</p><p>Without questioning her own actions, Phoebe left the stall and hurried out of the restaurant. Thankfully there was a taxi parked at the curb. With rain beating down on her, she climbed in the backseat and gave the driver her work address. Not until she was several blocks away could she breathe easily again. She felt like someone who\u2019d taken a wrong step, who\u2019d lost her footing and faltered. Only now, safe from Clark, did she feel secure.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Alix Turner</p><p>During her fifteen-minute morning break Alix lit up a cigarette in the alley behind the caf\u00e9. Closing her eyes, she took her f irst drag. She held the smoke in her lungs an extralong moment, savoring the instant sense of relief before exhaling. When she opened her eyes again, she could imagine\u2014all too clearly\u2014her husband\u2019s pained look of disappointment. Good boy that he was, Jordan Turner had never smoked. He couldn\u2019t begin to understand how diff icult it was to quit. What he understood even less was why Alix had started again after four years of not smoking.</p><p>She wanted to quit. Except that she couldn\u2019t seem to do it, although they both agreed that she needed to be one hundred percent free of nicotine before she got pregnant. A baby.</p><p>Tension skittered down her spine. Alix hoped to get pregnant soon and Jordan wanted that, too. They\u2019d moved into his grandma Turner\u2019s house on Star Lake and it was ideal, certainly for her, but perhaps even more for him. So many of his childhood memories were associated with the lake house. Only last night Jordan had said it was the perfect place to start their family. Which, of course, she\u2019d been saying all along.... It\u2019d be nice, Alix mused, really nice\u2014until her gaze fell on the cigarette. In a f it of frustration and anger she tossed it on the asphalt and crushed it with the toe of her work shoe. And then she immediately regretted wasting most of a cigarette. Besides being a nasty habit that made her hair smell and stained her f ingers, it was an expensive one. At least she was down to a maximum of five cigarettes a day\u2014less than two packs a week. The daily total varied, depending on the sort of day she\u2019d had, but she never exceeded f ive. That was her limit, and she was proud of her discipline, proud she\u2019d whittled the number down from twice that many just a few months ago. She knew it wasn\u2019t sufficient. But still...</p><p>Jordan had been kind enough not to say anything about the cost, but it had to be on his mind. It bothered Alix, too. But she recognized that her inability to give up cigarettes was about more than the addiction. As much as she wanted Jordan\u2019s baby, she was afraid. She didn\u2019t think of herself as a fearful person. A few years back she\u2019d stood up to an armed drug dealer without even f linching. But back then she didn\u2019t much care if she lived or died. The truth was, becoming a mother terrif ied her. She\u2019d tried to describe her fears to Jordan. He was better at listening these days, but after only a few words she realized her feelings on this subject were simply beyond his experience.</p><p>His family had nothing, absolutely nothing, in common with hers.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s father was a pastor; Jordan was following in his footsteps and would one day have his own church.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s parents were good people\u2014loving, compassionate, down to earth. His mom was the Brady Bunch kind of mother who baked cookies and still owned an ironing board. Parents like hers didn\u2019t fall within Jordan\u2019s frame of reference. He couldn\u2019t possibly comprehend what it was to hide in a closet to drown out the noise of her parents\u2019 drunken brawls. He knew things like that happened because he\u2019d worked with troubled teens in the past. But he knew it in a theoretical, indirect way. It wasn\u2019t part of him, a memory always hovering, always there. Okay, so motherhood was scary. Alix admitted it and suspected the cigarettes were an avoidance technique. If she smoked, she could put off dealing with her doubts. She could defer f inding out whether she was capable of being a mother. After all, crying babies upset her. She thought messy diapers were disgusting. As for breast-feeding an infant, which Jordan seemed to think came naturally to women, the idea f illed her with trepidation. Other women might have strong maternal instincts, but not Alix. And after her mother\u2019s example, who could blame her?</p><p>\u201cAlix.\u201d</p><p>Becky Major, the middle-aged prep cook, stuck her head out the door.</p><p>\u201cWinter\u2019s looking for you.\u201d Winter Adams was the woman who owned the French Caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve got another ten minutes.\u201d Alix intended to take her full allotment of time. After a week of dismal rain, the sun was shining and she wanted to enjoy it as long as she could.</p><p>\u201cLydia\u2019s here, too. She\u2019d like to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t hesitate. She\u2019d return to her motherhood worries later. A visit with Lydia was always a treat. On her way through the kitchen Alix poured herself a cup of coffee. If she couldn\u2019t have nicotine, she\u2019d settle for caffeine.</p><p>Lydia was waiting for her at the counter with a cup of her own.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>Alix noticed her friend\u2019s anxious look. \u201cOf course. What do you need? Shall we go outside?\u201d she asked, and Lydia nodded. They\u2019d have more privacy there.</p><p>The sidewalk tables were set up with the umbrellas open and Alix chose a shady one close to the caf\u00e9. Lydia sat across from her.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me interrupting your morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Alix assured her. Actually, she was grateful for a reprieve from her scattered thoughts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Casey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d As soon as Alix asked the question, she remembered.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. The foster kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Lydia held her coffee mug with both hands, resting them on the table.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t Casey only supposed to be with you for a week?\u201d She knew that because of a comment Margaret had made during last week\u2019s class.</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d Lydia sighed. \u201cNow it might be longer.\u201d</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t ask her why. Lydia would explain if she wanted to. But Alix didn\u2019t have any diff iculty f iguring out that the social worker hadn\u2019t found another home for Casey. Alix wasn\u2019t surprised, either; she\u2019d been shuff led around enough to know what that was like.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s it going with Casey?\u201d she asked, although she had a fairly clear idea.</p><p>\u201cAbout all I can say is that we\u2019ve tolerated one another. When Casey comes home from day camp, she goes straight to her room and closes the door.\u201d Lydia paused. \u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hoards stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Lydia looked mildly embarrassed. \u201cToilet paper. I came across six rolls in her bedroom. Last Monday I got groceries and then later couldn\u2019t f ind the crackers. They were in Casey\u2019s room, hidden under the bed. The end of the box was sticking out and when I knelt down to pick it up, I found a box of cereal, some cookies and the toilet paper. When I asked her about it, she said she might need them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you take the stuff away from her?\u201d Alix asked. Lydia shook her head. \u201cI decided that if she felt more secure keeping those things in her room, it was okay with me.\u201d</p><p>Alix suspected there\u2019d been a time and a place when necessities like crackers, cereal and toilet paper had been withheld from Casey. During her years in foster care, Alix had developed some idiosyncrasies of her own.</p><p>\u201cDinners are the worst,\u201d Lydia went on to say.</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>Lydia\u2019s expression was strained. \u201cAt least she eats, but she barely talks. I\u2019ve done everything I can to draw her out. Nothing I say or do seems to reach her. From the looks she gives me, it\u2019s as if she resents my showing any interest in her. Cody\u2019s been great lately and Brad, too, but there just doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to connect with her.\u201d</p><p>Alix had been in enough foster homes to recognize the behavior. \u201cShe knows she\u2019s going to be leaving soon, so she\u2019s trying not to care about any of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? Brad and I have bent over backward to make her feel welcome.\u201d</p><p>This was so hard for others to understand. \u201cListen,\u201d Alix said, leaning toward her friend. \u201cLet me put it like this. You\u2019ve got a piece of tape and you stick it to something and it stays put. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Lydia blinked. \u201cOkay. Yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeel it off and stick it again and what happens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still sticks,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cRight. But what happens when you peel it away for the third or fourth time?\u201d</p><p>Lydia shrugged. \u201cMost of the stickiness is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s the same with kids. Casey\u2019s protecting whatever stickiness she has left for the family who\u2019ll keep her and care for her and love her. She can\u2019t risk her heart on a family that\u2019ll be part of her life for a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>Lydia shook her head again as if she wanted to argue. \u201cBrad and I do care about her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d Alix didn\u2019t mean to sound f lippant or cynical but she couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cYou care about her now. Casey knows that six months down the road you\u2019ll have trouble remembering her name, especially if you take in other foster kids in emergency situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lydia appeared to mull that over. \u201cWould it be better if we didn\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Give her all the attention and love you can. It\u2019ll f ill her up. And that\u2019s a good thing, especially when it comes time for her to change homes.\u201d</p><p>Looking down, Lydia clasped and unclasped her hands. \u201cShe\u2019s been with us for nine days now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems longer than that, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Lydia grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s already tried to run away once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she make it obvious?\u201d</p><p>Her question surprised Lydia, who nodded.</p> <p>\u201cTypical.\u201d Alix had tried it more than once herself. If Casey had really wanted to slip away unnoticed she would\u2019ve managed to do so. It was a ploy to see if Lydia and Brad would stop her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about her family background?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext to nothing,\u201d Lydia told her. \u201cEvelyn didn\u2019t think it was necessary to tell us much, seeing that Casey was supposed to be with us for such a short while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvelyn phoned yesterday afternoon and asked if there was any way Brad and I could keep Casey for another couple of weeks\u2014</p><p>until her classes are f inished. Apparently the state will have to place her in a home in a different school district. Evelyn said there\u2019s a real shortage of foster homes this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Alix asked without emotion.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Brad and Cody, and the three of us decided we\u2019d be okay with having Casey stay longer. Only...only we don\u2019t believe she wants to stay with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d Alix told her confidently. \u201cThe problem is, she\u2019s been moved around so much she\u2019s afraid to let anyone know what she wants for fear it\u2019ll be taken away from her.\u201d</p><p>Lydia\u2019s frown showed her dismay. \u201cYou mean...love? Security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...and even toilet paper,\u201d Alix said with a small laugh. This was a whole different world to her friend. Lydia couldn\u2019t understand the mind of a child like Casey, not the way Alix did. Alix, too, had been a case number, a name on a f ile. Evelyn Boyd did her best; she was a good woman with a huge heart but she carried a heavy load.</p><p>\u201cYou talked about the tape and stickiness,\u201d Lydia reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I give Casey some of her glue back?\u201d</p><p>Good question. Alix leaned forward, resting an elbow on the table, and thought about it, recalling that time in her own life.</p><p>When she was in the eighth grade, she\u2019d lived in three different foster homes and attended three different schools. It\u2019d been a bad year for her, and she suspected that once Casey left Lydia and Brad\u2019s, her year would follow the same downward spiral.</p><p>\u201cDoes Casey have any family? A grandmother? Aunt? Cousins?</p><p>Does\u2014\u201d She stopped when Lydia started to nod.</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned a brother,\u201d she said eagerly, then paused.</p><p>\u201cActually, I think it was Evelyn who told me that Casey has an older brother. Apparently he\u2019s at the Kent Juvenile Facility.\u201d</p><p>Alix had brief ly been incarcerated there herself. Kent was a south Seattle community with the largest juvenile facility in the area, possibly the state.</p><p>\u201cIt would help if you could arrange for Casey to visit her brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how?\u201d Lydia sounded perplexed.</p><p>\u201cGet Evelyn involved. I can guarantee that Casey will feel a whole lot better if she can spend even a small amount of time with him.\u201d</p><p>Alix had loved her brother, too. She didn\u2019t talk about Tom and very few people knew about him. Tom\u2019s death had been the turning point in Alix\u2019s life. Up until then, she\u2019d experimented with drugs, hung out with losers and generally got herself into trouble.</p><p>Then Tom had been found dead. He\u2019d choked to death on his own vomit after shooting up heroin. As long as she lived, Alix would never forget the day she\u2019d learned that the only person who\u2019d ever truly loved her was gone. Forever. She\u2019d wanted to die herself. Giving herself a mental shake, Alix returned her attention to Lydia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Evelyn as soon as I get back to the store,\u201d Lydia said.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I could help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else you can suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...you\u2019re going to need lots of patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean more than Brad and I have already given her?\u201d</p><p>Lydia asked wryly.</p><p>Remembering her own youth, Alix nodded. \u201cLots more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d Lydia laughed a little. Alix laughed, too. She wondered whether Lydia\u2019s sister had any opinions on this latest development\u2014and was sure she did. \u201cWhat does Margaret have to say about the situation with Casey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d Lydia\u2019s smile wavered and she shook her head. \u201cMargaret means well. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s so used to looking after me. Even now Margaret\u2019s always positive that she knows best.\u201d</p><p>Alix glanced at her watch and realized her break had ended f ive minutes earlier. She\u2019d better f ind out why Winter had asked to see her.</p><p>\u201cI need to get back to work,\u201d she said and stood, collecting their empty cups.</p><p>\u201cThanks again,\u201d Lydia murmured.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything else I can do. Or if you ever need to talk,\u201d Alix said, and she meant it.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cHutch\u201d Hutchinson</p><p>Hutch sat at the table in the back of A Good Yarn and tried to concentrate on his knitting. The sampler scarf was progressing well as far as he could see, at least the f irst and second sections were. He\u2019d learned to knit and purl, which seemed to impress everyone, from his mother to his assistant, Gail. This was the third class and Lydia was showing them how to make cable stitches, which was bound to really impress Gloria and Gail. Lydia was teaching them in stages, and he suspected the stitches would become progressively more diff icult with every week. He felt a little hesitant about this, since knitting didn\u2019t come naturally to him. He\u2019d hoped for relaxation, not another challenge\u2014</p><p>despite the bragging rights conferred by his new skill. He might have considered dropping out if not for an even more interesting challenge. Phoebe Rylander.</p><p>She was already there when he arrived, and he\u2019d been distracted from the moment he sat down. He hoped his fascination with her wasn\u2019t obvious; he was afraid of embarrassing himself and frightening her off.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe how romantically inept he was, although he told himself there were extenuating circumstances. Phoebe was still grieving the death of her f ianc\u00e9, and he didn\u2019t want to appear insensitive to her pain. At the same time...well, he\u2019d like to get to know her.</p><p>He was trying to heed his mother\u2019s advice\u2014to go slow\u2014but if he went any more slowly, the next ice age might overtake the world before he\u2019d managed to ask her out on an actual date. This was the third week he\u2019d sat across from her. He felt as if he was still in junior high\u2014and he didn\u2019t like the feeling. He\u2019d offered to escort her to her car that f irst class. Phoebe had declined, so during the second class he didn\u2019t mention it again. They\u2019d spoken a few times, about inconsequential things. She\u2019d laughed at his jokes. That was a good sign, but then Alix and Lydia had laughed, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve really come to enjoy these classes,\u201d Phoebe had said at the end of class as she packed her knitting bag. Hutch continued to keep his supplies in his briefcase. It wasn\u2019t so much that he didn\u2019t want anyone to know he was knitting. He just preferred not to walk around carrying an oversize purse, especially one of those quilted ones that looked like a diaper bag. At the end of the second class Phoebe had started to leave f irst. Hutch had hurried forward to open the door for her and she\u2019d smiled her appreciation.</p><p>Hutch had smiled back, then stood there like a dope as she\u2019d moved down the sidewalk.</p><p>Phoebe had been a half a block away when he\u2019d instinctively begun to follow her. He\u2019d stopped abruptly midstep, uncertain what to say or do next. After that initial statement during the f irst class, she\u2019d said nothing more about her f ianc\u00e9. Hutch had assumed the other man\u2019s death was recent but couldn\u2019t be sure. He was def initely interested in getting to know Phoebe, but he didn\u2019t want to start a conversation by opening a half-healed wound. He had no idea whether it would be appropriate to refer to her f ianc\u00e9, yet it seemed heartless to completely ignore this man she\u2019d so obviously loved.</p><p>The way he f igured it, he needed to make a move soon or forget it entirely. And forgetting Phoebe was definitely something he didn\u2019t want to do. But if he waited too long, didn\u2019t make his interest clear, the whole thing would become awkward. For both of them. He\u2019d tried to work out the best approach. Unfortunately he\u2019d come up blank. He\u2019d never had trouble starting conversations with women while he was in college and in his twenties. Of course, he\u2019d never encountered a situation like this one, either. It didn\u2019t help that he hadn\u2019t dated anyone in so long his skills had rusted away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like me to check your stitches?\u201d Lydia asked, breaking into his thoughts. He\u2019d reviewed what he had\u2014and hadn\u2019t\u2014said to Phoebe a dozen times. In the end, he hadn\u2019t approached her, and regretted it for the rest of the week. This third class was it, he decided. If he didn\u2019t act now he was afraid he never would.</p><p>Hutch glanced up at Lydia and found her regarding him expectantly. Thinking he might have missed part of the conversation, he handed her his knitting. She took it from him and frowned.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d he asked. Although his attention had been on Phoebe, he\u2019d carefully tried to follow Lydia\u2019s instructions.</p><p>Lydia gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cThe pattern\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Hutch had thought so, too, but it felt good to have Lydia conf irm it.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is your tension, Hutch. See how tight these stitches are?\u201d</p><p>It was true that he had diff iculty moving the yarn on the needles, but it\u2019d been like that from the moment he cast on his f irst stitches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re knitting armor,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it like this from the start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Lydia said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason you signed up for this class, isn\u2019t it? To relax?\u201d</p><p>Hutch nodded.</p><p>He looked quickly at Phoebe. Lydia was right; he\u2019d enrolled in this class to help lower his blood pressure and learn new techniques for dealing with stress. However...he\u2019d met Phoebe, and she\u2019d inadvertently increased his stress. At least his thumb was improving. The knitting had benef itted him there.</p><p>\u201cI have just the opposite problem,\u201d Phoebe volunteered after Lydia had left the table. \u201cMy stitches are too loose. At the rate I\u2019m going, this scarf is going to be ten feet long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine will be ten inches.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at his rather lame joke, which encouraged him.</p> <p>\u201cAre you enjoying the class?\u201d he asked, then wanted to groan. If his joke was lame, this effort at conversation was even worse. Phoebe smiled at him. \u201cVery much. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d Hutch didn\u2019t mention that she was responsible for about ninety-nine percent of his pleasure. He\u2019d been looking forward to this evening and dreading it at the same time. His thoughts had been on Phoebe all week and now here she was\u2014</p><p>yet he felt as much hesitation as he had before. He was even more reluctant to take a risk with her for fear of offending her so soon after a major loss...and perhaps a fear of being rejected, too, although he hated to admit that. He paused, hoping for further encouraging signs. None came but, determined now, he forged ahead. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose...I mean, after class...but if you\u2019ve got other plans, I understand...\u201d That sounded so pathetic, it was all he could do not to get up and walk away. He closed his mouth, deciding he wouldn\u2019t say another word. What was wrong with him? He was a competent businessman who headed a family owned enterprise and commanded the respect of over a hundred employees. Yet around Phoebe he acted like a kid in junior high.</p><p>\u201cOther plans for what?\u201d she asked curiously. Well, he\u2019d bungled that, despite his attempt to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to have coffee?\u201d he asked, his voice gruff now, almost angry. This was going from bad to dismal. To his utter astonishment, Phoebe nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his mouth shut before he could talk her out of it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the French Caf\u00e9 across the street.\u201d Alix looked up from her knitting. \u201cThey\u2019re open until ten tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d Phoebe said. \u201cYou work there, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure do. I\u2019m part of the morning staff. I do the baking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the one responsible for those wonderful pastries,\u201d</p><p>Phoebe commented. \u201cI stopped by the other day and picked up a half-dozen for the clinic. They were fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take all the credit,\u201d Alix said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d Lydia cut in. \u201cI\u2019ve seen and tasted Alix\u2019s handiwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Margaret agreed. \u201cYou see this extra fat on my hips?</p><p>Blame Alix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who chose to eat those Danishes and croissants,\u201d Alix reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI second that,\u201d Hutch added, remembering the lawsuit hanging over his head. It wasn\u2019t just the candy business that could be jeopardized by this lawsuit. If he lost, bakeries would be prime candidates, too. And restaurants. No telling where this craziness would end.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d Margaret sighed. \u201cI deserve every ounce of this extra weight.\u201d</p><p>Hutch grinned, then caught Phoebe watching him. She smiled back. He felt a sensation of warmth. Of happiness\u2014and comfort. Maybe he hadn\u2019t seemed as big an idiot as he\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cShall we walk over to the French Caf\u00e9 after class?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d If she\u2019d suggested they have coffee in Costa Rica, he would\u2019ve found a way to get there. Walking across the street was no problem\u2014if he didn\u2019t do something stupid like throw himself in front of a bus.</p><p>The Knit to Quit class ended a few minutes before eight. Alix had been especially quiet most of the evening. Hutch liked her and her husband, too, who came to pick her up again. Apparently Jordan worked late the evenings Alix was at A Good Yarn, which meant they could drive home together. Phoebe stood and gathered her things. Hutch did, too.</p><p>\u201cGood night, you two,\u201d Lydia said as they walked toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d Hutch echoed.</p><p>\u201cSee you next week,\u201d Phoebe said, looking over her shoulder. Lydia waved them off. As they closed the door, Hutch happened to hear Margaret speculating on a romance between him and Phoebe. For an instant he was tempted to stop and listen, wondering how they viewed his chances.</p><p>Once outside, Hutch threw his briefcase into his car. He\u2019d been lucky enough to f ind a parking place almost directly in front of A Good Yarn\u2014maybe that was a sign. Phoebe waited and then they hurried across the street.</p><p>The French Caf\u00e9 was brightly lit and there were a number of couples scattered around the restaurant, eating a late dinner or sipping coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d Hutch asked as they approached the counter.</p><p>\u201cJust black coffee,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you choose a table and I\u2019ll go get our coffees.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and he watched as she selected a quiet place in the back of the restaurant. After ordering and paying for their drinks, he carried both mugs to the table.</p><p>Now that he was alone with Phoebe, he found himself at a loss. He tried to recall his college days, but everything had been so easy back then. So natural and effortless. He used to see himself as witty and social\u2014something he could hardly believe now.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he began. \u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe brushed the hair from her face, which he\u2019d noticed was a habit of hers. More than once he\u2019d been tempted to reach out and do it for her, which would\u2019ve been inappropriate to put it mildly. He clasped his hands in his lap.</p><p>\u201cWell...I think I already mentioned I\u2019m a physical therapist.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou told us that during our f irst class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Obviously what he\u2019d said about himself wasn\u2019t memorable. \u201cI work for a family-owned business,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I remember that now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d made a point of not referring to Mount Rainier Chocolates by name. The company was well-known in the area, and the moment people learned about his connection, they bombarded him with questions\u2014always the same ones. He was tired of answering them, tired of all the silly jokes and sly remarks. Besides, there was more to him than his job.</p><p>\u201cYou took the class to relax, isn\u2019t that what you said? And because of your thumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He raised his hand and waggled his thumb, feeling a twinge of pain.</p><p>\u201cHave you had physical therapy?\u201d she asked. He shook his head. Physical therapy took time he couldn\u2019t spare; not only that, his injury wasn\u2019t serious, despite its slowness in healing.</p><p>\u201cThere are various exercises you can do to regain dexterity,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean other than knitting armor?\u201d he joked. Phoebe smiled again and it seemed the entire room grew a little brighter.</p><p>The conversation went well from that point forward. Phoebe was easy to talk to, her own comments interesting and animated. If the conversation lagged she picked it up. Still, Hutch felt he needed to say something about her f ianc\u00e9. He might as well do it now. Get it over with, if that wasn\u2019t too crass a description.</p><p>\u201cI know how diff icult this time is for you,\u201d he said solemnly when a discussion of recent movies had run its course. Her gaze shot to his. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLosing your f ianc\u00e9...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...these things happen.\u201d He could tell that talking about the man she\u2019d loved f lustered and upset her. Hutch felt bad about bringing up such a painful subject, but he wanted to be sure Phoebe knew he sympathized.</p><p>He decided to take his cue from her and move on. He said the f irst thing that came to mind. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed being in the class with you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened as she cast her eyes down. \u201cI feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d...like to see you again, outside class.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her a chance to respond. \u201cBut only if you\u2019re ready. If it\u2019s too soon, I understand. All I ask is that you let me know when you feel ready to date again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d She hesitated.</p><p>His heart sank.</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019m ready now,\u201d she said, meeting his eyes. A sense of exhilaration f illed him. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Then, because he felt he had to clarify what he\u2019d said, he added quickly, \u201cWonderful that you\u2019re willing to see me again. Not wonderful that your f ianc\u00e9 died.\u201d The instant the words left his tongue, Hutch wanted to yank them back. He couldn\u2019t have said anything stupider or more insensitive. \u201cThat didn\u2019t come out right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I knew what you meant.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled a sigh of relief. \u201cThe Fourth of July is this weekend,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go on a picnic?\u201d he asked. It was a traditional Fourth of July activity, he f igured. \u201cI have a couple of bicycles,\u201d he said on the spur of the moment.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun. Anyplace special you\u2019d like to ride?\u201d</p><p>Hutch hadn\u2019t taken out his bicycle in years. \u201cI biked through the Skagit Valley once and really enjoyed that.\u201d The landscape was f lat. He didn\u2019t want to huff and puff his way up a hill; he\u2019d prefer to play it safe.</p><p>Phoebe\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cI love the Skagit Valley.\u201d</p><p>He felt like standing up and cheering. \u201cThen it\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They parted outside the caf\u00e9 and Hutch experienced an unfamiliar feeling of satisfaction\u2014with the conversation, with her and even with himself.</p><p>The next morning Hutch arrived at the off ice in an exceptionally good mood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re whistling, \u201d Gail said.</p><p>\u201cI was? When?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust now.\u201d She seemed to approve, however, because she sent him a contented smile.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it,\u201d he said, feeling vaguely puzzled. \u201cListen, I need you to do a couple of things for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrder me two fully assembled mountain bikes. One blue and one red, complete with helmets. Have them delivered to my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away.\u201d</p> <p>That morning he\u2019d checked out the bikes in his garage and they were old and not in the best condition. Rather than spend the time getting them updated and repaired, it would be simpler to purchase new ones.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He felt a bit self-conscious about this. \u201cGo online and order me a book, if you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Do you have the title or the author\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the author, but the title should be along the lines of Dating for Dummies or Relationships for Idiots.\u201d</p><p>Gail couldn\u2019t disguise her amusement, which Hutch chose to overlook. He couldn\u2019t blame her. However, he was willing to start his romantic education from scratch, as long as he could spend time with Phoebe Rylander.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p><p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>\u201cBlossom Street Books.\u201d Anne Marie answered the phone in her usual pleasant tone, assuming the caller would be asking about her hours or whether a particular title had come in.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie, this is Tim Carlsen.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie froze and drew in a deep breath. She\u2019d known it was too much to hope that she\u2019d never hear from him again. Fortunately she was alone in the bookstore. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Carlsen?\u201d she asked stiff ly.</p><p>He ignored the lack of welcome in her voice. \u201cHave you given any more thought to our conversation last week?\u201d he asked. It\u2019d been ten days since she\u2019d heard from Tim Carlsen. Ten days since the Monday afternoon he\u2019d told her he might be Ellen\u2019s biological father. From that moment until now, Anne Marie had been waiting, wondering if he planned to follow through with his threat to take legal action.</p><p>\u201cI assumed the next move was yours,\u201d she said, hoping her bluntness would tell him she had no intention of allowing him into her daughter\u2019s life. It was too late\u2014and besides, the law was on her side.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Tim said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get an attorney. You\u2019re right. Ellen\u2019s your family now. Whether I\u2019m her biological father or not isn\u2019t relevant.\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie was prepared to battle him all the way to the Supreme Court. That he\u2019d capitulated so readily took her by surprise. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, hardly knowing what else to say.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever decide you\u2019d be willing to have Ellen tested...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Undaunted, he continued. \u201cOr if one day Ellen asks about her father, I hope you\u2019ll contact me.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wasn\u2019t sure if this was a ploy. \u201cI doubt that\u2019ll be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt some point there might be a medical issue,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked anxiously. \u201cIs there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. I just want you to realize you can call me if anything like that ever surfaces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t contact you again. I\u2019d like to leave my phone numbers with you, though. If at any time, for any reason, you have a change of heart, I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d call me.\u201d</p><p>He slowly recited three numbers: his home, off ice and cell, which she dutifully copied down and repeated, although she didn\u2019t plan to use any of them except in the direst of circumstances. A silence followed before he said, \u201cI guess there\u2019s nothing more to say.\u201d There was no denying the misery in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t,\u201d Anne Marie agreed. As far as she was concerned, the conversation was over.</p><p>\u201cIf Ellen\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t f inish what he\u2019d started to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she ever needs anything or if you\u2019d ever consider letting me into her life...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already discussed this, Mr. Carlsen. You have my answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. He sounded utterly defeated. \u201cThank you, Ms. Roche.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie replaced the telephone, although her hand lingered on the receiver. She was grateful Tim Carlsen wasn\u2019t going to fight her on this, and the tension in her chest slowly dissipated. She hoped, for Ellen\u2019s sake, that she\u2019d made the right decision. That very evening, Anne Marie had reason to doubt she had. Ellen returned from day camp full of enthusiasm, chattering about the games she\u2019d played and the song she\u2019d learned. She collected Baxter and took him for a walk along Blossom Street, skipping down the sidewalk with boundless energy, greeting her friends along the way.</p><p>Standing in the doorway of the bookstore, Anne Marie watched her daughter. Ellen was a happy child now. She remembered how reticent and quiet Ellen had been when they f irst met. Where was Tim Carlsen then? Where was Ellen\u2019s father when she\u2019d needed him most?</p><p>Anne Marie recognized immediately how unfair she was being to Tim. He\u2019d had no idea Candy Falk had given birth to a child. Even with the little she knew about Candy\u2019s history, Anne Marie was well aware that any one of a number of men could have fathered Ellen.</p><p>That night, when Anne Marie went to check on her daughter, she found Ellen sitting cross-legged on her bed holding a pencil and pad. Baxter lay curled on the bed beside her. Ellen appeared to be deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d Anne Marie asked, sitting beside her.</p><p>\u201cMy list of twenty wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you adding to it?\u201d</p><p>Ellen chewed on the end of her pencil. \u201cNo. I\u2019m looking at all the wishes I already wrote down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of them have come true, haven\u2019t they?\u201d Anne Marie asked. The girl had wanted to learn how to knit, which she\u2019d done. She had her own bedroom furniture now and a friend from school had recently spent the night.</p><p>\u201cNot every wish has come true,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cNot this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one about f inding my father.\u201d</p><p>What was going on? It was almost as if Ellen had heard her phone conversation with Tim Carlsen earlier that day.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think my father looks like?\u201d Ellen asked. To hide her discomfort, Anne Marie grimaced. \u201cI bet he has warts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, big ones. All over his face.\u201d</p><p>Setting aside her pad and pen, Ellen giggled and got up on her knees.</p><p>\u201cAnd really big feet. Size thirty-six shoes,\u201d Anne Marie added.</p><p>\u201cAs big as those shoes clowns wear.\u201d</p><p>Ellen giggled again.</p><p>\u201cI bet his arms are really long and drag on the ground.\u201d Anne Marie stood up and walked around the bed, hunching her shoulders, apelike, and letting her arms dangle so they brushed against the carpeted f loor.</p><p>Her antics got Baxter\u2019s attention and he started barking frantically until Anne Marie stopped, sat down again and petted him. Mollif ied, Baxter returned to his nap.</p><p>Ellen petted him, too. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cNot my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you suppose he looks like?\u201d Anne Marie asked. Ellen\u2019s eyes shone with excitement. \u201cI bet he\u2019s really handsome.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter wasn\u2019t far off the mark there, Anne Marie mused. Tim Carlsen was attractive. Of course, there was always the possibility that he wasn\u2019t Ellen\u2019s father, but that was likely wishful thinking on her part.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if he has hair like mine.\u201d</p><p>That, he did. Anne Marie realized how much Ellen resembled him. She had Tim\u2019s coloring, his dark, straight hair and the same deep, brown eyes. This conversation was becoming more diff icult by the minute.</p><p>\u201cI bet he likes animals, too.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t venture a guess about that.</p><p>\u201cMy f irst mom didn\u2019t. She said she\u2019d get me a dog but she never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly love animals,\u201d Anne Marie commented. Ellen stroked the Yorkie\u2019s side. \u201cEspecially Baxter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially Baxter,\u201d Anne Marie agreed. She looked at the clock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past your bedtime, young lady,\u201d she said with mock severity. Ellen didn\u2019t protest. \u201cCan I read before I go to sleep?\u201d she pleaded. Anne Marie nodded. As was her habit, she knelt next to the bed and listened to Ellen\u2019s prayers. The girl yawned loudly halfway through the list of friends she prayed for every night and ended with a sweet, heartfelt request that God say hello to her Grandma Dolores.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to read tonight?\u201d Anne Marie asked as she bent to kiss Ellen\u2019s forehead.</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s eyes were half closed. \u201cMaybe...not,\u201d she whispered. Anne Marie smiled, then turned off the light and tiptoed from the room.</p><p>For a long time afterward, she sat in the living room, deliberating about Tim Carlsen. At first she was convinced she\u2019d made the decision that was best for Ellen. After all, Carlsen had no legal rights. She wasn\u2019t fooled. There was a very good reason he\u2019d decided not to pursue this through the courts. He\u2019d discovered what Evelyn Boyle had already conf irmed; because the birth certif icate hadn\u2019t acknowledged him as Ellen\u2019s father, the courts had no means of contacting him before the adoption. Which meant Tim wasn\u2019t part of this scenario and had no place in Ellen\u2019s life. Even if he could prove he was Ellen\u2019s biological father, it was too late.</p><p>The only way Tim would be able to know Ellen was if Anne Marie allowed it. She wasn\u2019t about to do that. The man had been a drunk and a drug addict. It didn\u2019t matter that he was clean and sober now\u2014or claimed to be. There were consequences when you\u2019d lived that kind of life. Besides, what guarantee was there that he wouldn\u2019t backslide? Anne Marie wasn\u2019t willing to risk that. No, it was better that Ellen never f ind out about this.</p><p>Having justif ied her decision yet again, Anne Marie was determined to stand by it. She got ready for bed and, unlike her daughter, managed to sit up and read for at least thirty minutes. But despite her most strenuous efforts, her thoughts repeatedly returned to Tim and their telephone conversation. After she\u2019d read the same paragraph three times and still missed its meaning, she slammed the book shut and set it on her nightstand.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d she muttered, switching off the lamp. She slid down in bed, arranged her pillows and nestled against them, then closed her eyes.</p><p>Instantly Tim Carlsen\u2019s image rose before her. \u201cGo away,\u201d she groaned out loud. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>She turned onto her side and tried to force herself to sleep. An hour later she was still awake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After Robert\u2019s death, Anne Marie had diff iculty sleeping. For a while she\u2019d taken coated aspirins that were supposed to aid sleep without upsetting her stomach. They almost always worked. Retrieving a tablet from the bathroom, she swallowed it, then sat in the living room for another thirty minutes, knitting while she waited to feel sleepy. But even knitting didn\u2019t quiet her thoughts. Anne Marie sighed, feeling confusion, guilt, frustration. If Ellen hadn\u2019t mentioned her father, she would\u2019ve dropped the whole matter and the two of them would\u2019ve gone peacefully about their lives.</p><p>What was it with kids? Ellen seemed to have built-in radar, zeroing in on the very topic Anne Marie wanted to avoid. Finally Anne Marie yawned and went back to bed. She crawled under the covers and closed her eyes with renewed determination to cast out all thoughts of Tim Carlsen and his unreasonable request.</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Her mind whirled with a thousand different subjects. She\u2019d talked to two real estate agents that day and had an appointment to look at a house after the holiday weekend. But regardless of what entered her mind, her thoughts always came back to one subject. Tim Carlsen.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Throwing on her bathrobe, Anne Marie marched down the stairs to the bookstore. She switched off the alarm and turned on the lights as she went into her off ice, where she\u2019d left the phone numbers Tim had given her. She punched out his home number, her jaw tight and her teeth clenched.</p><p>His phone rang four times. She half expected a greeting to come on, inviting her to leave a message.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, a groggy Tim answered. \u201cThis better be good,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cTim?\u201d</p> <p>A short pause followed. \u201cAnne Marie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hadn\u2019t even checked. \u201cMidnight,\u201d she said, glancing at the store clock. She wasn\u2019t about to apologize for phoning so late. He was the one who\u2019d kept her up.</p><p>\u201cIs Ellen all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you phoned because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve decided you can have Ellen\u2019s DNA tested, but only under one condition.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t know.\u201d That was Anne Marie\u2019s stipulation and if Tim balked at that, it was over right then and there.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected him to agree so fast.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Anne Marie hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead.</p> <p>\u201cCould we meet this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Fourth of July. We have plans.\u201d It was the truth; she and Ellen would be with Melissa and her family for a barbecue.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, anytime is f ine. You say when and where, and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Without any deliberation, Anne Marie mentioned a nearby park and suggested they meet late Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I tell Ellen?\u201d she asked, wondering how she\u2019d introduce him.</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019m your date,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cMy date?\u201d So he knew she was a widow. He\u2019d implied as much when he\u2019d asked about Ellen\u2019s adoptive father and she\u2019d refused to answer him.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a better idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wished she felt more comfortable with this, but she was committed now, whatever the outcome. \u201cNot a word about the two of you possibly being related,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cNot a word. You have my promise.\u201d</p><p>Whether he kept his promises remained to be seen.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>When I was nine years old my mother gave me a pair of shiny silver aluminum knitting needles and a ball of bright purple yarn and showed me how to cast on for a pair of mittens. I can still remember my excitement as the yarn came alive in my f ingers and turned itself magically from string into a lumpy mitten. I never dreamed then that knitting would become my friend, my refuge, my psychiatrist, sometimes my enemy, and ultimately lead to my career.</p><p>\u2014Jean Leinhauser, Author, Designer, Publisher, Teacher Lydia Goetz</p><p>My yarn store is closed on Mondays, which I reserve for appointments, meetings and housework. Margaret usually visits Mom on Mondays and I try to stop by on Wednesdays. We include her in weekend activities whenever possible. That Monday morning began with the three of us at the breakfast table\u2014Cody, Casey and me. They seemed to be getting along, I\u2019d noticed, exchanging occasional comments with each other, often about Chase. Animals had a way of breaching people\u2019s defenses, allowing them to connect. I\u2019d seen that with Whiskers, too.</p><p>Cody was dressed for day camp and Casey had her books set out for her remedial math class. She never asked for help with homework, although both Brad and I had offered. Her streak of independence was as wide as the Columbia River. Most days I felt she simply tolerated us. Meanwhile, I was working hard to f ind common ground with her.</p><p>She made that diff icult with her mood swings and generally negative attitude. My hope was that today\u2019s visit with her brother\u2014which she didn\u2019t know about yet\u2014would somehow make a difference.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up after class this morning,\u201d I told her casually. Casey looked up from her cereal bowl. \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d go to lunch,\u201d I said. I wanted to surprise her with the visit\u2014but I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her if it all fell through.</p><p>Casey frowned, as though she wasn\u2019t pleased with the idea of joining me for lunch.</p><p>I\u2019d discovered that her brother\u2019s name was Lee Marshall and he\u2019d recently turned eighteen.</p><p>For a minute I thought Casey was going to say something. I half expected her to insist she didn\u2019t need any favors but she didn\u2019t, which was a relief. I didn\u2019t feel like arguing with her.</p><p>\u201cCasey f ixed my backpack,\u201d Cody piped up. \u201cThe zipper was stuck and she got it to work.\u201d</p><p>The girl shrugged, dismissing his appreciation. \u201cNo big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Cody\u2019s grateful and so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve done it just as well,\u201d she said. Cody had the same problem earlier and I\u2019d had real diff iculty getting the zipper unstuck. \u201cMaybe I could have, and maybe not. But I didn\u2019t have to worry about it because you already f ixed it. Thank you, Casey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom isn\u2019t very strong,\u201d Cody was quick to explain. \u201cShe had cancer, you know, and it\u2019s hard for her to do some stuff.\u201d</p><p>I bit my tongue to avoid contradicting Cody. My having had cancer had nothing to do with my ability to slide a zipper up or down.</p><p>\u201cYou had cancer?\u201d Casey frowned as she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cTwice,\u201d Cody said importantly. \u201cIn her head.\u201d</p><p>I made a feeble gesture with my hand, hoping to change the subject. So much of my life had revolved around my illness that I didn\u2019t speak of it all that often these days. But since Casey was obviously curious, I felt I should explain. \u201cI was f irst diagnosed as a teenager and then later as a young adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to die?\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a question most people asked, even if they wondered about it. Anyone who did persist couched the enquiry in more subtle terms, referring to my \u201cprognosis\u201d or \u201cremission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone eventually dies, Casey. It\u2019s part of the human condition.\u201d I felt that was too philosophical, so I smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019m hoping to live a good, long time and become a problem to my children.\u201d I made that plural because of our hopes for adoption. Her concern touched me; I hadn\u2019t expected it of her. Casey nodded and returned to her cereal.</p><p>Casey and Cody left the house together and I tore into my weekly routine of housekeeping and laundry. I didn\u2019t have any appointments other than the one at the juvenile facility in south Seattle early that afternoon.</p><p>The morning sped by and soon it was almost twelve and time to pick up Casey. She slid sullenly into the passenger seat and slammed the door, sitting there without a word for several minutes. Then out of the blue she asked, \u201cDo you want me to get my things f irst?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d I glanced at her as I drove.</p><p>\u201cMy clothes and stuff.\u201d</p><p>The question confused me. \u201cFor lunch?\u201d</p><p>She looked directly at me, her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat about after lunch? You aren\u2019t taking me back to Mrs. Boyle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head as I waited for a light. A hint of a smile came to her, so f leeting that I thought I might have misread it.</p><p>\u201cDid you think that\u2019s what was happening?\u201d I asked, shocked by her assumption. I probably should\u2019ve mentioned my plan earlier and regretted that I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cActually, I wanted this to be a surprise, but I might as well tell you now,\u201d I said.</p><p>I saw her stiffen, as though surprises of any kind were bad and something to be avoided.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our way to the Kent Juvenile Facility so you can visit your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLee?\u201d She jerked her neck to look at me with such speed I actually wondered if she\u2019d dislocated it. \u201cI get to see Lee? \u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so. I called Evelyn Boyle and she set it up for us.\u201d Not without pulling a few strings, I suspected. From that moment forward, Casey couldn\u2019t sit still. Once I\u2019d parked the car in the garage outside the facility, she nearly leaped out the passenger door.</p><p>Thankfully, everything went smoothly when I introduced</p><p>Casey and myself. While the receptionist led her back to visit with her brother, I sat in the waiting area and took out my knitting. Because my little shop on Blossom Street had grown so busy, I found less and less time for my own projects. I knew I\u2019d have a full hour to work on a sweater I was making for Cody. He\u2019d chosen the colors himself\u2014a dark green and brown that looked almost like camouf lage when they were knit together. I\u2019d have it f inished before he started school. I\u2019d offered to knit a poncho for Casey but she\u2019d rejected the idea. It\u2019d hurt my feelings but I didn\u2019t let her know that. I had a pattern that several teenage girls had made, and I\u2019d been so sure she\u2019d like one.</p><p>The hour passed quickly. I spent it knitting\u2014making substantial progress\u2014thinking over some plans for the store and daydreaming about a baby. When Casey reappeared, her eyes were shining and she hurried over to me.</p><p>I tucked my knitting in my bag and stood. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat! Just great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She seemed delighted that I\u2019d remembered. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>Since she was in such a good mood, I took a chance and placed my arm lightly around her shoulders. To my private satisfaction she didn\u2019t shake it off.</p><p>We chose a small Mexican restaurant in downtown Kent and decided to eat outside on the patio. We both ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans, which happened to be the luncheon special. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLee\u2019s doing really well,\u201d Casey said, volunteering the information between bites of chips and salsa.</p><p>\u201cWill he be out soon?\u201d I was curious to learn why he\u2019d been incarcerated but Evelyn hadn\u2019t told me. Reading between the lines, I guessed it was for vandalism\u2014probably not a f irst offense, either. Casey scooped up more salsa. \u201cHe\u2019ll be released this fall. There\u2019s a new program through the state that helps foster kids with college expenses. Lee got his GED while he\u2019s been here and he\u2019s applied to take classes at Highline Community College this September. Oh, and he was really on my case about staying in school. I promised I would\u2014and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d I nodded vigorously. I wanted her to know how much I approved. \u201cDoes Lee have a place to live and a job for when he gets out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best part. He\u2019s going into a group home and they\u2019ll help him f ind a job. Lee really wants to make it, you know? And I want him to, \u2019cause when he\u2019s got a real address and everything, I can go live with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly...only that might take a while.\u201d She lowered her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to be stuck with his little sister too soon.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dimmed slightly. \u201cI can always hope it works out, though. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said. I hoped Lee managed to stay on the straight and narrow so Casey could join him in a home of their own.</p> <p>\u201cHe might go in the army. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea, but he said he\u2019s considering it.\u201d</p><p>In that case, she wouldn\u2019t be able to live with him.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you saw your brother?\u201d I asked. Casey paused, a chip half buried in the salsa. \u201cI don\u2019t remember. Two years ago, I think. He almost didn\u2019t recognize me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years? \u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talk on the phone and stuff, but it\u2019s hard....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe state couldn\u2019t keep you together?\u201d</p> <p>She snickered. \u201cThey have enough trouble f inding a home for one kid.\u201d</p><p>I was completely naive about the foster care program. All I knew was that there was a desperate need for families willing to take in kids.</p><p>Our meals arrived, and we dug into our lunch with enthusiasm. To my astonishment Casey spoke nearly nonstop. Alix had been so right; reconnecting her with her brother had broken down a barrier between us. It was as if I\u2019d suddenly become trustworthy in her eyes. For the f irst time since she\u2019d come to stay with us, I heard about her parents.</p><p>\u201cMy mom and dad divorced when I was too young to remember my dad,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your mom?\u201d I asked when she didn\u2019t immediately continue. I know I\u2019d do whatever it took to make sure I kept Cody with me. My instincts toward our son were no less maternal than if I\u2019d given birth to him myself. His mother, Brad\u2019s ex-wife, drifted in and out of his life whenever the impulse struck her. Janice seemed to undergo periods of guilt, and then she\u2019d want to spend time with Cody every week; after that, a month, sometimes two, would go by and we wouldn\u2019t hear from her. Cody accepted whatever time Janice gave him, and never asked either Brad or me when he\u2019d see his mother again.</p><p>\u201cDid she die, Casey?\u201d I asked, since Casey hadn\u2019t replied.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for bringing it up if the subject\u2019s too painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly, slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. She died, but it was...</p> <p>later.\u201d</p><p>She put aside her fork. \u201cMom got involved with this guy who used to slap her around. Lee tried to step in, but he beat Lee up, too.\u201d She stared down at her plate as she spoke. \u201cThen Martin started hitting me, and my teacher noticed the bruises and called Child Protective Services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they took you and your brother out of the home?\u201d</p><p>Casey nodded. \u201cThe state said if Mom wanted to keep her children, Martin had to leave. But Mom loved Martin\u2014and the things he bought her.\u201d</p><p>I could hardly believe what I was hearing. \u201cYou mean your mother chose a man who abused her and her kids?\u201d It was appalling to me\u2014beyond appalling\u2014that any mother would abandon her own children.</p><p>\u201cMom said we should go live with our dad, only no one knew where he was. When the state couldn\u2019t f ind him, Lee and I were put in foster homes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Casey, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I reached across the table and clasped her arm.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>She began eating again, but I could tell it was more to get me to move my hand than from any interest in her meal.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your mother after you and Lee were out of the house?\u201d</p><p>She went rigid, the fork still in her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She died about three years ago. I think it was from drugs. Martin was her supplier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Casey.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as if it hadn\u2019t affected her one way or the other, but no child could remain untouched by that kind of betrayal. After lunch we drove back home. To my pleasure and surprise Casey wanted to bake cookies. After assembling all the ingredients, I let her work by herself while I folded laundry. Despite a small mishap, in which she set a kitchen towel on f ire taking the cookie sheet out of the oven, she did a good job. As she dealt with the dishes I went into the other room to call Evelyn Boyle. I told her that Brad, Cody and I had talked, and we\u2019d arrived at a consensus\u2014to let Casey stay with us until she\u2019d f inished her summer school program. I could hear the relief in Evelyn\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d she breathed. \u201cCasey\u2019s doing so well with you and Brad.\u201d Evelyn phoned Casey at least once a week. I wasn\u2019t privy to the conversations and assumed the case worker knew better than I did how Casey was adjusting to our family. The f irst real sign of improvement I\u2019d seen had come that afternoon. Apparently we\u2019d made an impact on the girl\u2019s life, and that thrilled me.</p><p>While I had Evelyn on the phone, I asked her about Casey\u2019s parents. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t believe what the girl had said, but I suspected parts of her story were exaggerated. I was shocked to learn that everything Casey had told me was the truth.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the meeting between Casey and her brother go?\u201d</p><p>Evelyn asked.</p><p>\u201cVery well. She seemed like a different person afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Evelyn\u2019s voice rang with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made my day\u2014no, make that my whole week.\u201d</p><p>I f igured she had plenty of weeks when nothing at all went right, so I felt especially pleased that I\u2019d contributed to one of her better days.</p><p>\u201cDoes Casey know she\u2019ll be with you until summer school is out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Brad and I planned to tell her at dinner that night, when the whole family was together.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d Evelyn said fervently. I knew she\u2019d been under tremendous pressure and that by volunteering, Brad and I had taken a load off her shoulders. The fact that Casey and Cody were now getting along made the decision easy.</p><p>That evening, as we sat around the dinner table, I gave Brad a meaningful look. He winked at me, understanding my signal that he should break the news to Casey.</p><p>\u201cSo, Casey,\u201d he said as he passed the macaroni salad to Cody.</p><p>\u201cI hear you had an exciting afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI saw my brother.\u201d</p><p>Cody grinned from ear to ear. \u201cTell her, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Casey glanced from one to the other. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Boyle asked if you could stay with us until you f inished summer school. Your new foster home is in north Seattle, and rather than move you to another place so far from the school, we thought it\u2019d be best if you stayed here.\u201d</p><p>We all waited for Casey\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>Okay. That was it?</p><p>\u201cWould you like to do that?\u201d Brad asked. Like me, he\u2019d anticipated some sort of reaction\u2014something other than the bland response she\u2019d given us.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d she said. I thought she sounded almost indifferent, and that stung a bit. Somehow Brad and I managed to hide our disappointment until we climbed into bed that night. We both sat up, leaning against a pile of pillows, our books in our hands.</p><p>\u201cI thought she\u2019d act a little happier than that,\u201d Brad said. He didn\u2019t need to clarify what\u2014or rather, whom\u2014he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I think we\u2019re making headway.\u201d Improvement came in small doses. I\u2019d noticed a few days ago that she\u2019d replaced the toilet paper in the hall closet. I wasn\u2019t sure if she still had the soda crackers and the other food. Regardless, Casey was beginning to trust us.</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Needless to say, Brad wasn\u2019t around her as much as I was.</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, she baked cookies this afternoon.\u201d I\u2019d never mentioned the hoarding to him.</p><p>\u201cAnd nearly burned down the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad, be fair. That could\u2019ve happened to anyone.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a bad kid, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with you. I see glimmers every now and then of the kid she could be.\u201d</p><p>I set my book on the nightstand and reached for the lamp beside my bed. As I turned off the light, I whispered, \u201cYou\u2019ve been very patient, husband of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatient enough to earn a reward?\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d I said, raising my eyebrows.</p><p>Brad put down his own book and turned off his light. A moment later, I was in my husband\u2019s arms, feeling loved and cherished.</p><p>Ah, yes, this had been a good day indeed.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Phoebe Rylander</p><p>\u201cAnother f lower delivery for you,\u201d Claudia said when Phoebe returned from her lunchtime walk. These short outings had become part of her everyday routine; they helped revive her and refresh her.</p><p>Claudia pointed to a huge f loral arrangement made up entirely of roses. They were stunning, exquisite. Red and white, surrounded by ferns and other delicate greenery in a crystal vase. Phoebe had to hand it to Clark. He never seemed to quit.</p><p>\u201cEither take them home yourself or give them away.\u201d She was not letting Clark Snowden back in her life. He could send her a dozen roses every day for the next f ifty years and it wouldn\u2019t shake her determination. Especially after the wonderful time she\u2019d had with Hutch over the Fourth of July weekend. She smiled thinking about their biking adventure in the Skagit Valley. The tulip fields were long past blooming but the countryside was still beautiful. Phoebe couldn\u2019t remember ever having that much fun with anyone. She\u2019d laughed at his silly comments\u2014he didn\u2019t worry about looking foolish\u2014and exchanged views on all kinds of issues, from politics to household ecology. Hutch was completely unpretentious. Unassuming. And honest.</p><p>\u201cBefore you toss these roses,\u201d Claudia was saying, \u201cyou\u2019d better read the card.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Phoebe shook her head. \u201cNothing Clark has to say is going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Claudia waved her index f inger at Phoebe. \u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t from Clark.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe stared at her. \u201cThey aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Claudia grinned and held up the card, sighing loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you managed to get two handsome men sending you f lowers when I haven\u2019t found even one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive me that!\u201d Phoebe pretended to be annoyed with the receptionist. \u201cDid Hutch send the f lowers?\u201d</p><p>Claudia smiled and handed her the card. Unlike Clark\u2019s notes, which were always romantic, Hutch\u2019s card read simply THANK YOU. HUTCH. Straightforward and unpretentious. Unlike Clark, Hutch hadn\u2019t tried to impress her, hadn\u2019t taken her to a fancy restaurant with a celebrity chef. Instead, he\u2019d brought a picnic, including a bottle of local wine. And to her surprise he hadn\u2019t attempted to kiss her, although Phoebe would\u2019ve welcomed it.</p><p>She waited until three that afternoon, when she had a break and called Hutch at his off ice. She was put directly through by his assistant.</p><p>\u201cThis is Bryan Hutchinson,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it isn\u2019t Lance Armstrong?\u201d she teased.</p> <p>\u201cOh, sorry. Lance speaking.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe laughed. \u201cThank you for the roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to have them on Monday, but Susannah said she preferred to wait until she had a fresh supply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusannah from Susannah\u2019s Garden?\u201d The shop was next to the yarn store and had the most gorgeous display of arrangements and bouquets. Phoebe found herself mesmerized every Wednesday as she gazed into the f lower shop window before class.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of Susannah\u2019s Garden until I signed up for the Knit to Quit class,\u201d Hutch said. \u201cHer f lowers are exceptional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too. Thank you again.\u201d</p> <p>Hutch hesitated. \u201cI wanted you to know how much I enjoyed being with you last weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had an absolutely fabulous time.\u201d</p><p>A short silence followed. Hutch wasn\u2019t good at small talk, and it always seemed to take him a while to feel comfortable with her. That didn\u2019t bother Phoebe. Actually, she liked the contrast with her ex-f ianc\u00e9. Hutch wasn\u2019t smooth like Clark, who could talk his way into or out of anything.</p><p>\u201cWe have class tomorrow night,\u201d she said. She felt a pleasant sense of anticipation about seeing him again.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, class. Have you done your homework yet?\u201d Their weekly assignment was to f inish the current section of the sampler scarf so they\u2019d be ready for the next lesson.</p><p>\u201cYes. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m knitting furiously as we speak.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe laughed. She seemed to do that a lot with Hutch.</p> <p>\u201cHow would you feel...I mean, I know it\u2019d be early, unless you wanted to wait until after. Would that be too late?\u201d He paused as if expecting a response.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me to meet you for dinner?\u201d she speculated.</p><p>\u201cIf so, the answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>Again that short pause. \u201cReally?\u201d he said. \u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>Hearing the pleasure in his voice made her smile.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you sound so shocked when I agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I? Tell me, what woman in her right mind would turn down an invitation from Lance Armstrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, that\u2019s for sure, especially when he\u2019s sent me roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that depends on you. Would you rather eat early or late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason you prefer an early meal?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat way I won\u2019t have to wait so long to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Coming from anyone else, that would have sounded phony. But when Hutch said it, she knew he meant every word.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very romantic,\u201d she murmured. She could practically see him blush.</p><p>\u201cWhat about...\u201d He stumbled on the question. \u201cAre you busy, um, tonight?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe wondered why that hadn\u2019t occurred to her. \u201cNo, as a matter of fact I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to meet this evening instead? No, not instead because I\u2019d be disappointed if you didn\u2019t show up for class tomorrow night, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be at class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. At dinner with me tonight, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I mean, that\u2019s terrif ic.\u201d His voice was exuberant, like that of a child who\u2019d been granted an unexpected gift.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just saying that,\u201d she teased. \u201cHutch, I\u2019d love to meet you tonight. I hated the thought of rushing through our dinner and hurrying to class and afterward... Well, we both have to work in the morning, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. This is much better.\u201d They set a time, then Phoebe ended the conversation; she had a client at three-f ifteen. \u201cBye, Hutch,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cSee you at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Phoebe, and thanks.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure why he was thanking her. She felt she was the one who owed him thanks\u2014for the weekend, the roses, tonight. And for making her laugh.</p><p>As she hung up the phone, it occurred to Phoebe that she didn\u2019t even know what Hutch\u2019s business was. Their conversations had been interesting but not personal. She hadn\u2019t spoken much about her job, either\u2014or her ex-f ianc\u00e9. The f ianc\u00e9 Hutch believed was dead....</p><p>She supposed it didn\u2019t really matter what his family\u2019s company manufactured or what service they provided, as long as it wasn\u2019t immoral or unethical. Which it couldn\u2019t possibly be, knowing Hutch. She amused herself by guessing\u2014shoelaces? Tractor parts?</p><p>Toilets? The subject hadn\u2019t really arisen, but it wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d deliberately hidden anything from her. The number he\u2019d given her was a direct line and his assistant had answered the phone,</p><p>\u201cBryan Hutchinson\u2019s off ice.\u201d Nevertheless it was slightly mysterious. She\u2019d ask him over dinner. Phoebe dressed carefully that evening because she wanted to look attractive, not because she was worried about impressing Hutch with her wardrobe or sense of style. He was a comfortable person, conscious of others\u2019 needs. While biking he\u2019d stopped to help a couple who\u2019d been lost and needed directions. Later he\u2019d purchased a sandwich and a coffee for a homeless man. He hadn\u2019t done it for show; he was a genuinely caring person. Hutch arrived a few minutes early as she was still brushing her hair. Phoebe thought she heard someone outside her condo door and when she went to look through the peephole, she saw him pacing the hallway, checking his watch.</p><p>\u201cHutch,\u201d she said, opening the door. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you knock?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, his expression embarrassed, as he stepped inside her apartment. \u201cThe book said I wasn\u2019t supposed to appear too eager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat book?\u201d</p><p>He came in, sat down on her sofa and exhaled noisily. Right away, Princess, her cat, jumped onto his lap. Phoebe stared in wonder. Princess had detested Clark and hissed at him the very f irst time he entered her condo. After that Princess had consistently avoided him. Apparently her cat was a better judge of character than she was.</p><p>Hutch gently stroked Princess, who purred contentedly. \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t guessed, I\u2019ve been out of the dating scene for a while.\u201d He grinned wryly. \u201cI got a book about dating. It said I shouldn\u2019t arrive too early or I\u2019d seem overeager and that, according to the book, is something women f ind off-putting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Phoebe nearly laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s why you were waiting outside my door?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cbut I love it that you did.\u201d</p><p>Her comment seemed to surprise him.</p><p>She sat beside Hutch, and Princess leaped effortlessly from his lap to hers. \u201cWhat else did the book have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty. I\u2019ve read it three times in the last six days.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe laughed outright. \u201cOh, Hutch, you\u2019re so sweet and funny.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cI\u2019m glad you f ind me amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd refreshing. And just plain wonderful.\u201d</p><p>That brought up a question. \u201cWhen you say I\u2019m sweet, do you mean sweet as in delightful and charming? Or sweet the way young people use it\u2014as in cool, intriguing and very satisfactory?\u201d</p><p>He did a more-than-passable imitation of Bogart. Phoebe\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cBogart\u2019s my hero. The African Queen is my all-time favorite movie.\u201d</p><p>Hutch went still for a moment. \u201cMine, too.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe knew he hadn\u2019t just invented that to f latter her; it wasn\u2019t the sort of thing he did. She got up to feed Princess, then collected her purse. Hutch had made a reservation for six-thirty at a Thai restaurant; Phoebe had immediately agreed when he suggested it. She hadn\u2019t eaten Thai in years. Clark felt that Asian restaurants didn\u2019t attract the \u201cupscale\u201d clientele he wanted to be seen with. He would never have patronized a place like Basil, which Hutch had chosen for their dinner.</p><p>It was obvious that he was acquainted with the owners, who insisted on making the menu selections for them. Phoebe could barely restrain herself from asking Hutch about his background. She waited until they\u2019d been served glasses of icy cold beer.</p><p>\u201cI realized after we hung up this afternoon that I don\u2019t know very much about you,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cYou mean other than my superior biking skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cOther than that and your movie preferences and political views and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... You\u2019re an executive with your family\u2019s business, but what exactly is it?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cEver heard of Mount Rainier Chocolates?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe nearly choked on her beer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding!</p><p>I love those chocolates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. My grandfather started the company shortly after the Second World War. He used a recipe passed down from his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the caramels best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost everyone does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re only mentioning this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were talking about other things,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed our discussions and I saw no reason to bore you with details about my job.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt the sincerity of his answer. \u201cAren\u2019t you a bit young to be at the company helm?\u201d she asked next. Pain showed brief ly in his face. \u201cMy father died of a heart attack. He was f ifty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we all were. The company was everything to Dad. I felt a responsibility to follow in his footsteps. Unfortunately I wasn\u2019t ready to assume the role of CEO, so I had a lot to learn in a short amount of time.\u201d He went on to tell her about the new candy bar the company was introducing, which sounded tempting to Phoebe. \u201cI\u2019ll bring a few to class soon,\u201d he promised. Their food came in several courses and dinner couldn\u2019t have been more delicious. At nine o\u2019clock, after coffee and a dessert of fresh fruit and coconut ice cream, they left with profuse thanks to the owners and staff. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d walked to the restaurant, and when they stepped outside, they noticed the evening had cooled considerably. Phoebe had brought a sweater; Hutch held it politely as she slipped her arms into the sleeves.</p><p>\u201cThat was a divine dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt always is,\u201d Hutch said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I chose this restaurant.\u201d</p><p>They walked side by side in silence, and then Hutch reached for her hand. \u201cThe book said hand-holding is acceptable after the second date,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a list of rules, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat other rules are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing...\u201d He paused. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not giving away all my secrets.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe laughed.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust curious,\u201d she said.</p><p>They strolled down the well-lit street, holding hands, swinging them slightly.</p><p>\u201cAnything in particular that\u2019s arousing your curiosity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Hutch stopped walking and looked down at her. They\u2019d come to a side street where traff ic was light.</p> <p>\u201cI wondered what the book had to say about kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAccording to the rules, it would be within the scope of respectable behavior to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kiss you on the third date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe third date? When was this book published?\u201d</p><p>\u201c1952. I picked it up at a secondhand bookstore\u2014after reading Dating for Dummies. I happen to love old books and I found the advice in the older one more to my liking.\u201d</p><p>They had so many of the same likes and dislikes, and she kept discovering new similarities between them. \u201cI love old books, too. I\u2019ve collected them for years.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, as if nothing she said would surprise him.</p> <p>\u201cMe, too. I like old sci-f i novels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld biographies for me,\u201d she said.</p><p>They continued walking, and Hutch escorted Phoebe to her door. \u201cI had a great time,\u201d she told him, turning to smile up at him.</p><p>\u201cI did, too.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, so Phoebe took matters into her own hands. Rising onto the tips of her toes, she slid her arms around his neck and kissed him. Hutch placed his own arms around her waist, then tightened his embrace.</p><p>The kiss was magical. Romantic. Sexy. Clark always had to be in charge; Hutch simply let their kiss happen. It felt like something shared, as though it belonged to her as much as him. When he lifted his head, he kept his eyes closed for several seconds. Then he cleared his throat. \u201cThat was very...nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Phoebe pressed her hand to his heart, feeling the heavy thudding against her palm. \u201cYes, it was.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. She wouldn\u2019t have believed it was possible, but the second kiss was even better than the f irst.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Phoebe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Hutch.\u201d She felt weak with longing as she fumbled with the key and opened the door.</p><p>Smiling, she set her purse down and immediately noticed the light on her phone. She checked caller ID. No surprise there\u2014 the call had come from Clark.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going again?\u201d Ellen asked, skipping at Anne Marie\u2019s side as she held Baxter\u2019s leash.</p><p>\u201cTo the park.\u201d Anne Marie hadn\u2019t told her much about their meeting with Tim Carlsen. She still wasn\u2019t sure what to say or how much to explain. She\u2019d mentioned only that they\u2019d be seeing a \u201cfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have some ice cream?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>Anne Marie smiled at her. \u201cI think that can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoody.\u201d</p><p>Ellen was so easily pleased, her trust complete. Anne Marie prayed she was doing the right thing by introducing her daughter to Tim. Ever since her late-night phone call, she\u2019d been racked with indecision. More times than she could count, she\u2019d picked up the phone, determined to cancel. And then, overcome with doubt, she\u2019d replace the phone, deciding to let this play out.</p><p>As recently as an hour ago, she\u2019d been convinced it was a terrible mistake. But now she\u2019d f inally made up her mind\u2014she\u2019d grant Tim the privilege of getting to know Ellen. Tim had suggested meeting at the fountain in the center of the park. Sure enough, there he was, sitting on the circular stone edge. Children raced around the park, their glee and excitement infectious in the afternoon sun.</p><p>He stood as they approached, and Anne Marie\u2019s heart felt lodged in her throat.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Tim greeted them, his gaze focused on Ellen. Not understanding, the girl looked up at Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cHello, Tim,\u201d she managed to croak out.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t say anything further or make any effort to introduce him, Tim bent down and thrust out his hand. \u201cYou must be Ellen. My name is Tim.\u201d</p><p>Ellen edged closer to Anne Marie. \u201cThis is Baxter,\u201d she said, motioning toward the Yorkie, who stared curiously at Tim. To Anne Marie\u2019s frequent annoyance, Baxter barked up a mighty storm with just about everyone he encountered for the f irst time. Not with Tim, though. The small dog quietly and without reservation accepted him as a friend.</p><p>\u201cMom said she\u2019d buy me an ice cream,\u201d Ellen announced. Tim\u2019s smile was gentle. \u201cWhat a great idea. I\u2019ll get ice cream for all of us. Why don\u2019t you two sit here and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He started walking toward the nearby ice-cream vendor\u2019s cart, glancing back to send them another reassuring smile. Anne Marie lowered herself to the stone bench, half listening to the melodic splashing of water behind her. Her mouth had gone dry and it felt as if her tongue was glued to her teeth. Normal conversation seemed impossible. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to get through this ordeal without Ellen sensing that something was very wrong.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Tim?\u201d Ellen asked, sitting next to her. She brought Baxter onto her lap and waited for Anne Marie\u2019s explanation. If only there was an easy explanation!</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d Anne Marie said again, surprised she was able to answer at all.</p><p>Ellen didn\u2019t speak for a moment. \u201cIs he your...boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Because she hadn\u2019t come up with anything better, Anne Marie nodded. \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>That appeared to satisfy Ellen. \u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like anyone who bought you ice cream,\u201d Anne Marie teased, hoping to make light of the girl\u2019s immediate acceptance of Tim.</p><p>Ellen giggled. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She petted the Yorkie, who\u2019d curled up in her lap. \u201cBaxter likes him, too.\u201d</p><p>The little traitor, Anne Marie mused. \u201cI saw that.\u201d</p><p>As promised, Tim was back within minutes, carrying three icecream bars. Ellen placed Baxter on the ground as he doled them out. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, polite as always. Unwrapping the bar, Ellen looked at Tim, her head slightly tilted. \u201cMom says you\u2019re her boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Tim\u2019s eyes met hers.</p><p>\u201cSort-of boyfriend,\u201d Anne Marie corrected.</p><p>\u201cWould you like that?\u201d Tim asked Ellen, then took the f irst bite of his ice cream.</p><p>Ellen nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust okay? \u201d he said, pretending to be insulted. He grinned at Anne Marie, who smiled back stiff ly.</p><p>Ellen laughed. \u201cBaxter thinks you are, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog with inf inite good sense.\u201d Tim continued to eat his ice cream and had it half-consumed before Anne Marie had even removed her wrapper.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you want to ask me?\u201d Tim directed the question to Ellen. \u201cSince I might be dating your mother,\u201d he added. She nodded again. \u201cDo you have a job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he told her. \u201cI work at an insurance agency with my father. Dad\u2019s retiring next year and I\u2019ll be taking over the business once he does.\u201d</p><p>Ellen looked at Anne Marie for clarif ication. \u201cHe\u2019s got a good job,\u201d she explained simply. \u201cHe works in an off ice.\u201d</p><p>Ellen\u2019s attention returned to Tim. \u201cDo you drink?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie was shocked by that question. Surely Ellen couldn\u2019t recall her own mother\u2019s drinking\u2014could she? She\u2019d never indicated that in any way.</p><p>\u201cI used to a long time ago but I don\u2019t anymore,\u201d he said in a solemn voice.</p><p>Ellen licked her ice cream while she thought about his response. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for me,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cDo you love Jesus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen,\u201d Anne Marie whispered, worried that the questions were getting too personal.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Tim answered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t always go to church like I should.\u201d</p><p>Ellen accepted that. \u201cDo you like animals?\u201d she asked without a pause.</p><p>Tim nodded. \u201cI had a dog as a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Baxter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. He was a big black Lab named Caesar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any pets now?\u201d</p><p>Tim took her rapid-fire questions in stride. \u201cA cat named Bozo.\u201d</p><p>Ellen giggled delightedly. \u201cThat\u2019s a funny name for a cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBozo\u2019s a funny cat.\u201d Tim crossed his legs at the ankles. He seemed relaxed, at ease, comfortable with the girl\u2019s interrogation. Thankfully, Ellen\u2019s questions had distracted him\u2014and Ellen herself\u2014from the fact that Anne Marie had hardly said a word. She couldn\u2019t. If either of them so much as looked at her, Anne Marie was afraid she might just grab her daughter and take off running.</p><p>\u201cDo you like kids?\u201d Ellen asked next, studying Tim intently.</p><p>\u201cI like them a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle girls, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle girls, too, especially pretty ones like you.\u201d</p><p>His answer made her smile, revealing front teeth that were still a bit too big for her mouth. Anne Marie couldn\u2019t help noticing that Ellen\u2019s dark hair and eyes were nearly a ref lection of Tim\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about having a father in your life, Ellen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Anne Marie shot him a warning frown.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s on my list!\u201d She set the stick from her ice-cream bar carefully on the fountain\u2019s edge. \u201cMom and I have a list of twenty wishes,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you know about it?\u201d</p><p>Tim shook his head. \u201cDo you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen was always eager to talk about her wishes, almost as though she was trying to convert everyone she met. \u201cMom and her friends made these lists of twenty wishes. I made my own list and a bunch of my wishes already came true. I wanted to learn to knit and I did. Mom showed me how and I made a lap robe for my Grandma Dolores. She died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s up in heaven with Jesus now. She loved Him, too. Just like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she\u2019s watching over you from up there,\u201d Tim said sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Mom said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else on your list?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLots! We went to Paris. We were supposed to go last Christmas, but then there was a problem with our airline, remember?</p><p>It was on the TV news and everything, so we had to wait until this summer, but that was even better. I have a new wish now.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t remember her daughter ever being this open with someone who was virtually a stranger.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your new wish?\u201d Tim asked her.</p> <p>\u201cTo learn French. I say a new word every day. Baxter knows that Viens ici means come here. \u201d The dog raised his head and she laughed. \u201cSee? The chien understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve signed her up with a French tutor,\u201d Anne Marie said. She\u2019d found one through Teresa, who seemed acquainted with just about every teacher in the school district. \u201cI\u2019m going to be taking lessons, too.\u201d</p><p>Tim\u2019s eyes softened as he glanced at Anne Marie. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrif ic mother,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a list of wishes?\u201d Ellen demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but I already know what I\u2019m going to wish for.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie looked at him suspiciously as Ellen chattered blithely on. \u201cBarbie and Lillie and Elise have wish lists, too,\u201d she was saying.</p><p>\u201cFriends of yours?\u201d Tim asked, turning to Anne Marie. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cBarbie met Mark,\u201d Ellen continued. \u201cHe\u2019s in a wheelchair and they\u2019re in love. And Lillie met Hector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she love him, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ellen said loudly. \u201cThey hold hands in public. \u201d</p><p>Tim tried to restrain a smile. \u201cTell me more about your wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen\u2019s expression was solemn. \u201cI signed up for karate classes. That was one of my wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>Ellen wrinkled her nose. \u201cToo many boys. They can be mean, you know.\u201d</p><p>Tim nodded gravely. \u201cI heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have kids?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His eyes darted to Anne Marie. \u201cNot yet, but I\u2019d really like to be a daddy one day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA man needs children,\u201d Ellen said with all the wisdom of her nine years.</p><p>\u201cOh? Why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren are important. \u201d</p><p>Once again Tim glanced at Anne Marie. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s something else on my list. I nearly forgot. Only...only this wish hasn\u2019t come true yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to meet my dad.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie placed a protective hand on Ellen\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYour dad?\u201d he repeated slowly.</p><p>Ellen bent down to scoop up the dog and held him close.</p><p>\u201cEverybody has one, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Tim said quietly. \u201cDid anyone ever tell you anything about him?\u201d</p><p>Ellen shook her head sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t even have his picture.\u201d</p><p>That was a blessing as far as Anne Marie was concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he wonders about you, too,\u201d Tim said. \u201cI bet if he knew he had such a lovely little girl, he\u2019d be very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d</p><p>Before this could go any further, Anne Marie said, \u201cEllen, why don\u2019t you play on the swing set while Tim and I visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Can Baxter come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should probably stay here for now. You can take him on the merry-go-round later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed readily enough, then dashed off to play with the other children.</p><p>\u201cEnough about the father business,\u201d Anne Marie said with barely restrained anger.</p><p>Tim raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring it up. She did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou led her on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue, Anne Marie. It\u2019s clear to me that Ellen is curious about her father. That\u2019s the reason you called me in the middle of the night, isn\u2019t it? Ellen asked you questions you couldn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie ignored him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a delightful child,\u201d Tim said, his gaze resting fondly on Ellen.</p><p>No one needed to tell Anne Marie that. Reluctantly she handed over the baggie of hair she\u2019d collected from Ellen\u2019s brush. That was all he required, Tim had said, to establish paternity. He slipped it inside his pocket. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a wonderful job with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer grandmother deserves most of the credit. Ellen\u2019s only been with me for a year or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, she seems happy and well-adjusted.\u201d</p><p>If he thought he could f latter his way into their lives, he was mistaken. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said coolly.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that you allowed me to meet Ellen.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cWith your permission I\u2019d like to meet again.\u201d</p><p>She held herself rigid. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever it\u2019s agreeable with you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him narrowly. \u201cDon\u2019t be so accommodating. It confuses me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and his smile emphasized the laugh lines around his mouth and beside his eyes. Under any other circumstances she would\u2019ve found him charming and attractive. She couldn\u2019t lower her guard with him, though. Not yet, and maybe not ever.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie,\u201d he said, his expression serious. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll let me take you both out on another...date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider it.\u201d Anne Marie wasn\u2019t willing to make any promises beyond that.</p><p>\u201cI am your boyfriend, remember? Your sort-of boyfriend, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him.</p><p>Ellen had waited her turn for a swing and then joined the other kids, kicking her feet in the air as she soared higher and higher. Children\u2019s laughter rang through the park, and Anne Marie recognized the distinctive sound of her daughter\u2019s high-pitched giggle. After several minutes, Ellen raced back to the fountain. Baxter barked when he saw her, his tail wagging madly. Tim got up as she approached. \u201cIt was very nice to meet you, Ellen. And I hope all your wishes come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Especially the one about my father.\u201d She wrinkled her forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t want to meet him?\u201d Tim asked, obviously bewildered.</p><p>\u201cI do, but I asked Mom what she thought he looked like and she said he probably had big warts on his face.\u201d She giggled again. Tim slid a look toward Anne Marie. \u201cDid she, now? What else did she have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Anne Marie rushed to add.</p><p>\u201cThat he had really big feet.\u201d Ellen raised her leg. \u201cFeet as big as a clown\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I doubt that\u2019s true,\u201d Tim said, squatting so the two of them were at eye level. \u201cMy guess is that your father\u2019s a handsome prince who\u2019d like nothing better than to sweep you and your mom off to a magic kingdom.\u201d</p><p>Ellen\u2019s dark eyes rounded with pleasure. \u201cDo you really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it would,\u201d Tim agreed and, straightening, he looked at Anne Marie. \u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201d he asked. And then he winked at her.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Large or small, all types of women\u2019s bodies are beautiful and I want to give knitters permission to express their beauty through what they make and wear.</p><p>\u2014Joan McGowan-Michael, www.whiteliesdesigns.com and author of Knitting Lingerie Style (2007) Lydia Goetz</p><p>I\u2019d noticed subtle changes in Casey since I\u2019d taken her to see her brother, Lee, last Monday. A week had passed, and she\u2019d begun spending more time with the family, instead of hiding in her bedroom with the door closed.</p><p>Without being asked, she\u2019d set the dining-room table one night. I was pleased\u2014and surprised\u2014but I didn\u2019t dare comment. She started doing her homework at the kitchen table, too. All this had taken place since seeing her brother. His encouragement, and his talk about going to college and getting a job so he could send for her, had given her hope. I prayed everything would work out for Lee and consequently for Casey. Monday night, I served my special meat loaf, from a recipe Margaret had shared with me. She hadn\u2019t gotten it via any of the usual methods today\u2014cookbook, magazine or the Food Channel. Instead, my sister had heard about it at her hairdresser\u2019s. Like Margaret, I\u2019ve discovered that some of the best recipes come by word of mouth. It had certainly proved true in this instance. Her meat loaf had become a family favorite. It was a cool and rainy afternoon and because I was home all day doing housework, I didn\u2019t mind having the oven on, even if it was almost the middle of July.</p><p>I\u2019d been to see my mother earlier that morning, having switched days with Margaret, and then after summer school, Casey had hung around me most of the afternoon instead of attending day camp. I thought she might want to make cookies again, but she declined. She asked if she could bake a cake instead. I agreed, and we found a recipe for an apple upside-down cake in my cherished old Joy of Cooking. It turned out really well, too. Again without being asked, she set the table for dinner and called Brad and Cody once everything was ready.</p><p>\u201cJanice phoned me this afternoon,\u201d Brad said as he loaded his plate with a helping of peas and mashed potatoes, followed by a thick slice of meat loaf.</p><p>Cody\u2019s mother hadn\u2019t contacted them since school was dismissed for the summer. I\u2019d been figuring we\u2019d hear from her sooner or later.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to see Cody tomorrow afternoon.\u201d Brad turned to me and then our son.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I said in what I hoped was an encouraging voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about seeing your mother, buddy?\u201d Brad asked, ladling gravy over everything on his plate. Cody shrugged. \u201cDo I have to spend the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you want to.\u201d</p><p>Cody seemed torn. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any computer games and she doesn\u2019t like Chase. Can I see her and hug her and go home again?\u201d</p><p>I hid a smile. Cody was more concerned about being away from his Xbox and his dog than spending time with his mother. And I couldn\u2019t really blame him. Although he was only ten, he knew what Janice was like. He showed her the same level of interest she\u2019d given him.</p><p>Casey frowned as she listened to the exchange. \u201cI thought Lydia was your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Cody said, smashing peas with his fork and mixing them into his potatoes. \u201cI have two moms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI married Brad when Cody was eight,\u201d I explained to Casey.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have more kids?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I set my fork beside my plate. \u201cAs a result of the chemo and radiation used to treat my cancer, I can\u2019t have children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you applied for adoption?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. The subject of my infertility wasn\u2019t as painful to me as it\u2019d once been. For years I\u2019d been convinced that even if I found a man willing to live with the uncertainty I faced as a two-time cancer survivor, my inability to bear a child would kill any hope of marriage. And then I\u2019d met Brad Goetz.... I counted my blessings every day. My feelings of inadequacy had diminished because of his unstinting love and support. And since we\u2019d set our adoption plans in motion, I\u2019d been feeling almost serene. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Casey was quiet after that, as though the conversation distressed her.</p><p>\u201cCody\u2019s going to be with his mother tomorrow afternoon.</p><p>Would you like to come by the yarn store after school?\u201d I asked her as we f inished our meal.</p><p>At f irst Casey didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d spoken to her. \u201cMe?\u201d she asked as she looked around the table.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you,\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cIf you like, I\u2019ll teach you to knit,\u201d</p><p>I offered yet again.</p><p>She gave me her usual shrug. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard,\u201d Cody piped up after he\u2019d carried his plate to the sink. \u201cMom taught my whole class to knit last winter. Everyone made patches for Warm Up America, even the boys. Then Aunt Margaret crocheted them all together and we donated the blanket to a veterans\u2019 home in West Seattle.\u201d</p><p>For the f irst time since I\u2019d mentioned knitting, Casey actually seemed interested.</p> <p>\u201cKnitting helps with math, too,\u201d Cody told her as if he were an expert.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of math,\u201d Brad inserted, looking at Casey. \u201cHow\u2019s your class?\u201d</p><p>Casey replied in the same indifferent way she typically did. \u201cAll right, I guess. Math is stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s a necessary part of everyday life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said a bit defensively.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, I\u2019ll check over your homework,\u201d Brad suggested. He\u2019d made the offer before, but Casey had always turned him down f lat.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want,\u201d she said after a moment.</p><p>Brad and I exchanged a private smile.</p><p>While Cody cleared the serving dishes, Brad and Casey sat in the living room as he reviewed her homework. I couldn\u2019t hear everything he said but they certainly had a lively discussion. Afterward, Casey moved to the kitchen table and exhaled loudly as she threw herself into a chair. \u201cI have to do this assignment over,\u201d she muttered. I patted her shoulder encouragingly and stacked the dishes in the dishwasher.</p><p>Tuesday afternoon, shortly before one, Casey showed up at A Good Yarn, backpack slung over her shoulder. She\u2019d taken the bus by herself. I was nervous about her coping with the different transit schedules, but Casey assured me it wasn\u2019t a problem. Apparently she was more skilled at f inding her way around than I\u2019d assumed, for which I was grateful.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, waiting until Mrs. Sinclair, a repeat customer, had paid for her purchase. \u201cI ordered lunch from across the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks.\u201d Casey went to the back of the shop, to the table where I taught classes.</p><p>My sister had been unusually quiet about Casey. They\u2019d met a couple of times, but just brief ly. I\u2019d only recently told her that Casey would be with us until she\u2019d f inished summer school. Margaret\u2019s reaction was to roll her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI ordered us a Reuben,\u201d I said to Casey, sitting down with her.</p> <p>\u201cAs you can see, they\u2019re huge. I f igured we could split one.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d left a knitting instruction book, a pair of size ten needles and a bright variegated skein of worsted weight yarn on the table for her, as well. It\u2019s been my experience that it\u2019s easier to pick up knitting basics when you\u2019re using larger needles and a thicker yarn.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in a Reuben?\u201d Casey asked, eyeing the sandwich suspiciously.</p><p>I set her half on a paper plate and slid it across the table.</p><p>\u201cCorned beef and mustard, Swiss cheese and sauerkraut,\u201d I answered.</p><p>Casey studied it; her nose wrinkled as if she wasn\u2019t sure she was going to like this. \u201cHow do they get the corn in the beef ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any corn as far as I know.\u201d Funny, I\u2019d never stopped to wonder where the name had come from.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s this Reuben guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t know, either,\u201d I told her. \u201cBut whoever he is, he invented a wonderful sandwich.\u201d I reached for my half and took the f irst bite. It was just as tasty as I remembered. I opened the bag of potato chips and emptied them out on a spare plate, then poured a large bottle of iced tea into two glasses.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and give it a try,\u201d I urged Casey, who seemed to do nothing more than stare at it.</p><p>She picked up her sandwich and tentatively took one small bite. Her eyes brightened. \u201cHey, this is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you so.\u201d</p><p>By this time I\u2019d eaten nearly half of mine. Still, Casey was f inished before me.</p><p>\u201cThat was really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>I collected our paper plates and stuffed them in the recycling bin. \u201cReady for your f irst knitting lesson?\u201d</p><p>Casey nodded.</p><p>I pushed yarn and needles toward her and sat in the adjoining chair. \u201cHow\u2019d school go today?\u201d I asked, making conversation as I delved into the center of the skein, searching for the beginning strand.</p><p>\u201cI got an A on my homework.\u201d</p><p>I paused to say, \u201cCasey, that\u2019s fantastic!\u201d I\u2019d located the strand I wanted and tugged it free.</p><p>Predictably, she shrugged at my compliment, but I knew she was pleased. Once Brad heard the news, he would be, too. I was proud of them both. Proud of Brad because he\u2019d offered his help, been repeatedly rejected and yet tried again. And proud of Casey, too, because she\u2019d been willing to admit she needed help. I had to show her how to cast on two or three times. She couldn\u2019t seem to grasp the technique. In the end I simply did it for her. Unfortunately, things didn\u2019t go any more smoothly when it came to learning the basic knit stitch. To her credit, Casey did try. I could see she was becoming frustrated, so I told her about other people I\u2019d taught to knit.</p><p>\u201cDoes everyone have as much trouble as I\u2019m having?\u201d she asked. She bit her lip as she clutched the two needles. At one stage she held one needle under her arm as she wove the yarn around the tip of the other.</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d I said.</p><p>Margaret wandered by and threw me a look I recognized from our childhood. It said I should have my sanity checked. Maybe so, but I wasn\u2019t willing to abandon hope yet. Soon my nerves were frayed to the breaking point. Unfortunately, Casey\u2019s were, too. When the needle slipped out of her grasp and clattered onto the f loor, Casey bolted upright and threw down the entire project.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cCasey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate knitting. I don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p><p>I longed to reassure her, to remind her that knitting came more quickly to some than it did to others. I didn\u2019t want her to give up so easily. Apparently I hadn\u2019t relayed that message effectively enough.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to learn to knit if you don\u2019t want,\u201d I f inally said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. It\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to argue, but realized there was no point. Picking up the yarn and needles, I set them back on the table. I was disappointed, although I made an effort not to show it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to read?\u201d I asked, thinking I\u2019d send Casey down to Blossom Street Books and let her choose a novel. Otherwise, I didn\u2019t know how I\u2019d keep her entertained for the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said f latly.</p><p>\u201cSo what would you like to do?\u201d</p><p>Casey looked bored. \u201cDo you have a TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>The bell above the door chimed and Jacqueline Donovan, a good friend of mine, walked in. Jacqueline and Reese, her architect husband, had taken a cruise to Hawaii and they\u2019d just returned. I was eager to see her, so I left Casey to her own devices for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline!\u201d I said, hurrying toward her with my hands out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back. Did you have a fabulous trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was incredible. You and Brad should take a cruise sometime.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d love that; unfortunately I couldn\u2019t see it happening in the near future, especially if we were adding a baby to our family. As she headed toward the yarn displays, Jacqueline burbled with all kinds of stories. She\u2019d read a knitting magazine on the plane and decided she had to knit this wonderfully intricate vest for Reese. She examined an expensive hand-dyed alpaca yarn, choosing a lovely deep brown shade. I rang up her purchase. When we\u2019d said goodbye, with promises to see each other soon, I walked back to the table. To my astonishment, Margaret was sitting with Casey.</p><p>The two of them were crocheting.</p><p>Not knitting, crocheting.</p><p>Casey glanced up at me and broke into a smile. \u201cThis is fun,\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun,\u201d I repeated, struck nearly speechless.</p><p>\u201cI can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crocheting a washcloth.\u201d Righteousness rang in my sister\u2019s tone. \u201cLook at her work, Lydia. The girl\u2019s a natural.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to wipe that grin off Margaret\u2019s face, which wasn\u2019t very generous of me. The thing is, she\u2019d succeeded where I\u2019d failed. Casey was relaxed, conf ident and actually enjoying herself.</p><p>\u201cAt the rate she\u2019s going,\u201d Margaret said, \u201cshe\u2019ll have it done before we close up shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d I told them both. I meant it. The bell above the door chimed again, and I left to greet my customer. As I turned away, an unexpected feeling of happiness came over me. Who would\u2019ve guessed that my sister, not me, would be the one to reach Casey?</p><p>My f irst instinct had been a twinge of jealousy; however, that quickly passed. Margaret, so judgmental and disapproving of Casey, had been patient enough to teach the girl crocheting. I was grateful for her kindness.</p><p>Maybe there was hope for all of us\u2014Casey, Margaret and me</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cHutch\u201d Hutchinson</p><p>Hutch was already at the table with Alix, Margaret and Lydia when Phoebe arrived. He\u2019d come ten minutes early, and it wasn\u2019t the thrill of learning a new pattern that had enticed him to leave his off ice ahead of schedule. It was the thrill of falling for Phoebe Rylander. At quarter past six, Hutch discovered that he\u2019d checked his watch no fewer than ten times when Phoebe burst through the door, breathless and f lushed.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she said, hurrying to the back of the store. The spot next to him was empty. Hutch had arranged it by placing his briefcase on the chair until she showed up. Then, and only then, did he conveniently remove it.</p><p>Phoebe pulled out the chair and sent him a f leeting grin as she sat down, breathing hard. He wondered if something had happened and hoped she\u2019d tell him. They\u2019d planned to go for coffee after class.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t miss anything,\u201d Lydia assured her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Phoebe removed her knitting from the bag she carried, still a little out of breath.</p><p>Phoebe must\u2019ve run the entire way from the clinic to Blossom Street, a distance of several blocks. He should know; after the past two classes, he\u2019d walked her to the garage where she parked her car.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s everyone doing?\u201d Lydia asked.</p><p>Hutch held up his scarf. In his own opinion he\u2019d made exceptional progress, especially considering where he\u2019d started. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Lydia said, \u201cI mean with the quitting aspect of the class. I can see how the knitting\u2019s going, and you\u2019re all doing an excellent job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I\u2019m no longer knitting armor,\u201d Hutch told them. His tension had loosened considerably. He\u2019d become more comfortable with the needles, and he credited Lydia for that. But he credited Phoebe for several other changes in his life. When no one else responded, Hutch felt obliged to f ill the silence. \u201cThe knitting\u2019s def initely helped me relax and it seems to have improved my blood pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Lydia smiled in his direction. His mental attitude had improved, too. He\u2019d stopped obsessing about the lawsuit, leaving it in the hands of his attorney. Nothing he did now would affect the outcome, anyway. Knitting had changed his life, he thought with a grin. Through the class he\u2019d met Phoebe and everything seemed different now. Because of her recent loss he didn\u2019t want to rush her, so he made a point of calling her no more than once every other day, counting the hours between calls and dates. With Phoebe he felt witty, clever and downright fascinating. The prospect of seeing her excited him.</p><p>They shared many of the same interests. Her appreciation of old books was only one example of that. Over the weekend she\u2019d shown him her collection, including a f irst edition of Mark Twain\u2019s The Innocents Abroad published in 1869 that, amazingly, she\u2019d picked up at a garage sale for f ive dollars. When he\u2019d gone to her place on Saturday afternoon, he\u2019d f lipped through her stack of DVDs, which conf irmed that they loved the same movies from Bogey to f ilm noir to Indiana Jones. Afterward they\u2019d walked to the theater and shared a bucket of buttered popcorn, watching a brand-new animated feature in the company of at least a hundred kids.</p> <p>Hutch didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever enjoyed an afternoon as much. On his way home, he\u2019d stopped at the off ice, out of pure habit. From the day he\u2019d taken over as CEO, he\u2019d spent every Saturday there. However, he stayed for less than an hour, his mind on everything but business.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your thumb?\u201d Lydia asked, bringing him out of his musings.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, thanks,\u201d he said, bending his thumb to demonstrate his mobility.</p><p>Lydia nodded. \u201cAnd Phoebe?\u201d she asked next. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe glanced at Hutch. \u201cBetter. Much better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know this is a painful time for you....\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes, and when she spoke, her voice was barely audible. \u201cI was late for class because I ran into...an old friend of my f ianc\u00e9\u2019s. I...I told him I\u2019m seeing someone else now and he got terribly upset.\u201d</p><p>Under the table, Hutch clasped her hand. \u201cWho you\u2019re seeing is none of his business,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cI know, but he didn\u2019t want to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSituations like this are diff icult, especially when other people are still grieving, wanting to hold on to the past,\u201d Lydia said. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t let that confrontation ruin your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Phoebe promised, squeezing Hutch\u2019s f ingers, silently thanking him for his support. She exhaled slowly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather not discuss this right now. I\u2019m still upset about it. But I\u2019m trying to put it behind me.\u201d</p> <p>Alix looked at them both as if seeing them with new eyes. Her gaze held his for an instant\u2014and then she winked at him. Hutch assumed that was her way of condoning the relationship. He winked back.</p><p>\u201cI want everyone to know,\u201d Alix said. \u201cI went twenty-four hours without a cigarette.\u201d</p><p>Lydia clapped her hands, and the rest of the group joined in.</p><p>\u201cGood for you, Alix!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, congratulations,\u201d Hutch added.</p><p>Margaret nodded with dignif ied approval.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d Alix said. \u201cI was so cranky that by dinnertime I wasn\u2019t f it company for man or beast. So I went outside and worked in the yard. I managed to weed the whole garden. My body was screaming for a cigarette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t give in to the craving.\u201d Lydia\u2019s tone praised her. Alix shrugged. \u201cNo, but I think by then, Jordan was ready to beg me to smoke again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t.\u201d Margaret shook her head. \u201cHe wants you to quit as much as you want to quit. Maybe more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried any of the nicotine-withdrawal products?\u201d</p><p>Lydia asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried the gum. It does take the edge off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about chocolate?\u201d Hutch asked.</p><p>Alix groaned.</p><p>\u201cI would, but with my addictive personality I\u2019d weigh three hundred pounds in about three weeks.\u201d</p><p>Hutch grinned and reached into his briefcase, taking out a dozen of his company\u2019s new Mount Saint Helens candy bars. He f igured Phoebe was right, and he should tell his fellow classmates about the family business.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s this?\u201d Margaret was the f irst to comment, automatically picking up one of the bars. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen these before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re our new product,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Phoebe smiled. \u201cIn case no one realized it, Hutch and his family own Mount Rainier Chocolates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d Alix said, eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d This came from Margaret.</p><p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d Lydia said next. \u201cPun intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe company\u2019s been in the family for three generations. This is a new product we\u2019re about to launch nationally. Please take one. I\u2019d appreciate your comments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re giving us these?\u201d Margaret grabbed a second bar.</p><p>\u201cYou are kidding, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Alix sounded shocked. Hutch was amused by their reactions. He knew his chocolates were popular, but the members of his knitting class looked at him as if he were handing out hundred-dollar bills. \u201cTake as many as you\u2019d like. You\u2019d be doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come this is our f ifth class, but only now do you reveal who you are?\u201d Margaret asked.</p><p>\u201cIs it important?\u201d Hutch returned.</p><p>\u201cNot in the least,\u201d Lydia said, staring openly at her sister. Margaret tore into one of the bars, and after the f irst bite, declared, \u201cI hate to say it, but this is probably the best chocolate bar I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p><p>Hutch raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhy do you hate to say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love chocolate, and I could eat one\u2014no, two or three\u2014of these every day for the rest of my life. I\u2019m struggling with my weight as it is.\u201d She slapped her legs. \u201cI have the thighs that ate Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Margaret wasn\u2019t generally one to crack jokes, and Hutch laughed appreciatively at her unexpected remark. Women were his target audience, although he didn\u2019t announce the fact. Research showed that women consumed far more chocolate than men; not only that, they were the primary purchasers within the family. Once everyone had eaten a chocolate bar and murmured or groaned happily, they all resumed their knitting and that day\u2019s new stitch.</p><p>Class time sped by. All too soon it was eight o\u2019clock, and they gathered up their things. Hutch and Phoebe crossed the street to the French Caf\u00e9.</p><p>Phoebe had said very little during class. Hutch waited until they were settled in their chairs and had taken their f irst sips of coffee.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like talking about what happened earlier this evening?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t want to pry or prod her to talk if she felt uncomfortable. But conf iding in someone could help, and he was a good listener.</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. \u201cOh, Hutch, it was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He reached across the table and took her hand in a consoling gesture.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2014my f ianc\u00e9\u2019s friend\u2014is...oh, it doesn\u2019t matter. I thought, you know, that if I showed him I was getting on with my life that he\u2019d...that he would, too.\u201d</p><p>Hutch waited a moment, then said, \u201cApparently he wasn\u2019t ready to hear that.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she frowned. \u201cHe went ballistic.\u201d</p><p>Hutch felt that was excessive. The guy\u2019s friend was dead. It wasn\u2019t as though Phoebe could dedicate the rest of her life to the memory of the man she\u2019d loved.</p><p>\u201cWas he especially close to your f ianc\u00e9?\u201d he asked. She didn\u2019t meet his gaze and simply nodded. \u201cI\u2019m still so upset that I don\u2019t really want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Hutch respected that. \u201cThen we won\u2019t. Let\u2019s discuss something cheerful instead.\u201d</p><p>She grinned weakly. \u201cDo you have any ideas?\u2019</p><p>He\u2019d considered this earlier. \u201cWhat about a trip to the beach this weekend?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy family owns a condo in Westport.\u201d</p><p>Hutch hadn\u2019t been there in years. His sister and her family were the only ones who really took advantage of the place. His mother made the trek once every summer with a few of her friends. Hutch f igured he should have a turn, too.</p><p>Phoebe instantly brightened. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>He did want to clear up one thing. \u201cNot to worry\u2014there are three bedrooms. No pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, my masculinity\u2019s suffering here. I was hoping you\u2019d be so tempted by my wild sexuality that you wouldn\u2019t be able to keep your hands off me.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe laughed.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you were.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, too. \u201cWell, maybe, but not all that much.\u201d Hutch wanted to be far more than friends. Still, he\u2019d never coerce her into a sexual relationship, although the subject was on his mind constantly.</p><p>\u201cA weekend at the beach sounds like exactly what I need.\u201d She smiled at him gratefully. \u201cIt would be wonderful to get away for a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll make the arrangements. I\u2019ll pick you up Saturday morning at eight if that\u2019s not too early, and we\u2019ll drive back Sunday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect. I\u2019ll do the cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. There are wonderful restaurants in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I insist. I make a good seafood linguine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to cook, f ine, but it really isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. And I\u2019ll make brunch on Sunday. My cheese omelet will melt in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Hutch couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her. \u201cMaybe we should leave tomorrow instead of waiting for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>For the f irst time all evening, Phoebe looked relaxed and carefree. \u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d she told him, \u201cbut I have clients scheduled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Saturday it is,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSaturday it is,\u201d he echoed. \u201cAnd it can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>Ellen packed her overnight bag as if she intended to spend a month with her new grandmother instead of overnight.</p><p>\u201cShould I take Thierry?\u201d she asked Anne Marie, holding the stuffed teddy bear she\u2019d purchased in France. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll f it in your suitcase,\u201d Anne Marie told her, standing in the doorway of her daughter\u2019s room. \u201cI think you\u2019ll be able to survive one night without him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ellen said, trying to zip up the small suitcase that bulged on both sides. Baxter slept on the bed, curled up tightly, snoozing away the Friday afternoon.</p><p>Anne Marie stepped inside the room. \u201cMaybe I should help you close that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d Ellen insisted, and sure enough, she managed to pull the zipper all the way around, although it was a struggle. Turning, she smiled triumphantly at Anne Marie. \u201cSee?\u201d</p> <p>Anne Marie\u2019s mother had agreed to keep Ellen overnight. This wasn\u2019t the f irst night Ellen had spent with her Grandma Laura. Her mother\u2019s wholehearted support of the adoption meant a lot to Anne Marie, especially since their relationship had been a diff icult one for some years.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to watch movies and have popcorn and then tomorrow Grandma Laura\u2019s taking me to the Pacif ic Science Center and she said I could ride on the monorail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have fun on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ellen asked. Apparently the thought had only now entered her mind.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Anne Marie had a full schedule, too. \u201cTo start with, I\u2019m seeing Tim again.\u201d She\u2019d purposely made it sound like a date. Although they were meeting at a restaurant, this wasn\u2019t a social engagement. Tim had gotten the test results back and had asked to talk to her privately. \u201cThen I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like him,\u201d Ellen said, interrupting her. \u201cHe\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie responded with a wobbly smile. \u201cHe is very nice,\u201d</p><p>she agreed reluctantly. Intent on changing the subject, she quickly added, \u201cThen on Saturday afternoon, when I\u2019m f inished at the bookstore, I\u2019m going out with a real estate agent to look at a couple of houses.\u201d</p><p>Ellen\u2019s face fell. \u201cI don\u2019t want to move. I like it here.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie was well aware of her daughter\u2019s feelings, which was why she\u2019d delayed leaving the neighborhood. Ellen loved their tiny apartment and the friends she\u2019d made on Blossom Street. For most of her life, she\u2019d been shuff led from foster home to foster home, and then to her Grandma Dolores\u2019s. Understandably Ellen craved permanence and stability, and Anne Marie intended to provide that. Whenever they\u2019d discussed moving from the apartment, Ellen had seemed apprehensive, so Anne Marie had waited. She was trying to handle this carefully to avoid undermining Ellen\u2019s still-fragile sense of security. She\u2019d hoped to f ind a house this summer and move in by the time school started. Clearly, that wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>\u201cOnce we\u2019re in our new house we\u2019ll never move again,\u201d Anne Marie promised.</p> <p>She could tell that Ellen didn\u2019t want to talk about this anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat else are you doing?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>\u201cSaturday afternoon I\u2019ll pick you up and we\u2019ll go see Melissa, Michael and the baby. Brandon\u2019s coming, too.\u201d</p><p>Ellen broke into a smile and clapped her hands. \u201cOh, goody!\u201d</p><p>In the course of the past year, Anne Marie\u2019s relationship with her stepdaughter had gone from hostile, on Melissa\u2019s part, to one of mutual affection and shared conf idences. Robert would be thrilled to know that the two women he\u2019d loved were now close friends. His son, Brandon, had always been a supporter of Anne Marie\u2019s and that hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to head out?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>Nodding, Ellen dragged the heavy bag off her bed. On the drive over to her mother\u2019s house, Anne Marie reminded Ellen about her manners, although it wasn\u2019t really necessary, since Ellen was a well-behaved child. Anne Marie stayed only long enough to get her settled. They hugged goodbye and then Ellen stood in the front window, Grandma Laura behind her, waving wildly.</p><p>Nerves twisted Anne Marie\u2019s stomach as she got closer to her destination. She was meeting Tim Carlsen at a restaurant near his insurance agency\u2014and as far from Blossom Street as possible. Forty minutes later, she parked on the street Tim had mentioned. She saw him pacing in front of the old-fashioned diner, waiting for her. Glancing at her watch, she noted that she was right on time, almost to the minute.</p> <p>Tim\u2019s eyes met hers as she crossed the street.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside,\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She didn\u2019t know whether the DNA result was good news, or even what def ined good in this situation. All she could tell was that Tim seemed uneasy. That could mean he\u2019d learned he was Ellen\u2019s biological father\u2014or that he wasn\u2019t. They found a booth and slid inside, sitting opposite each other. The waitress brought over a coffeepot and Anne Marie righted her mug, as did Tim. He and the older woman exchanged fond greetings; he was obviously a regular and well-liked, which didn\u2019t surprise Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she asked anxiously. \u201cWhat did you f ind out?\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer, the waitress returned with menus and said, \u201cThe special today is chicken-fried steak. Cook uses a recipe he got from his grandmother who was from Texas,\u201d she announced proudly. \u201cThe soup\u2019s split pea.\u201d</p><p>After she left, Tim asked, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and then, as if to denounce her as a liar, her stomach growled loudly enough for him to hear. He grinned. \u201cThe soup\u2019s homemade. I know, because I had it for lunch.\u201d</p><p>His smile intrigued Anne Marie. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll have a bowl of the soup, but only if you eat something, too.\u201d</p><p>He agreed and when the waitress came back they placed their orders. A moment later, Anne Marie repeated the question that had been burning in her mind ever since his phone call. \u201cSo you got the results?\u201d</p><p>Tim nodded, took an envelope out of his pocket and handed it to her. \u201cEllen\u2019s my daughter,\u201d he said without preamble. Anne Marie went numb. She wasn\u2019t sure what she was supposed to feel, how she was supposed to react. The f irst emotion that struck her was fear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to remind you that Ellen\u2019s legally my daughter now,\u201d</p><p>she f inally managed. \u201cYou have no rights as far as the courts are concerned. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tim raised one hand to forestall her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have no intention of trying to take her away from you or proceeding with any form of legal action.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie sighed with relief. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Staring down at the table, he unwrapped his silverware, setting it and the paper napkin aside. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you the results shook me,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI thought you already knew.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cI suspected, but having that suspicion conf irmed jolted me. All the emotions I felt\u2014well, it was kind of a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He f idgeted with the fork, running his f inger over the tines.</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, I felt tremendous guilt at having abandoned Candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, you didn\u2019t even know she was pregnant.\u201d Because of that, he had no reason to feel guilty, in her view anyway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Candy tried to let me know and that\u2019s been bothering me.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie looked at him steadily but didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cI had a long talk with my sponsor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sponsor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. In Alcoholics Anonymous, part of the program includes having a sponsor, someone who\u2019s successfully stayed clean and sober. That person listens and encourages when needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She should\u2019ve known that was what he meant. Tim set his fork aside and reached for the spoon. \u201cKnowing I have a child threw me more than anything else since I entered rehab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine the guilt and regret is only natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make it up to Ellen somehow and yet I know I can\u2019t,\u201d</p><p>Tim said. \u201cI have a beautiful, intelligent, delightful child I can\u2019t even acknowledge and it\u2019s killing me.\u201d He plowed his hand through his hair. Anne Marie recognized the agony in that gesture. As if he suddenly realized what he\u2019d said, his gaze shot to her.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t misunderstand me. I don\u2019t blame you. Not in the slightest. If it wasn\u2019t for you in Ellen\u2019s life, I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t be as healthy and happy as she is now. After Dolores died, Ellen could\u2019ve ended up who-knows-where. I can\u2019t even be sure I would\u2019ve found my daughter if not for you or had the chance to conf irm that Ellen\u2019s my child.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, Anne Marie was beginning to feel sorry for him. \u201cDid your sponsor help you sort through all these emotions?\u201d</p><p>Tim responded with a nod. \u201cWhat he said about acknowledging my feelings made sense. At the same time, the fact that Ellen\u2019s my own f lesh and blood hasn\u2019t sunk in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only seen Ellen once and I love her. I mean, I love that little girl. There are years of my life that are more or less a blur. Years I squandered on stupid, destructive behavior. And yet out of that whole mess came Ellen. Precious, innocent, perfect Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s why they say God works in mysterious ways.\u201d</p><p>Tim laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived with their meals, Anne Marie\u2019s soup and chicken-fried steak for Tim. They paused long enough to sample their food.</p><p>After taking a few bites, Tim put down his fork. \u201cWould you allow me to see her again?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hesitated, caught between contradictory impulses\u2014</p><p>compassion for Tim and fear for herself.</p><p>\u201cNot alone or anything. You\u2019d always be there.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie knew that once this door was opened, there\u2019d be no closing it. After a moment, she said\u2014felt she had to say\u2014\u201cI think that would be f ine.\u201d</p><p>For an instant she saw tears glistening in his eyes. \u201cThank you,\u201d</p><p>he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ve been kind and generous when I haven\u2019t deserved either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go about this very slowly,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cHowever you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen believes you\u2019re my boyfriend, and I feel we should let her continue with that assumption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Tim said. \u201cHow soon before I can ask you two on another date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould this Sunday work for you?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled. \u201cThat would work very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a sailboat,\u201d Tim said eagerly. \u201cWould you and Ellen enjoy going out on the water with me?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wouldn\u2019t presume to speak for her daughter, but she knew she herself would love it. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s docked at Lake Washington. I could meet you at the bookstore. Say one-thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Tim ate with renewed vigor. When he\u2019d almost f inished his meal, he stopped and looked directly at Anne Marie. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said again. \u201cFor everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank Ellen.

She wasn\u2019t sure why, but she told him about Robert and how she happened to meet shy, reticent Ellen. Like Ellen\u2019s f inding her father, Anne Marie\u2019s connection with her daughter had started with her own list of twenty wishes.</p><p>\u201cEllen quiet?\u201d Tim said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gradually come out of her shell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me more about her.

His interest was genuine and his love for the daughter he\u2019d never known had touched her heart.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go for a walk?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Like her, he seemed reluctant to part.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you by the agency where Dad and I work.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, curious about everything concerning her daughter\u2019s father.</p><p>Tim paid for their meals and they strolled down the street. When they came to the agency, he pointed to the names printed on the door. \u201cI hope Ellen and my parents will get the opportunity to meet one day,\u201d he said casually. Then, as if he feared he\u2019d said something he shouldn\u2019t, he added, \u201cOnly if you agree, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d she said, willing to consider it.</p><p>\u201cThey never lost faith in me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I was using, they were tough. They didn\u2019t approve of the choices I was making and yet, when I hit bottom, my father was there for me. Mom, too. They\u2019re the ones who arranged for me to enter rehab.\u201d He hadn\u2019t told her much about what he referred to as his \u201cwasted years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the time I wasn\u2019t capable of doing anything for myself. I needed help and like I said, my parents were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sound like wonderful people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. I\u2019m very fortunate. A lot of addicts and alcoholics don\u2019t have the family support I do. It\u2019s made all the difference to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been clean and sober for eight years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the grace of God, nearly nine. For me, it\u2019s one day at a time and it always will be. I attend AA meetings at the rehab center every Thursday night. It\u2019s encouraging for people going through rehab to see someone who\u2019s successfully completed the program and stayed clean all these years.\u201d</p><p>They wandered back to where Anne Marie had parked her car. \u201cThank you for a good evening,\u201d she said. It had been, in more ways than he probably realized.</p><p>Tim opened her car door. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. And...thank you. \u201d</p><p>He stood on the curb, lifting one hand in a small wave as she pulled away.</p><p>Driving home, Anne Marie felt reassured, free of the worry and fear she\u2019d experienced only a few hours ago. She hadn\u2019t been prepared to like Tim Carlsen, but she did.</p><p>She actually liked him quite a bit.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Teaching a child to knit is one of the greatest joys a knitter can experience.</p><p>\u2014Karen Thalacker, author of Knitting with Gigi and Gigi Knits...and Purls. www.gigiknits.com Lydia Goetz</p><p>I\u2019d taken a rare Saturday off and wouldn\u2019t you know it, the day was gloomy and overcast. Brad and I had told the kids that if the weather was nice, we\u2019d rent bikes so they could ride around Green Lake. Casey\u2019s eyes got big when we mentioned it, and I learned she\u2019d never done anything like that. Brad and I generally walked; the three miles around the lake was good exercise and we enjoyed the scenery with its aura of peace and serenity. When we woke to cloudy skies, everyone was disappointed, especially Cody. Casey didn\u2019t say much, but I knew she\u2019d been looking forward to the adventure.</p><p>\u201cIt might not rain,\u201d Cody muttered with his nose pressed against the living-room window.</p><p>No sooner had he made his optimistic forecast than the downpour started. Unlike the usual drizzle we get in the Pacif ic Northwest, it rained buckets, the water hitting the sidewalk with such force it seemed to bounce.</p><p>\u201cPut in a movie,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>Brad had decided to work in the garage, and I planned to use the opportunity to write my aunt Betty a letter. She was my father\u2019s sister and my godmother and we\u2019d always had a special relationship. Betty didn\u2019t have a computer, so e-mail wasn\u2019t an option, but I liked writing her real letters on the stationery she got me for Christmas.</p><p>\u201cWhich movie?\u201d Cody said listlessly. He inspected the DVDs we kept next to the television.</p><p>I could hear him and Casey discussing what to watch and noticed that Cody let Casey make the choice. She picked Schoolof Rock with Jack Black. It was one he\u2019d seen plenty of times and I knew he\u2019d rather see something else. I was proud of him for putting someone else\u2019s desire above his own. Our son was growing up!</p><p>As the movie played, I checked in now and then. At one point I discovered that Cody had taken out a jigsaw puzzle Brad had completed last winter and then dismantled. It was a thousandpiece puzzle depicting a Civil War scene, far beyond our son\u2019s skill level. But I didn\u2019t want to discourage him, so I said nothing. Cody had cleared off the dining-room table and set up the puzzle, just as Brad had months earlier. Then he propped up the box with the painting of Pickett\u2019s charge at Gettysburg and began turning all the pieces faceup, the way he\u2019d seen his father do. Casey sprawled on the sofa, staring at the screen. Chase lay on the f loor nearby and Casey rested one bare foot on his soft back. I wondered why she wasn\u2019t crocheting. From the day Margaret had taught her, she\u2019d had a crochet hook in her hand every spare minute. She\u2019d crocheted f ive washcloths now and I\u2019d given her some leftover yarn for granny squares, which she seemed to enjoy making.</p><p>Then I realized why she was gazing blankly at the TV. She was disappointed that our outing was cancelled because of the weather. I started to tell her we\u2019d do it another day\u2014and stopped. We would, but it might very well be after she\u2019d left for her next foster home. I didn\u2019t want to remind either one of us of that. When I f inished my letter, I sealed the envelope and went in search of a stamp. I thought there might be one on the diningroom hutch. Entering the room to look for it, I saw that Casey had abandoned the movie and was sitting next to Cody at the table.</p><p>\u201cYou need to f ind all the border pieces f irst,\u201d she was telling him. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Frankly, I\u2019d never believed I\u2019d ever see the two of them working together like this, with no squabbling and no complaining. After a moment Cody triumphantly held up a corner piece.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s great,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWe\u2019ll start building out from there.\u201d She set it on the far side of the table. I located a stamp, then glanced over at the two of them. I noticed that Casey had allowed Cody to put several pieces in place.</p><p>\u201cI want to do it,\u201d Cody said loudly when Casey added a small section she\u2019d been working on.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Casey muttered.</p><p>Okay, so maybe I\u2019d been a bit optimistic. But within a few minutes they\u2019d settled back into their cooperative mood, and I heard nothing but occasional murmurs and yelps of satisfaction. Around noon Brad came in for lunch. I\u2019d heated tomato soup and made cheese sandwiches. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in there?\u201d he asked, gesturing toward the dining room.</p><p>\u201cCody and Casey are putting together a jigsaw puzzle, the same one you did last winter.\u201d</p><p>He arched his brows but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cLunch is ready, kids,\u201d I said, poking my head inside. When I saw that they\u2019d already finished the entire border, I was impressed. \u201cHow\u2019d you get so much done so quickly?\u201d</p><p>Holding a single piece in his hand, Cody looked up. \u201cCasey\u2019s really good at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you are, too,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Cody couldn\u2019t stop grinning, he was so pleased. \u201cCan I eat after?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather work on this.\u201d</p><p>I turned to Casey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait, too. We can reheat the soup later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d The movie had long since ended, and the screen was black. I walked over and switched it off, then returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Brad and I ate alone, something that hardly ever happened anymore.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an easy puzzle, you know,\u201d he said. I agreed. \u201cThey seem to be enjoying themselves, though.\u201d</p><p>Brad wolfed down the rest of his sandwich and carried his empty soup bowl to the sink. A moment later, he\u2019d joined the two children, sitting in a chair between them. When I\u2019d put our few dishes in the dishwasher, I joined the family, too. We worked steadily on the puzzle, with a quick lunch break for the kids, and it must\u2019ve been two hours before I realized the sun was shining through the dining-room window.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone want to ride bikes around Green Lake?\u201d I asked. The three of them looked at me, their eyes blank until my comment registered.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Cody cried, pointing at the window. \u201cThe sun\u2019s out!\u201d</p><p>Casey\u2019s smile lit up her face.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone still game to go to the lake?\u201d Brad asked. He didn\u2019t need to repeat the question. Cody and Casey let their feelings be known with boisterous hollering. After some discussion we decided to leave Chase behind. Cody protested loudly but I was afraid the dog would get loose. Chase was otherwise a reasonably well-behaved dog, but he had a bad habit of running ahead, forcing us to chase after him. When we got to Green Lake, I was pleased to see that it wasn\u2019t nearly as crowded as usual. Like us, many families seemed to have abandoned their weekend plans because of the weather. Now, just a couple of hours after the rainstorm, there wasn\u2019t a cloud in the sky. We reached the bicycle rental place and while Brad paid the fees and signed the paperwork, I helped Cody and Casey choose their bikes and put on their helmets. Brad and I thought that instead of walking today we\u2019d cycle, too. The path around the lake was well laid-out and Cody took off f irst, with Casey directly behind him. We circled the lake twice before we stopped for ice cream. Sitting on the bench along the pathway, the four of us licked chocolate-dipped cones, hurrying to eat the ice cream before it melted in the hot July sunshine.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear about the surgical patient who woke up before the doctor was finished with the surgery?\u201d Brad asked the children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He posed it as a serious question, like something he\u2019d heard on the evening news.</p><p>Cody shook his head. \u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Casey said.</p><p>\u201cApparently, the man wanted to f inish his own surgery. The surgeon explained that all that remained was the stitches.\u201d</p> <p>I thought I knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cThe man said he could do that, so the surgeon told him to suture himself.\u201d</p><p>Cody groaned.</p><p>\u201cGood one,\u201d Casey said, grinning broadly. \u201cSuture himself,\u201d</p><p>she repeated, and burst out laughing.</p> <p>Cody\u2019s laughter joined hers, while I was content to roll my eyes and lick my ice cream. Brad was obviously quite happy with himself.</p><p>Casey looked at me, her eyes brimming with joy. It was diff icult to remember that this was the same angry, def iant girl who\u2019d shown up on our doorstep a few weeks earlier.</p><p>\u201cWhen do we have to return the bikes?\u201d Cody wanted to know. Brad checked his watch. \u201cFifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Cody roared to his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s long enough to ride around the lake one more time.\u201d He grabbed his helmet and slammed it on his head. \u201cLast one back is a dead frog.\u201d</p><p>Well, I for one had no intention of being referred to as a dead frog, so I f inished my cone and hopped on my bike. Cody and Casey were already way ahead of me. Brad took his time but it wasn\u2019t long before he sailed past.</p><p>I was the last to arrive at the bike rental shop\u2014to no one\u2019s surprise. Cody leaned against the side of the building with his ankles crossed, as though he\u2019d been waiting there for hours. Brad, who stood beside him, tapped his watch.</p> <p>\u201cHere comes Lydia, the dead frog,\u201d my husband announced. Casey bent double with laughter as if this was the funniest thing she\u2019d ever heard. Fortunately I\u2019m a good sport.</p><p>\u201cYou three had better beware. You never know what might turn up in your stew tonight.\u201d I was planning to ask Brad to grill hamburgers, but I wasn\u2019t telling Cody and Casey that. \u201cFrogs, anyone?\u201d</p><p>Cody shifted toward Casey and said in a stage whisper, \u201cLast Halloween Mom made monster eyeballs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck.\u201d Casey pretended to be horrif ied.</p><p>\u201cIt was really meatballs with a green olive poking out,\u201d Cody explained.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the bat wings,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThey looked like chicken wings to me, but what do I know?\u201d Brad said.</p><p>\u201cGhosts, too,\u201d Cody added. \u201cThose were really just mashed potatoes.\u201d</p> <p>Casey glanced at me. \u201cYou have a great imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try,\u201d I said and looped my arm around her neck as we walked back to the car.</p><p>On the way home we stopped at the grocery store and picked up hamburger buns and fresh tomatoes, although Cody and Brad both hated them.</p><p>Casey and I liked tomatoes and cheese on our burgers, however, and I wasn\u2019t about to be cheated out of this small treat. While I picked out the best tomatoes, Brad and Cody went to the deli for potato salad and baked beans. We were going to have the perfect summer feast.</p><p>While Brad lit the barbecue, Casey and I got everything into serving dishes and set the picnic table in the backyard. Chase and Cody raced around the grass. Cody tossed a Frisbee in the air and the dog caught it every time.</p><p>\u201cYou want to throw it?\u201d Cody asked Casey when she\u2019d f inished helping me.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>I could see that she was grateful, and again I wanted to hug Cody for his thoughtfulness. Our son was capable of real sensitivity and I was sure that was due, in part, to the diff icult situation with his mother. He hadn\u2019t said much about his visit with Janice a week earlier, and I hadn\u2019t asked. Brad had stayed in the car, listening to the radio, while Cody was up in her condo. Cody, like any little boy, loved his mother. He loved me, too, and I didn\u2019t want him to feel guilty about his feelings for Janice. I hurt for him that Janice showed so little interest in his life. During dinner Brad told more of his silly jokes. I remembered a few old knock-knock jokes my father had told when I was a kid. We all laughed rowdily as if we were clever and funny when we were probably neither. We were just having fun as a family. By the time we\u2019d f inished cleaning off the outside table, we decided to work on the jigsaw puzzle again. With the four of us all f inding pieces, it was coming together quickly. Eventually, we grew tired of that and gathered around the television to watch a movie Brad had rented while we were at the grocery store. When the f inal credits rolled, Cody was yawning. It\u2019d been a full, full day.</p><p>\u201cChurch in the morning,\u201d Brad reminded the two children.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to go?\u201d Cody whined.</p><p>There were no Sunday School classes during the summer months, which meant Cody had to sit with Brad and me. It was his least favorite thing to do, but his father and I felt it was important. Casey had accompanied us each week, without comment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going,\u201d Brad informed Cody.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad you did,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d Cody said, pouting.</p><p>I had to laugh. He was such a typical kid.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Chase,\u201d he muttered, starting down the hall toward his bedroom. He paused halfway, then started back. I thought he might want to argue some more about church. Instead he hugged his father, then walked over to me and threw both arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI had fun today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d I said and hugged him back.</p><p>As Cody returned to his bedroom, I saw the look of pain in Casey\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, Casey,\u201d I said. \u201cHow about a hug from you, too?\u201d</p><p>She seemed unsure.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t wait for her to come to me; I walked over and gave her a f irm hug. \u201cI\u2019m glad you were with us today.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I thought she might let her arms dangle at her sides, but then she hugged me. \u201cI had a good time, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d she whispered, \u201cit was probably the very best day of my whole life.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Phoebe Rylander</p><p>The weekend in Westport with Hutch was incredible and wonderful and exciting. Those were only a few of the words Phoebe could think of to describe their time together. The condo overlooked the Pacif ic Ocean on one side and Gray\u2019s Harbor on the other. The community was f illed with quaint shops, delectable seafood restaurants and antique stores and seemed completely unspoiled.</p><p>Holding hands, they\u2019d walked barefoot along the beach and on Saturday afternoon, Hutch assembled huge, complicated kites for them to f ly. Phoebe stood on the shore and laughed hysterically at Hutch\u2019s attempts to keep their strings from tangling. Later on Saturday, after a dinner of Phoebe\u2019s seafood linguine, they sat on the beach in front of a campf ire that crackled and shot sparks in the air. Hutch slipped his arm around her shoulders and drew her close. They didn\u2019t talk; conversation seemed unnecessary. Instead, they\u2019d looked into the mesmerizing f lames as the driftwood burned and simply enjoyed being together.</p><p>Sunday morning, Phoebe insisted on making a cheese omelet, which Hutch praised as lavishly as he had her pasta the night before. They both grew subdued that afternoon, preparing to return to their respective lives. Phoebe regretted having to leave this idyllic place.</p><p>Hutch had kissed her several times, and Phoebe loved being in his arms. He didn\u2019t pressure her to sleep with him, which was a pleasant change from other men she\u2019d dated\u2014Clark in particular.</p><p>It was while she sat staring into the f ire that she\u2019d realized the biggest difference between the two men and the reason she\u2019d always found an excuse to delay her wedding to Clark. Hutch was sincere, genuine, kind, while Clark had shown little evidence of those qualities. Clark\u2019s entire world revolved around him\u2014his career, his ambition, his needs. The more time she spent away from him, the more Phoebe saw how blind she\u2019d been. His inf idelity had been a blessing wrapped in pain and betrayal. How grateful she was now that she hadn\u2019t married him. As she sat by the f ire on the beach, thinking about Clark, Phoebe\u2019s eyes had welled with tears. She could only feel thankful that she\u2019d recognized the truth before it was too late. Hutch seemed to believe that her emotions were connected to the death of her f ianc\u00e9. Phoebe wanted to tell him the truth and knew she needed to do it soon. She regretted the lie. When she\u2019d f irst introduced herself to the class, it had just seemed easier than launching into a complicated explanation. This was the weekend she\u2019d planned to tell him about Clark, but she\u2019d been afraid. She hadn\u2019t wanted to ruin their time together, so she\u2019d put it off yet again.</p><p>Hutch dropped Phoebe at her apartment around eight on Sunday evening. After giving Princess a few minutes\u2019 attention and refreshing her food and water, Phoebe checked her phone. The message light was blinking wildly. Caller ID informed her that the majority of calls had come from Clark. Without listening to any of his attempts to contact her, Phoebe deleted each message until she got to her mother\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe, where are you? Why aren\u2019t you answering the phone?\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice rang with urgency. \u201cClark\u2019s father suffered a massive heart attack. He\u2019s in the hospital. No one knows what\u2019s going to happen. Please call Clark as soon as you get this. I just pray it isn\u2019t too late.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe gasped. She\u2019d always been fond of Clark\u2019s father, and the thought of losing Max shook her badly. Without thinking she grabbed the phone and dialed Clark\u2019s cell.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe!\u201d he said. \u201cThank God you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had emergency bypass surgery on Saturday morning. Where were you? No one seemed to have any idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t important,\u201d she told him. Phoebe didn\u2019t owe him any explanations and she certainly wasn\u2019t about to tell him she\u2019d been in Westport with Hutch.</p><p>Her words had a sobering effect on him. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course,\u201d</p><p>he said. \u201cListen, Phoebe, Dad asked if you\u2019d come and see him. Will you do that? You know how special you are to my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll visit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible for you to come now?\u201d Clark asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. It would mean the world to Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Clark gave her Max\u2019s room number at Swedish Hospital, which she wrote down on a pad near the phone. \u201cI have one request,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Clark was acting far too agreeable. Perhaps she was being cynical, but past experience had taught her he wasn\u2019t to be trusted.</p><p>\u201cIf I go to see your father now, you can\u2019t be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Clark hesitated.</p><p>\u201cAgreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoebe, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my stipulation and either you agree or I\u2019ll arrange another time to come by the hospital.\u201d She\u2019d visit Max during working hours because the one thing she could count on was that Clark wouldn\u2019t show up if it interfered with law-f irm business. Again he paused. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed, Phoebe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wouldn\u2019t deny it. \u201cThanks to you, I\u2019m not the same gullible woman I used to be.

I promise.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she could trust him and said nothing. If he did</p> <p>\u201cjust happen\u201d to stop by, she\u2019d keep her word. She\u2019d simply leave.</p><p>As she hung up the phone, Phoebe closed her eyes. Why Max wanted to see her right now, she couldn\u2019t begin to guess. Was his condition really so dire that she had to rush to the hospital immediately?</p><p>Reaching for her sweater and purse, Phoebe hurried to the parking garage. All the way to the hospital, she resisted the urge to call Hutch and tell him about this unexpected turn of events. But she couldn\u2019t discuss Clark with Hutch because he thought her f ianc\u00e9 was dead. That was the problem with a lie: it occasioned other lies and soon you\u2019d created an ever-increasing spiral of them. And when it came to revealing the truth\u2014well, that was diff icult. She\u2019d wanted to tell him; Hutch deserved to know about Clark. Yet she hadn\u2019t. She was afraid her deception would taint their relationship. And the longer she delayed, the more embarrassing and awkward the truth became. Phoebe found a parking spot on a street that would be well lit once the sun went down and walked the short distance to Swedish Hospital. She wasn\u2019t all that far from Blossom Street. Really, when she thought about it, she had a great deal for which to thank Clark. If not for him, she would never have met Alix, Lydia and Margaret, or for that matter, Hutch. Just thinking about him produced a sense of anticipation. She had Max Snowden\u2019s room number, so Phoebe took the elevator directly to his f loor and entered the surgical ward. In the room, Phoebe found Marlene Snowden sitting by her husband\u2019s bedside, holding his hand. Thankfully, Clark was nowhere in sight.</p><p>When she saw Phoebe, Clark\u2019s mother released Max\u2019s hand and rose to her feet. \u201cPhoebe! I\u2019m so grateful you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Max opened his eyes and smiled, stretching out his arm. \u201cMy dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Max.\u201d He looked pale and weak, so unlike the robust man she\u2019d known. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry this happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to get better soon. It\u2019s only a matter of time before he\u2019s back on the golf course and we\u2019re dancing at the country club again. Isn\u2019t that right, Max?\u201d Marlene gazed down at her husband. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll be making some small lifestyle changes and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Marlene,\u201d her husband said, cutting her off. Marlene Snowden sighed. \u201cI know Max wants to talk to you privately,\u201d she said, patting her husband\u2019s hand, \u201cso I\u2019ll leave you to chat.\u201d She leaned forward and kissed Max on the brow. \u201cI\u2019ll go get a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe watched her go, then turned to Max. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked, frankly curious.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve always loved you,\u201d Max said hoarsely. Phoebe nodded; the affection was mutual.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who talked you into taking Clark back the f irst time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she acknowledged. Pressure had come from all sides, including her own mother, but it was Max who\u2019d convinced her to give Clark another chance. \u201cYou were so sure it would never happen again. Only it did, Max, and frankly I don\u2019t think Clark will ever stop.\u201d</p><p>Max shook his head in disgust. \u201cMy son can be an idiot.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand, echoing his sentiment.</p> <p>\u201cI would\u2019ve enjoyed having you as my daughter-in-law\u2014the daughter I never had.\u201d</p><p>It went without saying that she would\u2019ve enjoyed being part of the Snowden family, too.</p><p>To her horror, Max\u2019s eyes f illed with tears. \u201cIs there any possibility that you\u2019d be willing to forgive Clark and marry him?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe hardly knew how to respond. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me that Clark deserves to lose you. If he hadn\u2019t done this before...\u201d He let the rest fade and turned his head to stare out the hospital window. \u201cIn my heart I know Clark loves you. You\u2019re good for him, Phoebe. When he\u2019s with you, Clark is a better man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Again Max interrupted her. \u201cAlthough Marlene insists I\u2019m going to be as healthy as ever, I\u2019m not convinced. As far as I can tell, I\u2019m living on borrowed time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Max.\u201d Phoebe bit her lower lip. She had only vague memories of her own father, who\u2019d played such a minor role in her life. From the f irst she\u2019d felt a bond with Max, who was like a second father to her.</p><p>\u201cI want to see my son married and settled down. I\u2019d be grateful to hold a grandchild in my arms one day, God willing. Now, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll ever happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a fright,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that, Phoebe.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cDo you know something the doctors haven\u2019t told your family?\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t answer but he looked away, and she realized then that he did. She tightened her grip on his hand.</p><p>\u201cI love my son,\u201d Max murmured. \u201cI know his strengths and his weaknesses. I also know he regrets this mess and that he misses you terribly. He\u2019d do anything to get you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible anymore,\u201d Phoebe whispered.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d be willing to reconsider, I could have a stipulation put in my will.\u201d Max\u2019s gaze implored her. \u201cIf Clark ever again commits any form of inf idelity, I\u2019d disinherit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cYou alone would inherit\u2014not Clark. You and any children the two of you might have.\u201d</p><p>Aware of how much it must\u2019ve hurt him to make such a suggestion, Phoebe pressed the back of his hand against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cMax, I\u2019m sorry but I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d Max smiled up at her, although the effort seemed to drain him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019d sleep a whole lot easier if I knew you\u2019d reconsider marrying Clark.\u201d He paused as though gathering his strength in order to continue. \u201cClark might not admit it, but he needs you, Phoebe.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t conf irm or deny that. Knowing Clark so well, she believed he didn\u2019t need her as much as the evidence that he could manipulate her. What Clark craved above all was control, of everyone and everything around him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but...\u201d</p><p>Max closed his eyes, his strength nearly gone. \u201cClark\u2019s learned his lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know why you wanted to see me?\u201d She had to f ind out whether Clark had a role in this before she could promise Max she\u2019d reconsider.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Max whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s desperate to have you back, on any terms, Phoebe, and asked me to help persuade you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, very clever of him, she mused skeptically. Being an attorney, a very skilled one, meant that his father\u2019s wishes wouldn\u2019t stand in his way. Clark would uncover a loophole. He certainly wouldn\u2019t allow her to take away his inheritance. None of that mattered, though.</p><p>Phoebe shook her head. \u201cMax, I don\u2019t want a husband tied to me because of a stipulation in a will,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIf the bonds of love and commitment aren\u2019t enough, then there\u2019s nothing left to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that I\u2019d even ask such a thing of you proves how badly I want to see my son settled. You\u2019re his equal in every way. Clark isn\u2019t an easy man to love\u2014he\u2019s already proven that.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself Phoebe grinned.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest this if I didn\u2019t believe he was truly sorry. He swore to me that it\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe swore that to me, as well,\u201d Phoebe reminded him. \u201cThe f irst time.\u201d</p><p>Max frowned. \u201cLike I said earlier, he doesn\u2019t deserve your forgiveness or your love.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe debated how much to tell Max, then decided she couldn\u2019t mislead him. \u201cI\u2019ve met someone else, Max.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes dulled and it was several minutes before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cClark doesn\u2019t know that, does he?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe looked away. \u201cI told him, but he didn\u2019t take it well. That\u2019s one of the reasons I insisted he not be here, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be able to come.\u201d</p><p>Max sighed. \u201cForgive an old man for trying to make things right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive. You love your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Phoebe. I wish this had worked out differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Max squeezed her hand. \u201cThank you for being honest with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t mention our conversation to Clark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe,\u201d Marlene Snowden said, startling her as she stepped into the room, holding a cup of coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re dating someone else now. It didn\u2019t take you long, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarlene,\u201d Max protested.</p><p>\u201cClark told me. He was in the cafeteria because you refused to see him. You were with that other man this weekend, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Marlene Snowden demanded in a shrill voice. \u201cNo wonder we couldn\u2019t reach you.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe ignored the accusation.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you accuse my son of cheating!\u201d Marlene continued. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the pot calling the kettle black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time I left,\u201d Phoebe said. She kissed the back of Max\u2019s hand and walked out of the room.</p><p>Thankfully, Clark\u2019s mother didn\u2019t follow her. She wished Max the very best, she\u2019d miss him painfully, but she could never marry his son.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>Beach towels tucked under their arms, Ellen and her friend, Hallie Reynolds, paced anxiously in the apartment, waiting for Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cHurry, Mom!\u201d Ellen cried. \u201cWe\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t,\u201d Anne Marie said as she grabbed the sunblock and threw it in her beach bag. She\u2019d lathered each of the girls earlier. They were all headed to the water park, and even now, Anne Marie wasn\u2019t quite sure how she\u2019d let Ellen and Tim talk her into this. She wore her swimsuit under her shorts and T-shirt, but she had no intention of going in the water. She\u2019d leave that to Tim and the girls. Anne Marie planned to lie on the grass or the beach or whatever was there and laze away the afternoon reading. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom!\u201d Ellen cried again. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hurry up, everyone else will get the best spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost ready.\u201d Anne Marie quickly put on lip gloss and paused to check her ref lection in the bathroom mirror. She ran a brush through her hair, then plopped a brand-new straw hat on her head. This was about as good as it got. She joined the girls, who\u2019d linked arms around each other\u2019s necks. They\u2019d met at the day camp and become instant friends. For the last few weeks, they\u2019d been inseparable. After making sure Baxter had enough water, Anne Marie loaded the girls into her car. They squealed with delight at the prospect of spending the whole afternoon at the water park. When Tim had suggested the outing last weekend, Ellen had been so excited she could barely hold still. Anne Marie couldn\u2019t possibly have declined after that. So here she was, on her one free day of the week, wearing an old swimsuit, a cheap hat and sunglasses. It\u2019d been years since she\u2019d worn this swimsuit. At least it f it, although she had to admit it wasn\u2019t even close to being fashionable. But that was f ine, because she didn\u2019t intend for anyone other than Ellen to see it.</p><p>\u201cTim is my mom\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d Ellen told Hallie on the way to the water park. She was obviously pleased about imparting this information.</p><p>Anne Marie stopped herself from correcting her daughter just in time. Her relationship with Tim was far too complicated to explain. He\u2019d dropped by the bookstore on Saturday and afterward they\u2019d all gone to a movie. When it ended, he\u2019d taken them to dinner at a pizza place, where he\u2019d brought up this Wednesday outing. Tim wasn\u2019t her boyfriend, of course, but Anne Marie had begun to enjoy his company. So had Ellen\u2014who\u2019d started asking a few too many questions about this purported romance. However, except for that night at the diner, she\u2019d only seen him in Ellen\u2019s presence. Nothing \u201cromantic\u201d could happen in those circumstances, and yet...Anne Marie wouldn\u2019t have minded if he\u2019d tried to kiss her. Or wanted to see her on her own. Thinking of Tim in that way was the very last thing she would\u2019ve expected. She suddenly recalled that at her stepdaughter, Melissa\u2019s, wedding, she\u2019d caught the bouquet. Anne Marie had laughed at the time, telling everyone it was clearly a mistake. Then, all these months later, she\u2019d met Tim, and now everything was falling into place. She was attracted to him, he was her daughter\u2019s father\u2014it all seemed to f it. A picture of the three of them creating a family was so tempting, she had to force herself to be sensible. She\u2019d started to build this fantasy and it had to stop.</p> <p>When they arrived at their destination, Anne Marie had to drive to the farthest reaches of the parking lot before she located an empty space.</p><p>Ellen and Hallie were f idgeting, eager to get to the water. The second she turned off the engine, the girls unfastened their seat belts and leaped out of the car. Anne Marie was stuck hauling the beach bag with their inf latables, changes of clothing and everything else. As they neared the ticket stand, she saw Tim waiting there, as they\u2019d agreed earlier.</p><p>When he saw them, he hurried over to Anne Marie and took the heavy bag from her arms.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He smiled at her, then asked the girls, \u201cAre you two ready for some fun?\u201d</p> <p>In response, they gave high-pitched squeals. Once inside the park, they chose a shady spot to arrange their towels and other paraphernalia. Tim helped Anne Marie spread out the blanket she\u2019d brought, while the girls, unable to wait a moment longer, raced toward the wave pool.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Tim,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming in, too?\u201d he asked, sounding disappointed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later,\u201d she said, kicking off her sandals and taking out a paperback novel she\u2019d been looking forward to reading. \u201cI\u2019ll hold down the fort,\u201d she told him, sitting cross-legged on the blanket. They\u2019d been fortunate enough to secure a place on the grassy area in front of the water.</p><p>He jerked the T-shirt over his head, tossed it onto the blanket and ran to the wave pool. She couldn\u2019t help noticing that he had an impressive physique, with sculpted muscles and broad shoulders. He probably worked out, but he wasn\u2019t excessively muscular with that weight-lifter look she hated. He joined in the girls\u2019</p><p>antics as if he were nine years old all over again. Anne Marie did make an effort to read. Soon, however, she abandoned all pretense of following the story and spent her time watching Tim and the girls.</p> <p>\u201cThis is silly,\u201d she muttered and stripped off her T-shirt and shorts. She waded into the pool. The shock of the cool water made her gasp, but after a minute or two she\u2019d adjusted to the temperature. The wave machine, which was periodically turned off, wasn\u2019t on just then.</p><p>Ellen and Hallie rushed toward her, and Anne Marie instinctively held up her hands. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep my hair from getting\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a chance to finish before two teenage boys nearby decided to have a water f ight. Caught between them, Anne Marie was drenched within seconds. Her hair hung in wet tendrils about her face. She wiped her eyes, blinking to clear them of water. So much for that idea.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to splash them back?\u201d Tim asked, making no effort to disguise his amusement. \u201cI\u2019ll defend your honor.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie played along, clasping her hands and batting her lashes outrageously. \u201cMy hero!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, watch!\u201d Ellen shouted and dove underwater. In a few seconds, she\u2019d thrust her skinny legs into the air as she stood on her hands. She surfaced and shoved the wet hair out of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid you see? Did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were so agile,\u201d Anne Marie teased.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s agile? \u201d Hallie asked.</p><p>\u201cLimber,\u201d Tim explained.</p><p>Hallie exchanged a blank look with Ellen.</p><p>\u201cIt means I\u2019m talented,\u201d Ellen said.</p><p>\u201cSo am I!\u201d Hallie imitated the trick and a moment later both girls were upside down.</p><p>A bell rang, indicating that the waves were about to start again. When Anne Marie had watched earlier, she thought it looked tame enough\u2014at least from the sidelines.</p><p>\u201cGet back, Mom,\u201d Ellen warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m f ine,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>Standing near the \u201cshore\u201d with both girls, Tim called out,</p><p>\u201cYou might want to move to the shallow end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you two cut it out?\u201d Anne Marie said as the f irst wave hit her. She was swept off her feet and went tumbling through the water. She came up choking and sputtering to the sounds of Tim, Ellen and Hallie roaring with laughter.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Anne Marie managed to say. Clutching her throat, she made a show of choking. Soon Ellen and Hallie were pounding her on the back.</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s biggest concern was that the girls not get sunburned. Throughout the afternoon she repeatedly slathered them with sunblock. Returning the favor, Ellen rubbed the lotion on Anne Marie\u2019s back. At one point, Anne Marie caught Tim watching her\u2014and suspected he would\u2019ve enjoyed being the one to rub her back. It was a good feeling and she held on to it for several minutes.</p><p>They stayed at the park until after f ive and although the girls were bone-weary, they protested when Tim announced it was time to leave. In order to buy peace, Tim offered them dinner at McDonald\u2019s. They stopped at one close to the park, and Tim purchased cheeseburgers, fries and milkshakes for everyone. Anne Marie couldn\u2019t remember having such a good appetite in years. She relished every bite of her burger and drank every drop of her milkshake.</p><p>When she\u2019d f inished her meal, Anne Marie felt completely relaxed, completely content. While the girls explored the playground, she and Tim sat in the booth, chatting.</p><p>\u201cThank you. That was a lot of fun,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to go in the water but I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d</p><p>His gaze held hers for an extra-long moment. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did, too.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much of a choice, did I?\u201d</p><p>The girls would eventually have dragged her into the water, one way or another.</p><p>Tim glanced at Ellen, who\u2019d clambered to the top of a huge red slide. \u201cShe\u2019s terrif ic, isn\u2019t she? So conf ident and naturally charming...\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded, enjoying the opportunity to see her daughter through another person\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He sighed, and then looked tentatively at Anne Marie. \u201cWould it be all right if just the two of us\u2014just you and I\u2014went out to dinner one night?\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. \u201cSure,\u201d she said, trying to sound nonchalant. In reality she was excited about seeing Tim again. On their own. Without kids. It was her fantasy coming to life....</p><p>\u201cWhat about Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday works for me,\u201d she replied. It wasn\u2019t as though she had to check her social calendar; she rarely had plans for Friday night.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a wonderful Italian restaurant not far from Blossom Street,\u201d he was saying. \u201cTheir eggplant parmesan is out of this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like eggplant?\u201d she asked, wrinkling her nose.</p><p>\u201cLove it.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie cringed.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather eat somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, they\u2019ll have something other than eggplant on the menu. I\u2019m a pasta girl myself.\u201d</p><p>Tim grinned. \u201cThen Italian it is.\u201d</p><p>Apparently the girls were f inished playing because they ran back to the booth, laughing as they did.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>Ellen and Hallie both nodded.</p><p>As Tim slid out of the booth, Ellen turned to him, an odd look on her face. \u201cYou can kiss my mom if you want,\u201d she whispered loudly.</p><p>\u201cEllen!\u201d Anne Marie said, shocked. She could see that Tim was trying to hide a grin.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve been thinking about doing exactly that,\u201d he announced. Leaning forward, he planted a loud kiss on Anne Marie\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Ellen frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not a real kiss, not like in the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause adults do it in the dark,\u201d Hallie said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like kids watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Apparently this made everything clear to Ellen. Anne Marie, Ellen and her friend parted company with Tim in the parking lot, although he insisted on following them back to Blossom Street. By the time she dropped Hallie off and drove home, it was almost seven-thirty. Ellen was struggling to keep her eyes open.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sleepyhead,\u201d Anne Marie said.</p><p>Ellen trailed her sluggishly up the stairs, dragging her beach towel behind her. Baxter greeted them enthusiastically, no doubt ready for his supper, his walk and some intensive cuddling. Anne Marie fed the dog, then threw their towels and swimsuits in the washing machine. Tim volunteered to take Baxter for a short walk and she accepted his offer. When he returned with the Yorkie, they found Ellen fast asleep on the sofa. Tim kissed her forehead, then lingered only a moment, declining coffee or tea. Anne Marie had to admit she was disappointed that he didn\u2019t take the opportunity to kiss her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After seeing him out, she carried her daughter to the bedroom. Without bothering to change Ellen\u2019s clothes, Anne Marie put her to bed, tucked under a crisp, cool sheet. It\u2019d been a long, exhausting day. An exhilarating day...</p><p>The phone rang as Anne Marie was putting their wet clothes in the dryer. The tiny laundry room adjoined the kitchen, and she dashed out, lunging for the phone on the second ring for fear it would wake Ellen.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie?\u201d her friend Barbie asked. \u201cIs everything okay?</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just spent an entire afternoon at a water park with Ellen and Tim. Ellen\u2019s asleep and I\u2019m exhausted. Who would\u2019ve guessed swimming could be so draining?\u201d</p><p>Barbie laughed. \u201cIt can be a lot of fun, too.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie knew how much Barbie and Mark enjoyed the hours they spent in her swimming pool. Mark was bound to a wheelchair and loved the freedom water afforded him. \u201cIt was. We had a blast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everything\u2019s going well with Tim?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes...\u201d Anne Marie had been skeptical when Tim f irst ap proached her, but her reaction to him had moved into a whole new stage. The way she felt about his invitation proved that. It was time they got to know each other, she decided, time they tested this growing awareness between them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re attracted to him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Anne Marie admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s been wonderful with Ellen and he\u2019s respectful of my place in her life.\u201d Because she\u2019d needed someone to conf ide in, Anne Marie had shared her concerns with Barbie when Tim made his initial overtures.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more, right?\u201d</p><p>Barbie seemed to have some kind of intuition when it came to relationships\u2014romance radar, she called it. \u201cTim asked me out to dinner,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>\u201cJust you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust me. On Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring Ellen here?\u201d Barbie said. \u201cActually, I was phoning to invite both of you to come over on Friday night for a pool party. Mom and Hector are coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want Ellen to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? She wouldn\u2019t be any bother. Hector can bring one of his great-nieces and the two of them will entertain each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Barbie, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>Never one to hold back, Barbie asked, \u201cHas Tim kissed you yet?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t think she could include that peck on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHe has, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Barbie burst out.</p> <p>\u201cTechnically, yes\u2014but it was just for show.\u201d</p><p>Barbie laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. This is ideal, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d she asked, although she was beginning to feel the same way. She was falling for this guy, who happened to be her adopted daughter\u2019s biological father.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect scenario for Ellen,\u201d Barbie was saying.</p><p>\u201cMaybe...\u201d Anne Marie hated to seem so tentative. She\u2019d begun to hope that a relationship between her and Tim was possible, but she wasn\u2019t quite ready to believe it. \u201cDo you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Barbie insisted. \u201cEllen would have the mother who loves her and her biological father. This couldn\u2019t have worked out better if you\u2019d planned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d Anne Marie said wryly.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so perfect. Promise me one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll tell me everything when you come to pick up Ellen on Friday night. Oh\u2014and I want to meet him soon.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Anne Marie put the phone down, wearing a huge grin. Despite Barbie\u2019s optimism, she hoped she wasn\u2019t counting on too much\u2014and at the same time she felt encouraged by Tim\u2019s dinner invitation. She sensed he was attracted to her, just as she was to him. In fact, she found herself thinking about him far too often, thinking about the two of them\u2014and their daughter.</p><p>Her biggest fear was that she might be setting herself up for a major disappointment, one that would hurt Ellen, too.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>After thirty years in the courtroom telling yarns, I started to learn how to make it. The biggest revelation was that yarn, like society, is only held together by friction\u2014and then only loosely.</p><p>\u2014Cecil Miskin, owner, Buffalo Gold, www.buffalogold.net Lydia Goetz</p><p>\u201cCasey!\u201d Cody shouted at the top of his lungs.</p><p>\u201cPhone!\u201d</p><p>Casey stuck her head out her bedroom door. \u201cI got a phone call?\u201d she asked, sounding more than a little surprised. In the month and a half Casey had been living with us, she hadn\u2019t received a single call. When I\u2019d asked her about this, she\u2019d shrugged off the question, answering it with one of her own.</p><p>\u201cWhy make friends when I\u2019ll be moving at the end of the summer anyway?\u201d</p><p>That left me with another question, which I didn\u2019t ask. According to Evelyn Boyle, Casey had attended school in this neighborhood for most of the school year. Did Casey actually mean she hadn\u2019t made a single friend in that whole time? Of course it might just be that none of her school friends were part of the summer program. But then why didn\u2019t she keep in touch with them? It didn\u2019t seem natural to purposely avoid friends, even short-term ones. I\u2019d made friends at summer camp while I was growing up and on vacation with my family. Some of those friendships had been brief, but they\u2019d almost all left me with pleasant memories.</p><p>I\u2019d noticed how reticent Casey was about opening up to others. That explained why it\u2019d taken weeks for her to come outside her bedroom for anything other than meals. She liked the three of us, I could tell, and she enjoyed learning and doing new things. Brad and I had grown attached to her. In fact, we\u2019d gone so far as to discuss taking her on as our foster daughter, but Evelyn had already made arrangements with a good family. Twice now, Casey had come to the yarn store and worked for me. Well, maybe worked was a slight overstatement. She wanted to help, so I let her put price tags on skeins of yarn and restock the shelves. Despite a few mistakes, I paid her. Within half an hour, she\u2019d blown that f irst twenty dollars, buying a cover for an iPod she didn\u2019t have. She managed to hold on to the second twenty a bit longer. Two hours, I\u2019d say. Casey seemed to be doing better in her classes, too. I\u2019m convinced that was due to Brad, who\u2019d begun to check her homework every night. He showed limitless patience as he sat with her and explained fractions. The concept was hard for Casey to grasp. She seemed reassured when I told her I\u2019d had a diff icult time with fractions, too. For her, the breakthrough came while she was baking a cake. I\u2019d picked up a variety of mixes, which she made at least twice a week. We\u2019d eaten more cake since her arrival than in the previous two years.</p><p>She was mixing a cake when Brad pointed out that she didn\u2019t need to pour in the water and oil separately if she could f igure out how to add a cup and a quarter of water to a third of a cup of oil in the same measuring container. The two of them worked it out together. That practical lesson in fractions led to understanding, and for the f irst time she seemed to actually get it. I was still waiting for Casey to come to the phone. \u201cWho is it?\u201d she called out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cody yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Now, this was an intriguing development. As if she had no interest in answering the phone, Casey came slowly out of her bedroom and shuff led down the hall. I was knitting in the living room, while Brad read the paper\u2014</p><p>typical after-dinner activities, in other words. I didn\u2019t listen in on Casey\u2019s phone call, but I was relieved to know she was making friends.</p><p>The conversation ended after less than five minutes. I was jolted when she banged down the receiver and raced back to her bedroom. She slammed the door so hard I swear it shook the whole house. Brad glanced up from the paper. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, but I think I should f ind out.\u201d</p><p>His nod told me he agreed.</p><p>I gave Casey ten minutes to cool down, then knocked politely on her bedroom door.</p><p>She ignored me.</p><p>\u201cCasey?\u201d I called. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I knew better than to ask if anything was wrong. From experience I realized she\u2019d deny it. No answer.</p><p>Tentatively I opened the door and stepped inside to see her sprawled on the bed, face buried in her arms. She wasn\u2019t crying or showing any other sign of distress. But then, I\u2019d never seen Casey cry.</p><p>I stood by the edge of the bed and gently stroked her hair. She shook off my hand.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t...need...anyone.\u201d Each word was said from between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cWho was that on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be kind of difficult for no one to make a telephone call.\u201d</p><p>She clearly didn\u2019t appreciate my weak attempt at humor. I stayed with her for a few more minutes. Everything about her body language told me she didn\u2019t want me there. The longer I stayed, the more she seemed to stiffen with resentment. She couldn\u2019t have made her feelings any plainer. I hate to admit how discouraged I was. I\u2019d been willing to listen and reassure Casey. I wanted her to conf ide in me. I yearned to hold her and show her how much I cared, to tell her that if her heart was broken, then so was mine. Instead, she rejected every overture of comfort.</p><p>Her dismissal hurt. I blinked back tears as I silently rose and left her alone. I sat in the living room not sure what to think. After a while Brad lowered the paper. \u201cYou upset about something?\u201d he asked. Sometimes men can be so obtuse. Obviously I was upset! All he had to do was look at me to know that.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>My husband has the most expressive eyebrows I\u2019ve ever seen. They inched toward his hairline, conveying sympathy\u2014and a bit of shock at my rudeness. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d he asked. I crossed my arms and shook my head. I suppose I was acting like a rebellious child but at the moment I didn\u2019t care. Having Casey live with us hadn\u2019t been easy. This girl came complete with a matched set of emotional baggage.</p><p>\u201cI take it this has to do with Casey?\u201d Brad continued. Cody dashed into the living room, Chase at his heels. He halted abruptly when he saw us. \u201cAre you guys f ighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brad answered. \u201cYour mom\u2019s worried about Casey. Can you tell us anything about that phone call you took earlier?\u201d</p><p>Cody sat down next to his father. \u201cI heard him say his name was Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLee,\u201d I repeated, dropping my arms. I leaned forward and looked at Brad. \u201cThat\u2019s her brother.\u201d And then all at once I knew. \u201cWhen I took Casey to visit him, Lee told her he was going to college and would be getting a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019d send for her,\u201d Brad murmured.</p><p>\u201cShe also said he was considering the army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he does, she won\u2019t be moving in with him.\u201d</p><p>It was the only thing that would distress Casey this much. That short visit with her brother had given her hope\u2014hope of getting out of the system, hope of being with him, hope of living a normal life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><p>Sometimes I worried that making an emotional investment in Casey was a big mistake. At the end of the summer she\u2019d be leaving us and we had to accept that, just as she did. But how could we not care about her?</p><p>Brad frowned. \u201cShould I see if she\u2019ll talk to me?\u201d he asked. Since I hadn\u2019t gotten anywhere, I didn\u2019t think he would either, but that was no reason not to try. After all, Brad was the one who\u2019d devoted hours to teaching her about fractions.</p><p>\u201cLet me try,\u201d Cody piped up. \u201cMe and Chase,\u201d he said in all seriousness.</p> <p>Brad turned to me for my opinion and I gestured helplessly.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, son,\u201d Brad said. \u201cSee what you can do.\u201d</p><p>Cody nodded. \u201cCome, Chase,\u201d he commanded. \u201cCasey needs us.\u201d</p><p>The two of them trotted down the hallway to Casey\u2019s bedroom. Cody knocked, then opened the door and went inside. Brad and I waited. My fear was that Casey would scream at him and hurt his feelings. Without realizing it, I sat on the edge of my cushion, ready to hurry to his rescue if the need arose. Probably ten minutes passed, with each one feeling like a hundred. If Cody and Casey were talking, I couldn\u2019t hear their voices. I strained to listen and heard nothing.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you suppose is happening in there?\u201d Brad asked. He looked as tense as I felt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>Finally, just when I was about to investigate on my own, Casey\u2019s bedroom door opened. \u201cMom,\u201d Cody yelled, as if I was in the basement instead of one room away. \u201cDo we have any ice cream?\u201d He made it sound like a call to 9-1-1.</p><p>\u201cI believe so,\u201d I said as calmly as I could.</p><p>\u201cWe need two bowls, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo bowls coming right up.\u201d</p> <p>He closed the door, then jerked it open again. \u201cWhat about chocolate syrup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I\u2019ll check.\u201d</p><p>Brad was on his feet, too. \u201cI\u2019ll make a quick run to the store if necessary.\u201d</p><p>I was already in the kitchen, investigating the cupboard where I knew I\u2019d f ind chocolate syrup if we had any. \u201cGot it,\u201d I called out triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Cody\u2019s voice was relieved. \u201cHurry, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d I promised him.</p><p>Working together, Brad and I quickly prepared two heaping bowls of vanilla ice cream covered with chocolate syrup. When I f inished adding the chocolate, I asked, \u201cShould I look for whipped topping?\u201d</p><p>Brad shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>Each of us carrying a bowl, we approached the closed bedroom door.</p><p>Brad knocked and turned the knob. We stepped inside, holding out the ice cream as though we\u2019d come bearing gifts of gold and precious jewels.</p><p>Casey sat on the bed with her back to the wall. Cody was sitting there, too, and Chase lay between them. Casey\u2019s hand was on his fur, which she stroked methodically, avoiding eye contact with either Brad or me.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom and Dad,\u201d Cody said.</p><p>We\u2019d been dismissed.</p><p>We went back to the living room, where I picked up my knitting and Brad turned on the TV. We were halfway through an episode of CSI: Miami when the bedroom door opened and Cody came out, holding two empty bowls.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right in there?\u201d Brad asked. Cody nodded. \u201cIce cream doesn\u2019t cure anything,\u201d he said sagely, \u201cbut it sure helps with the pain.\u201d He brought the bowls to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWho told him that?\u201d Brad wondered.</p><p>I ventured a guess. \u201cEither Margaret or Alix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hang around with wise women, my love,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>I had to agree. \u201cYou in the mood for ice cream?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It seems to work.\u201d</p><p>We smiled at each other. A crisis had been averted. After a while Casey came out of her room with her crochet hook and a skein of yarn under one arm. \u201cI need help with this,\u201d</p><p>she said, as if the events of this evening had never occurred.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I certainly wasn\u2019t an expert at crocheting but I could read the directions. If not, I could always contact my sister. Casey sat on the sofa beside me. \u201cI think I made a mistake here.\u201d She held it out for me to examine.</p><p>I studied the washcloth she\u2019d started and didn\u2019t f ind anything wrong. \u201cIt looks f ine to me, Casey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYou might want to have Margaret check it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes f lew up to meet mine. \u201cCan I come to the shop again? You don\u2019t have to pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a whole list of things that need your attention and of course I\u2019ll pay you.\u201d</p><p>I could see she was pleased, although she tried to hide it.</p><p>\u201cThat would be okay, I guess.\u201d I realized she didn\u2019t want me to know how much she liked being at the yarn store. That attitude always caught me unawares. This fear of losing what she valued most. Wasn\u2019t that exactly what Alix had warned me about?</p><p>She returned to her room, and I went to bed around ten, exhausted. All the melodrama of the evening had tired me out. I still didn\u2019t know what Lee had said to Casey and most likely I never would. If she\u2019d told Cody, he hadn\u2019t indicated in any way. Curious though I was, I didn\u2019t feel I could pry it out of him. That wasn\u2019t the example I wanted to set. The phone rang just as Brad stepped out of the bathroom, dressed for bed. The sharp, unexpected sound startled us both. I reached for it quickly.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cLydia,\u201d my sister boomed over the line. \u201cIt\u2019s Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d My mother\u2019s declining health had been a major concern for more than a year now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the E.R. Mom fell.\u201d</p><p>I gasped and reached out for Brad. He gripped my f ingers. \u201cIs she hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her hip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Shivers raced down my spine.</p><p>\u201cThank God someone heard her.\u201d</p><p>More than a year earlier, Mom had been diagnosed with diabetes and had to have her blood sugars carefully monitored. That had been the beginning of her health problems. The decline had been rapid since then.</p><p>\u201cIs it broken?\u201d I asked, fearing the worst.</p><p>\u201cNo, just a hairline fracture. She also hit her head pretty hard, but that seems to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes,\u201d I said. Brad freed my hand and I tossed aside the covers. My feet were already on the ground when Margaret stopped me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need. The tests are done. I didn\u2019t feel there was any reason to phone you until we knew something def inite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve called me earlier,\u201d I cried, upset and relieved at the same time. I had a right to know about my own mother and yet...ignorance was bliss.</p><p>Guilt washed over me. I shouldn\u2019t be thinking that. I loved my mother and was grateful Margaret had been there to handle the situation.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor wants to keep Mom overnight for observation. She needs her sleep and frankly,\u201d Margaret said, sounding drained and emotionally depleted, \u201cso do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d I advised. \u201cTell the hospital that if they need to contact anyone during the night, they should call me.\u201d</p><p>Margaret hesitated, then reluctantly agreed. After she\u2019d answered a few more questions, I replaced the receiver. Tears f lowed unrestrained down my face, blurring my vision. I worried about my mother, but I had no idea how to help her. Brad handed me a wad of tissues and I tried to explain what had happened.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s f ine, right?\u201d Brad pressed.</p><p>I nodded. Mom was unaffected by this incident, as far as the physicians could tell, but I wasn\u2019t. It was all too obvious that I was going to lose my mother.</p><p>In many ways I already had. Margaret and I were her caregivers now. We\u2019d assumed the role of adults, and she\u2019d become almost a child\u2014dependent, passive, at the mercy of others. I worried that I\u2019d somehow failed her.</p><p>When I wiped my eyes, I saw Cody and Casey standing in the doorway to our bedroom, watching me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Cody asked.</p><p>Before I could tell them, Casey offered me a tentative smile.</p><p>\u201cI think Lydia needs some ice cream,\u201d she said.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>Barbie\u2019s house rang with laughter when Anne Marie arrived to drop Ellen off. Lillie, Barbie\u2019s mother, answered the door, Hector at her side, and it was easy to see how much in love they were. How happy her friend was. Anne Marie felt only gratitude that Lillie had found love, but in some ways it was painful to watch, reminding her of what she\u2019d lost. Still, she\u2019d seen that falling in love again was possible\u2014for Barbie and Mark, for Lillie and Hector. Maybe it was possible for her, too.</p><p>The big surprise in her own life had been meeting Tim. An even bigger surprise was the attraction she felt toward him. Life was f illed with the unexpected, and some of those events were happy ones.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d Lillie said, stepping aside to gesture them inside. They hugged, and Hector greeted her in his usual dignif ied manner.</p><p>\u201cMaria, my grandniece, is with me,\u201d he told Ellen, \u201cand she\u2019s eager to meet you. I hope you two can be friends.\u201d</p><p>Ellen followed shyly and stood next to Anne Marie. \u201cMy mom has a date with Tim,\u201d she announced. \u201cIt\u2019s just the two of them, so he can kiss her in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie blushed, but before she could comment, Barbie bustled into the room.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. You\u2019re here.\u201d She wore an apron that suggested someone kiss the cook. Mark rolled out with her. He wasn\u2019t the type of man who openly showed affection, but Ellen had won him over from the moment they met and she moved instantly to his side to hug him.</p><p>\u201cNext time bring your date to the party,\u201d Mark said as soon as he\u2019d released Ellen.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Anne Marie promised. She crouched down so she was eye-to-eye with Ellen. \u201cBarbie has my cell number. If you need me for anything you can call, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up around ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ellen wrapped her thin arms around Anne Marie\u2019s neck and squeezed tight. Then she raised her head and whispered,</p><p>\u201cKiss Tim for me.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled. \u201cI will,\u201d she whispered back. Lillie walked Anne Marie out to her car. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you dating again,\u201d she said. \u201cMy life changed when I met Hector. I look forward to each day, each minute, I have with him.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wondered if Tim would be her Hector.... Because, just like Lillie, just like Barbie, she was ready to experience love again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t recommend being in love highly enough,\u201d Lillie said with a laugh. Hector stood in the doorway, waiting for her, and she stepped back as Anne Marie climbed into her car and started the engine. Pulling out of the driveway, she saw Hector join Lillie, sliding his arm around her waist and drawing her close. Oh, yes, Anne Marie was ready for love. Ready to share her love for Ellen with someone who cared for the child as much as she did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That thought stayed with her as she drove home and parked behind the bookstore.</p><p>One of the many things Anne Marie liked about Tim Carlsen was the fact that he didn\u2019t ignore social niceties and details. Although Monte\u2019s, the Italian restaurant he\u2019d chosen, was within walking distance, he insisted on picking her up, despite her offer to meet him there.</p><p>When she opened the apartment door to let Tim in, Baxter yelped excitedly. Tim stooped down and paid him due attention, and when he straightened, his eyes widened with appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYou look...wow,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d While Tim played with Baxter, Anne Marie went into her bedroom to get her purse. As she did, she noticed that her hand was trembling.</p><p>Although she\u2019d tried to minimize this dinner date with her friends, she felt nervous. She could hardly remember the last time she\u2019d been on an actual date. Before she\u2019d married Robert, so that was... She decided not to do the math.</p><p>She\u2019d dressed carefully in a white eyelet summer dress with a silky pink shawl and pink pumps.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Tim asked when Anne Marie met him in the living room.</p><p>She nodded. Because she felt f lustered, she found herself chattering as they strolled to the restaurant. The evening was perfect, still sunny, with a light breeze scenting the air.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking at houses,\u201d she said. \u201cEllen doesn\u2019t want to move, but the apartment\u2019s too small.\u201d She went on to tell him that she was considering houses in the same neighborhood as Hallie\u2019s, thinking that if Ellen had a friend close by, the move would be less traumatic.</p><p>By the time they reached the restaurant, Anne Marie realized she hadn\u2019t let Tim say a word. This behavior was so uncharacteristic for her, she felt she should explain.</p><p>\u201cI generally don\u2019t talk this much,\u201d she said, embarrassed. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>Tim reassured her with a grin. \u201cSo am I,\u201d he admitted. It was such a comforting thing to say that Anne Marie was instantly at ease. The hostess seated them at a nice table near the window. When the waiter came to take their drink order, Tim said he\u2019d stick to water but told Anne Marie she should have a glass of wine. She ordered the house red.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you if other people drink?\u201d she asked, feeling awkward.</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. Other people can handle it. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Still, she felt guilty drinking in his presence. \u201cI don\u2019t mind doing without wine,\u201d she said.</p><p>He held up his hand. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. Sobriety is up to me and me alone.\u201d</p><p>His attitude impressed her, and she sipped her wine, almost able to enjoy it.</p><p>When the waiter returned, they placed their dinner orders. Tim asked for the eggplant parmigiano and Anne Marie the clam spaghetti. The waiter left and Anne Marie smoothed her napkin repeatedly in her nervousness, waiting for Tim to speak. So far, she\u2019d dominated the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping now that we\u2019ve had a chance to get to know each other, you\u2019ll be comfortable with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI already feel that way.\u201d Anne Marie took a piece of bread and tore off a bite. \u201cI can hardly believe how much.\u201d She dipped the bread in the small dish of olive oil in the center of the table, not looking at him as she spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced me that you won\u2019t try to take Ellen away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never do that. The two of you belong together. Dolores got that right. She knew you\u2019d love and care for Ellen better than Candy\u2014or anyone else, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>She f lushed, feeling a surge of joy. The fact that he, of all people, had acknowledged this brought her not only gratitude but peace. \u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>They enjoyed their meal immensely, talking about a wide range of subjects from baseball to politics and everything in between. Over spumoni and coffee, Tim grew quiet again. \u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, Anne Marie, I\u2019d like to tell my parents about Ellen.\u201d</p><p>It would be self ish to withhold a grandparent\u2019s love from her daughter, so Anne Marie agreed. \u201cThat would be f ine.\u201d</p><p>His hand cradled the coffee cup, and he nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me Ellen\u2019s their only granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, and my mother\u2019s been dying to have a girl to spoil. My younger sister has two boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds just like my mother.\u201d</p><p>Tim stared down at his coffee. \u201cWould you also be willing to let Ellen spend time with me alone?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie hadn\u2019t expected this subject to come up quite so soon, yet it was a reasonable request. \u201cAre you asking about visitation?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Still, she hesitated. \u201cHow often were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever you\u2019re willing to give me. I don\u2019t mean to pressure you, Anne Marie. If you\u2019d rather wait, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wanted to plant the thought in my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s a good way of putting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking if you can tell Ellen that you\u2019re her father.\u201d</p><p>This was the great unasked question, the one that underlay all the others.</p><p>\u201cI would like to do that. Even before I got the test results I felt that Ellen was my child.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Anne Marie\u2019s turn to stare into her coffee. Her ice cream had started to melt, and she pushed it aside. Her f irst inclination, self ish though it might be, was to deny him. She glanced up and found him watching her intently, his eyes relaying a message of hope and expectancy.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with Ellen when you tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll begin the visitations slowly. And you can\u2019t tell her until I feel she\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, you\u2019re the one setting the rules.\u201d</p><p>He was so agreeable, and that helped soothe her worries.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if I took her one night next week? My parents\u2019 wedding anniversary is coming up and I\u2019d like Ellen to meet them before the big party.\u201d</p><p>Before she could f ind an excuse to refuse him, Anne Marie nodded. \u201cBut they can\u2019t let her know who they are. What they are to her, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accept that.\u201d His gaze held hers. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>This request probably explained why he\u2019d asked her to dinner on her own, which was more than a little disappointing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we got that settled,\u201d she said briskly.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Tim said, \u201cthere\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I might have misled you in the past few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMisled me? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize. That was never my intention.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie was even more confused. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He inhaled deeply. \u201cI guess the best way to tell you is just to tell you. I\u2019m involved with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie sat unmoving as the shock rippled through her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Vanessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I have to tell you this whole situation has been very difficult for her.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie bit off a sarcastic comment. She needed all the self-control she possessed not to reveal how shocked she was by his announcement.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie struggled to remain calm. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you might\u2019ve said something sooner?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, then closed it. \u201cYes, well...perhaps I should have, but there never seemed to be a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she muttered. Funny how he\u2019d managed to get what he wanted before telling her this. She felt humiliated. Foolish. Naive. All these weeks she\u2019d allowed the romantic daydream to grow, picturing the three of them as the perfect little family. No wonder he\u2019d never kissed her. If she hadn\u2019t been walking around immersed in her stupid fantasies, she might have caught on earlier.</p><p>\u201cI apologize if you think I was leading you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d she said, focusing some distance beyond him, refusing to meet his eyes. She held herself stiff and couldn\u2019t wait to escape. This was what she got for risking her emotions. It wasn\u2019t worth it; deep down she knew she\u2019d never fall in love again.</p><p>\u201cI feel it\u2019s important that we remain friends for Ellen\u2019s sake,\u201d he was saying.</p><p>\u201cWe can certainly be cordial.\u201d What seemed most important at the moment, however, was getting away from Tim. She needed to think, to absorb what he\u2019d told her.</p><p>She made a show of looking at her watch. \u201cDo we have the check yet?\u201d</p><p>In response he raised his hand to catch the waiter\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want to meet Vanessa,\u201d Anne Marie said. No way was she letting her daughter go off with someone she\u2019d never met. She didn\u2019t care if Vanessa was \u201cinvolved\u201d with Tim. That wasn\u2019t any kind of recommendation or guarantee.</p><p>He blinked, his expression wary.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s going to be with you when you have Ellen...\u201d</p><p>Tim relaxed. \u201cI suppose she will. Some of the time, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I need to meet her, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d She did her best to keep the irritation out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. That\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>Another thought entered her mind, one that set off warning bells. \u201cHow did you and...Vanessa happen to meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that really matters,\u201d he said, bristling noticeably.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in AA, too?\u201d Anne Marie guessed.</p><p>Reluctantly Tim nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow much sobriety does she have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith everything that\u2019s been going on with you and me and Ellen, well...she slipped up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute here,\u201d Anne Marie said, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cNot more than an hour ago, you told me you were accountable for your own sobriety. Didn\u2019t I hear you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you now saying that you\u2019re taking responsibility for Vanessa\u2019 s sobriety, too?\u201d she asked. The question appeared to shake him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie held his gaze. \u201cEllen can meet Vanessa, but I have to be there when she does. Otherwise the deal is off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then we understand each other.\u201d</p><p>All at once the room seemed unbearably stuffy. Oppressive. Anne Marie dropped her napkin on the table and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you outside.\u201d</p><p>He stood, too. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the bill. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>She needed breathing room. As the night air cooled her fevered skin, Anne Marie resisted the urge to cover her face with both hands. In all her life she\u2019d never felt more embarrassed. How stupid she\u2019d been. What a romantic fool. And worse, Tim knew. He\u2019d read the longing in her heart, saw it in her eyes. He knew. If she could\u2019ve disappeared, simply vanished, she would gladly have done so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 26</p><p>Phoebe Rylander</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d Hutch said, lingering in the doorway of Phoebe\u2019s condo. He leaned close and kissed her gently. This wasn\u2019t the f irst time they\u2019d kissed that evening. \u201cI really have to leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d she whispered. She hated to see him go. They\u2019d spent a wonderful evening, a memorable evening. They\u2019d been together on Sunday, too, but even a day seemed too long to be apart. When he\u2019d suggested they see each other tonight, she\u2019d readily agreed.</p> <p>It became more and more apparent that Hutch was nothing like Clark. In fact, he was the complete opposite of her former f ianc\u00e9.</p><p>Hutch was thoughtful and caring and funny and different. He made her laugh and had lightened the load of pain she\u2019d carried after her breakup with Clark. And yet she probably wouldn\u2019t have given him a second look if not for the knitting class. That class, which she\u2019d enrolled in on impulse, had opened her eyes in so many ways.</p><p>Phoebe didn\u2019t want to think of herself as demanding or shallow when it came to the men she chose to date. Then again, perhaps she had been. Most of the men in her past had been like Clark\u2014</p><p>highly successful, established in their careers, urbane and handsome. Hutch was rather ordinary-looking but he possessed those other attributes, too. The ambition and the success. Only he was...better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow,\u201d he said, moving slowly into the hall. Meowing, Princess followed him out, apparently as unwilling to let him go as Phoebe was herself. She picked up her cat and held her close.</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said. Leaning against the doorjamb she waited until he was inside the elevator and had disappeared from sight. The time had gone by so quickly, she could hardly believe it was already after ten.</p><p>Hutch had met her at the clinic, after a meeting with his attorney. He\u2019d refused to discuss the case, telling her he was leaving the whole mess to the professionals paid to deal with it. They\u2019d rented a paddle boat on Lake Washington before eating at a hole-in-the-wall f ish-and-chip place he\u2019d gone to as a kid. It\u2019d been a lazy summer\u2019s night, interspersed with laughter and a growing attraction. They\u2019d sat under an umbrella table and made excuses to loiter in the early-evening sun. When Hutch dropped her off after dinner, neither had wanted the evening to end. He\u2019d gladly accepted her invitation for coffee, and they\u2019d sat and talked for nearly an hour. But it was dark now, and they both had to work in the morning. Phoebe knew he got to the off ice by six, except for the days he visited the gym f irst. The phone rang and Phoebe hurried to answer it, expecting to f ind it was Hutch. It would be just like him to call as soon as he was in the car. He often did that to say good-night a f inal time or discuss the next day\u2019s plans...or whisper that he missed her. Instead, Caller ID showed that it was Clark. Phoebe backed away from the phone. She didn\u2019t want to speak to him, didn\u2019t want anything to do with him. Her instinct was to let him leave a message. She did, and waited until her phone went to voice mail.</p><p>Unable to stop herself, she stood close to the phone and listened as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe, it\u2019s Clark.\u201d He sounded depressed. \u201cI know you\u2019re there. I also know you don\u2019t want to talk to me. I wouldn\u2019t contact you if this wasn\u2019t important. Please call me back. You\u2019re at the condo, I know you are.\u201d He hesitated, then added in a broken voice, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Phoebe reached for the phone, but her hand hovered over the receiver. It was a week ago that she\u2019d gone to the hospital to see his father and she wondered if Max had taken a turn for the worse. After all, he\u2019d implied that he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d live much longer.</p><p>Her pulse accelerated. Clark\u2019s father was such an extraordinary man. The family would fall apart without him. She grabbed the phone.</p> <p>Clark answered on the f irst ring. He didn\u2019t greet her; instead he whispered \u201cThank you\u201d in a fervent voice.</p><p>\u201cIs it your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this isn\u2019t something to do with Max, we have nothing to talk about.\u201d She started to disconnect when she heard him cry out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up! There\u2019s no delicate way to say this...but my father\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe gasped. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a high fever. They haven\u2019t been able to control it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Clark.\u201d There was no adequate response to that, no comfort she could offer. A lump formed in her throat.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s caught some sort of infection and that seems to be causing the fever. It\u2019s bad, Phoebe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctors called Mother and me to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you there now?\u201d</p><p>She heard Clark swallow hard. \u201cYes. Where else would I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what she could do other than listen.</p><p>He spoke over her comment. \u201cI was right, wasn\u2019t I? You were home but you didn\u2019t want to speak to me.\u201d</p><p>His question came at her more like an accusation, and she had no intention of answering.</p><p>\u201cHe was there, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Clark continued in the same aggressive tone. \u201cThis new man you\u2019re seeing. You\u2019re only doing it to hurt me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho I\u2019m seeing is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked. \u201cI wonder if you ever really loved me.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe felt dreadful but there was no reason for it. Clark was slinging guilt at her and she needed to step away, stop being his target. She couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, allow this conversation to revolve around him when his father might well be dying.</p><p>\u201cIs he a good lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phoebe took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cThis con versation is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d he begged. \u201cListen, just listen...\u201d</p><p>Phoebe didn\u2019t want to hear any more. She considered hanging up, but Clark interrupted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t have the right to ask you questions like that.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe desperately wanted to cut off this call; at the same time, she wanted to learn what she could about Max\u2019s condition. Before she could decide, Clark said, \u201cYou can call me any name you like, Phoebe, and I\u2019d probably deserve it, but one thing you have to admit is that I love my dad.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe knew that was true. Clark was close to both his parents\u2014although his behavior certainly didn\u2019t resemble that of his father.</p><p>\u201cWill you come sit with Mom and me?\u201d he asked, his tone pleading. \u201cThe doctors said it would be a miracle if Dad lasts the night.\u201d</p><p>When she hesitated, Clark said, \u201cCan\u2019t we put aside our differences for Dad\u2019s sake? Just for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Marlene are alone? What about the rest of the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crisis appeared to be over. Everyone\u2019s gone\u2014and now this. It\u2019s killing Mom and me.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe looked up at the ceiling, still unsure. Then, against her better judgment, she whispered, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>His appreciation was almost palpable. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough, Phoebe. This will mean the world to Mom.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe rather doubted that.</p><p>With her purse and car keys in hand, she\u2019d reached the door, then came to an abrupt halt. It seemed to her that with all the connections the Snowdens had, Marlene and Clark shouldn\u2019t be alone. Why would he contact her when he had friends and relatives all over the city?</p><p>None of what he\u2019d said really made sense. She hated to be so distrustful, but time had taught her some valuable lessons about Clark Snowden. He\u2019d stop at nothing to get his own way. Now that he knew about Hutch, he\u2019d be more intent than ever on winning her back. Then again, it wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d kidnap her. Despite her doubts, even Clark wouldn\u2019t go so far as to make up a story about his father\u2019s imminent death.</p><p>But just in case...</p><p>Phoebe decided not to take any chances. Turning back, she went to the phone and hit Speed Dial to call her mother. Three rings later, Leanne answered sleepily. \u201cPhoebe? Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClark\u2019s father apparently isn\u2019t doing well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Her mother was instantly alert.</p><p>\u201cClark said he\u2019s contracted an infection. According to him, Max is fighting for his life. They aren\u2019t sure he\u2019ll last the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d her mother asked urgently. \u201cShould I put his name on the church prayer chain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful, Mom,\u201d Phoebe said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it f irst thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Phoebe felt guilty about using her mother like this, but she knew how eager Leanne was to ingratiate herself with the Snowdens. \u201cListen, Mom, Clark\u2019s holding vigil with his mother at the hospital. I gather they\u2019re alone. Why don\u2019t you go there with me? Marlene could use a friend at a time like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Phoebe. I\u2019m so glad you asked. We can\u2019t leave Marlene and Clark by themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d If Max was dying, Phoebe doubted she had the words to comfort Clark\u2019s mother; the relationship between them was already strained. Leanne would be a real help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the house in f ifteen minutes,\u201d Leanne said. \u201cI\u2019ll just throw on some clothes and run a brush through my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up,\u201d Phoebe told her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d her mother protested. Oh, but she did. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you driving in Seattle on your own this late, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Leanne said as if she hadn\u2019t thought of that. \u201cGood idea. I\u2019ll be ready when you get here.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe waited a few minutes, then got her car from the condo parking garage and drove to her mother\u2019s home on Capitol Hill. During that brief time, Clark called not once, but twice.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get this number?\u201d she demanded. She could only assume that her mother had given it to him, in one of her misguided attempts to inf luence Phoebe\u2019s decision. He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI\u2019d only use it in an emergency, which this is.\u201d</p><p>He was right about that, but his access to her cell number bothered her.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were on your way,\u201d he complained. \u201cYou\u2019re still coming, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a few minutes,\u201d she promised. \u201cHas Max\u2019s condition changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing\u2019s changed. Hurry, please.\u201d</p><p>Pulling into the familiar neighborhood of her youth, Phoebe saw that her mother\u2019s porch light was on. As she stopped in the driveway, Leanne hurried out the front door and slid into the passenger side, fastening her seat belt.</p><p>\u201cPoor Marlene, she must be beside herself.\u201d Leanne clasped her hands tightly together. \u201cHave you heard anything new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Clark\u2019s frantic call asking her to rush would only upset her mother, so Phoebe didn\u2019t mention it. Besides, he\u2019d said Max\u2019s condition hadn\u2019t changed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time they\u2019d parked and reached the hospital\u2019s main entrance, Phoebe saw Clark pacing just inside. He seemed agitated and nervous, which was understandable. This had to be a tense night for him and his mother.</p><p>His face brightened the moment he saw her. But a frown formed as soon as he realized Leanne had accompanied her. The glass doors slid open and Leanne ran toward Clark, hugging him hard. \u201cClark, this is such terrible news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeanne,\u201d he said, hugging her back. Over her mother\u2019s shoulders, his eyes searched out Phoebe.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Marlene?\u201d Leanne asked. \u201cShe must be frantic.\u201d</p> <p>Clark dropped his arms and led the way into the hospital foyer.</p><p>\u201cShe...she left.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe stared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if your father\u2019s going to survive the night and your mother went home? \u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...Dad seems to be doing better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d Phoebe asked, her suspicions building.</p> <p>\u201cA while ago,\u201d Clark said, meeting her gaze head-on.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrif ic,\u201d Leanne murmured, glancing from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cWas Max ever desperately ill?\u201d Phoebe asked, refusing to break eye contact with Clark. She wanted him to know he hadn\u2019t fooled her. When he\u2019d f irst phoned, she\u2019d hated being so mistrustful of his intentions; now it seemed she\u2019d been right. Clark was willing to use anything to win her back, even an out-andout lie. She shouldn\u2019t be surprised and yet she was. At the same time she was sickened that he\u2019d sink to this level\u2014that he\u2019d exploit his father\u2019s condition in this way.</p><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019m here,\u201d she said, \u201cI might as well check at the nurses\u2019 station to see for myself how Max is doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very busy,\u201d Clark immediately countered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in ICU, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>Clark exhaled. \u201cActually, he was moved earlier....\u201d He let the rest fade. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we all have a cup of coffee and I\u2019ll update you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your father made a miraculous recovery in the last thirty minutes.\u201d She didn\u2019t keep the sarcasm out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing well enough for Mom to go home, but you have to understand he\u2019s still at serious risk.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe didn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cI could do with a cup of coffee,\u201d Leanne said. \u201cDecaf, of course. Anything with caffeine would keep me awake for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two go ahead,\u201d Phoebe told them. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in a few minutes. I\u2019m going to use the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>Clark stared after her as she hurried down the hall to the public restrooms. Once inside, she pulled out her cell phone, called directory assistance and had them connect her with the hospital\u2019s receptionist.</p><p>\u201cCould you please tell me what room Max Snowden\u2019s in?\u201d she began and silently asked God to forgive the lie. \u201cI\u2019d like to order f lowers online and apparently they need a room number.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a moment, please.\u201d</p><p>Before long the woman was back. \u201cOur records show that Mr. Snowden was released from the hospital two days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Phoebe said through gritted teeth. \u201cThank you for your trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>It would be Phoebe\u2019s pleasure to tell Clark what she thought of him. When she stepped out of the restroom, Clark and Leanne stood in the hallway waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cTime to go, Mother,\u201d she said f irmly.</p><p>Leanne cast her a confused glance. \u201cBut...what about coffee with Clark?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe marched past him. \u201cWe aren\u2019t having coffee with Clark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoebe,\u201d her mother said, struggling to keep pace with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you? You\u2019re being rude. Clark\u2019s father is very ill. Like you, I\u2019m disappointed that Marlene isn\u2019t here, but Clark told me she\u2019s been with Max for days and is emotionally and physically exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe stopped and turned to face her mother and Clark. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then she wasn\u2019t at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course she was,\u201d Leanne protested. \u201cThe entire family was gathered here.... Clark was just telling me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very interesting, Mom, since Max was released two days ago.\u201d She looked directly at Clark. \u201cDid you think I couldn\u2019t call the hospital switchboard?\u201d</p><p>He glared back at her and refused to answer.</p><p>\u201cIf anything like this ever happens again,\u201d she said slowly and distinctly, \u201cI\u2019m calling the police.\u201d She wanted to be sure he understood this wasn\u2019t an idle threat. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Clark. One more incident like this and I\u2019ll report you as a stalker.\u201d</p><p>Her mother whirled around and confronted Clark, an expression of shock and disbelief on her face. \u201cIs that true?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cClark Snowden is the last person you should be asking about the truth,\u201d Phoebe said in a withering voice as she turned and headed out the door, toward the parking garage. Her mother scurried after her, half trotting in an effort to keep up. Angry as she was, Phoebe couldn\u2019t get away from Clark fast enough. If she\u2019d ever had any doubts or second thoughts, this had sealed it. Thank goodness she\u2019d followed her instincts and brought her mother along.</p><p>Leanne didn\u2019t say anything for several minutes. \u201cI think you might be right about Clark,\u201d she f inally said, breathless by the time they entered the parking garage. \u201cThat man isn\u2019t to be trusted.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>With my work as a designer, I feel like I am leaving a legacy to pass on to future generations. I can\u2019t imagine either of my children growing up without a relationship with knitting. I cannot wait until my kids are old enough to learn to knit, and we can sit and knit together. What other line of work allows you to create like this, alongside your family?</p><p>\u2014Chrissy Gardiner, knit designer and teacher, www.gardineryarnworks.com</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help worrying about Casey. Ever since she\u2019d received that phone call from Lee she\u2019d been withdrawn and, frankly, difficult. Some days were definitely better than others, but this morning was apparently destined to be a bad one. When I called Casey for breakfast, I heard her slamming things around her bedroom and when she finally deigned to show up, she didn\u2019t so much as offer a greeting or even an acknowledgement. Now, sitting at the kitchen table, she slouched over her cereal bowl almost as if she was afraid someone would jerk it away. I tried talking to her and her responses, such as they were, came in the form of grunts and growls. My efforts were mostly ignored.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come to the yarn store with me?\u201d I asked. Her classes were over, so her other option was day camp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in early, even though I have class tonight.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I bothered to explain.</p><p>Her answer was a noncommittal shrug.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes or a no?\u201d I asked, my patience growing thin. She glared up at me. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but I was willing to assume she wanted to go to work with me. \u201cThere\u2019s a new shipment of yarn that needs to be priced.\u201d One thing I could count on was Casey\u2019s interest in collecting a paycheck. Other than those mishaps early on, she\u2019d done a fairly good job at every task I\u2019d given her.</p><p>\u201cWill Margaret be there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>It was the f irst real sentence Casey had uttered all morning.</p><p>\u201cYes. And Brad will stop by after work to take you home.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again, which appeared to be her universal response this morning.</p><p>It took me a moment to realize why she\u2019d asked about Margaret.</p><p>\u201cYou can bring your crocheting if you want,\u201d I said, wanting her to know I\u2019d paid attention.</p><p>She lifted one shoulder halfheartedly.</p><p>As far as breakfast-table conversation went, that was it. Unaware of the tension between Casey and me, Cody chattered away at astounding speed. I could hardly keep up with the rapid switching of subjects, but fortunately all he required was an occasional</p><p>\u201cWow\u201d or \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>The three of us left the house and I dropped Cody off at the day camp. There was a f ield trip for his age group today\u2014to the aquarium\u2014and that was his very favorite activity. Casey remained silent as I continued on to the store. I worked hard at remembering what Alix had told me about the years she herself had spent in foster care. She\u2019d had varied experiences, some good, some bad. She\u2019d said that Casey was probably afraid to let anyone know what she enjoyed, as though she wasn\u2019t allowed to have any fun. At this point it was diff icult to say that Casey took much pleasure in anything\u2014with the one exception of our day at Green Lake.</p><p>When I pulled up at the church, Cody leaped out of the car and ran toward his friends without a backward glance. He used to kiss my cheek, but that had changed this summer. He no longer considered it \u201ccool\u201d to show me affection in front of his friends. I missed his goodbye hugs, but I understood. Cody was growing up.</p><p>I must have smiled because Casey gave me an odd look.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCody,\u201d I said, and explained why.</p><p>For just an instant I thought Casey might\u2019ve been amused. I\u2019d been waiting for her to lower her guard. For the past two days I\u2019d been tiptoeing around the issue of her discontent and now I decided to confront it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d I asked as gently as I could.</p><p>She turned to me as if to gauge the sincerity of my question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d thought\u2014hoped, really\u2014that you\u2019ve enjoyed your time with our family.\u201d</p><p>The shrug was back, and Casey kept her gaze directly ahead of her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d I echoed in mock outrage.</p><p>Casey actually grinned. \u201cIf you must know, staying with you has been better than most summers.\u201d</p><p>Admitting that was quite a concession on her part. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d I said.</p><p>Casey\u2019s mood seemed to improve once we got to the yarn store. I wanted to tell her that being there had the same effect on me. I could be angry or depressed or just plain tired. Yet the moment I entered my store, whatever was pressing on my heart instantly lifted.</p><p>The only other place I felt that same serenity was inside a church. But a yarn store? For reasons I can\u2019t even begin to explain, my shop on Blossom Street produced in me a contentment I\u2019d rarely found since that f irst diagnosis of cancer back when I was a teenager. As soon as I got there, so did three customers. It almost seemed as if they\u2019d been waiting for me to turn over the Open sign, because a moment later, all three women walked in. Margaret served the f irst woman and was busy with the other two when another customer came in with a knitting problem. I immediately saw what she\u2019d done wrong and we sat together at the back table while I explained her mistake, which was relatively easy to f ix. Using a crochet hook, I had to go down about f ifteen rows. I\u2019m always surprised by the number of knitters who can\u2019t bear to see someone unravel their work. This woman closed her eyes while I dropped the stitch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After Casey had priced the new yarn and arranged it in the correct cubicles, she sat with Whiskers on her lap and stroked the cat for an hour straight. I was astonished that she could sit still for that long. Whiskers spent hours every day asleep in the front window, so this much attention was unusual. He purred with contentment; Casey\u2019s lap had obviously become one of his favorite places.</p><p>I grabbed lunch when I could between customers, bringing back a take-out container of salad for Casey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going for a walk,\u201d Casey announced around two and headed out the door. She\u2019d timed her declaration perfectly, waiting until I was busy f iguring out yardage for a sweater project for Mary Kilborn, an experienced knitter. Because I was poring over a computer program that listed the brand name and skein yardage for every company, I barely had a chance to react to her statement.</p><p>\u201cBrad will be here at\u2014\u201d I didn\u2019t get to f inish as Casey was already gone and well out of earshot.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said. Brad wouldn\u2019t appear for another two hours and Casey would surely be back by then. As was so often the case with her, I was wrong. Brad showed up before Casey did.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think she might be?\u201d he asked, his brow furrowed with concern.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. I never expected her to be gone this long.\u201d</p><p>I started to rub my palms together, a nervous habit I\u2019d developed over the summer\u2014or more accurately, since Casey\u2019s arrival. I could tell that Brad\u2019s day hadn\u2019t gone well, because it wasn\u2019t like him to be short-tempered. \u201cWell, where did she say she was going?\u201d he asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. She didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Brad frowned, even harder this time. \u201cDo you suppose she\u2019s run away again?\u201d</p><p>The thought hadn\u2019t even occurred to me. \u201cNo, why would she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does she do anything?\u201d he asked, throwing his hands in the air. \u201cThat kid\u2019s impossible to understand.\u201d He grinned, then added, \u201cYou\u2019d think she was a teenager or something.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cor something\u201d was right. Casey wouldn\u2019t actually be a teenager until the following year, but she showed all the signs of being one now\u2014especially the moodiness.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be back,\u201d Margaret assured us. She f inished counting out change for a customer who\u2019d come in to purchase an extra skein when she\u2019d run out of yarn on a project.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d Brad asked when the woman had gone.</p> <p>\u201cTwo things.\u201d Margaret walked around the counter. \u201cFirst, Casey didn\u2019t collect her pay for this morning and secondly\u2014\u201d</p><p>Margaret pointed at the crocheting Casey had left on the lesson table \u201c\u2014she didn\u2019t take her work with her.\u201d</p><p>I nodded; my sister was right. \u201cYou might as well relax until she turns up,\u201d I advised my husband.</p><p>Brad muttered a comment under his breath, then accepted the inevitability of waiting. Sighing heavily, he sat down at the table. Five minutes later, Casey strolled in as though she\u2019d hardly been away at all.</p><p>Instantly Brad was on his feet. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Casey blurted, glaring at him def iantly. In an effort to avoid an argument, I rested my hand on Brad\u2019s. \u201cEverything\u2019s f ine now. She\u2019s back and she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Casey pretended not to hear me as she walked over to the table and grabbed her crocheting, stuff ing it inside the quilted bag I\u2019d lent her. Then she straightened. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d she asked as if Brad had kept her waiting.</p><p>Brad glanced at me, eyebrows raised. I shook my head as the two of them left, giving each other the silent treatment. Margaret watched them walk away and turned to me. \u201cI bet you\u2019ll be glad when she\u2019s out of the house.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019d feel. What surprised me, though, was the sense of loss that came over me at that statement.</p><p>Despite the diff iculties we\u2019d had with Casey, I\u2019d become genuinely fond of the girl. I would miss her, and so would Brad and Cody.</p><p>In fact, Casey\u2019s stay with us had been good for our son. He\u2019d learned the concept of sharing. Cody was the sole focus of our love and attention. Of course we hoped to add another child to our family, but as it was now, our lives revolved around his. He\u2019d been a friend to Casey, and in the process had learned communication skills. Despite the moodiness she sometimes displayed, she seemed to like him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss her.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d spoken out loud until my sister made a huff ing sound. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>I asked, challenging Margaret to state her opinion. She sent me that familiar disapproving look and simply shook her head.</p><p>That evening Alix was the f irst to arrive for class. As she walked into the store, I could smell cigarette smoke on her. As if she could guess what I was thinking, she announced to both Margaret and me, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m smoking again. I went four days without a cigarette but I\u2019m back to three a day, so don\u2019t give me any grief.\u201d</p><p>Obviously Alix and Casey were both in unsociable moods that day. \u201cThree is better than ten or twenty or whatever you started out with.\u201d I wanted her to be aware that I wouldn\u2019t judge her.</p><p>\u201cThere is medical help, you know,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cAnd if you weren\u2019t so stubborn you\u2019d get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Alix brief ly shut her eyes. \u201cI can do this. If I\u2019m a little short-tempered it\u2019s because I just smoked my last cigarette for the day and I\u2019m already craving another.\u201d</p><p>It was more than needing a cigarette. Alix was so rarely that I knew something else was troubling her. And my guess was that it had to do with Jordan. He wasn\u2019t with her, although he usually walked her to class and then either went over to the church or met with a men\u2019s group while Alix knitted.</p><p>\u201cJordan isn\u2019t with you tonight?\u201d I ventured.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>I held up both hands as if to say sorry I asked\u2014and I was. Margaret, however, had never steered clear of a fight. \u201cWhat is it with everyone today?\u201d she said, arms akimbo. \u201cFirst Casey and now you.\u201d</p><p>Alix\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be cranky. Jordan and I had a small argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I could sympathize. Whenever Brad and I were irritated with each other, I felt dreadful. I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t much fun at times like that, either.</p><p>\u201cIt happens,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cGet over it.\u201d</p><p>To my astonishment, Alix grinned. \u201cYeah, I guess I should. It\u2019s my own fault. We were supposed to meet at the caf\u00e9 at f ive and I was late. He didn\u2019t feel he should hold on to a table, so he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you did arrive, there wasn\u2019t one available,\u201d</p><p>Margaret f inished for her.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She exhaled slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset him and I\u2019m usually on time, but there were extenuating circumstances.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never known Alix to be intentionally late. In fact, she was generally the f irst to show up, as she had tonight. She needed structure, and since I knew what her life had been like as a child, I understood why.</p><p>\u201cCasey wanted to talk. It wasn\u2019t like I could put her off, and then I had to rush to f inish up the menu plans for my boss. Winter\u2019s going on vacation and asked me to take over for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasey?\u201d Alix had spent time with Casey? That afternoon?</p><p>Suddenly it all made sense. I should\u2019ve realized Casey would seek out Alix, but until that moment it hadn\u2019t occurred to me. Alix nodded and looked from Margaret to me. \u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t know she was with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Margaret said f latly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a clue where she was, and she was gone for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she could talk to you,\u201d I said, although it was diff icult not to feel a twinge of jealousy. I so badly wanted Casey to feel safe enough, comfortable enough, to turn to me. Instead she\u2019d gone to Alix. Her reasons were completely logical\u2014</p><p>and, of course, I\u2019d done the same thing. I\u2019d gone to Alix, too, asking questions about her experience as a ward of the state so I could understand Casey\u2019s.</p><p>Alix seemed a bit confused. \u201cShe said you were the one who sent her to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d mentioned it, only that had been weeks ago. Naturally I was curious as to what Casey had said, especially since they\u2019d talked for such a long time, but I didn\u2019t ask. I hoped Alix would volunteer the information; when she didn\u2019t, I left it at that.</p><p>\u201cIs everything settled between you and Jordan?\u201d I asked instead.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Alix said, looking dejected. \u201cHe was pretty upset with me. He said I should\u2019ve called his cell, and he was right. Hopefully we\u2019ll grab some dinner after class.\u201d Then a smile twitched at the edges of her mouth, and the tension eased from her face. \u201cI\u2019ll f ind a way to make it up to him later.\u201d</p><p>Margaret hooted with laughter. \u201cI just bet you will,\u201d she said, winking at Alix.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Phoebe Rylander</p><p>Phoebe wasn\u2019t a baseball fan. However, when Hutch invited her to attend Stitch and Pitch night at the Mariners\u2019 game, she was eager to accept. Everyone in the class had gotten tickets and it would be an enjoyable Thursday evening, quite different from her usual activities.</p><p>Hutch picked her up at work and had dressed in a Mariners\u2019</p><p>jersey, complete with baseball cap. She had to admit he looked athletic and rather charming in a boyish manner. She knew he\u2019d started working out at a gym three mornings a week and it showed. In fact, she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes off him. Judging by the way he kept stealing glances at her, the feeling was mutual. Ever since Monday night when Clark had tried to deceive her, Phoebe had a renewed appreciation of Hutch. He was honest and forthright, whereas anything Clark said simply couldn\u2019t be trusted. With him, the truth was all too f lexible. The crowds streamed into the stadium. As she and Hutch reached their seats, he left her to stand in a long line to purchase the ever-popular hot dogs.</p><p>Phoebe watched the pitcher warm up, and the excitement in the crowd was contagious. She saw Lydia, Brad, Casey and Cody f iling into the row in front of her and Hutch, half a dozen seats to the right. Both kids had catcher\u2019s mitts, obviously hoping for foul balls. Lydia had her knitting; Phoebe had brought hers, too.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she called out.</p><p>Grinning, Lydia turned around. \u201cHi! I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve seen Margaret, have you?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe nodded. \u201cShe was in line at the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. She made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise Beaumont was there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Margaret managed to talk her into coming,\u201d Lydia said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Anne Marie.\u201d Phoebe impulsively stood up to wave. Ellen was with her, as well as another couple she didn\u2019t recognize. Anne Marie waved back from several rows below. Sitting down again, Phoebe leaned forward to ask Lydia,</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that couple with Anne Marie and Ellen?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lydia shaded her eyes, peering down at them, then shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d After a moment she twisted around to speak to Phoebe again. \u201cAnne Marie\u2019s been dating this guy named Tim, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, mainly because he\u2019s holding hands with the other woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>She craned her neck to get a better view. \u201cThe thing is, it sort of looks like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, when I dropped into the bookstore to pick something up and he was there.\u201d</p><p>Hutch returned, holding a cardboard container laden with two huge hot dogs slathered with condiments, including sauerkraut and mustard, plus two giant-size sodas and a bag of hot, roasted peanuts.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry,\u201d he warned, sitting down beside her.</p> <p>\u201cStarved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you bring me any chocolate, Mr. Mount Rainier?\u201d</p><p>Margaret asked, scooting past several other people in order to sit next to her sister. Elise trailed behind her, knitting in hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize! I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe nudged him in the ribs. Ever since the knitting group had heard that he was the head of Mount Rainier Chocolates, Hutch had gotten into the habit of bringing chocolate to class. The Mount Saint Helens bar had launched nationally and, according to Hutch, had been well received. The sales reports were just coming back and he was thrilled with its success so far.</p> <p>\u201cLook!\u201d Cody shouted, leaping to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019re on the big screen!\u201d</p><p>Phoebe swiveled her head to the huge screen, and sure enough, the entire knitting section was on display. Cody, waving both arms, stood out prominently.</p><p>Phoebe laughed, and then everyone in the group held up their knitting. Unprepared, Hitch and Phoebe scrambled to f launt their sampler scarves. She nearly dumped her hot dog on Margaret\u2019s head in the process, but saved it from catapulting forward in the nick of time.</p><p>Knitters sat on every side of them and the mood was jovial as they showed one another their current efforts. Several yarn stores had set up booths by the concession stands and Phoebe couldn\u2019t resist looking\u2014and buying.</p><p>Until now, she\u2019d resisted purchasing yarn for anything beyond her current project. She\u2019d discovered that she enjoyed knitting; the problem was, she didn\u2019t have enough free time now that she was seeing Hutch almost every day. She\u2019d taken to knitting during her lunch break, which was the only reason she\u2019d been able to keep up with the class.</p><p>Next Wednesday, the f irst Wednesday of August, would be their last class. She\u2019d be f inished with her scarf, and she wanted to start something new. She chose sock yarn in the Mariners\u2019 colors, thinking she\u2019d take another class\u2014this one on sockknitting taught by Elise\u2014and give the finished product to Hutch.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you buy?\u201d Hutch asked when she rejoined him. She opened the bag and proudly revealed her booty. \u201cI\u2019m going to learn to knit socks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrif ic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you like the colors?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d He smiled down at her\u2014and kept smiling. For that matter so did Phoebe. Although they were surrounded by thousands of cheering fans, they were gazing only at each other.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d knit them for you,\u201d she whispered. He didn\u2019t say anything, but reached for her hand and entwined their f ingers, his grip hard. She squeezed back, wanting him to know she shared the intensity of his feelings.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, guys,\u201d Alix said, hurrying past.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Hutch said, standing up so Alix and Jordan could get by.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they off to in such a hurry?\u201d Phoebe asked no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d Margaret answered, her f ingers moving the crochet hook with speed and dexterity. She seemed to be working on an afghan. Casey was crocheting, too, and Lydia was knitting. What most impressed Phoebe was that Lydia could knit without even looking at the needles. Phoebe, on the other hand, watched every single stitch for fear of making a mistake. The thought of having to rip out a row traumatized her, although she\u2019d been forced to do so often enough.</p><p>A few minutes later, Alix was back, this time without Jordan.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled as she stepped over Phoebe\u2019s feet. \u201cAll of a sudden I had to get to a restroom.\u201d She slipped past the couple sitting next to them.</p><p>Jordan followed soon after, apologizing as he did. He carried one hot dog and a soda, and when he sat down beside Alix, Phoebe noticed that the two of them were sharing the meal. Living on a youth pastor\u2019s salary probably made it diff icult to splurge on dinner out two nights in a single week. Phoebe knew from class yesterday that they\u2019d squabbled, although she didn\u2019t know about what. Apparently that had happened before she\u2019d arrived. At the end of class, Jordan had stopped by to pick up Alix as usual. He\u2019d stood by the door, looking depressed, not at all his normal outgoing self. As soon as Alix saw her husband, she\u2019d set her knitting down and rushed to his side. For a long moment, all they did was stare at each other\u2014and then Jordan had reached out and grabbed Alix with both arms, hugging her close.</p><p>Later that evening, just as she and Hutch had gone off in different directions, Phoebe caught sight of Alix and Jordan in a burger place, their heads together, eating and talking animatedly. Obviously whatever strain had existed between them yesterday afternoon had passed.</p><p>Tonight\u2019s game ended with the Mariners winning at the bottom of the ninth. The crowd was jubilant as they poured out of Safeco Field. Walking hand in hand, Phoebe and Hutch made their way to the parking lot, where Hutch had left his vehicle. For the f irst time that evening, he seemed somewhat withdrawn. She didn\u2019t need to ask what was troubling him\u2014the lawsuit against Mount Rainier Chocolates. He\u2019d occasionally mentioned it, never disclosing very much. She\u2019d also seen an article about the lawsuit in the paper, but it hadn\u2019t provided any more information than she already had.</p><p>\u201cHow about a cup of coffee at my place?\u201d she suggested. He smiled at her and nodded, making a visible effort to resume his cheerful attitude.</p><p>She swallowed painfully. She was going to confess that she\u2019d misled him\u2014and everyone in the knitting class\u2014about her f ianc\u00e9. She should never have let the pretence go on for this long. But when she was with Hutch there were so many other things to talk about. Still, he\u2019d recently commented on the fact that she didn\u2019t have any pictures of her f ianc\u00e9 around the condo. For a moment his remark had jarred her, until she remembered that he thought Clark was dead.</p><p>She trusted that he\u2019d forgive her this foolish deception, which had taken on a life, a momentum, of its own. She also hoped that after tonight\u2019s confession, he\u2019d feel free to share his worries over this lawsuit. In her opinion, the entire matter was frivolous, a waste of time. But whenever she\u2019d asked him about it, Hutch had brushed aside her questions and said his attorney was handling it. He always added that he wasn\u2019t really worried. Only he was. That seemed very clear tonight.</p><p>Once they were at her condo, she put away her yarn purchase, ground fresh beans and made a small pot of coffee, just enough for two cups.</p><p>She joined Hutch in the living room and handed him his mug.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you,\u201d she began softly. Hutch stiffened, almost as if he knew what was coming\u2014</p><p>although he couldn\u2019t possibly. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it serious?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been lying to you.\u201d</p><p>Hutch carefully set his mug on the low table beside him. \u201cI\u2019d rather deal with the truth now than later.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of her coffee, then glanced down. \u201cWhen I signed up for the knitting class, I told everyone I was engaged and that my f ianc\u00e9 died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s not dead?\u201d Hutch frowned and anxiety f lared in his eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>Despite her nervousness, she smiled. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not dead and I\u2019m not married. It\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders slumped with relief.</p><p>\u201cI was engaged and in love with a man who...\u201d She paused, f inding it diff icult to continue. \u201cI broke off the engagement two months ago, when I discovered he\u2019d been arrested for solicitation.\u201d</p><p>Hutch pressed his hand over hers. He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cIt happened before this, too. I took him back the f irst time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe f irst time you knew about,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cExactly. I have to suspect there were other instances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Phoebe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe managed to convince me it would never happen again, and I believed him.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention the pressure she was under from both Clark\u2019s family and her own to forgive and forget.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, which felt dry and cracked. \u201cI did what I had to do, ended the engagement, and although it was painful I don\u2019t regret it, not for a second.\u201d Telling Hutch about Clark\u2019s most recent attempt to get her to take him back would only upset him. Phoebe decided to say nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo when you enrolled in the Knit to Quit class, it was because you were trying to stop loving your f ianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>Lowering her head, Phoebe nodded.</p><p>\u201cHas it helped?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and grinned. \u201cMore than you\u2019ll ever know. I was crushed, devastated, humiliated, angry. I realize now that while I did love Clark, his actions killed all the feelings I had for him.\u201d</p><p>Hutch brought her close and touched his forehead to hers.</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t lie to you any longer.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose, lightly, tenderly, in a way she\u2019d come to adore. His gentleness stirred her more than a dozen passionate caresses. Slipping her arms around his neck, she raised her mouth to his and they kissed for a long time, each kiss connecting them on a deeper level. She leaned against his shoulder, her head spinning with desire. Hutch\u2019s breathing was ragged. They sat like that, satiated and at peace, for a while.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the lawsuit,\u201d she f inally said. Hutch exhaled. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. My attorney\u2019s agreed to f ight it but he\u2019d prefer that I settled out of court. I refuse to do that. It would be like an admission of guilt. However, my attorney feels I\u2019m taking a terrible risk letting this case go to trial.\u201d Hutch was silent for a moment. \u201cThe suit\u2019s raised a lot of interest nationwide. If I lose, it opens the door for other people to sue the larger companies, claiming chocolate is addictive. And what about alcoholics suing wineries? Or prescription-drug abusers blaming the pharmaceuticals? You see what I mean. There\u2019s a lot more at stake than meets the eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it worth all this angst?\u201d she asked, siding with his attorney. In this particular instance it might be best to simply pay off this idiotic woman and be done with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted with some reluctance. \u201cI turned down their f irst settlement offer. I can\u2019t see handing over such a large chunk of cash just to make this go away. When my attorney suggested we might be willing to settle, the plaintiff came back with an even higher demand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreed does nasty things to a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Besides, who\u2019s to say I won\u2019t be sued again next week, next month, next year? It\u2019s dangerous either way. I\u2019d rather confront this head-on and have it dealt with once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe sighed. \u201cI wish there was something I could do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked eagerly.</p><p>He folded her in his embrace. \u201cLet me hold you for a few more minutes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in my arms I can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d</p><p>Hutch might not be as eloquent as Clark had been, but his words were sincere. His emotions were real.</p><p>Chapter 29</p> <p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>This was going to be diff icult; Anne Marie could see it already. As Tim had repeatedly reminded her, she was the one who\u2019d insisted on being present when Ellen met Vanessa. That was certainly true, but Anne Marie didn\u2019t think meeting at the Mariners\u2019 game for Stitch and Pitch night\u2014meeting \u201caccidentally on purpose\u201d\u2014was such a brilliant idea. She\u2019d agreed to do it his way, although it went against her instincts. That had been her f irst mistake. They\u2019d arrived at the game as planned and were headed toward their seats when Tim had called out to them. He\u2019d made a pretense of just noticing them. The evening had gone downhill from there.</p><p>Vanessa had been openly hostile to Anne Marie. To Ellen she\u2019d been patronizing and saccharine sweet. The worst part, as far as Anne Marie was concerned, was that Tim didn\u2019t appear to perceive anything amiss with Vanessa\u2019s behavior. To all outward appearances, he seemed to feel the meeting couldn\u2019t have gone better. In Anne Marie\u2019s opinion, the whole experience had been a disaster. Now that they were home and Ellen was preparing for bed, she had a chance to mull over the events of the evening.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Ellen called from her bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Time for their nightly ritual. Ellen climbed into bed with Baxter cuddled next to her. Anne Marie knelt on the f loor so Ellen could say her prayers.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy the baseball game?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt was all right.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t for Anne Marie, but she couldn\u2019t tell Ellen that. The girl looked guilelessly up at her. \u201cI thought you were Tim\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Doing her best to sound calm and serene, Anne Marie smiled down at her daughter. \u201cTim and Vanessa are a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ellen frowned. \u201cBut he took you out to dinner by yourself, remember?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wasn\u2019t likely to forget. \u201cVanessa was there,\u201d she half-lied. Perhaps not in the physical sense but in every other way Tim\u2019s girlfriend had been with them.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me about her.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie realized she didn\u2019t actually know very much about the other woman. \u201cI guess I should\u2019ve told you earlier,\u201d she said. In a short time Ellen had grown close to Tim. She admired him and talked about him incessantly. Along with Brad, Mark and Hector he was a positive male f igure, and Anne Marie wouldn\u2019t say or do anything to jeopardize that special relationship.</p><p>\u201cI know meeting Vanessa was a surprise.\u201d Tim had wanted to be the one to introduce Vanessa to Ellen, and Anne Marie had agreed. In retrospect it would\u2019ve been a hundred times better if she\u2019d been able to lead up to the subject of this other woman. She wished now that she\u2019d suggested it and regretted that she hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cYou like Tim, don\u2019t you?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>For fear her voice would give her away, Anne Marie nodded instead.</p><p>\u201cAnd he likes you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cjust not in a girlfriend-boyfriend way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Clearly Ellen was disappointed as well as confused. Who could blame her? \u201cThe person Tim really loves is you,\u201d Anne Marie murmured.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Ellen\u2019s eyes f lashed with delight. \u201cI like him, too. He makes me laugh and takes us neat places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does. Besides, Tim knew your grandmother and your other mom.\u201d Anne Marie didn\u2019t believe it was her place to inform the child that she was Tim\u2019s biological daughter. She\u2019d leave that to him\u2014at a mutually acceptable time and place. This evening had taught her a valuable lesson. She wasn\u2019t about to let Tim blurt out the news without f irst laying the groundwork. Ellen\u2019s dark eyes widened. \u201cHe knew my Grandma Dolores?</p><p>How come I never met him till now?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie wasn\u2019t prepared to answer that question. She\u2019d already stretched the truth about as far as it would go. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to ask Tim the next time he stops by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Vanessa be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. You like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ellen shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s okay, but she talks to me like I\u2019m a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll learn,\u201d Anne Marie assured her and prayed that was true. \u201cVanessa\u2019s a very nice person.\u201d She almost gritted her teeth as she said it.</p><p>Ellen seemed to consider that and then nodded. \u201cShe must be if Tim loves her.\u201d</p><p>Good point. Anne Marie hadn\u2019t thought of it in those terms. Out of the mouths of nine-year-olds...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Anne Marie reached for Ellen\u2019s small hands and closed her eyes, prepared to listen while the child said her prayers. These sometimes went on for three or four minutes. She asked God to bless Anne Marie f irst, then listed all her friends from school and day camp, followed by her Blossom Street friends and f inally Tim. She hesitated and added Vanessa to the list.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Ellen said, opening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Anne Marie echoed and kissed Ellen\u2019s cheek. She stroked Baxter\u2019s silky fur, then left the room, closing the door quietly behind her.</p><p>Restless and unsure, Anne Marie folded her arms and paced the kitchen, mulling over the conversation with her daughter. The truth was, she\u2019d been hostile toward Vanessa. Well, maybe not hostile, but certainly not hospitable. She resented the other woman, who\u2019d ruined the perfect scenario she\u2019d created for Ellen, Tim and her.</p><p>Anne Marie was shocked to discover how strong her feelings for Tim were. She hadn\u2019t expected that in the beginning. But the transformation in her attitude had been gradual. He\u2019d been so good, so natural, with Ellen. Anne Marie had watched him closely, initially unwilling to trust him, yet he\u2019d earned her trust. Earned it to the point that she\u2019d lowered her guard. She\u2019d half convinced herself she was falling in love with him. When he\u2019d told her about Vanessa, she\u2019d been angry and embarrassed, but in retrospect she understood that Tim had been in a diff icult position. He\u2019d already sprung the news that he was Ellen\u2019s biological father. He\u2019d tried to be fair, giving Anne Marie a chance to get used to that reality before he introduced Vanessa into their lives, as well. Whether it was the best way to handle the situation didn\u2019t matter. What was done was done. Unfortunately her relationship with Vanessa had started badly.</p><p>They were both at fault, because both felt threatened. If it was ever going to be made right, Anne Marie would need to reach out to the other woman.</p><p>The next morning, she decided to get in touch with Vanessa as soon as possible. She\u2019d have to ask Tim for her phone number; she\u2019d call him later. After taking Ellen to day camp, she opened the bookstore. She was still counting cash into the till when she saw Tim standing at the door. He looked as if he hadn\u2019t slept all night.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she greeted him cheerfully. He frowned.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a good morning?\u201d she teased, smiling at him. Slowly he smiled back. \u201cIt is now,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be in such a happy mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He scratched his head. \u201cVanessa didn\u2019t feel things went well last night.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie broke a roll of quarters and added them to the register drawer. \u201cThey didn\u2019t, but I take responsibility for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t as...friendly as I might\u2019ve been to Vanessa. I owe her\u2014and you\u2014an apology.\u201d</p><p>Tim just stared at her, as if he wasn\u2019t sure he should believe what she\u2019d said. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve taken Vanessa\u2019s feelings into account more. She felt I\u2019d intruded on her territory, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...yes, something like that.\u201d</p><p>This next part was the most diff icult. \u201cYou were right\u2014I\u2019m afraid I read more into the situation between you and me than I should have. That probably caused a certain amount of animosity in our initial meeting.\u201d She was embarrassed to admit this, but he already knew. It wasn\u2019t as though she\u2019d done a good job of hiding her feelings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for,\u201d she said, eager to change the subject. \u201cIf you\u2019ll give me Vanessa\u2019s phone number, I\u2019ll call her and see if I can make amends. I\u2019m sure she feels as awkward about what happened at the game as I do.\u201d</p><p>Tim stepped closer to the counter as he scribbled a number on the back of his business card. \u201cCan you tell me exactly what did happen?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie shrugged. \u201cIt was nothing really. Just undercurrents between the two of us.\u201d Basically they\u2019d stared daggers at each other. It had been a juvenile display that Anne Marie regretted.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Ellen think of Vanessa?\u201d Tim asked. Anne Marie didn\u2019t answer immediately. \u201cShe told me that if you love Vanessa, she must be very special.\u201d No need to mention the comment about Vanessa speaking to her as if she were a baby. Some of the tension seemed to leave Tim\u2019s shoulders. \u201cShe actually said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I tell Vanessa, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>He was almost at the door when she stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s time, you know.\u201d</p><p>He turned around. \u201cTime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you to tell Ellen that you\u2019re her father. In her heart I think she already knows. The news isn\u2019t going to upset her.\u201d</p><p>Tim swallowed hard and nodded. \u201cWould it be okay if I came by this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be perfect. In the meantime, I\u2019ll contact Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie waited until midmorning to call Tim\u2019s friend. At f irst the conversation didn\u2019t go well.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Vanessa demanded the instant she answered her cell phone.</p><p>Anne Marie had to bite her tongue to keep from responding in kind. \u201cIt seems to me that you and I should try to be friends,\u201d</p><p>she said calmly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt will if we both make the effort,\u201d Anne Marie told her. \u201cThe thing is, I behaved badly last evening and I want to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie ignored that. \u201cFor Tim and Ellen\u2019s sake, I\u2019d like to suggest we start over.\u201d</p><p>The phone went silent and for a moment Anne Marie thought the other woman had hung up.</p> <p>\u201cVanessa, are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Despite the inclination to give this up as useless, she tried again.</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to accept my apology?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa hesitated. In a lower voice, she answered, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean it, Vanessa. I\u2019m not a threat to your relationship with Tim. For him and for Ellen, it would help if you and I could come to some agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou agree to keep your hands off Tim, and we\u2019ll get along f ine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled, relieved that she\u2019d done what she needed to do. \u201cFriends?\u201d she asked.</p><p>After a short pause, Vanessa repeated the word, again with some hesitation. \u201cFriends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStick to being Ellen\u2019s mother, and everything will work out just f ine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised. \u201cIt was a pleasure talking to you,\u201d she said. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Marie,\u201d Vanessa said quickly. \u201cThis couldn\u2019t have been an easy call to make. I want you to know I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I hope to see you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>The truth was, Anne Marie would probably never be close friends with Vanessa but at least they understood each other now. Both were determined to make the best of an awkward situation. The rest of the day, Anne Marie and Teresa were busy with customers. There was a run on the newest installment of a popular series, and Anne Marie found herself constantly occupied\u2014for which she was grateful. About four-thirty, just before Ellen was due to return, Tim walked back into the store.</p><p>He looked, if anything, even worse than he had that morning.</p> <p>\u201cIs Ellen here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I thought you were coming tonight.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can wait that long. Now that the decision\u2019s been made, I want to get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie could understand. \u201cI\u2019d like to be in the room when you do,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, hands buried in his pants pockets. A few minutes later, Ellen ran into the store with her backpack bobbing on her shoulders. \u201cMom, Mom!\u201d She stopped abruptly when she saw Tim, glancing from him back to Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d Tim said in a deceptively casual voice.</p><p>\u201cHi. Vanessa\u2019s not with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTim has something he wants to tell you,\u201d Anne Marie said, reminding Tim that his visit had a purpose. She turned to Teresa, who\u2019d been taking a phone order. \u201cI\u2019m going to the apartment for a few minutes. Would you cover for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>The three of them walked up the stairs, Ellen f irst, then Anne Marie and Tim. Having heard Ellen\u2019s voice, Baxter waited on the landing, eager to go out for his afternoon walk. He scurried into the bedroom and returned with the leash in his mouth. Ellen was proud of teaching him that trick.</p><p>\u201cIn a few minutes,\u201d Anne Marie told her Yorkie, bending to pick him up.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down,\u201d Tim said, motioning to the sofa. Ellen did, and Anne Marie sat next to her with Baxter on her lap. She hooked her free arm around her daughter\u2019s shoulders. Tim looked ashen as if he didn\u2019t know where to start or how. Ellen sighed loudly enough for him to hear. He turned to her and opened his mouth but nothing came out.</p><p>\u201cAre you my father?\u201d she asked unexpectedly. Tim nodded and sank to the carpet on his knees in front of her. His eyes were moist. \u201cYes, Ellen. I\u2019m your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d Smiling up at Anne Marie, she said, \u201cI wanted to meet my father, remember? It was one of my wishes. Then you told me that Tim knew Grandma Dolores and my other mom and I knew God had sent me my daddy.\u201d</p><p>With that she hurled her arms around Tim\u2019s neck and hugged him f iercely. \u201cI\u2019m so glad it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie felt tears in her own eyes.</p><p>They\u2019d make this work, all of them. For Ellen.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>It is so important to allow yourself the time to be creative, because without creativity how can you imagine possibilities? For me, it\u2019s always been knitting and crochet and they have opened the door to limitless possibilities.</p><p>\u2014Candi Jensen, author and producer of the Emmynominated PBS TV show, Knit and Crochet TodayLydia Goetz</p><p>As I\u2019ve mentioned, A Good Yarn is closed on Mondays; that\u2019s when I schedule my doctor, dentist and other appointments. I also catch up on paperwork and accounting. I\u2019d also started leaving part of every Monday open to visit my mother. Thankfully Mom was only in the hospital overnight. Ever since her fall she seemed so frail to me, and I noticed that her mind wandered more. Some days she seems lost in the past. A couple of weeks ago, I swear she didn\u2019t know who I was. Margaret and I both feel we won\u2019t have her much longer, so it\u2019s important to spend as much time with her as possible. Moving her into an assisted living complex had been a diff icult decision, but more than ever, we realized it was the right one. Mom seemed to decline with every visit and she still missed her home, but we\u2019d had no other choice, Margaret and I, since she couldn\u2019t live by herself anymore.</p><p>At least the situation with Casey had improved in the past week. The real change had come after the day she\u2019d sought out Alix. Despite my tentative inquiries, neither one of them had divulged the topic of their conversation.</p><p>Whatever Alix said had helped Casey. I just wish she\u2019d told me where she was going. I\u2019ve hardly ever seen Brad so worried, fearful that she\u2019d decided to run away again. My husband had come to care as deeply about Casey as I did.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing today?\u201d Casey asked as I f inished packing lunches for her and Cody. She attended day camp with him unless she came to the shop with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting groceries, and then I\u2019m going to visit my mother,\u201d</p><p>I said, adding a small bag of corn chips to Cody\u2019s lunch. Those were his favorites, and he\u2019d eat them every day if I let him.</p><p>\u201cCan I come with you?\u201d She\u2019d dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, her usual attire, with f lip-f lops.</p><p>The request surprised me\u2014and it pleased me, too. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>Casey tried to sneak a cookie and I slapped her hand. \u201cNot before breakfast.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the cereal box instead. Before long Cody had joined her, and they sat side by side spooning up Rice Krispies and making exaggerated slurping sounds, which I chose to ignore.</p><p>I dropped Cody off, then Casey and I went to the grocery store.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a lot to say while I steered the cart through the aisles and carefully followed my list. I noticed, however, that several items showed up at the check-out stand that I didn\u2019t remember putting in the cart. I allowed the cake mix and the cantaloupe to pass without comment, but removed the teen gossip magazine before it reached the cash register. Holding it up, I looked at Casey, who shrugged as if she had no idea how that could possibly have landed in the cart. I replaced it in the magazine slot, poking her in the ribs. She laughed and so did I.</p><p>We brought the groceries home and made short work of putting everything away. Then we drove to the assisted living complex. Casey had met my mother before but only brief ly and only with the whole family present. Because this was her f irst real visit, I felt I needed to prepare her.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s mind is fading,\u201d I explained. \u201cShe\u2019s having some memory lapses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe might forget your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s often confused.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to say too much\u2014</p><p>didn\u2019t want to frighten Casey or negatively inf luence her opinion.</p><p>\u201cI get confused sometimes,\u201d she said.</p><p>I grinned. \u201cMe, too,\u201d I admitted. It was probably best for Casey to form her own judgment.</p><p>I parked the car and exchanged hellos with the friendly staff as Casey and I passed through the wide foyer to the elevator, which would take us up to my mother\u2019s small apartment. Tapping at her door, I let myself in. \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I said cheerfully. Margaret and I had positioned her sofa in the living room, with the afghan Margaret had crocheted in lovely fall colors spread over the back. Across from the sofa were her favorite chair and the coffee and end tables that had been in the family home. There was no room for anything else.</p><p>The kitchen had a miniature refrigerator and a microwave, a sink and a few dishes, but that was about all. I cleaned out her fridge every week, tossing the open cans of tuna f ish and the moldy cheese. Naturally I had to do that when Mom wasn\u2019t looking. She hated to discard anything.</p><p>Her bedroom was compact, too. There was just enough room for her bed, a nightstand and her beloved sewing machine. Mom didn\u2019t sew these days, but that machine had been a major part of her life for so many years, she\u2019d never feel at home without it. Despite the restrictive quarters, Margaret and I had found a spot for it.</p><p>Mom glanced up from the television. When she saw it was me, she brightened. \u201cLydia. You brought Hailey with you.\u201d</p><p>Hailey was my sister\u2019s daughter. \u201cNo, Mom, this is Casey.\u201d I slipped an arm around the girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cShe\u2019s spending the summer with Brad and me.\u201d I wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure Mom would remember Brad. Some weeks she did; other weeks she looked blankly at me when I mentioned his name. My mother tilted her head quizzically. \u201cHave I met you before?\u201d she asked Casey. \u201cI\u2019m so forgetful lately.\u201d</p><p>Casey slid her f ingertips into the pockets of her jean shorts.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d brought Mom to the house for dinner one Sunday afternoon shortly after Casey\u2019s arrival. Casey had spent most of the day in her room as if she felt she was intruding on family time. I\u2019d tried to coax her out to no avail. There\u2019d been a couple of similar occasions, including one at Margaret\u2019s, but as far as I knew, Casey hadn\u2019t exchanged more than a few words with my mother.</p><p>\u201cYou do look familiar, though,\u201d Mom said with a frown. Casey sat on the sofa next to her chair and studied the TV</p><p>screen. \u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d</p><p>I could\u2019ve answered for her. My mother was enthralled by the cooking channel. Paula Deen was her favorite, and she watched her show faithfully, as well as four or f ive others. She used to write down the recipes, which she passed to Margaret and me, and she asked for cookbooks every Christmas. Mom didn\u2019t cook anymore, but that didn\u2019t alter her desire to create wonderful meals for her family. She\u2019d given up writing out the recipes, and that concerned me. I was afraid she\u2019d lost\u2014what? Her sense of purpose? Her belief in a future? I suspected her ability to follow the instructions was already gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPaula Deen\u2019s baking cookies this morning,\u201d Mom told Casey, who appeared interested in what was happening. That didn\u2019t surprise me, considering the cookies and cakes she\u2019d baked herself.</p><p>I headed into the bedroom to gather up Mom\u2019s laundry, which I washed for her every week. The washer and dryer were down the hall and shared by the residents on the second f loor.</p><p>\u201cLydia was a terrible cook as a child,\u201d I heard my mother say.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t trust her in the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Casey met my gaze, giggling delightedly. I\u2019d heard the story of how, at age eleven, I\u2019d burned peanut butter cookies to a crisp countless times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the clothes into the washer and be right back,\u201d I said. Sometimes Mom had trouble remembering my name, but she recalled in vivid detail a long-ago incident from my youth. Maybe because it had been repeated so often over the years. Judging by Casey\u2019s rapt attention, I doubted either of them heard me leave. After I\u2019d loaded the washer I returned to f ind both Mom and Casey laughing, whether at something on the TV</p><p>or a shared joke I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Since Casey was keeping my mother entertained, I went back into the tiny bedroom to make her bed. Mom would be so embarrassed to realize she\u2019d left it unmade. When I was a kid, my mother had been a real stickler about tucking in the sheets and smoothing out the blankets each and every morning. Having a properly made bed was right up there with brushing my teeth and saying my prayers, and it was a habit I\u2019d never abandoned.</p><p>As I worked, I noticed that the laughter between Mom and Casey continued. It was so unusual to hear my mother laugh that I poked my head out the door to see what was so amusing. The TV was actually off, and Casey sat on the f loor at my mother\u2019s feet, doubled over with glee. When she caught sight of me, she pointed in my direction. \u201cYou read Margaret\u2019s diary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom, are you telling tales on me?\u201d I asked in mock outrage. Mom nodded. \u201cYour sister was so upset, she marched into the backyard and burned her diary. Your father said we were fortunate no one called the f ire department.\u201d</p><p>Casey found that equally hilarious and laughed even harder. Mom did, too. Happy tears rolled down her weathered cheeks until she reached for the handkerchief she kept inside her sweater pocket and dabbed at her eyes.</p><p>It was true. At seventeen, I\u2019d snuck into my sister\u2019s bedroom, searched for her diary and read page after page. As luck would have it, my sister had discovered me there, sitting on her bed, completely enthralled with what she\u2019d written. To say she was furious would be an understatement. Margaret had ripped the book from my hands and stormed out of the house, demanding that my parents \u201cdo something.\u201d</p><p>What Margaret didn\u2019t understand\u2014or for that matter, my parents, either\u2014was that I was starved for a normal life. In my view Margaret was a normal teenager and I wasn\u2019t because I had cancer. I craved my sister\u2019s life and the only way I could get a glimpse of normal was by reading her journal.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s forgiven me now,\u201d I said, then added, \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>Casey looked at me archly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks a lot, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you keep a diary?\u201d Mom asked Casey.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood thing.\u201d I said, hands on my hips. \u201cI\u2019d probably read yours, too.\u201d</p><p>Casey grinned and turned back to my mother, wanting to hear more tales of my sinful past.</p><p>We stayed until it was time for Mom to go to the dining room for lunch. She sat at the same table every day with three other widows. They all seemed to get along well and I was grateful she had at least this social interaction, since she rarely participated in events or day trips planned by the staff.</p><p>Casey escorted her to the dining room while I f inished folding and putting away her clean laundry. Then I hurried downstairs, meeting the two of them as Casey helped Mom into her chair.</p><p>\u201cBring Hailey again,\u201d Mom said, smiling up at me. Casey didn\u2019t seem upset that my mother thought she was my niece. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d I gently hugged her goodbye. This was probably the best visit I\u2019d had with her since the move. She was almost her old self again, and I had Casey to thank for that. The girl had been enthralled with my mother, even when Mom repeated the same stories over and over.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you came with me,\u201d I said as we walked toward the visitor parking lot.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have grandparents,\u201d she said a little sadly. \u201cI mean, I never had one I actually remember.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how to comment.</p><p>We were driving back to the house when Casey suddenly turned to me. \u201cWhat was it like to have cancer?\u201d she asked. The question caught me unawares. My mother must have brought up the subject, although I couldn\u2019t guess how much or how little she\u2019d said\u2014or remembered.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a lot of fun, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d I thought it was preferable to keep the details to myself. I recalled how disturbed Mom and Margaret had been when I lost my hair during chemo. Good grief, that was the least of it! The drugs, the vomiting, the horrendous headaches that incapacitated me. Going bald was nothing.</p><p>Nearly a year of my life had been spent in the hospital. I\u2019d be home for short periods of time, and then something else would happen that would force me to return. I didn\u2019t like to think about those years.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen. I\u2019d just gotten my driver\u2019s license.\u201d I kept my answers short and considered trying to change the subject. I didn\u2019t, because Casey obviously wanted to understand.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the worst part, other than feeling sick all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst part?\u201d I echoed. \u201cI think it was missing out on all the fun in high school.\u201d It was so much more than being unable to attend football games or dances. All my friends were dating and exploring their independence. Not me. Instead I\u2019d been in the hospital for months on end, hooked up to IVs, in such physical and emotional pain that I didn\u2019t have the strength to open my eyes. I\u2019d desperately longed to be like everyone else. I was so sick of being sick.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever go to a dance?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I\u2019d gone with my girlfriends.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a special dress?\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly a lump f illed my throat. \u201cMom made me one, and it was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and managed a laugh. \u201cThe boys in my class tended to date girls who weren\u2019t bald.\u201d I\u2019d generally worn a kerchief, since the wigs I had were so hot and uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou lost your hair?\u201d Casey asked in horror.</p><p>\u201cMargaret has pictures. I think she took them as revenge for reading her diary.\u201d</p><p>Casey smiled, but then her expression grew serious again. \u201cIt was hard having cancer, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I could make light of those years but decided on honesty instead. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for several minutes. \u201cThe cancer came back, didn\u2019t it?\u201d she f inally asked. \u201cThat\u2019s what Cody told me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in my early twenties. The fact is, it might still return. Life doesn\u2019t come with a guarantee that just because I\u2019m a nice person the tumors won\u2019t grow again.\u201d</p><p>We pulled into the driveway and I turned off the engine. I climbed out of the car and waited, watching as Casey continued to sit there, apparently steeped in thought. A moment later, she joined me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brave person,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>I laughed because I certainly didn\u2019t think of myself in those terms. Looping my arm around her neck, I brought her head close to mine and kissed her hair. \u201cOh, yes. That\u2019s me, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had cancer twice and you...you still let me live with you this summer.\u201d</p><p>That part, at least for this day, was pure joy.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>\u201cHutch\u201d Hutchinson</p><p>Hutch was in love. Everyone around him recognized the signs and didn\u2019t have any qualms about pointing it out. Not that he was trying to hide it.</p><p>A little while ago\u2014before Phoebe\u2014his sister had attempted to set him up with a girlfriend of hers...Mia, Myra, something like that. He\u2019d forgotten her name just as he was sure she\u2019d forgotten his. Meeting Phoebe had changed everything. The f irst time he\u2019d seen her he\u2019d felt the attraction. She was beautiful, and he wasn\u2019t reacting merely to her appearance. Phoebe was everything he\u2019d ever hoped to f ind in a woman\u2014and she loved him. He could hardly believe it.</p><p>Hutch was, however, somewhat disappointed that it\u2019d taken Phoebe so long to admit that her f ianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t dead. But although it troubled him, he could understand why she\u2019d lied. In similar circumstances, he might have done the same thing in order to avoid embarrassment and lengthy explanations. It\u2019d been simpler this way, and as she\u2019d said to him, the minute her f ianc\u00e9 agreed to pay for sex with another woman he was dead to her. Hutch wondered about this other man who\u2019d once been a very important part of Phoebe\u2019s life. In the two months they\u2019d been seeing each other Phoebe had never spoken of her engagement or offered up anything but the sketchiest details. All Hutch knew was that the man Phoebe had planned to marry had lied and cheated on her. When the truth came out\u2014the second time\u2014</p><p>she\u2019d severed the relationship for good. He realized how deeply hurt she\u2019d been by what her ex-f ianc\u00e9 had done.</p><p>\u201cI have your attorney on line one,\u201d Gail Wendell said, breaking into his thoughts.</p><p>Now that the trial date was approaching, he heard from John Custer nearly every day.</p><p>\u201cHutch speaking,\u201d he said, picking up the phone. The conversation with John lasted only a few minutes. As soon as he\u2019d f inished, he tried to put the matter out of his mind. It was on days like this that he wanted, no, needed, to talk to Phoebe. As soon as he heard her voice, his blood pressure seemed to decrease. Checking his watch, he reached for his phone again. Quarter to eleven. Phoebe was between clients. They spoke two and three times a day now, and even that wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said when she answered her cell.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you talk to your attorney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Hutch closed his eyes. He loved hearing the sound of her voice. It f lowed over him, easing his burdens, comforting him.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Reality returned and his eyes f lickered open. \u201cWe\u2019re scheduled to go to court next week. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any way around that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>No sorrier than Hutch. \u201cI was hoping, foolishly perhaps, that the other attorney would see reason. But from what I hear, Clark Snowden\u2019s conf ident he can win\u2014and in the process make a name for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnowden?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the plaintiff \u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Hutch looked down at a f ile on his desk that required his attention. One gratifying consequence of meeting Phoebe was that he\u2019d learned to delegate. This evidence that he trusted his subordinates had improved his relationship with his department heads, as well. \u201cWhat about dinner tonight?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m tied up for the rest of the week.\u201d</p><p>Her rejection shocked him. Until now, she\u2019d always been as eager to see him as he was her. Not wanting to sound possessive or unduly concerned, he murmured, \u201cAll week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...and next week, too.\u201d</p><p>Her voice had grown fragile. \u201cI see.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what had changed, but clearly something had.</p> <p>\u201cListen, Hutch,\u201d she said in a tight voice, \u201cour relationship\u2019s happened very fast, don\u2019t you think? Maybe we should step back and analyze what\u2019s going on between us before we continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost two months. I know what I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you know what you want? \u201d</p><p>Hutch felt a distinct chill. He had the feeling that she was breaking up with him, but he had no idea why. \u201cYes,\u201d he countered sharply. \u201cI want you in my life.\u201d</p><p>His words seemed to take her aback. After an awkward moment, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t...I need time\u2014to think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d he asked irritably. \u201cHave I done anything to offend you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, never.\u201d Her voice softened perceptibly.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s this needing time all about? Isn\u2019t that rather sudden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I need to think, I really do. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>Maybe best for her but def initely not for him. Hutch wanted to argue with her, to f igure out what had changed, but restrained himself. After all, it was up to her to accept or reject his love. Phoebe said nothing, and he was shaken by the loss that tore through him.</p><p>If she wanted time, he\u2019d give it to her. Pride wouldn\u2019t allow him to press his point or to plead.</p> <p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d he said, his voice devoid of emotion. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, you contact me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Phoebe.\u201d</p><p>She started to speak again but he couldn\u2019t bear to listen. Gently he replaced the receiver and sat staring into space, wondering what had just happened. In the course of a few minutes she\u2019d ended the most promising relationship of his life. Hutch stayed at his desk for the rest of the afternoon, attacking the paperwork in front of him. At four-thirty, Gail stepped into his off ice. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Hutch glanced at her. \u201cNever better. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Gail frowned, shaking her head. \u201cFor one thing, you\u2019ve been very quiet ever since you got off the phone with John Custer.\u201d</p><p>Hutch made a show of studying his watch. \u201cIsn\u2019t it quitting time?\u201d he asked. In other words he had no intention of answering her question.</p><p>\u201cWhich brings me to something else,\u201d Gail said. \u201cYou\u2019re usually on the phone with Ms. Rylander about now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t be seeing Ms. Rylander again,\u201d he said starkly. She didn\u2019t bother to hide her shock. \u201cWhy ever not? You\u2019re crazy about her and I know she feels the same way about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently you and I are both wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>The older woman clucked her tongue several times, sounding like an agitated hen. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to sit back and do nothing? \u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Hutch, for the love of Mary, don\u2019t be so stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t my decision,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDid you at least f ind out why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry harder.\u201d</p><p>Hutch lifted his shoulders in a shrug. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the ball\u2019s in her court. If Phoebe wants to call me, f ine, but I\u2019m not holding my breath.\u201d He sounded resolute and sure of himself, although he didn\u2019t feel either of those things. Gail hesitated and then, with a f inal shake of her head, left his off ice.</p><p>As soon as she shut the door, Hutch exhaled, letting go of the pretense, and his entire body sagged with defeat. For a moment he thought about confronting Phoebe and demanding she tell him what he\u2019d done that was so terrible. He couldn\u2019t think of a single thing to warrant this reaction and felt sick as he contemplated the new fact of his life\u2014what had seemed so promising only hours earlier was now completely and utterly over.</p><p>He stayed at the off ice until nearly eight. Then, with a heavy heart, he drove home. Dinner was a frozen entr\u00e9e he shoved in the microwave and ate in front of the television.</p><p>His phone rang twice but he didn\u2019t pick up. Whoever had called wasn\u2019t interested in leaving a message, which was f ine because he wasn\u2019t interested in listening to one, either. The late-night news f lashed across the screen, and Hutch realized he\u2019d been staring at the television for hours, but couldn\u2019t remember anything he\u2019d seen. No matter how many times he went over his conversation with Phoebe, he couldn\u2019t explain her sudden decision\u2014or was it sudden?\u2014to end their relationship. Needless to say, Hutch didn\u2019t sleep well that night or the next. He kept busy at work, met with his attorney and made every effort not to think about Phoebe. He didn\u2019t succeed but pretended he had. The lawsuit occupied his mind when he wasn\u2019t dwelling on Phoebe.</p><p>To her credit, Gail didn\u2019t mention Phoebe\u2019s name again, and neither did he. Every now and then he caught his assistant watching him, looking for any telltale sign. What she hoped to f ind, he didn\u2019t know. Perhaps Gail expected to uncover some crack in his resolve, some indication that he was weakening. But if anything, Hutch grew more convinced that he simply wasn\u2019t cut out for love or marriage. He\u2019d laid his heart on the line and Phoebe had ripped it to shreds without cause or provocation. If this was love, then he wanted no part of it. He had a good life, albeit a lonely one, but he was used to that. As for children, he had his niece and nephew and God willing, eventually one of them, or both, would take over the family business. Otherwise he\u2019d sell out, which he might have to do anyway, depending on the outcome of the court case. Friday afternoon, f ive days after that last conversation with Phoebe, Hutch left the off ice even later than usual. It was mid-August now, and in his opinion no place on earth was more beautiful than the Pacif ic Northwest on a hot summer\u2019s day when the sky was blue and Mount Rainier glimmered like an apparition in the distance.</p><p>It was almost nine, but there was still plenty of sunshine. He was walking toward his parking space when he saw her. Phoebe.</p><p>She stood next to his car, waiting for him. Hutch stopped and instantly squelched the surge of joy he felt at seeing her. He wouldn\u2019t allow her to toy with his feelings. Not again. Apparently this was some game to her. A game he wasn\u2019t willing to play.</p><p>He strode decisively to his car, each step f illed with purpose.</p><p>\u201cHello, Hutch,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d she whispered brokenly. \u201cI tried, but I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>He held his briefcase with both hands and just stared at her. He supposed she expected him to ask her questions or show how grateful he was to see her. He wouldn\u2019t do either. She frowned. \u201cSay something,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, eyes brimming with tears. \u201cYou might tell me you...that you missed me.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together, refusing to tell her any of that even if it was true.</p><p>She raised her hand as though to touch his face. Hutch retreated a step.</p><p>She covered her mouth with one hand and began to sob. His resolve f inally faltered but he wouldn\u2019t let himself succumb to her tears, although it was impossible to remain stoic and indifferent to her pain.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I\u2019ve discovered I can do it, Phoebe.\u201d He reached for his door handle. \u201cI can live without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, his back to her.</p><p>\u201cClark Snowden...\u201d</p><p>At the mention of the plaintiff \u2019s attorney, he turned to face her. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was...he was my f ianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>The words slammed into him with a force that was actually physical. He couldn\u2019t have spoken had his life depended on it.</p><p>\u201cI knew if Clark found out you\u2019re the man I love, he\u2019d do everything in his power to hurt you. I\u2014I thought the only way to protect you was to break off our relationship...but I can\u2019t do it. I tried and I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m too self ish and needy, Hutch, and I love you too much.\u201d</p><p>His briefcase fell to the pavement as he hauled her into his arms, holding on as if they\u2019d both perish otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me.\u201d His need for her was an ache that shot through him, that burned within him.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.... I was afraid.\u201d</p><p>Then they were kissing, straining against each other, trying to undo f ive days apart, f ive days of agony. Hutch tasted her salty tears and kissed them from her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d she whispered, clinging to him.</p><p>\u201cClark will try to destroy you...to ruin the business and discredit you. I can\u2019t stand by and let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m going to win this lawsuit and then I\u2019m going to marry you, if you\u2019ll agree.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d half lifted her from the pavement and with her arms around his neck, Phoebe sobbed her answer. \u201cYes, yes! Oh, Hutch, yes! I want to marry you more than anything in the world. I want to spend my life with you.\u201d</p><p>That was good to hear, because he wanted her with him for the rest of his, too. Nothing mattered but loving Phoebe. Snowden could do whatever he would; it made no difference to Hutch as long as he had Phoebe.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>Tim walked out to the curb to meet Anne Marie and Ellen as she parked her car outside his parents\u2019 house. Vanessa stood on the porch, waiting, making sure Anne Marie knew she was watching every move.</p><p>This had been Tim\u2019s idea, bringing Ellen over to meet his parents. The f irst time, it would be just his mother and father; later he planned to introduce her to his siblings. Ellen needed to feel comfortable with Vanessa, too. Anne Marie hoped the air had been cleared, that there wouldn\u2019t be any problems between her and the other woman. Maybe Vanessa needed further reassurance that she had no designs on Tim. Ever eager to see her father, Ellen unfastened her seat belt and hurtled out of the car and to his side. Without a pause, she threw her arms around his middle, then immediately asked, \u201cDid you bring your motorcycle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I would, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>Anne Marie climbed out of the car and waved to Vanessa, who halfheartedly returned the gesture. Even from this distance, Anne Marie could see that the other woman didn\u2019t want her there.</p><p>Anne Marie hoped she\u2019d have the opportunity to tell her that she wouldn\u2019t always be accompanying Ellen to Tim\u2019s family events. On this f irst occasion, however, she felt it was important to be there.</p><p>By the time she reached the porch steps, Tim and Ellen were in the garage examining Tim\u2019s Harley. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello, Vanessa,\u201d Anne Marie gave the other woman an affable smile.</p><p>Vanessa had crossed her arms. \u201cHow come you have to be here?\u201d she demanded. Any residual friendliness from their phone conversation had obviously evaporated.</p><p>\u201cI felt Ellen needed to know I was close by in unfamiliar surroundings. It won\u2019t always be like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d With that, Vanessa turned and walked into the house, letting the screen door slam behind her. Not sure where to go, Anne Marie went in search of Ellen and Tim in the garage. Ellen sat on the Harley, the large black helmet on her head. She resembled one of those Roswell aliens, Anne Marie thought with amusement. Ellen saw her and waved frantically.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Mom! Look,\u201d she cried, her voice muff led by the helmet.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in there?\u201d Anne Marie joked, peering through the visor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me! It\u2019s me!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she looked at Tim who smiled back. Their eyes held a fraction longer than necessary as they both shared in Ellen\u2019s delight.</p><p>Anne Marie had to force herself to glance away. Despite her reassurances to Vanessa, she still found Tim attractive, especially when she saw how happy Ellen was whenever the three of them were together.</p> <p>Ellen talked incessantly about Tim. It was Dad this and Dad that. She\u2019d taken to calling him Dad ever since he\u2019d announced he was her father. That same night she\u2019d marked the wish off her list. Anne Marie and Ellen had begun putting pictures of father and daughter in the girl\u2019s Twenty Wishes scrapbook. After a few minutes, Tim helped Ellen remove the helmet and led the two of them inside. \u201cMom and Dad are eager to meet you,\u201d he said.</p><p>His parents\u2014and Vanessa\u2014were waiting in the living room. Tim held Ellen\u2019s hand, tugging her forward. Not wanting to intrude, Anne Marie hung back.</p><p>Vanessa sat on the sofa, arms still crossed as she glared suspiciously at Anne Marie\u2014as if to ask what she\u2019d been doing in the garage with Tim all that time.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Tim\u2019s mother said softly. \u201cYou must be Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad, meet your granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Ellen sidled close to Tim, looking small and uncertain.</p> <p>\u201cMy name is Mary,\u201d Tim\u2019s mother said, \u201cbut I hope you\u2019ll call me Grandma.\u201d</p><p>Ellen gave an almost imperceptible nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Thomas, and I\u2019m your grandfather,\u201d Tim\u2019s father told her next.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I could have three grandmas,\u201d Ellen said in a tentative voice.</p><p>Anne Marie felt she needed to explain. \u201cEllen was living with her Grandma Dolores when we f irst met. After I adopted Ellen, my mother wanted to be called Grandma, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather call me Mary?\u201d his mother asked, glancing from Ellen to Anne Marie.</p><p>Anne Marie decided to let her daughter answer that herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you Grandma,\u201d Ellen said after a bit.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be very nice.\u201d Mary straightened. \u201cI hope you like fried chicken because that\u2019s what we\u2019re having for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Ellen nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen your daddy was a little boy, he loved my southern fried chicken.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, Anne Marie exhaled slowly. Tim\u2019s parents were good people and it was clear that they loved Ellen already. Thomas stepped forward and thrust out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Tim\u2019s dad, and you\u2019re Ellen\u2019s adoptive mother?\u201d</p><p>She accepted it and returned his smile. \u201cAnne Marie Roche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate your allowing us into Ellen\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been an easy decision, but Anne Marie didn\u2019t tell him that.</p><p>\u201cEllen seems to be doing just f ine, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Vanessa said sharply. This was her way of telling Anne Marie that her job was done and it was time to move along now. Taking her cue, she started to back away. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you all to become better acquainted. When would you like me to come for Ellen?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Tim narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not going, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease join us for dinner,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get to know you, too, seeing that you\u2019re the one raising our granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d Anne Marie turned to Vanessa, unsure how to respond. She wanted the other woman to understand that she knew her place and had no intention of encroaching on her relationship with Tim.</p><p>\u201cThomas,\u201d Mary called from the kitchen. \u201cI need you and Tim to move the picnic table out of the sun.\u201d</p><p>The two men promptly left and Anne Marie found herself alone with Vanessa, wondering what, if anything, she should say. Vanessa released a long breath. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Anne Marie felt awkward standing in the middle of the room, yet wasn\u2019t relaxed enough to sit.</p><p>\u201cJust now,\u201d Vanessa elaborated. \u201cWhen you f irst arrived. I shouldn\u2019t have said what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d Anne Marie said, pretending to have forgotten the complete lack of welcome. \u201cTrust me, I understand. You\u2019re in a diff icult situation. We both are. The only thing we can do is deal with it, right?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa didn\u2019t seem persuaded. \u201cI guess, but it\u2019s kind of hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Anne Marie said. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll stay a little longer, then make my excuses and leave. You and Tim can bring Ellen home later, or if it\u2019s easier I can come back and pick her up. Whichever suits you best.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make this work,\u201d Anne Marie told her, \u201cbut we need to keep the lines of communication open. I don\u2019t want you to feel uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Vanessa said aggressively. \u201cTim and I are going to be married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable,\u201d Anne Marie agreed. \u201cAnd by the same token, I want Ellen to feel at ease with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already does.\u201d Vanessa scowled, as though she expected Anne Marie to dispute that statement.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate how readily you\u2019ve accepted Ellen.\u201d Anne Marie wasn\u2019t convinced that was true, but didn\u2019t want to challenge the other woman.</p><p>Vanessa gave the same exasperated sigh she had earlier. \u201cYou have no idea how diff icult it is, sharing Tim with this child. What\u2019ll happen when we have our own children?\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t have an answer for her. \u201cThe two of you will f igure that out when the time comes,\u201d she said. It was the best she could do.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Vanessa mumbled. \u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>The two men returned, and Tim immediately went to Vanessa\u2019s side.</p><p>Rather than feel like an outsider, Anne Marie made her way to the kitchen, where Mary and Ellen were chatting amicably.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I have everything under control. We\u2019ll be eating in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Ellen sat on a bar stool at the counter. \u201cLook, Mom,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cGrandma Mary has a crooked little f inger, the same as me.\u201d She held her two little f ingers together and displayed how they veered off, forming the shape of a V.</p><p>\u201cMy father once told me they\u2019re a sign of high intelligence,\u201d</p><p>Mary said.</p><p>\u201cDoes Dad have those, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d Mary sent Ellen a smile. She took the chicken from the oven and arranged the pieces on a large platter.</p><p>\u201cI can carry that outside if you\u2019d like,\u201d Anne Marie volunteered. She wished now that she\u2019d declined the dinner invitation. It was too awkward for both her and Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Ellen, why don\u2019t you tell everyone dinner\u2019s ready,\u201d</p><p>Mary suggested.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but can I show Grandpa something f irst?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Mary said.</p><p>Ellen dashed into the living room while Anne Marie carried the platter of fried chicken outside and set it on the table. She\u2019d just come back into the house when she heard Ellen scream. Anne Marie froze. She\u2019d never heard her daughter scream like that. It was a cry of intense pain. In her rush to f ind Ellen, she nearly stumbled. Heart-wrenching sobs came from the garage. Anne Marie saw Ellen on the cement f loor with Tim bending over her. Thomas stood in the background, his face pale.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she cried, falling to her knees beside Ellen. The girl cradled her arm against her side and was in such pain she seemed to have trouble breathing. Sobs racked her thin body and she shook uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cShe fell off the motorcycle,\u201d Tim said. \u201cIt was so fast I couldn\u2019t reach her in time to catch her.\u201d He was pale and shaken, too. \u201cI think she broke her arm.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie brought Ellen carefully into her embrace. \u201cCall 9-1-1,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Tim rushed into the other room.</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t have a lot of medical experience, but it seemed to her that Ellen was going into shock. That was when she lost it, too. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long?\u201d she yelled, f ighting to hold back the panic.</p><p>Thomas rushed into the house and returned with a blanket, which he wrapped around Ellen\u2019s shoulders. Ellen\u2019s sobs tore at Anne Marie\u2019s heart and soon her own face was streaked with tears. She rocked Ellen, whispering words of comfort and reassurance as they waited for the paramedics. An eternity passed before she f inally heard the siren. As soon as the medical personnel arrived, they took over, and within minutes Ellen was loaded into the aid car. Anne Marie rode with her; Tim followed in his vehicle.</p><p>Thankfully the emergency room wasn\u2019t crowded. Ellen was given something to relieve the pain, then sent to have an X-ray of her arm.</p><p>The second her daughter had been wheeled out, Anne Marie whirled on Tim. \u201cHow could you let this happen?\u201d she cried. He shook his head hopelessly. \u201cIt was all so fast...\u201d he said again.</p><p>Covering her face with both hands, she fought for composure. There was no point in blaming Tim; Ellen could just as easily have fallen at home with Anne Marie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He slid his arm around her shoulders. \u201cSo am I,\u201d he said, pressing his head to hers. \u201cI knew the instant she landed that she\u2019d broken a bone.\u201d</p><p>At just that moment Vanessa walked into the cubicle. When she saw Tim with his arm around Anne Marie and their heads together, she exploded. \u201cI knew it! I knew it! The minute I\u2019m out of the picture you go after Tim.... So much for all that crap about not being interested in him. You\u2019ve been after Tim from the day you met.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. She blinked in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou want Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d he warned. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop. Do you think I\u2019m blind?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI saw how the two of you were looking at each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>A nurse stepped into the cubicle. \u201cYou need to keep your voices down,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a problem here, I advise you to take it outside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reluctantly Tim stood up. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this without half the hospital listening in.\u201d</p><p>They left and Anne Marie relaxed a little. She\u2019d had enough of Vanessa\u2019s hysterics for one day. Brushing her disheveled hair out of her face, she closed her eyes and wondered if she\u2019d made a big mistake letting Tim into their lives. Just then, it seemed she had.</p><p>Before she could brood any more on the situation, the technician was back with Ellen and a copy of the X-ray. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re going to get a cast,\u201d he said to Ellen. Her daughter\u2019s face was dry of tears now but her eyes were wide and curious. \u201cCan I have a pink one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what Dr. Sawyer has to say about that.\u201d</p><p>It took another hour before the arm was set and the cast in place. Ellen looked admiringly down at her arm, which was encased in a hot-pink cast, and smiled up at Anne Marie. \u201cIt still hurts really bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it does, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Ellen scooted out of the chair. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Vanessa.\u201d</p> <p>Ellen said nothing, just stared at the f loor. The assistant brought in paperwork for Anne Marie to sign. Once she did, they were free to go. Tim sat out in the waiting area and stood up when they appeared.</p><p>Ellen showed no delight at seeing him.</p><p>Tim knelt in front of her. \u201cHow\u2019s my girl?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I have a cast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d take me back to my car, I\u2019d appreciate it,\u201d Anne Marie said wearily.</p> <p>\u201cOf course. My dad lent me his. All I had at the house was the Harley.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie didn\u2019t care who the car belonged to as long as she got where she needed to go. On the drive back to the family home, she didn\u2019t inquire about Vanessa. Frankly, she didn\u2019t care where the other woman was; she was just grateful not to be dealing with her anymore.</p><p>Anne Marie sat in the backseat with Ellen and got out as soon as he\u2019d parked. All she wanted to do was escape, to get her daughter home.</p><p>\u201cApologize to your parents for me,\u201d she said, unfastening Ellen\u2019s seat belt. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Hands in his pockets, Tim stood helplessly by as Anne Marie led Ellen to her car. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do...\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d she said stiff ly.</p><p>\u201cCan I phone you later and see how Ellen\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t mean to be rude but she couldn\u2019t face him again that night. \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t. Tomorrow would be f ine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He accepted that without argument. \u201cRemember to call if there\u2019s anything I can do.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but as far as Anne Marie was concerned Tim had done quite enough.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>Alix Turner</p><p>\u201cAlix, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Alix tensed. She recognized her employer\u2019s tone of voice and it was ominous. Alix had already had a heart-toheart with Winter Adams, owner of the French Caf\u00e9, a few days earlier.</p><p>Alix had made a costly mistake this morning, her second that week. In both instances the entire batch of dough had to be dumped, wasting the ingredients and the time. Alix knew she was in the wrong, and she knew the mistakes had occurred because she was so agitated, mentally and physically. Although she\u2019d gone several days without a cigarette, her body still screamed for nicotine. It was supposed to get easier, but it hadn\u2019t. She knew why, too, but that didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to f ire me?\u201d Alix demanded. She stepped into the off ice and held herself rigid, expecting the worst. It was what she deserved. If having to toss two different batches wasn\u2019t bad enough, Alix had been irritable all week. She was afraid her employer had grown tired of her short temper, and what had happened this morning was the f inal straw. Winter obviously intended to let her go.</p><p>She looked at Alix and sighed loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I want to do. If you recall, I asked you to take over as manager next week when I\u2019m on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re doing it anyway, right?\u201d Alix didn\u2019t know why she felt the need to ask. Losing her job now would be disastrous. She and Jordan were living at the lake house, so with saving for a place of their own, increased transportation costs and much higher utilities, their budget was stretched to the limit. She\u2019d had to give up cigarettes out of necessity as much as desire. She simply couldn\u2019t afford to smoke.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Winter returned thoughtfully. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a wonderful employee until just recently. I\u2019m hoping you can resolve whatever\u2019s bothering you.\u201d She looked directly at Alix. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><p>Alix swallowed hard and nodded. It was easy to blame her bad mood on her need for a smoke; however, the reason was more than her craving for nicotine.</p><p>The cigarettes were a convenient excuse, but the underlying problem was her fear of motherhood. She yearned for a child; at the same time the prospect still terrif ied her. Jordan did his best to reassure her but Alix couldn\u2019t help worrying about her abilities as a mother. Her husband was willing to take the risk, willing to believe they\u2019d be good parents. Alix was the one who doubted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work on a better attitude,\u201d Alix promised as she left the office.</p><p>\u201cGiving up smoking isn\u2019t easy,\u201d Winter said sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cIt causes mood swings and concentration problems\u2014but with you I sense it\u2019s more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Alix agreed.</p><p>\u201cDo you need some time to clear your head?\u201d Winter asked.</p><p>\u201cCould I have an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Removing her apron, Alix decided she\u2019d take a walk. She set out for the small park close to Blossom Street, her strides brisk, her thoughts no less so.</p><p>The day was overcast, dark skies threatening rain, but the weather suited her mood. The play section of the park was deserted. Alix sat on a swing and placed both hands on the chain, gently swaying back and forth.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Alix glanced up to see Casey Marshall standing off to one side, looking morose. They\u2019d talked a couple of times and understood each other, since they shared a similar background, with all the insecurities it engendered.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s got you down?\u201d Alix asked, putting aside her own troubles.</p><p>\u201cI came to say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my new foster home next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>Casey bit her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s a good place. Evelyn told me. The best, she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated moving, too,\u201d Alix told her. She remembered stuff ing everything she possessed in a small suitcase, leaving behind friends, pets and life as she\u2019d known it for those months or years. Settling in with a new family was always diff icult. She\u2019d hated starting over.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d Casey left the rest unsaid. She sat in the swing next to Alix and kicked at the ground with the toe of her tennis shoes.</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t need her to f inish the thought. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to leave Lydia and Brad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Casey nodded. \u201cThey...they\u2019re great. I know I sort of got pushed on them,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThey want to adopt a baby...</p><p>Everyone does, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Alix couldn\u2019t argue with the facts. Infants were quickly adopted and older children were often shuff led from home to home, family to family, never having the opportunity to put down roots in any one community.</p><p>\u201cWhen I f irst came to them, I...I didn\u2019t want to be there. It was only supposed to be a couple of days. Lydia and Brad opened their home to me and...and their hearts, too. I didn\u2019t want to like them, but I did. I do.\u201d Sadness seemed to emanate from her as she stared down at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And Alix did. In the beginning she\u2019d tried to blend in with her foster families, too, trying to prove she could be one of them, that she was worthy of love.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work,\u201d Casey continued. \u201cEverything I did was a disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true.\u201d Alix was well aware of how hard Lydia had tried to make Casey feel welcome and part of their family.</p><p>\u201cIt is! \u201d Casey cried. \u201cLast night I tried to surprise Lydia and make dinner and then the casserole boiled over and smoke was pouring out of the oven and the f ire alarm started beeping and dinner was ruined.\u201d She said this in one giant breath.</p><p>\u201cDid Brad or Lydia get upset?\u201d</p><p>Casey shook her head. \u201cBrad made a big joke of it. He said the f ire alarm should be called the dinner bell.\u201d</p><p>Despite the seriousness of the conversation, Alix smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd Cody thought it was cool \u2019cause we had to order pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lydia?\u201d</p><p>Casey glanced away. \u201cLydia...put her arm around me and said I shouldn\u2019t worry about it. Then she showed me where she keeps the bigger casserole dish so if I wanted to try again I\u2019d know which one to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no one was upset with you.\u201d</p><p>Casey jerked her head up. \u201cI was upset with me,\u201d she countered. \u201cThis was my way of thanking them and the whole dinner backf ired.\u201d</p><p>The girl still looked upset; Alix understood that. Casey had wanted to do something nice and instead she\u2019d revealed her incompetence. She was being unnecessarily hard on herself, which was a tendency Alix shared. She exaggerated every little thing that went wrong. At the moment Alix was sure Casey felt her whole life had been one mistake after another and everything she attempted was a disaster.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all, either,\u201d Casey said. \u201cLydia hired me to do small jobs at the store and she even paid me. She didn\u2019t need to do that, but she did and then I goofed up really bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem possible that Casey\u2019s shoulders could droop any lower, but they did. \u201cLydia asked me to put price stickers on a shipment of yarn. There were two different kinds of yarn and I accidentally switched the prices, so the expensive yarn was priced really low. As soon as I got it on the shelf, a lady came in and bought every skein and said Lydia had to give her the price I put on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Lydia do it?\u201d</p><p>Casey nodded.</p><p>Alix would bet Margaret had something to say about that.</p><p>\u201cI told Lydia I\u2019d pay her back but she said it wasn\u2019t that big a deal. It was, though, and she lost a lot of money because I was careless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasey,\u201d Alix said, \u201ceveryone makes mistakes. I made a big one this morning at the caf\u00e9 and my employer had an excellent excuse to let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do that was so bad?\u201d she asked as though it couldn\u2019t possibly have been as bad as what she\u2019d done. Alix wasn\u2019t keen on proclaiming her stupidity. \u201cI forgot the sugar in the cinnamon rolls. I bake them practically every morning and today I just left it out and the whole batch was ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid everyone get mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but those ingredients cost money, and then there\u2019s also the time involved. Ms. Adams could\u2019ve f ired me, with good reason.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t, and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>Casey sat up a little straighter. \u201cSo, like you said, everyone makes mistakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. What\u2019s important is the lessons we learn from them. You were telling me Lydia showed you where she kept the larger casserole dish so you\u2019d know which one to use next time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when you decide to cook again, you\u2019ll use the bigger dish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Lesson learned.\u201d</p><p>Casey gave her a wry smile and shrugged. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t like cleaning ovens. It\u2019s hard work, even if the oven\u2019s supposed to be self-cleaning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is precisely my point,\u201d Alix said. \u201cJordan always says that failure offers us an opportunity to learn and to grow.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThe trick is not to make the same mistake twice.\u201d From experience, including that week\u2019s baking calamities, Alix knew it was a lot easier said than done.</p><p>Casey brightened. \u201cIf I ever put price stickers on yarn again, I\u2019ll double-check to make sure the right price is on the right skein.\u201d</p><p>Alix patted the other girl\u2019s shoulder. \u201cExactly. See what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCody makes mistakes, too. Only they aren\u2019t as big as mine.\u201d</p><p>Casey said with a half smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s younger than you. The mistakes get bigger as we get older.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Casey agreed. \u201cBreaking a glass when he\u2019s setting the table isn\u2019t as bad as ruining a whole dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart for a kid,\u201d Alix teased. Gripping the chain with both hands, Casey started to swing higher. \u201cI feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d For that matter, so did Alix.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019ll make a great mom.\u201d</p><p>Great mom. Great mom. The words repeated themselves in Alix\u2019s mind like a chant\u2014or a prayer. \u201cYou think so?\u201d she asked, unable to disguise her uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Casey pushed herself higher on the swing. \u201cLydia told me you\u2019re quitting cigarettes so you and Jordan can get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Unable to respond because of the lump clogging her throat, Alix simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered when she could speak again. Agreat mom. Casey couldn\u2019t have known how profoundly those words had affected her.</p> <p>Their short conversation was the turning point in Alix\u2019s day. When she returned to work, she went to see Winter immediately.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d her employer asked, looking up from her computer.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you for letting me keep my job,\u201d Alix said.</p><p>\u201cI love working here and I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re willing to forgive my crappy mood.\u201d</p><p>Winter smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Alix. Except for this week, you\u2019ve been a wonderful employee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to change,\u201d Alix told her fervently. That afternoon, Alix could hardly wait to get home. On the bus ride, she tapped her foot nervously, the events of the afternoon tumbling through her mind. Once she got to the lake house, she picked fresh lettuce from their small garden patch and made a Cobb salad, a favorite of Jordan\u2019s. When she\u2019d f inished preparing the salad, she put it in the refrigerator, then set the table outside. After that, she lay in the hammock with a book and fell asleep in the late-afternoon sunshine, waiting for Jordan.</p><p>The sound of the front door opening woke her. For a moment she was disoriented and then she knew\u2014her husband was home.</p><p>\u201cAlix?\u201d Jordan called out.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d Alix rushed into the house toward him, catapulting herself into his arms. Before he could say a word, she spread eager kisses across his face, her lips moving from his eyes and cheeks and nose before settling on his lips.</p><p>Jordan grabbed her by the waist and staggered backward until he was leaning against the kitchen wall.</p><p>Alix wrapped her legs around his and hungrily kissed him again. She lifted her head and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this all about?\u201d Jordan asked, his voice rough with longing. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a good mother. A great one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he said without hesitation. He supported the back of her head and returned her mouth to his for another series of deep, soul-f illed kisses.</p><p>She gasped when the last kiss ended. Her lips remained close to his, so that she breathed his breath and he breathed hers. He kissed her again, then asked, \u201cWhat happened to convince you?\u201d</p><p>Alix pressed her head to his shoulder. \u201cDo you want to talk all night or do you want to make a baby?\u201d</p><p>Jordan chuckled and scooped her up, Alix\u2019s arms around his neck. As he started toward their bedroom, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous question if I ever heard one,\u201d and her laughter joined his.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>Anne Marie Roche</p><p>Ellen\u2019s cast had been on for nearly a week and Tim had come by every afternoon to check on her. Vanessa hadn\u2019t accompanied him even once, which was just as well, considering the scene at the hospital. Anne Marie avoided mentioning the other woman\u2019s name and so did Tim.</p><p>Ellen\u2019s arm had stopped hurting and she thrived on the extra attention. Anne Marie had to ask Tim to stop bringing gifts. Ellen had so many stuffed animals now, there was no space in her bedroom for more.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will my dad be here?\u201d Ellen asked, bounding down the stairs with Baxter at her heels. She swung the leash in one hand.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know you have a hot date?\u201d</p><p>The urge to roll her eyes was nearly overwhelming. Barbie and Mark had arranged for her to meet a friend of Mark\u2019s; Barbie had made the mistake of referring to the evening as a \u201chot date\u201d in Ellen\u2019s presence. Ellen, of course, had picked up on the term and used it ever since.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him where I was going, no,\u201d Anne Marie said. When she\u2019d told him she had an appointment Friday evening, Tim had quickly offered to stay with Ellen. Foolishly, perhaps, Anne Marie had accepted. Her mother would gladly have had Ellen over for the night, but that would\u2019ve entailed driving. It was simpler this way.</p><p>Tim genuinely loved Ellen. If Anne Marie had ever doubted that, he\u2019d proved his feelings for the child the day Ellen broke her arm. He\u2019d been as pale as a bleached sheet when he realized what had happened and he\u2019d blamed himself. He\u2019d been vigilant, almost excessively so, ever since.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell him?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Anne Marie hesitated, preferring he not be told where she was going. It wasn\u2019t any of his business.</p><p>\u201cTell who what?\u201d Barbie asked as she stepped into the bookstore. Mark followed in his wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cMy dad,\u201d Ellen said.</p><p>\u201cTim\u2019s staying with Ellen while I\u2019m out this evening,\u201d Anne Marie explained.</p><p>\u201cOn a hot date,\u201d her daughter added with emphasis on the hot. She attached the leash to Baxter\u2019s collar and after hugging both Barbie and Mark, shot out the door, taking Baxter for his afternoon stroll down Blossom Street.</p><p>\u201cHot date, huh?\u201d Mark said once Ellen was halfway down the block.</p><p>Anne Marie pretended to be upset with him. \u201cThat\u2019s what she calls it, thanks to you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait till you meet Mel,\u201d Barbie said with a wink. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful\u2014smart, funny and sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>Mark glared up at Barbie. \u201cHe\u2019s not that sexy.\u201d</p><p>Barbie\u2019s smile lit up her eyes. \u201cMark, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>At that Barbie laughed outright. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>They gazed at each other, exchanging some private message, and slowly a grin slid into place. \u201cMaybe not,\u201d he murmured in a low, husky voice.</p><p>Barbie bent and kissed his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason for complaint, sir\u2014and I don\u2019t think you do, either.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Mark who winked. \u201cYour point is well taken, madam.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie laughed. She loved the banter between these two. Barbie and Mark somehow brought out the best in each other. According to what she\u2019d heard, he\u2019d been surly and downright rude when he and Barbie originally met\u2014at the movies, of all places. The f irst time Anne Marie had met him was in a fastfood restaurant and it was plain, at least to her, that Mark was in love with Barbie. She suspected he\u2019d fought the attraction as long as he could, then simply surrendered to the sheer force of Barbie\u2019s personality.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come to give you a few tips,\u201d Barbie announced. Mark, however, seemed more interested in studying a selection of mysteries, which were displayed on a table close to the front of the store.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of tips?\u201d Anne Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cDating tips, of course!\u201d</p><p>Mark set aside Sue Grafton\u2019s T is for Trespass and glanced up.</p><p>\u201cThis is all Barbie\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately the bookstore was empty. Anne Marie would hate having customers privy to this conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you dated, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her last supposed date had been with Tim, when he\u2019d dropped the bombshell about Vanessa. The memory of their evening together still embarrassed her.</p><p>In retrospect, she should\u2019ve noticed the signs; she\u2019d made the mistake of assuming Tim was interested in her just because she was enthralled with him. To her, it\u2019d been like linking two pieces of puzzle and f inding they f it perfectly. No, not two pieces, three. Tim and Ellen and her...the fantasy of a family.</p><p>\u201cIt has been a while,\u201d Anne Marie agreed.</p><p>\u201cThe rules have changed,\u201d Barbie said with authority. Anne Marie turned to Mark for guidance. He, however, was back to exploring the mystery and thriller titles. He held Brad Meltzer\u2019s latest and was studying the cover. Seeing that he wasn\u2019t going to be any help, she sighed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cForget what those dating books tell you. Just be yourself,\u201d Barbie advised.</p><p>\u201cI know Mel\u2019s a widower, but does he have children?\u201d That was a subject she felt she could discuss. Knowing they shared common ground would be a great starting point.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re grown and married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is this guy, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAge is a matter of attitude,\u201d Barbie insisted. Anne Marie groaned. \u201cOh, come on, Barbie.\u201d</p><p>Barbie relented. \u201cHe\u2019s not that old. In his f ifties.\u201d</p><p>Robert\u2019s age, Anne Marie mused. Her husband had died of a heart attack far too young; he\u2019d been in his f ifties, too. Even now, it was hard to believe he was dead.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye Anne Marie saw that Louis, her new part-time employee, had come in. He was a student at UW and worked evenings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Mel and I won\u2019t have a problem f inding things to talk about,\u201d Anne Marie told her friend. He\u2019d lost his wife a year ago and Robert had been gone more than two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t,\u201d Barbie said, taking a Vogue magazine from the rack and leaf ing through it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen, I wish I could chat longer, but I need to go and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear something bright and cheerful,\u201d Barbie told her.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Anne Marie didn\u2019t bother to say she\u2019d already planned to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re meeting at the restaurant, correct?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d Anne Marie conf irmed. She wanted it that way, despite Barbie and Mark\u2019s assurances that Mel would be happy to pick her up.</p><p>She hugged Barbie and pecked Mark on the cheek, then headed upstairs to change clothes for her \u201chot date.\u201d</p><p>By the time she\u2019d f inished, Ellen and Baxter had returned. Ellen stared at her. \u201cYou look really pretty.\u201d</p><p>That comment pleased Anne Marie, and she glanced at the hallway mirror. She wanted to make a positive f irst impression and had chosen her outf it carefully. She wore white linen pants with a pale yellow shell under a white blazer. Even to her own critical eye, she looked good.</p><p>She\u2019d taken as long to decide on the jewelry\u2014an antique cameo on a gold chain\u2014as the clothes themselves. She\u2019d had her hair done earlier in the day; she\u2019d needed a haircut, anyway, so she\u2019d timed it to coincide with her date.</p> <p>A knock at the back door told her Tim had arrived. Ellen let him in. \u201cWhat did you bring me, what did you bring me?\u201d she asked, jumping up and down.</p><p>This was exactly the behavior Anne Marie wanted to put a stop to. Ellen had become a little too accustomed to his frequent gifts.</p><p>\u201cDinner.\u201d Tim set a white bag on the kitchen table. He did a double-take when he saw Anne Marie. \u201cYou look fabulous. What\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She ignored the question and drank in the appreciation shining in his eyes. Ellen gladly supplied the news. \u201cMom\u2019s got a hot date.\u201d</p><p>Tim\u2019s smile faded. \u201cYou\u2019re going out? I thought you had an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. It\u2019s an appointment for dinner.\u201d She didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to explain any more than she already had. Tim didn\u2019t keep her updated on his relationship with Vanessa.</p> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d he murmured, but he didn\u2019t ask any further questions.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be late...I don\u2019t think,\u201d she said as she retrieved her purse and her car keys.</p><p>\u201cTen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but to be on the safe side let\u2019s say eleven. If I\u2019m going to be any later, I\u2019ll phone.\u201d She probably would anyway, just to check up on Ellen, whose arm still hurt at night.</p><p>\u201cTake as long as you want,\u201d Tim said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be home at any particular time?\u201d</p><p>Tim shook his head. \u201cNone.\u201d He opened the door. \u201cHave a nice evening.\u201d His gaze held hers and his words seemed sincere.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Anne Marie kissed Ellen, gave her f inal instructions, then left the apartment. Mel turned out to be everything Barbie and Mark had promised. To begin with, he was distinguished-looking, dressed in a classy suit and tie, and sexy in that Sean Connery way she found so attractive. Like Mark, he was an architect. Their dinner conversation didn\u2019t lag even once; they discovered in short order that they shared the same political views, enjoyed many of the same movies and authors, and were both Placido Domingo fans.</p> <p>The evening passed so quickly that Anne Marie was startled to see it was after ten.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d she said as she reached for her purse. \u201cI need to check on my daughter.\u201d She paused, not wanting to appear rude. Mel gestured with his hand. \u201cGo ahead, by all means.\u201d</p><p>Tim answered on the second ring and immediately reassured Anne Marie. \u201cEverything went great. Ellen\u2019s been asleep for over an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say her prayers?\u201d</p><p>Tim chuckled. \u201cOh, yes. Does it generally go on as long as it did this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes?\u201d The child took her prayers seriously.</p><p>\u201cLonger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI f igured as much.\u201d No doubt Ellen had been hoping to impress her father.</p><p>\u201cShe prayed for you,\u201d Tim informed her. \u201cShe seems to think you\u2019re going to marry your, uh, hot date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting. And how did she feel about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed okay with it.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie smiled across the table at Mel.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think you\u2019ll be back?\u201d Tim was asking.</p><p>\u201cIn about half an hour.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to continue a conversation with Tim while she was with her date, so she ended the call. \u201cSee you then.\u201d She dropped the cell back in her bag. They f inished the last of their coffee, and then Anne Marie regretfully said she\u2019d have to go. Mel walked her to her car, one hand lightly clasping her elbow. It was a gesture both protective and respectful, and it reminded her suddenly of Robert.</p><p>\u201cThank you for a lovely evening,\u201d she said. \u201cI really enjoyed meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible to see you again?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward to kiss her cheek. \u201cI haven\u2019t dated since Laura died, and...well, meeting you has been a very pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>It had been for Anne Marie, as well.</p><p>As she drove home, a relaxed, comfortable feeling stole over her. She\u2019d agreed to this date because of Tim. Her attraction to him had shown her that she\u2019d healed enough to enter into a new relationship. It\u2019d led to an embarrassing situation but she\u2019d recovered from that. One thing was certain: She wasn\u2019t going to make any assumptions about Mel. Like her, he still carried the pain of having lost a spouse. That loss would never entirely leave either of them.</p><p>Tim was f lipping through a copy of The New Yorker when she walked into the apartment. As soon as he saw her, he threw down the magazine.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, standing, \u201chow did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she told him, then amended her statement. \u201cActually, it went really well. I like Mel.\u201d</p><p>Tim nodded, sliding his hands into his back jean pockets.</p><p>\u201cThank you for staying with Ellen. My mother said she\u2019d watch her, but I hated to drag Ellen over there. She still wakes up once or twice a night because her arm aches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, but he seemed reluctant to leave.</p><p>\u201cAnything I can get you?\u201d she asked, taking off her linen jacket.</p><p>\u201cA cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She moved into the kitchen and brewed a small pot, f illing two cups. \u201cHow do you take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack.\u201d She recalled that but didn\u2019t want to seem presumptuous\u2014</p><p>or interested enough to notice.</p><p>Tim was already sitting at the kitchen table, his elbows propped on a place mat. Anne Marie handed him the coffee, then sat across from him, waiting for him to speak.</p><p>Eventually he did. \u201cI thought you should know I\u2019m no longer seeing Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe recently had a second slip. She got drunk.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie nodded; she remembered he\u2019d mentioned the first time this had happened.</p><p>\u201cOnce I could forgive, but when I found out she\u2019d been drinking again, I told her it was over. I can\u2019t expose Ellen to that, and Vanessa\u2019s behavior the afternoon Ellen broke her arm was inexcusable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I played a role in this,\u201d Anne Marie felt obliged to say.</p><p>Tim ignored that. \u201cVanessa has to accept responsibility for her own actions, the same way we all do.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie reached across the table and touched his arm. \u201cI know this must be hard on you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sad smile. \u201cI\u2019d planned to tell you this earlier in the evening, about Vanessa and me.\u201d He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Clearly there was more.</p><p>\u201cAnd suggest the two of us start dating,\u201d he said. \u201cI never did have a good sense of timing,\u201d he added with a rueful laugh. He couldn\u2019t have shocked her more. \u201cThe two of...us?\u201d She\u2019d put the matter so completely out of her mind, she hardly knew how to react.</p><p>\u201cWould you consider it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI...yes, I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she said, still in a daze. Tim took a single sip of his coffee, then got to his feet. Anne Marie walked him to the door.</p><p>As they reached it, he turned back. \u201cMaybe this will help,\u201d he said and before she realized what he was going to do, he pressed his mouth to hers. The kiss was tender and persuasive, so persuasive that her knees felt as if they might buckle.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Anne Marie,\u201d he whispered in a voice that didn\u2019t sound like his.</p><p>He left, and Anne Marie leaned against the door, eyes wide with shock...and pleasure. This was a most unexpected turn of events.</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>Watching a complex stitch pattern grow as I knit silences the voice in my head that tells me to sweep the f loor.

I\u2019d tried to reach her, but the harder I tried the more she withdrew. This frustrated me to no end.</p><p>I had Saturday free, my f irst since the day we\u2019d rented bikes at Green Lake.

Brad, Cody and I had already had breakfast by the time Casey emerged from her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cMorning, beautiful,\u201d Brad said, smiling. He sat at the kitchen table, lingering over his coffee before he headed out to mow the lawn. During the summer he\u2019d started calling Casey beauti-ful and princess.</p><p>At f irst Casey had scowled and claimed she wasn\u2019t beautiful nor was she anyone\u2019s princess.

Just you and me.\u201d</p><p>Casey opened the cupboard and took out a box of cereal.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>Her wariness surprised me. I\u2019d f igured this would be one invitation she\u2019d jump at. What twelve-year-old girl didn\u2019t want to visit the mall?</p><p>\u201cDo you need a reason to shop?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shrugged, but I could see that, despite herself, her interest was piqued.</p><p>\u201cI need to get Cody some jeans for school and a new winter coat.

I always felt a bit guilty buying a cake when it was so easy to bake one, but ice cream was the perfect summertime dessert. Casey sat in the living room waiting for me. She held a small paper bag and although I was curious, I didn\u2019t ask what it contained. Nor did she tell me.</p><p>\u201cCan we see Grandma Hoffman f irst?\u201d she asked when I\u2019d backed the car out of the garage and onto the street.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s f ine.\u201d The assisted living complex wasn\u2019t far from the mall.</p><p>We parked, and Casey was out of the car before I could even unfasten my seat belt. I hurried to catch up with her. Casey\u2019s eagerness was quite a contrast to Cody\u2019s discomfort. He\u2019d been to visit my mother any number of times, but he quickly grew bored. After ten or f ifteen minutes he was ready to leave. I hadn\u2019t phoned ahead and hoped we wouldn\u2019t be interrupting anything. I found Mom sitting in front of the television, watching the Food Channel as usual. She had a pen and pad in hand and seemed to be trying to write down the instructions. I hadn\u2019t seen her do that in some time. Over the past few years, she\u2019d f illed several spiral-bound notebooks with carefully detailed recipes, but she hadn\u2019t done it recently. Often, when we spoke on the phone, it was about these wonderful cooks and the recipes they\u2019d demonstrated on television. Mom had always enjoyed making family dinners, and it hurt me that this small joy had been taken away from her.</p><p>When Casey and I entered the apartment, Mom\u2019s eyes brightened, then immediately dimmed. I realized she\u2019d forgotten Casey\u2019s name, although she obviously recognized her face.</p> <p>\u201cCasey and I thought we\u2019d stop by for a quick visit,\u201d I said, mentioning her name so Mom wouldn\u2019t need to ask.</p><p>\u201cCasey,\u201d Mom repeated, stretching out her hand. Casey plopped down on the f loor, sitting cross-legged next to Mom\u2019s chair. She took her hand. \u201cI brought you a gift,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Casey bobbed her head. \u201cWe made them at day camp this summer and I want you to have it so you\u2019ll remember me.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s pleasure was undeniable as she reached for the bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat could it be?\u201d she asked pensively.</p><p>Casey knelt in front of her as she opened the plain brown sack. Inside was a photograph of Casey wearing a baseball cap, with her arm around Cody\u2019s neck. They were smiling into the camera. The picture was set inside a plastic canvas frame into which Casey had woven blue and teal yarn.</p><p>To my utter amazement my mother blinked back tears. \u201cHow nice,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s got a magnet on the back so you can stick it on your fridge,\u201d Casey explained, turning it over so Mom could see. I don\u2019t think she noticed how emotional my mother had become or, if she did, Casey chose to pretend otherwise. \u201cWould you like me to put it on the fridge for you?\u201d</p><p>Mom nodded. When Casey moved into the kitchen, Mom dabbed at her eyes with the handkerchief she always tucked in her sweater pocket.</p><p>\u201cThat was a lovely thing to do,\u201d I said, joining Casey in the kitchen. I put my arm around her shoulders but I could tell she didn\u2019t want me touching her, so I quickly let go.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind that I gave it to Grandma Hoffman rather than you?\u201d she asked a little anxiously.</p><p>I assured her I didn\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely photo and you can see how much it means to my mother.\u201d</p><p>For the f irst time in what seemed like weeks Casey gave me a genuine smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss everyone... I think your mom\u2019s so nice. And she\u2019s funny. I never had a grandma before, and well...I wanted her to have something to remember me by.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t stay much longer; it was getting close to Mom\u2019s lunch and after that she\u2019d nap for an hour or two. Once we got to the mall, our f irst stop was the Sears store, where I traditionally purchased Cody\u2019s school clothes. I\u2019d read their two-page advertisement that morning and noticed that all boys\u2019 jeans were on sale.</p><p>\u201cYou should buy him this shirt, too,\u201d Casey said, holding up an olive-green T-shirt with some monster character printed on the front.</p><p>Cody had been wearing mostly shirts in primary colors. He was long past the stage where he wanted to wear anything with Disney characters, but I wasn\u2019t really familiar with any appropriate alternatives.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d like that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d love it,\u201d Casey said conf idently.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Put it on the stack.\u201d</p><p>Casey did and then glanced at another one.</p><p>\u201cDo you see anything else he might like?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cLots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they on sale, too?\u201d</p><p>Casey pointed at the sign. Fifty percent off. Together we chose three other shirts and one good pair of pants and a button-down shirt for church. She picked out a winter coat, although it wasn\u2019t anything I would\u2019ve selected.</p><p>Cody was growing like a well-watered plant and I suspected that by Christmas he\u2019d need a size larger in jeans. Yet with so many sales and such reasonable prices, it was hard not to go overboard now. We paid for our purchases, and I suggested we go to the teen department to buy something for Casey.</p><p>Casey didn\u2019t seem to like the idea. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need new clothes for school, too,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my stuff later. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>The attitude was back and I didn\u2019t know why. \u201cCasey, you don\u2019t have to buy your clothes secondhand.\u201d</p><p>Bored, she glanced away. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s at least f ind you a pair of jeans, okay?\u201d</p><p>Anyone looking at her disgruntled expression would think I was punishing her, and yet I knew she enjoyed shopping. While picking out clothes for Cody she\u2019d been interested, even excited. She was good at it, too.</p><p>Despite her protests I managed to buy her one new pair of jeans. She rejected everything else. I didn\u2019t understand it. As we ate at the food court I talked about how pleased my mother had been with her gift and gradually Casey\u2019s mood started to improve. On the way back to the house we went to the local ice cream parlor, where I\u2019d ordered the cake. By the time we returned home, the lawn had been mowed. Through my open window I breathed in the distinctive, pungent scent of fresh grass, which brought back immediate memories of childhood summers. When I\u2019d parked, Casey carried in our purchases and I put the cake inside the garage freezer. Brad and Cody had gathered around the table as Casey proudly showed off our bargains. \u201cWow, this is cool,\u201d Cody said, holding up the olive green T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cCasey chose that for you,\u201d I said, and we exchanged a smile.</p><p>\u201cTake her shopping with you all the time, Mom.\u201d Cody pulled off his old shirt and immediately slipped the new one over his head, muff ling his last few words.</p><p>Casey looked down at the f loor. \u201cI won\u2019t be here,\u201d she said. Brad turned to me and then to Cody. We both nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, you will,\u201d Brad said softly.</p><p>Casey jerked her head up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want you to live with us,\u201d Cody blurted out. \u201cMom and Dad and I talked it over, and we want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>Casey didn\u2019t seem to believe him. \u201cI can stay here as your foster kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Casey. We want you to be our daughter, part of our family,\u201d I said, my voice cracking with emotion. \u201cBrad and I want to adopt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want you for my big sister,\u201d Cody added, refusing to be left out. \u201cI didn\u2019t like you when you came here. I was supposed to be the oldest when they adopted \u2019nother kid.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cBut, you know, it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to have a big sister.\u201d</p><p>Casey just stared at us.</p><p>\u201cWould adopting you be all right?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou mean it?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, as though testing us to see if this was some cruel hoax. Brad and Cody nodded vigorously.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a trick, is it?\u201d Her eyes implored me and then Brad before she swiveled around to look at Cody.</p><p>\u201cNo, Casey, we mean it,\u201d I said. \u201cWe love you and want you to be with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever and ever,\u201d Cody chimed in.</p><p>I saw tears form in Casey\u2019s eyes. In all the weeks she\u2019d been with us, I\u2019d never seen her cry. Not once. She\u2019d been terribly upset the day she\u2019d heard from her brother but if she\u2019d cried, she hadn\u2019t let anyone see. Emotion came to her so tentatively that when I saw how affected she was, my own eyes f illed with tears. I gave her a watery smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we got the ice cream cake,\u201d Cody explained happily. \u201cThat\u2019s why Aunt Margaret and Uncle Matt are coming over tonight with Hailey and Julia.\u201d</p><p>Casey gulped back a sob and covered her mouth with both hands.</p><p>I reached for her, almost fearing she\u2019d push me away as she so often had in the past. But Casey moved willingly into my arms and leaned her head against me, her shoulders shaking with sobs.</p><p>\u201cWe love you, Casey,\u201d I whispered through the tightness in my own throat.</p><p>\u201cI...love you, too\u2014all of you,\u201d she choked out. I murmured quiet endearments as she clung to me and I to her.</p><p>\u201cI hoped...I didn\u2019t want to leave you and...\u201d She gulped between sobs.</p><p>\u201cThis is your home now,\u201d Brad told her, placing his arms around the two of us. Cody joined in, and I felt his small arm curl around my waist.</p><p>\u201cWe want to be your family,\u201d Cody said sweetly, \u201cokay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She hiccuped.</p><p>Family.</p><p>Casey might have come to us as an unexpected surprise, but she was in our hearts now and there she would stay.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>There is no life without knitting; every pattern on my needles presents an exotic challenge. My love for knitting is similar to my mother-in-law\u2019s infatuation with her soap operas. On her deathbed, she said to me, \u201cI don\u2019t mind dying, but could you put a TV in my coff in so I could see how my stories turn out?\u201d That\u2019s how I feel about knitting. Could I please have needles and lots of yarn in my coff in so I can see how my patterns turn out? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014Rita Weiss, www.creativepartnersllc.com</p><p>The adoption went through rapidly and with ease, thanks to Evelyn Boyle, who smoothed the process for us. Only a month had passed, and now Brad, Cody, Casey and I stood before a judge to make legal what had begun from almost the moment Casey had arrived in our home.</p><p>Evelyn was with us as the judge asked a few simple questions, then declared Casey Marie Goetz to be our daughter. The courtroom was respectfully quiet except for my sister, Margaret, who sat in the front row and wept like a baby. I was emotional myself, but managed to hold back the tears until the judge made his declaration. Then I sniff led and turned to throw my arms around Casey.</p><p>She remained dry-eyed. But what I read in my daughter was joy\u2014pure, profound joy. She hugged me back, squeezing hard in her enthusiasm. Then she hugged Brad and Cody and f inally, to everyone\u2019s astonishment, she spoke to the judge.</p> <p>\u201cWould it be all right if I hugged you, too?\u201d Casey asked, ready to bound up the steps.</p><p>At f irst the judge seemed taken aback. \u201cI\u2019ve never received such a request,\u201d he said formally. Then he grinned and added, \u201cI do believe I\u2019d like that very much.\u201d</p><p>Casey bolted up the steps and the judge stood and accepted her embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very fortunate girl,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, locking eyes with me.</p> <p>Margaret continued to wail in the background and I couldn\u2019t help it, I burst out laughing. So did Cody and Brad. You\u2019d think my sister was at a funeral instead of a celebration. I suddenly saw that Alix and Jordan were in the courtroom. I was touched that they\u2019d come, along with some of our other friends. Susannah from the f lower shop sat next to Alix, and of course Anne Marie and Ellen were there, too. As Brad, Cody, Casey and I paraded out of the courtroom, Margaret and Matt followed, with our friends trailing behind them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re treating everyone to lunch,\u201d Brad called out. \u201cIt isn\u2019t every day a man gains a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially one who can order off the adult menu,\u201d Casey told him smugly.</p><p>\u201cI want to order off the adult menu, too,\u201d Cody insisted. Someone suggested we go to Chinatown and as it happened, Brad knew a good restaurant that was on his UPS route. We\u2019d eaten there once, and I\u2019d found it delicious. And that way, everyone got to order from the adult menu.</p><p>As we left the courthouse, we ran into Hutch and Phoebe. To be honest, I\u2019d forgotten the \u201cCandy Man Trial,\u201d as it was being called in the media, was still going on.</p><p>\u201cWe won!\u201d Phoebe cried jubilantly. \u201cThe jury came back with their decision less than half an hour ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas there ever any doubt?\u201d Hutch asked, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Phoebe said to Hutch. She turned to me. \u201cI wish you could\u2019ve seen Clark\u2019s face when I walked into the courtroom this afternoon. He assumed I was there for him. \u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been following the case in the news and getting updates from the local TV station. In my view, Clark Snowden, the plaintiff \u2019s attorney, was exceedingly full of himself. He seemed to pose for the camera and struck me as both overconf ident and egotistical. Even if the case itself hadn\u2019t been so ridiculous, his attitude alone would have swayed my opinion. I knew from talk around the shop that others shared my feelings. I\u2019d recently learned how Phoebe was linked to Clark, so of course I\u2019d studied him on TV with avid interest.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe\u2019s presence shocked him,\u201d Hutch was saying. Her eyes gleamed with exhilaration. \u201cWhen I walked over and sat behind Hutch, Clark didn\u2019t know what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did once I told him you\u2019d agreed to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d I said, but I could see they were bursting with news from the trial and I was anxious to hear what had happened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you waited to show Clark your engagement ring until the recess\u2014otherwise I\u2019m betting the judge would\u2019ve expelled him.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe agreed with an exaggerated shudder. \u201cI thought he\u2019d start frothing at the mouth.\u201d She went from jubilation to a moment\u2019s sadness. \u201cI do feel bad for his father, though. This was yet another humiliation for Max. Clark\u2019s performance in the courtroom today was nothing to be proud of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, his closing argument was as weak as any I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Hutch said. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder the jury decided in my favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see anyone try and take my chocolates away,\u201d</p><p>Margaret said, stepping up to join us.</p><p>I would, too. Clark Snowden was a fool if he expected to come between a woman and her chocolate. Having seen both men in action during the trial snippets on TV, I was f irmly convinced that Phoebe had made a wise choice in Hutch. I loved seeing them together. They seemed a good match in so many ways, and I was thrilled to discover I\u2019d been right in my assumptions of a romance between them.</p><p>\u201cWe came over to tell you the news and congratulate you, too,\u201d</p><p>Hutch said. \u201cThis seems to be a day for celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Brad invited Hutch and Phoebe to join us for a celebratory lunch. Unfortunately, Susannah had to get back to the shop. When the rest of us entered the restaurant, Brad explained to Mr. Wong, the proprietor, why we were there. In short order we were ushered into a private room.</p><p>Mr. Wong said we wouldn\u2019t need menus, and before long, plates and chopsticks were distributed and tea was poured.</p><p>\u201cTo family.\u201d Brad offered a toast, lifting his teacup. Everyone around us raised theirs.</p><p>\u201cWe have an announcement,\u201d Jordan said, smiling fondly at Alix, who actually blushed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cJordan and I are having a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d everyone yelled.</p><p>\u201cTo enlarging families,\u201d Brad offered next.</p><p>\u201cWe have an announcement, too,\u201d Hutch said, taking Phoebe\u2019s right hand in his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant, too?\u201d Margaret asked, sounding shocked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Phoebe said with a laugh. \u201cBut I hope to be soon after Hutch and I are married. The wedding\u2019s in October.\u201d She held up her left hand to show off her diamond engagement ring.</p><p>\u201cCan I be the ring-bearer?\u201d Cody asked.</p><p>\u201cCody,\u201d I whispered, \u201cyou should wait to be asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! If Cody\u2019s the ring-bearer, can I be the f lower girl?\u201d</p><p>Ellen squealed.</p><p>\u201cEllen!\u201d Anne Marie said, obviously embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if I\u2019m not,\u201d the nine-year-old assured Phoebe. \u201cI want to be in another wedding, but if I\u2019m not in yours I\u2019ll be in Mom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Anne Marie\u2019s face reddened. \u201cEllen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your mother getting married?\u201d Brad asked in a teasing voice. Ellen blew on her tea and sipped it carefully. Then she nodded.</p><p>\u201cOnly we don\u2019t know who she\u2019s going to marry yet. There\u2019s my dad and then there\u2019s Mel. But I like my dad better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be a great idea for both of you to be in the wedding,\u201d Phoebe told the children. She spread out her arms to include everyone at the table. \u201cI want you all there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what? Our wedding cake\u2019s going to be chocolate,\u201d</p><p>Hutch said.</p><p>The group laughed.</p><p>The food started to arrive then, platter after platter brought by an entire staff of waiters. As the dishes were set on the table, I saw that Casey had gone very still. She sat next to me and I reached for her hand.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I leaned close to ask her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI was just wondering if I\u2019d always feel this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her free hand over her heart. \u201cHappy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cReally, really happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that happiness never leaves you,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>\u201cI belong,\u201d she said with such emotion that it was hard for me to swallow. \u201cI belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, slipping my arm around her shoulders. \u201cYou belong with us.\u201d</p><p>I shared my daughter\u2019s feeling. I\u2019d found belonging, too\u2014a husband, a home, a family. A whole world with all my friends on Blossom Street. </p> </body></html>"]
