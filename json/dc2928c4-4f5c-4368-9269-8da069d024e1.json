Now here I was, pawing through her things, finally free to explore her creepy old house. It wasn\u2019t personal, though\u2014I had barely known her. And the estate sale was probably her idea, anyway, one last attempt to infuriate her children.</p><p>The second I saw the sign, I had to stop. She had been surprisingly paranoid for a hospice patient, and I had never seen anything of her historic Victorian home beyond the downstairs bedroom where she had chosen to spend her remaining days. The chance to explore was just too interesting to pass up. Plus, I\u2019d said good-bye to most of my worldly possessions when I left Jeff , and I had an hour to kill until my next patient.</p><p>I was starting over from scratch and didn\u2019t have the money or the lifestyle for priceless antiques, but I always had room for treasure. Knickknacks, odd paintings, or costume jewelry would help liven up my empty apartment. Best of all, though, the sun-dappled attic upstairs was wall-to-wall books. For me, that was heaven.</p> <p>When I first saw the chain hanging from the top of the old tome, I didn\u2019t know what to think. I tugged it up. As the flat locket slid from between the pages, I got a little rush of excitement, like when pulling the prize out of a box of cereal. Sure, it was tarnished and grimy, but it was a prize nonetheless. Maybe my luck was finally changing.</p><p>I let the locket dangle in a sunbeam, charmed by its age and strangeness. I could picture it shining on some young lady\u2019s neck, part of an epic story full of romance and a Prince Charming who didn\u2019t turn out to be an overbearing, soul-sucking jerk. Not that I was bitter or anything. I just wanted to start over fresh, make that good-bye really mean something positive.</p><p>It\u2019s funny how a relationship can sneak up on you like that. It starts with a whirlwind courtship, dozens of roses and poetry and dancing. He buys you a toothbrush, gives you a drawer. You move in. You give in on little things, just to make him happy. The curtains. Your hair, which he thinks you should grow out. Then it\u2019s bigger things. The checkbook. Your job. And the one big-big thing, the baby that you lose, the gift he wasn\u2019t ready to give you. His relief at your pain kills something inside you, the hardest goodbye of all.</p><p>And then one day, you realize that you\u2019re basically a plaything and property to a man who\u2019s charmed you out of your pants and into the perfect wedding ring he had picked out before he even met you. That he\u2019s not making plans with you, he\u2019s making you fit into his plans, no matter what the cost. You realize that you\u2019ve become a paper doll with paper thoughts, that it was all too easy to give up control. And then one night, he hits you, and you pull your dignity off the floor and kick the bastard to the curb.</p><p>You say good-bye. And then you leave. And then you get somewhere else and learn how to say hello again.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said to the locket, trying it out.</p><p>Just looking at it made me happy in a way I had forgotten. A feeling of hope, of indulgence. I\u2019d forgotten how good it felt to choose something for myself, to see an object and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to make that mine.\u201d</p><p>It was pretty in such a Gothic, old-fashioned way. One side had a large, flat stone\u2014maybe a ruby or maybe just glass. And the other side of the oval had indecipherable writing around the edge with a compass rose in the center. I breathed on the metal and rubbed it on my scrub pants, but its secrets remained safe under eons of muck.</p><p>Just as I was about to head downstairs to pay for the locket, a little old lady appeared at my elbow and said, \u201cExcuse me, miss. Can you read this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be glad to try,\u201d I said with a smile.</p><p>She handed me a crusty old saltcellar, and I read the smudged grease-pencil price. I was like a magnet for old people. Maybe because I was accustomed to helping them at work. Maybe because I looked kind. Or maybe because every time I looked at an elderly person, I thought of my grandmother and couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p> <p>Taking care of my grandmother was one of my greatest joys and greatest sorrows. I got to be with her and help her, take care of all of the nursing tasks that she would be mortified to impose on a stranger. But I also had to watch her die, and it broke my heart. With my mom gone and my dad remarried across the country, she was all the family I had. The hours I spent with her every day were precious to me, and I couldn\u2019t believe how much time I had lost with her by wasting time with Jeff in Birmingham.</p><p>This old lady had the same sort of fire that made my grandmother special, a mix of manners and moxie that I hoped I had inherited. Watching her eyes narrow at the offending saltcellar reminded me of going antiques shopping with Nana when I was little, popping jelly beans one by one as she haggled. Still, I didn\u2019t have much time until I was expected at Mr. Rathbin\u2019s house, and after that, I had four more hospice patients waiting. Old people get really cranky when you\u2019re late.</p><p>I was just opening my mouth to apologize and slip away when my beeper went off. It was my case manager, followed by 911.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said, rushing past the surprised old woman and down the narrow staircase.</p><p>\u201cMust be a doctor,\u201d I heard her remark to someone else before I was out of earshot.</p><p>Coulda, woulda, shoulda, I thought, remembering the night that Jeff tore up my applications to medical school and threw them into the trash. Then I corrected myself.</p><p>I can still be a doctor if I want to. Nothing\u2019s stopping me, dammit. I can be anything and anyone I want to be. No one\u2019s going to tell me what to be ever again.</p><p>Back in my car, I reached into my pocket for my cell phone to call the office. Instead, I found the locket. Staring at it, I reminded myself that I was not a thief, that I had never stolen anything in my life ... on purpose.</p> <p>But something I couldn\u2019t explain kept me from going back inside and making things right. The busy woman running the estate sale probably didn\u2019t even know the locket existed. And the recently deceased Mrs. Stein wouldn\u2019t miss it. There wasn\u2019t a price on it. Still, I couldn\u2019t help imagining police cars with blinking lights surrounding my little sedan in the driveway as officers with guns ordered me to put my hands up. So much of the last three years of my life had been based on fear.</p><p>I tugged the chain over my head and pulled my long dark hair out from under it. I couldn\u2019t help giving myself a sly grin in the pull-down mirror. The locket was heavy, and it hung exactly over my heart, much lower than most of my necklaces. I tucked it under my T-shirt and scrub top, enjoying the dull weight against my skin and wondering what sort of metal lurked under the tarnish. Maybe once it was cleaned, I could have the chain shortened.</p><p>Or maybe I\u2019d keep it a secret, just because I could.</p><p>2</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this thing made of\u2014Kryptonite?\u201d I muttered to myself. \u201cIt\u2019s useless.\u201d</p><p>Nana didn\u2019t even glance up from her crossword puzzle to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s useless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting this locket clean. I\u2019ve tried everything under your sink. It\u2019s making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the array of cleaners and scrubby things cluttering the kitchen table. I\u2019d tried them all. Up next: a jack-hammer.</p><p>One corner of her mouth twitched up, and the other puckered down. \u201cTish, honey, please tell me you didn\u2019t just put bleach on a valuable piece of antique jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cLordy loo, sugar,\u201d she said from her wheelchair, her face all crumpled up like a dried-out apple. \u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin it. You have to be careful with old things. Show some respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you recommend?\u201d I asked her. If she didn\u2019t have a good old Southern recipe for hope, no one did.</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cTake it to a jewelry store tomorrow, before you muck it up. You\u2019re too impetuous. Have you opened it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been too busy trying to clean it to see what\u2019s inside,\u201d I said. To be honest, though, I was saving that for later, when I was alone. I wanted to savor it, keep it my own little secret.</p><p>When she turned back to her crossword, I tried the bleach one more time, just in case. In the silence of my scrubbing, I heard it. The sound I hated most. Nana\u2019s labored breathing. She was having a tough night, but she wouldn\u2019t admit it. I had arranged it so she was the last call on my rounds, so that I would always have plenty of time for her. I logged all of my nursing duties, making sure she had her chemo meds and antinausea drugs. And after that, I heated up her dinner, helped her tie the scarf around what was left of her hair, and tucked her into bed. She couldn\u2019t climb into it anymore on her own, and she hated that.</p><p>\u201cDo you need more Demerol, Nana?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>Her mouth turned down again, and her eyes narrowed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need any more, thank you very much, missy,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you go telling me how I feel.\u201d She\u2019d been prickly after the latest relapse. We had thought she was in remission, but apparently, her cancer thought the third time was the charm.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to be comfortable,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be me than be doped up,\u201d she said, fire in her eyes. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have much time left, you\u2019re darned tootin\u2019 I\u2019m going to spend it awake and raising heck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s bedtime, Nana,\u201d I said with a soft laugh. \u201cYou need your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who needs it, sugar,\u201d she said. \u201cOld bones don\u2019t sleep so easy. Now, why don\u2019t you get me ready so you can go out and enjoy being young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-five,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s not very young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eighty-four,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be young for both of us. Go to a party, or whatever it is you do. Go meet a nice young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for that,\u201d I said.</p><p>The last nice young man I\u2019d met had nearly broken me. I wasn\u2019t ready to be tied down again. And I wasn\u2019t ready to share what was left of myself yet, either.</p><p>I thought about it as I went through our nightly ritual. Thought about bars and bookstores, online dating, handing out little cards to attractive men. None of it was appealing. And it wasn\u2019t as if I was going to meet any eligible bachelors at work. All of my patients were older than seventy except one, who was thirty and a vegetable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I pulled the covers over my grandmother\u2019s shrunken arms and bloated stomach, I gave her my brightest smile. I made sure she had her remote controls, her crossword book and pen, her cordless phone, and her \u201cI\u2019ve fallen, and I can\u2019t get up\u201d button.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Nana. I\u2019ll see you in the morning. I love you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cQuit saying that like it\u2019s the last time you\u2019re going to say it,\u201d she said peevishly. \u201cSomebody besides me has to pretend I\u2019ll live forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live forever,\u201d I said. \u201cUntil I\u2019m as old as you are, and then you\u2019ll finally teach me how to make your famous chocolate pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d be back at her house at eight in the morning to help her out of bed and into her remote-control wheelchair. She could do almost everything else for herself and didn\u2019t want to give up her independence and move into a home. I was happy to help. After I had left Jeff, she was the first one I called, standing at a pay phone, crying in the freezing cold. I\u2019d left my cell phone behind, not wanting to give him a way to find me.</p><p>\u201cJust come home, Tish,\u201d she had said. \u201cUs Everett women can get through anything. Just come home.\u201d</p><p>And I had. I\u2019d lived with her for a few weeks before she offered to give me money for the deposit on my apartment. I was touched that she understood how much I needed space of my own, space to find myself. I was broke, and she\u2019d called it an early inheritance. Since then, we\u2019d anchored each other and developed a friendly, loving relationship with only one rule: we never talked about her illness or my past.</p> <p>Driving home, I browsed through my CD case. Sure, I had an iPod full of music, but it was all stuff Jeff had picked out, things we had listened to together. I wanted my old favorites, songs that made me feel powerful and pretty and wild and young. The sort of music Jeff had called immature and part of the \u201cold Tish.\u201d I rolled down my windows to the balmy spring night and sang at the top of my lungs, loving the wind in my hair and the thump of the locket against my heart in time with the drums. He wouldn\u2019t have liked that, either. Would have asked me, with that plaintive voice, if I didn\u2019t prefer the diamonds he had given me.</p><p>Nope. That\u2019s why I\u2019d dumped them down the garbage disposal on my way out and flicked the switch.</p><p>Back at my little apartment, I felt lighthearted for the first time in a long time. As if taking the locket had soothed me, become another choice that further defined who I was. I liked loud music. I took care of my grandmother. I had a good book and a rescued cat named Mr.Surly. I was having cheese toast and tomato soup for dinner. And I had stolen an antique locket from my dead patient\u2019s attic.</p><p>As I undressed and put on my pajamas, my eyes didn\u2019t leave the locket\u2019s reflection in the dresser mirror. I didn\u2019t want to take it off. There was something exciting about it, about having something I wasn\u2019t supposed to have.</p><p>It was time to open it. I felt around the edge opposite the hinge but couldn\u2019t find a clasp. Then I tried to work it open with my fingers, but it didn\u2019t budge. I went to the bathroom and tried to use a nail file to pry it open like an oyster, but it was very unwilling to produce its pearl. Mr. Surly watched me from the counter, tail twitching. He seemed amused.</p><p>With a weary sigh, I waggled my fingers at it and said, \u201cLocket, reveal thy secrets!\u201d</p> <p>Of course, that didn\u2019t work. That sort of thing never does.</p><p>I ran my fingers over it. There had to be a way. Then I pressed the jewel on the front, and the locket popped open.</p><p>I gasped as red liquid burst from inside, splattering my hand with scarlet drops.</p><p>Whatever it was, it burned, and I dropped the locket onto the counter, where it spun for a second, scattering a constellation of red on the bathroom counter.</p><p>I ran my hand under the cold water. The stains stopped burning but didn\u2019t wash away. I lathered up with antibacterial soap, but they didn\u2019t budge, so I got out the nail brush. Looking up at the mirror, I saw myself standing there in a ragged tank top and baggy pajama pants, scrubbing my hand until it was raw and pink. The stains seemed somehow brighter, so I gave up.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, what sort of ancient prankster filled a locket with staining red acid and then hid it in a book? It was its own antitheft device.</p><p>The locket lay innocently on the bathroom counter amid more pesky red spots. No point in scrubbing those right now.</p><p>Then I looked closer and noticed that the red drops had made tiny pockmarks in the granite. Little red holes, eaten into solid rock. I ran my finger over them, puzzled. It didn\u2019t make sense\u2014I should have been full of holes, too. But I wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t think too hard about it. I was more curious about the locket itself, which was finally open. The red stuff had drained out, so I picked it up and held it under the light.</p><p>Inside, trapped under glass, was a delicate portrait in watercolor. The man was fascinating, and I was transfixed by his piercing eyes, which challenged me from under delicate but sharp brows. His long dark hair looked as if it had been yanked from a tidy queue just moments before and left rebelliously loose to annoy the painter. His mouth was small and somewhat cruel, quirked up into a knowing smirk. His cheekbones could have cut paper. He wore a high white collar that was carelessly open, an indigo cravat hanging untied.</p><p>I loved Jane Austen, so this rogue in a cravat was right up my alley, like an extra-naughty Mr. Darcy. He was the complete opposite of stocky, clean-cut, all-American Jeff\u2014another point in the mystery man\u2019s favor.</p><p>I could almost see a thought bubble rising above his head. I dare you.</p><p>\u201cDare me to what?\u201d I said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have an answer for that.</p><p>I tore my eyes from the image and considered the other side of the locket, looking for the portrait of his lady. Instead, there were words engraved there, and I could almost make them out.</p><p>\u201cViernes toa meo,\u201d I whispered, tracing the letters. I knew a smattering of French and Spanish, just enough to order a sandwich and find the bathroom, and the words seemed oddly familiar but made no sense. Portuguese, maybe? Or Esperanto?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I said out loud. \u201cAnd who carried you over her heart?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have an answer to that, either. I would probably never know, unless I went back to the estate sale and dug around in the attic for clues. Maybe there was a larger portrait that I had missed lurking somewhere in the house, or something written in the book. Between the old lady and the locket, I hadn\u2019t even cracked the spine or looked at the cover. But it would be easy enough to spot\u2014a deep, oxblood red that stood out from the other, dusty brown tomes, which is why I\u2019d noticed it in the first place. I made up my mind to go back to the estate sale the next day, then snapped the locket shut and slipped it back over my head and under my tank top. I felt a little silly.</p><p>Now that the locket\u2019s mystery was solved, real life seeped back into my thoughts. After my time with Nana, I was more bothered than ever. If she was in more pain and not telling me, was she telling her doctor? Was the cancer getting worse, or were the chemo drugs the problem? Worst of all, where would she be if I hadn\u2019t come back from Alabama right when I had? Sometimes I thought I was the only thing willing her to live.</p><p>I\u2019ve always fallen asleep instantly, and my dreams were a fertile place for solving problems. I hoped to find the answers I needed that night.</p><p>3</p><p>I was cold and reached for my blanket. There was nothing there.</p><p>My tank top and pants weren\u2019t there, either.</p><p>Neither was my bed.</p><p>Now, that was curious.</p><p>I opened my eyes as I pressed myself up from the chilly stone. I was completely naked. Except for the locket, which hung against my heart. But it was no longer crusted with age and grime. It was shining and perfect, the brilliant gold glinting in the deep blue stillness of early morning.</p><p>I was frantic for a moment, my arms crossed over my chest, my eyes searching the strangely quiet woods around me. The stone slab was in a foggy clearing surrounded by a ghostly ring of birch trees. A few birds began to sing, breaking the silence. But their songs were somehow wrong.</p><p>Then I laughed to myself.</p><p>I was dreaming, of course.</p><p>Just another one of my crazy lucid dreams.</p><p>I\u2019d had realistic, colorful, full-sensory dreams my entire life, and I was quite accustomed to this moment. In my dreams, I left behind the self-doubt and worry that had dogged me for the past few years. I was stripped down to the essential Tish\u2014the me I wanted to be. I reveled in the lack of consequences. In my dreams, I was free. And yes, frequently naked.</p><p>No big deal. I could do anything I wanted to.</p><p>Time to explore the world.</p><p>After hopping off the stone, I dusted off my dream-butt. I spun slowly in a circle, looking for a path to follow, some sign of where the dream would lead.</p><p>I was startled when I saw him there, leaning against a birch tree. Seconds before, I was sure I was alone, and then he appeared as if by magic.</p><p>It was the man from the locket. He had the same insolent, daredevil, knowing smile, the same unruly hair. One tall black boot was kicked up against the tree behind him, and his arms were crossed over his chest, stretching the shoulders of his black tailcoat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d I asked, which came out more haughtily than I had intended.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he answered, kicking off the tree and walking toward me. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re wearing my locket. And I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>His accent was clipped and British, just as I would have expected.</p><p>\u201cI imagined you with more clothes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I imagined that you ended at the collarbone,\u201d I said.</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed, a laugh so full of fierce joy that it was unsettling. No one laughed like that in the real world. They were too self-conscious of what people would say. I hadn\u2019t laughed that way in a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cCome along, then, love, and let\u2019s get you covered,\u201d he said, and he began to unbutton his coat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t normally talk to strangers,\u201d I said, arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t normally escort naked hoydens about the countryside,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you stand around here uncovered for too long, something even more dangerous than me is going to find you. Besides, I can\u2019t take you home like this. It has to be respectable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has to be respectable? And where do you think you\u2019re taking me?\u201d I asked, but he was already shrugging out of his coat and holding it out to me.</p> <p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said. Then he grinned like a wolf, showing his teeth. \u201cIt won\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t too worried about being naked, but if he wanted me to wear his coat, that was fine. The air was chill and clammy, raising gooseflesh on my arms. I shrugged into the coat, and he buttoned it up to my neck. As he twisted the top button right under my chin, our eyes met, and I had to blush and look down. Too intense, his gaze. He was just a little taller than I, rangy but muscled, as I could see through the open neck of his shirt.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t used to things tight around my neck, and I struggled to unbutton the top button.</p><p>\u201cMustn\u2019t,\u201d he said, his glove catching my hand. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d I growled as he swatted my hand again. \u201cWhat is this\u2014Victorian England? No one buttons anything up to the neck, unless it\u2019s snowing,\u201d I complained. But I left the button alone.</p> <p>\u201cVictorian England?\u201d he said. \u201cNever heard of it. But showing your neck is dangerous here. Showing any skin, really. If it were anyone but me, you\u2019d most likely be dead.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arm, and for lack of options, I took it. His black coat was worn but thick and beautiful, fitted and darted in a way that made me feel curvy and pretty, even with nothing else on. His own shirt fluttered in the breeze, the scarlet waistcoat enhancing the paleness of his skin.</p><p>As we began to walk, I breathed in the scent of his coat. It smelled lovely, like berries and wine and something sharp and green. I got a little light-headed, drawing in the aroma.</p><p>He was watching me, and he chuckled. \u201cDo you know how a man tames a wolf?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou get some clothing you\u2019ve been wearing for a while, and you toss it in with her. In the cage or the cavern, where she sleeps. That first one, she rips up, shreds it to nothing. The second one, she just mouths it a bit, gets a taste. Inhales, like you\u2019re doing there. The third bit of clothing, she starts dragging it around, loving on it, sleeping with it. And then you\u2019ve got her under your spell. She\u2019s got the scent of you, wants to keep it around. She\u2019ll follow you anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you calling me a wolf?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me a man?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat else would you be?\u201d</p><p>He shot me a wicked grin full of pointy teeth. I started and then shook it off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream. Nothing can harm me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dream?\u201d he said, one arched eyebrow raised. \u201cYou think this is a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it is,\u201d I said coolly.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSweetheart, you couldn\u2019t conjure me if you tried.\u201d</p> <p>We glared at each other then, a battle of wills.</p><p>Motion caught my eye, and I looked down to see a small brown rabbit tenderly nosing out from the wood. It hopped and halted, hopped and halted, almost to us.</p><p>\u201cDid you dream that?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe rabbit? Sure, I suppose I did,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s a cutie. Probably represents my kindness. Or innocence. Something like that.\u201d</p><p>The rabbit sniffed my foot, nose twitching, eyes bright. I smiled.</p><p>And then it bit me, sinking fangs into my bare ankle.</p><p>I shrieked and, without thinking, kicked it. It shrieked, too, tumbling head over fluffy white tail through the air and landing with a thump in the grass. When it finally righted itself, it turned to hiss at me before darting back into the underbrush.</p><p>Hmm. That was different.</p><p>I looked down. My ankle was bleeding from two puncture wounds. And it hurt. Bad.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to watch out for that one now,\u201d the man said with another sly grin. \u201cHe\u2019s got a taste for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not scared,\u201d I said. \u201cJust a bunny, fangs or not. It\u2019s all in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got friends,\u201d the man said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll be back, and they all have fangs. And you\u2019re bleeding. If you think you\u2019re strong enough to fight off a warren of bludbunnies, I assure you that you\u2019re wrong. You\u2019d better come with me. Now.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t buying it. I needed to take control of the dream. I held out a hand with fingers splayed and focused my will.</p><p>\u201cZzzzzzzsssst! Pshew! Zzzzist!\u201d I said. But nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cWhat in Sang are you doing, love?\u201d he asked.</p><p>My arm dropped to my side. \u201cI was trying to shoot lightning bolts out of my fingertips,\u201d I said. Then, quietly, \u201cIt usually works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you it wasn\u2019t a dream. Do you want to try flying, too?\u201d</p><p>Sheepishly, I gave a little hop, but my feet came back down to the ground.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, feeling sullen and embarrassed and on the verge of outright panic. Things weren\u2019t going at all the way they usually did. He should have exploded in a ball of blue lightning by now.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done playing around,\u201d he said, \u201cwe really should get moving before something smells that blood on your ankle.\u201d</p><p>Again, the glove waited for my hand. I considered.</p><p>It was just a dream, whether or not the usual tricks worked. Might as well see where it went. He couldn\u2019t be more dangerous than a pack of deranged, bloodthirsty rabbits. I took his arm again, and we began to walk down a strange sort of path formed of two deep ruts in the earth. They were about six feet apart and very straight, cut as if by a machine.</p><p>The sky hung too low over a landscape of bleak, endless grasses and small copses and woods. It made me think of The Hound of the Baskervilles. The air was hazy, almost smoggy, but that went with my dreams, where things were often obscured or blurry until I was right up on them.</p><p>As we walked, something began to form in the sunrise haze ahead, dark shadows standing stark against the pearly lavender clouds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the caravan,\u201d the man said conversationally. \u201cMy caravan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said, unsure what to say.</p><p>The silence between us deepened. He seemed pleased about something, but I was suspicious of his good humor. There was something going on, something obvious that I was missing, that he wasn\u2019t telling me. Squinting into the haze, I saw smoke rising from the caravan and tried to puzzle out the shapes.</p><p>\u201cIs it a train?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen a caravan?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, love, you slay me. You\u2019re like a babe in the woods, trying to pet the bludbunnies.\u201d</p><p>His accent was growing on me, something close to British but with a touch of pirate growl. Very musical. I wanted him to talk more, even if what he said made no sense.</p><p>\u201cWhy does half of what you say start with \u2018blood\u2019?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a moment, just smiled at the nearing caravan. \u201cI keep forgetting,\u201d he said, almost an apology. \u201cYou don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, really,\u201d he said with another deep chuckle.</p><p>OK, that was just annoying.</p><p>\u201cAre you just trying to make me feel like an idiot?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying anything,\u201d was his response, but it was clear that his mind was elsewhere.</p><p>We were close enough now to pick out the individual features of a strange parade of wagons, all attached in a line. The first one looked like a cross between an old-fashioned locomotive, a brass pipe organ, and a chemistry set full of bubbling green liquid and black smoke, and the last one was a little red caboose. The ruts that we were following terminated in the wheels of the caboose, where a capuchin monkey in a red fez sat, looking bored.</p><p>I sniffed the air, but all I smelled was smoke. That was when I realized that I didn\u2019t see a single creature, except for the monkey on the caboose. No horses or cows or pigs, as I would expect outside a circus, and no accompanying stink. Not even an elephant or a giraffe. Peculiar.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should tell you everything,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll know what to expect when you meet everyone. We should be safe, this close to the wagons.\u201d</p><p>He led me back down the path to a little copse we had just passed. A wide, gnarled tree stump surrounded by leggy little saplings rose from the long grass, and he bowed to me and gestured to the stump.</p><p>\u201cMilady,\u201d he said.</p><p>I looked at the stump and tucked the coat behind me, quite sure that I didn\u2019t want to sit my lily-white fundament on a pile of splinters and bloodthirsty ant larvae, even in a dream. Seeing my reticence, he reached into an outside pocket of the coat and pulled out a brilliant crimson handkerchief. And then a yellow. And then an emerald. And then a vivid violet. And then a live dove, which flapped toward the caravan in a flurry of feathers.</p><p>I laughed, and he grinned. \u201cAbracadabra,\u201d he said quietly. Then he spread the big fabric squares out until they covered the stump.</p><p>I sat with a mumbled \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>As I settled myself, he started pacing, his high boots swishing through the grass.</p><p>\u201cWhere to begin?\u201d he asked himself.</p><p>\u201cThe beginning?\u201d I said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cYes, but which one?\u201d</p><p>As I waited, a rabbit shyly lolloped out from the grass. I pulled my legs up onto the stump.</p><p>\u201cShoo! Bad rabbit!\u201d</p><p>Looking up in irritation from the apparent war in his head, the man picked up the rabbit by the scruff of its neck and twisted its head until it popped. He threw the limp body back into the grass and continued pacing, deep in thought.</p><p>I was speechless. I didn\u2019t relish another fang bite, but I recoiled from the thoughtless, swift brutality of the action. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said to me. \u201cIt would have eaten the meat off your bones, given the chance. Appearances can be deceiving, you know. Nature is cruel.\u201d</p><p>Then he stopped and loosened his already-loose collar and looked into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll right. What\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d I shot back. \u201cI thought we were here so you could give me answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou still think this is some dream, that the spirits are trying to give you clever little answers to your problems. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s usually how it works,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. And I need to know your name. So we can speak as civilized people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy name is Criminy Stain,\u201d he said with a bow.</p><p>He said his first name so that it rhymed with Jiminy Cricket. It was outlandish, and I almost giggled, but the look in his eyes made it clear that giggling would be a very bad idea.</p><p>\u201cNow you know who I am. What\u2019s your name, then, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTish Everett,\u201d I said.</p><p>He almost giggled, but the answering glare in my eyes stopped him.</p><p>\u201cTishefferett?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s quite strange.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cTish. Short for Letitia. Letitia Paisley Everett.\u201d I enunciated clearly and paused between the words.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of names,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must be quite important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I said. \u201cFirst name, middle name, last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a ring.\u201d He tried to say it lightly, but I could tell that he was more than curious.</p><p>\u201cNo rings,\u201d I answered, holding up a hand and remembering the fascinating noise my diamonds had made in the disposal. \u201cJust a locket.\u201d</p><p>My hand went to the place where the locket rested, heavy, beneath the coat. A slow smile spread across the man\u2019s\u2014Criminy\u2019s\u2014face.</p><p>\u201cYes. My locket. Let\u2019s see it, then.\u201d</p><p>His gloved fingers shot down the back of the coat\u2019s neck and pulled up the heavy chain, bringing the locket out and laying it on top of the fabric.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as I remember it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an old book at an estate sale,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow much did it cost you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I fidgeted. But it was my dream; no point in lying to myself. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d he crowed. \u201cI knew it would work. I knew it would find the right one.\u201d He was almost giddy.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to steal it. It was an accident,\u201d I said, annoyed. \u201cBack to you, though. What is it that I need to know? What\u2019s the deal with the caravan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the story. It started with the locket, you see. I bewitched it and sent it out to find you and mark you as mine. To bring you to me.\u201d</p><p>He caught my hand in his glove and traced the random gathering of red dots on my skin. Except that they were no longer random, as they had been when I was awake. Now they were aligned into a sort of compass on the palm of my left hand, a central dot with elegant arrows snaking off in four directions, with half marks between them.</p><p>\u201cOK, that\u2019s really strange,\u201d I said. \u201cIt looks like a compass now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s a compass,\u201d he said. \u201cHow else would you find me, with all of Sang to navigate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t find you, and I don\u2019t know where Sang is. You found me, remember?\u201d</p><p>There was a cocky gleam in his eyes. I wanted to hate it, but, well, it looked great on him. \u201cIf I found you, then why were you sleeping on a blood altar in the nude a mile from my caravan? Exactly when I was out for a walk? Out of the entire world and every moment in time, why were you there at that exact moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how I got there. That\u2019s where the dream started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the dream ended.\u201d</p><p>But before I could ask what that meant, I heard hoof-beats, and he shoved me to the ground.</p><p>4</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I spluttered from an undignified heap by the stump.</p><p>He ignored me and sprinkled something over my head while muttering under his breath. I was overtaken with a chill and sat up to draw my legs under the coat, and that\u2019s when I noticed that I was mostly see-through.</p><p>The hoofbeats were louder now, and two terrifying horses skidded to a stop almost on top of me, their black coats frothy and their eyes wild. I scooted closer to the stump. One giant, metal-covered muzzle plunged into my shoulder with a painful thud, and a plate-sized hoof pawed where I\u2019d just been sitting, barely missing me. The horse couldn\u2019t see me, but it could definitely stomp me to death.</p><p>\u201cGood day to you, sirs,\u201d Criminy said in a respectful but playful voice.</p><p>\u201cStand back, Bludman!\u201d came a muffled shout, and I looked up at a man dressed all in coppery brown leather from the top of his Sherlock Holmes hat to the toes of his high boots. The only exposed skin on his entire body was his face, which was dominated by a waxed black mustache.</p><p>Criminy took a step back, hands held up innocently. \u201cOf course, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I be of any help to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what we seek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy caravan is just over the hill, and our papers are all in order, sir,\u201d Criminy answered. Sweeping up the handkerchiefs from the stump, he said, \u201cI was just practicing my legerdemain. But I\u2019d be glad to escort you to the head accountant, if you please. We haven\u2019t had a biter in over ten years, I\u2019m proud to say, although we had to let the wolfboy go for excessive licking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t care about your little freak show, Bluddy,\u201d the man spat. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a Stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Stranger? Out here on the moors?\u201d Criminy said in disbelief. \u201cOh, he wouldn\u2019t last long out here, sirs. Blud-bunnies everywhere this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s a high crime to aid and abet a Stranger, do you not?\u201d said the other man, who was identical to the first save for a pair of wire-rimmed glasses and a spade-shaped goatee.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, we\u2019ve got the notices posted, same as everywhere,\u201d Criminy answered. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never understood why strangers are so threatening.\u201d His eyes flicked to me so quickly that I barely saw it, but I could tell that he wanted me to mark what I heard.</p><p>\u201cDangerous,\u201d growled the first man. \u201cEnemies of the Kingdom. By order of the Magistrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why?\u201d He paused dramatically. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>The man with the mustache was furious, and his face turned red. His horse jigged in place, digging up divots with its hooves. I crowded back against Criminy\u2019s legs. The horse\u2019s great black head came down, the bloodred, white-rimmed eye inches from my face. The creature whuffed against the silver cap over its nose and mouth. These men and their mounts had to be more dangerous than anything they sought.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you question the Magistrate?\u201d the first man said, his voice low and deadly. \u201cBy order of the Copper Equilibrium Consortium, I could have you drained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then you\u2019d miss the show, my lord!\u201d Criminy said, and he pulled a bright red playbill from his vest. \u201cPlease, won\u2019t you accept these deluxe tickets from a humble Bludman who meant no offense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said the first man gruffly, but the second man reached down to accept the flier.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a caravan in ten years,\u201d he said, longing clear in his voice. \u201cThey never come to town anymore. Surely it can\u2019t hurt? His question was innocent, I\u2019ll wager. And if there are Strangers about, we\u2019d have found them by now. The bludmares are never wrong.\u201d</p><p>Did he say bloodmares? Did that mean that these nightmare horses were like the bloodthirsty bunnies? Were there actually fangs under their metal muzzles? And, more important, could they smell me? I scooted behind Criminy\u2019s legs, as far away from the bludmares as possible. His hand briefly caressed my invisible head.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s strange, Ferling,\u201d said the first man. \u201cI can feel it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a brass tube from his pocket and pushed a button, and it extended into a spyglass. A softly whirring spyglass with a blinking green light. He scanned the horizon and frowned.</p><p>There was a charged silence broken only by the pawing and snorting of the horses. Criminy\u2019s grin grew strained as the men had an argument with their eyes.</p><p>Finally, the second man said, \u201cI think we can let the question go, Rodvey. He didn\u2019t mean any disrespect, I\u2019m sure. And he\u2019s right\u2014I\u2019ve never seen so many bludbunnies about. A Stranger wouldn\u2019t last till breakfast.\u201d</p><p>The first man, Rodvey, wasn\u2019t happy as he glared at Ferling. His waxed mustache trembled with anger as he yanked back on his reins and barked, \u201cFine! But we keep searching until we find a Stranger or bones. You\u2019re lucky, Bluddy. You\u2019re awfully lucky.\u201d</p><p>He turned his horse and galloped away, and the second man gave a little salute and followed him. Criminy watched them go, his face frozen with rage.</p><p>\u201cBlasted Coppers,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the skin in the world doesn\u2019t make me half as bloodthirsty as those bastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d I said from the ground. \u201cAm I still invisible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, love,\u201d he said, waving a hand over me and muttering something.</p><p>A warm, melty sensation trickled over me, and then I was visible again.</p><p>He reached down a hand to help me up, saying, \u201cSorry, where were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to explain that. Those were Coppers? And the Stranger\u2014that\u2019s me, right? They\u2019re looking for me? How do they know I\u2019m here? And they said their horses were bloodmares? So horses can drink blood, and those guys are looking for me, and you invited them to the carnival? Because that sounds a little insane.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a quick study,\u201d he said with approval. He spun me around in an odd little dance step and helped me back onto the stump. \u201cThat\u2019s all quite true. But we were talking about us. About how you think this is all a dream. That\u2019s the important bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe weirder it gets, the more it seems like a dream,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that it\u2019s not the other way around, pet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2014that my other life is the dream, and this is my real life?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMakes as much sense as the contrary,\u201d he said, gracefully slipping to the ground and reclining to look up at me.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about the bunnies?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. They won\u2019t bother me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? They just like naked women?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey like naked anybody. But I\u2019m not to their taste.\u201d</p><p>Looking down at him in the watery morning sun, I began to notice little details that I\u2019d overlooked on our walk. He seemed to be in his early thirties, but his skin was unusually smooth. His dark, glossy hair didn\u2019t have a single strand of gray. And no stubble. He smiled brightly then, showing me his teeth.</p><p>They were very pointy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I asked, my voice low. I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I am?\u201d he asked, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cA vampire,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked. As if he\u2019d never heard the word and couldn\u2019t decide if it was an insult or not.</p><p>\u201cHow have you never heard of vampires? It\u2019s like we\u2019re speaking two different languages,\u201d I said, bemused to see him finally acting anything less than smug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smart,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you heard him call me Bludman. Surely you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re a man. But there\u2019s something different about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to piece it together, love,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a different world from yours, which means that there are different rules. Your world must be a soft one. Nearly everything here runs on blood. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called Sang, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world is called Sang, or this country is called Sang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe everything is called Sang. We\u2019re now on an island called Sangland, approaching the city of Manchester. There are villages and cities, mayors and Coppers, Pinkies and Bludmen, but the name of it all is Sang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSang,\u201d I mused to myself. \u201cIn the past tense. I like that. But what\u2019s a Pinky?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Pinky, darling,\u201d he said with a fond smile. \u201cYou eat plants and animals and drink water, and your blood is all meaty and hot and fragrant, bringing pink to your cheeks. The cities are full of your kind, of all different colors and sorts. But they all taste about the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou eat people?\u201d I said with an involuntary shiver.</p><p>\u201cEat people? Chew them up, like a cannibal?\u201d He laughed, another crystal-clear sound ringing through the silence. \u201cNever. Just drink of them. And not directly, not anymore. From vials, mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what a Bludman is?\u201d I asked, pronouncing it as he had, like \u201cblood-mun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said with a bow of the head. \u201cMy kind can be born or made, and I\u2019m born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you dead?\u201d I asked. I had to know.</p><p>\u201cDo I look dead?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cHonestly, where did you hear such tales? I\u2019m alive; my body just works differently from yours. I\u2019m a predator, see. And you\u2019re the prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that rabbit?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you saying that\u2019s a vampire bunny?\u201d</p><p>He followed my pointing finger to the offending creature and held out his finger to it. This one was an albino with bright blue eyes, and in my world, it wouldn\u2019t have lasted five minutes before a hawk or a fox scooped it up. Here, it was bold as brass. The rabbit sniffed him and hissed, then hopped away in a sulk.</p><p>\u201cThat was a bludbunny,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they start out sucking blood, then eating flesh, then cracking bones until they\u2019re round as balls. There are no real rabbits left, munching on carrots and flowers. But there are bludrats and bluddeer and bludhogs. Pretty much all of the wild animals are blood drinkers, outside of the old-fashioned predators\u2014wolves and the like. They keep the eating animals, the cattle and chickens and pigs and such, contained inside the cities. To keep them pure. And in one piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. I suddenly felt like a bit of watermelon at a picnic, with untold armies of ants marching in, unstoppable and overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel safe anymore, do you?\u201d he asked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Nothing can harm you so long as you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what happens when I leave you?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou can\u2019t spend all your time following me around and strangling rabbits.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and pulled at the grass. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me, woman,\u201d he said.</p><p>I watched him playing with the long blades of grass, weaving them into patterns as he hummed an unfamiliar song, a waltz.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m letting you get used to the idea of me,\u201d he said idly. \u201cI\u2019m pretending to be harmless. Is it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you smile,\u201d I said weakly, and he smiled again, his face radiant.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help that, love,\u201d he said. \u201cNot around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a lovesick puppy,\u201d I chided. \u201cOr is it a lovesick bludpuppy?\u201d</p><p>That garnered a laugh, and I felt as if I\u2019d won a prize.</p><p>\u201cLovesick bludpuppy,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, I like that.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look into his eyes anymore, because I could see a sort of adoration in them that made me nervous. I traced whorls on the stump with my finger.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d I said, \u201cI just ended a bad relationship, and I\u2019m not really looking for another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not be looking for it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut maybe it\u2019s come looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a dream?\u201d I asked. \u201cMy brain probably conjured you up because you\u2019re the exact opposite of my old fianc\u00e9. I may not be taken, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m available. I can\u2019t have you looking at me like that. But you seem ... nice enough.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t really have words for what he seemed.</p><p>He chuckled to himself, low in his throat. There was something sinister there, roiling under the surface like eels in a lake, dark and dangerous. But there was something wildly attractive about it, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re buying it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may say it\u2019s a dream, but you\u2019re empathizing, trying to make me feel better. I am no longer a figment of your imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying anything\u2014I\u2019m playing by the rules,\u201d I said, feeling a bit prickly. \u201cNo point in dreaming if you don\u2019t dream the dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of poetry in that,\u201d he said, smiling at the grass in his hands.</p><p>Then I felt his full focus on me. I tensed.</p><p>\u201cLook into my eyes, Letitia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Tish,\u201d I said out of habit.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said fiercely.</p><p>I looked down into his eyes. I couldn\u2019t help it, couldn\u2019t stop myself.</p><p>His eyes were the color of the ocean, a shifting grayish-brownish-greenish, alternately cloudy and clear. They didn\u2019t blink. The stare was so intense that a bolt of recognition and understanding shot through me, settling in my belly like a jigger of whiskey, hot and sweet.</p><p>My eyes snapped shut.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t feel this way. Whatever magic you\u2019re using, stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy magic won\u2019t work on your heart,\u201d he said. \u201cOr else I\u2019d have used it already, had you dancing back to my wagon like a marionette on a string.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem very fair,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTruer words were never spoken,\u201d he said, although I felt that we had agreed on different things.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Tish Everett. I\u2019m a nurse, and I take care of my grandmother, and I live in an apartment, and I have a cat. This is a dream. Any moment, I\u2019m going to wake up,\u201d I said behind closed eyes, my heart beating in my ears.</p><p>I needed to be free. I needed time to find myself in the safe little cocoon I\u2019d created in my world. I needed to take care of my grandmother, my responsibilities. I didn\u2019t want to feel a pull like this mystifying longing for a dangerous stranger in his bizarre, bloodthirsty world. It scared me.</p><p>Until he spoke.</p><p>Damn him and his sexy accent.</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way, love. If it\u2019s a dream, then whatever you do here doesn\u2019t count. Dreams are for experiencing things you can\u2019t in real life. You can feel, love, kill with impunity. Nothing matters; dreams are your heart\u2019s playground,\u201d he said, his voice musical and low.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019re in another world entirely, then your grandmother and your cat aren\u2019t here. You may never get back. You don\u2019t know how to get back, anyway. You might as well do the best you can here, make whatever life you can. You don\u2019t want to be alone in Sang, believe me.\u201d</p><p>He must have sensed my resolve weakening. The smooth voice went on, insinuating itself into my ears and settling in, growing roots.</p><p>I wanted so badly to give in.</p><p>\u201cEither way, your best bet is to trust me. Come with me. Join me.\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped so low that I could barely hear it.</p><p>\u201cBe my love,\u201d he said.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell if it was a question or a command.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy you? Why me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say that we both have our dreams,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd sometimes, they take a very long time indeed to come true.\u201d</p><p>The few birds sang in the silence, and I wondered if they, too, craved flesh. The grass rustled. Someone began playing a flute near the caravan, and the eerie trill danced through the air between us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which part is the dream or who is dreaming whom. My heart is my own, and I\u2019m not looking to share it,\u201d I said finally.</p><p>I felt as if I was standing on a precipice, and I had to take a stand. I had sworn that no man was going to tell me what to do ever again, even if he was just telling me to love him in return.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think I may eventually feel for you, for right now, you\u2019re going to have to back off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like following orders,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d I said.</p><p>5</p><p>The flute song rose and fell between us, breaking the tension into ripples. I watched him shred the little web of grass he had woven. It fluttered away in the breeze.</p><p>\u201cIt would appear we\u2019ve reached an impasse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>He tossed the last bit of grass to the ground and inspected his green-stained gloves, then shook himself like a dog. When he met my eyes again, the charged power of his gaze was gone, replaced by a mask of bright, manic energy. He leaped to his feet and did a strange little jig, then held out his hand with a flourish. A bouquet of flowers appeared there. When I reached to take it, it disappeared, and a little cloud of confetti burst from his sleeve and settled over me.</p><p>I clapped slowly and sarcastically but couldn\u2019t help grinning at him.</p><p>\u201cWe go to Criminy\u2019s Clockwork Caravan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find some clothes for you, feed you, introduce you around. The crew\u2019s about half Bludmen, half Pinky, so you\u2019ll feel at home. And there\u2019s a very strict order of things, in the caravan.\u201d</p><p>He smiled crookedly and held out his arm. \u201cYour blood is safe with us.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel safe, neither in body nor in heart. Why was I drawn to this odd, inhuman man? I had felt his tug when I opened the locket, but I had thought it was fancy and romance, the impossible longing for something noble and beautiful from long ago. I thought it was the same sort of harmless yearning I felt for Mr. Darcy. But here, near him, smelling him, I recognized the feeling for what it was. Attraction. And passion. And maybe fear\u2014the exciting kind.</p> <p>He was right, though. I had nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to. I found myself committing to the world of Sang, whether as a dream or as an alternative dimension. Maybe I had a head injury and was lying on my bathroom floor in a puddle of blood, dreaming strange dreams as Nana left message after frantic message on my voice mail.</p><p>That thought made me shiver, and he turned to look at me.</p><p>\u201cAll right, love? You look as if a goose has walked over your grave.\u201d</p><p>I tried to play it off as a joke. \u201cYou have geese here? Or are they bludgeese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBirds drinking blood?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cDo they have teeth where you come from? Because here, it\u2019s just ruddy little beaks. I suppose they could peck you to death, if you held still long enough.\u201d</p><p>We had reached the caravan again, and I braced myself for further bewilderment. Everything seemed slightly off-kilter, and I was walking into an unfamiliar place full of strangers and people who wanted to drink my blood. Still, nothing moved except for tendrils of smoke on the breeze, and it was eerie. I could see the same monkey in the same fez, sitting perfectly still on the caboose. I was amazed that any animal could sit still that long.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the monkey?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe must be really well trained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell trained? Love, you\u2019re a riot,\u201d he said, laughing again. I was powerfully drawn to that laugh, and I barely even knew the man. Or inhuman monster. Or apex predator. Whatever he claimed to be.</p> <p>\u201cPemberly, wake!\u201d he called.</p><p>A flash of green light surged over the monkey\u2019s open eyes, and they blinked several times. It leaped into the air and did a little jig on its back legs, its tail forming a perfect question mark.</p><p>\u201cPemberly, come,\u201d Criminy called, and the monkey swung down to the ground and ran to his outstretched arm, climbing up to sit on his shoulder, tail curling around his bicep.</p><p>The monkey turned to look at me, and I realized that the coppery fur was actually cunningly crafted metal. I could hear a subtle ticking from within, and when the eyes blinked, there was a metallic click.</p><p>\u201cLetitia, my dear, this is Pemberly. Pemberly, this is your new mistress,\u201d Criminy said. The monkey extended a dainty black paw, and Criminy nodded to me, saying, \u201cMustn\u2019t be rude.\u201d</p><p>I shook the little hand, which was cold and smooth. The monkey\u2019s mouth turned up at the corners in a comical grin, revealing silver teeth.</p><p>\u201cShe likes you,\u201d Criminy said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s a she?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBecause when Murdoch built her, I specifically requested a female,\u201d he said, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cIs she a pet or part of the caravan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBoth, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s whatever I need her to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere I come from, we don\u2019t have anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re quite lucky to have an excellent builder and mechanic on staff. A Pinky and a hermit but quite talented. He keeps the clockworks running, although we\u2019re having a spot of trouble lately with the Bolted Burlesque. The redhead keeps shorting out in the middle of a striptease, and then everyone wants their blood back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect a patron got too touchy,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cHappens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean ... why don\u2019t you have real animals? A real burlesque? This is a circus, right?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and chucked me under the chin, saying, \u201cI already told you, pet. Almost all of the wild animals are blood drinkers, and no Pinky in her right mind would stand around in her skivvies. Can you imagine what a blood-hungry pachyderm could do to a fragile little body like yours? No one\u2019s seen a living monkey in decades. And most of the city dogs and cats have been drained by blud-rats. The clockworks make good enough pets and guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why she was holding so still,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGuard mode. Can\u2019t be too safe, these days. I\u2019ll have Murdoch build something lovely for you, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and down the caravan, hunting for the Bolted Burlesque, but no sexbots were cavorting in plain sight. We stood for a few heartbeats in front of the wagons, and I felt as if he was waiting for some sort of reaction from me. I honestly didn\u2019t have one. He sighed and held out his hand to sling the monkey to the ground, saying, \u201cPemberly, guard.\u201d</p><p>She skittered back onto the caboose and sank down on her haunches as I had originally seen her, seemingly bored, her wide eyes gazing into the distance. A red light flashed intermittently in the irises.</p><p>Beyond the metal monkey, the vast, hazy moors stretched, haunted and sad, to the horizon. I still hadn\u2019t seen another person, except for the Coppers. Dream or not, it was unsettling.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re having breakfast,\u201d he said, checking a pocket watch. \u201cPractice won\u2019t begin until ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they practice?\u201d I asked. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t really understand what a caravan is. Or what this caravan is.\u201d</p><p>He let go of my hand and blocked my path.</p><p>His lovely, lilting voice rose and took on the tones of an old-fashioned barker, and a cane somehow appeared in one hand, a top hat in the other. He grinned, and his pointed teeth glittered madly.</p><p>\u201cThis, my lady, is a traveling circus. Death-defying acts, sideshow freaks, games of chance, and mystifying clockwork exhibitions to fool even the most steadfast Copper. Step right up! Test your mettle! See Veruca the amazing Abyssinian, Torno the strong man, and Herr Sigebert the juggling polanda bear!\u201d</p><p>The top hat flew up into the air, followed by the cane. In a motion so quick I barely saw it, he snatched a sneaky little rabbit from my feet and threw that into the air, too, juggling the three objects effortlessly, his manic eyes never leaving mine.</p><p>Around and around, the hat chased the cane chased the hissing rabbit, in circles, then figure eights. Then the rabbit and the cane disappeared into the hat, which landed delicately on Criminy\u2019s head. He wasn\u2019t even winded, and his eyes were sparkling. I could tell that he loved performing, loved his art. I clapped in admiration.</p><p>He cut a deep bow, and the rabbit fell out of the hat and squatted by his boots, stunned. He stomped on it with a sickening crunch, picked it up by the ears, and lobbed it under the caboose.</p><p>\u201cWe make magic, you see. We\u2019re the last of the gypsies, and we keep the world\u2019s treasures safe in jars, masquerading as chicanery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking in puzzles,\u201d I said.</p><p>His energy faded to a thoughtful silence, and he bowed to me. \u201cI do that, when I\u2019m maudlin.\u201d</p><p>He led me to a shining wagon of deep burgundy. It reminded me of an old-fashioned Pullman car with brass fittings and hand-painted curlicues, but there were no windows.</p><p>Criminy Stain, Gypsy King was painted along the side in ornate gold script.</p><p>Underneath that, much smaller, it said, Specializing in all sorts of magic and legerdemain.</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAh, but we\u2019re not going in there,\u201d he said. \u201cNot until you\u2019ve got some clothes on. Like I said, respectable.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and tucked my arms into the armpits of the coat. It barely covered my important bits in front but overshot my back end by quite a bit. If I didn\u2019t raise my arms, I could probably pass for respectable.</p><p>We passed several other wagons.</p><p>Torno the Strong Man.</p><p>Abilene The Bearded Lady.</p><p>Eblick the Lizard Boy.</p><p>Catarrh and Quincy the Siamese Twins.</p><p>I must remember not to make anyone angry, I thought. These people sound terrifying.</p><p>The next wagon read, Costuming &amp; Accounts, Carnivalleros Only.</p><p>Underneath that, in tiny letters, it said, Or else.</p><p>Or else? I took a step back.</p><p>\u201cHere we go, love,\u201d Criminy said, and I stopped him with a hand on his arm before he could open the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI understand that there might be something here,\u201d I said, knowing that he knew what I meant. \u201cAnd I get that you don\u2019t like taking orders. But maybe you should stop calling me \u2018love\u2019 all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a colloquialism,\u201d he said. \u201cLove, bird, pet, poppet, sweeting, although that one really only works for pirates. Terms of endearment, but nothing sneaky-like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d I said, and he raised his eyebrows in feigned innocence as he reached for the handle of the lime-green door. Before he could touch it, it crashed open, banging against the wood.</p> <p>\u201cWhozat?\u201d screeched a grating female voice from within. \u201cI can hear you out there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Mrs. Cleavers,\u201d he called. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve brought a guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sir, I\u2019m so sorry. I thought it was maybe C and Q trying to sneak a peek again. The twins are randier than a pack of bludbunnies on a full moon. I found them last week up to their chins in petticoats, doing something I won\u2019t mention in front of this ... er ... lady.\u201d</p><p>As I entered the dimness within, she came into focus. A small woman wrapped in a violet shawl, with a beaky nose and a ridiculous hat. She reminded me of a baby vulture. She sniffed the air as she blinked at me.</p><p>\u201cOoh, smell her! She smells like\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know what she smells like,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cAnd she needs clothes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the spell worked, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you value your job and your neck, shut your trap,\u201d he growled, and she snorted.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said, timid, and stuck out my hand.</p> <p>She shrank back, fidgeting with her black, scale-covered hands like bird\u2019s claws, muttering, \u201cMy gloves, my gloves. Where\u2019d I lay them down?\u201d</p><p>I politely averted my eyes. The wagon was crowded with cloth and spangles and lace and ribbons, racks upon racks of clothes and dress dummies in all sizes stuck full of pins and thread. The costumes were stunning and detailed in a way that had fallen out of style in my world. Everything looked deeply uncomfortable.</p><p>When Criminy touched my back, I startled and felt blood rush to my cheeks at the light pressure of his hand. I turned to find Mrs. Cleavers staring at me again, a gloved hand held out hopefully. I shook it, and we smiled. Then she erupted into a flurry of activity, buzzing around in trunks and closets.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see, let\u2019s see. What do we need? Petticoats, that\u2019s for sure. Corset. Dress and shawl, oh, yes. Look here, dear. What color are your eyes?\u201d</p><p>She pulled a chain out from under her jacket and used the attached brass opera glasses to look at my eyes from several feet away.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she muttered. \u201cMurky blue. That won\u2019t do at all.\u201d</p><p>I felt the sudden need to apologize for my eyes, but she was upside down in another chest, her tiny feet fluttering off the ground in knee-high lace-up boots.</p><p>She hooted in what I had to assume was triumph and emerged holding a puddle of deep burgundy fabric.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect,\u201d Criminy said.</p><p>\u201cStep outside, sir, if you please,\u201d she chirped. \u201cA lady\u2019s got to be respectable.\u201d</p><p>He obediently went out the door, whistling as it shut behind him.</p><p>She focused on me. Her eyes narrowed, and the jovial subservience flashed into all business. \u201cOff with the coat, then,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d</p><p>Shyly, I started unbuttoning the coat at the neck, and when my throat was exposed, she gasped. I turned away from her as I undid the buttons and shrugged off the coat, holding it back for her. She draped something over my arm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your drawers,\u201d she said, her voice croaky. \u201cGo fast, now. That\u2019s simply too much skin. Saint Crispin, girl! They\u2019ll smell you for miles.\u201d</p><p>Looking down at the frothy black skirts, I was puzzled. If they could make robots, what was so hard about making underwear? I stepped into the petticoats and pulled them up to my waist, tying the drawstring at what seemed like a comfortable tightness.</p><p>I held out my hand, and a black satin corset appeared.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve never worn one of these before. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>I had never told anyone, but I had actually bought one once, on a whim at the mall. It was purple satin with black lace, and it had just caught my eye. When I shyly showed it to Jeff, he demanded that I take it back because it looked, and I quote, \u201cOutlandish.\u201d</p><p>Well, guess, what, Jeff? I\u2019m in Vampireland, putting on a corset, so screw you.</p><p>She slapped it around me and laced it with lightning-fast fingers, very careful not to touch my skin, even with her gloves.</p><p>\u201cHold on to that post,\u201d she said.</p><p>There was a conveniently placed post nearby, so I wrapped my arms around it, thinking about Scarlett O\u2019Hara. The first yank on the lacing was still shocking, and the tugging didn\u2019t stop until I felt as if my lungs were going to explode. Little bars dug into my stomach and pressed against my chest.</p><p>\u201cIs this really necessary?\u201d I asked breathlessly.</p><p>She blew air out of her nose like a bored horse and lifted her shawl to show a tiny hourglass waist.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from,\u201d she said, \u201cBut in this world, sweetheart, a lady\u2019s worth nothing but the size of her waist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope the food isn\u2019t very good, then,\u201d I said, and she cackled.</p><p>Next came the dress, which had ties and embroidery over every inch. I fumbled around with it but couldn\u2019t figure out where my head went. It seemed to have three sleeves. Mrs. Cleavers sighed heavily before snatching it back and holding it out to me with the smallest sleeve\u2014which was actually the neck\u2014open. I ducked through it and pulled it down. It was heavy and thick, and I felt as if I were putting on a twenty-pound wetsuit. The sleeves went all the way to my knuckles and hooked over my thumbs. Along the wrists, another set of laces waited for my costumer\u2019s merciless tugging.</p><p>She laced and pulled all of the ties. The dress was snug against every inch of my skin until it met my hips, where it flared out and in like a mermaid\u2019s tail. A waterfall of ruffles cascaded off my bum. She dragged me to a full-length mirror and tilted it to show my full figure.</p><p>I had been transformed into a curvy Victorian bombshell. Or Gothic bombshell, maybe, because even for a garment that covered every inch of skin, there was something decidedly dark and sexy about the thing.</p><p>I smiled and ran my hands down my perfectly curved waist.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get on your high horse yet, child,\u201d she chided me, reading my mind. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got hair and makeup to do. And boots. Boots first.\u201d</p><p>She threw back the top of another chest, and the smell of leather drifted out. I slipped on the pair of gray stockings she handed me, and she started flinging boots to the floor at my feet, urging me to try on pair after pair until I found the ones that fit like a glove. They were calf-high and black with a kicky little heel. Once the boots were laced all the way up and cruelly tightened by my personal costume buzzard, I checked the mirror again and smiled.</p><p>Firm hands forced me into a chair. My dark, wavy hair was loose and rumpled, and she began dragging a silver brush through the tangles without mercy. I grunted in pain. She laughed.</p><p>A tiny dish of metal pins appeared and were twisted open in her mouth and jabbed into my skull. Against its natural inclination, my wild hair was molded into a proper sort of updo. She nearly singed my nose with a pair of brass tongs as she created little curls with the leftover feathery bits of hair around my face and ears that normally made my life hell.</p><p>As the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, she produced a long, metal fork with a bunch of black feathers and doodads attached and stabbed it into the glossy pile of hair. I turned my head to admire the effect and saw a polished rabbit skull nestled among peacock feathers and ribbons.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve never seen a fascinator,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a fascinator?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFascinator? I hardly know \u2019er!\u201d she cried, then laughed until she was wheezing.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to laugh, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. She\u2019d probably been waiting ten years to use that joke on an idiot like me.</p><p>\u201cYou Strangers slay me, lass,\u201d she said, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cSo am I done now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cLittle bit of paint first,\u201d she muttered as she jabbed my tender eyeballs with a sharpened pencil that she moistened with her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t generally wear much makeup,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p><p>She lined my eyes and smudged black all around them, then produced a glass jar of white powder.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not lead, is it?\u201d I asked, remembering some choice stories from my high school history class about the ridiculous things women used to do for beauty.</p><p>\u201cLead? Certainly not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s chalk and belladonna.\u201d</p><p>I lurched backward as the brush approached my face.</p><p>\u201cBelladonna is poison, too,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have it,\u201d she said, stepping toward me menacingly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell the master,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cFine. Tell him I don\u2019t want to die. See what he says.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip started trembling, and then she burst out laughing again. These bizarre people and their laughter were starting to get to me. I\u2019d only met two carnivalleros so far, and they had both cackled maniacally within moments of meeting me. Jeff would have hated it, but I was starting to crave it.</p><p>Her tiny boots clicked over to the door, and she stuck her head out and hollered, \u201cMaster Stain, the lady don\u2019t want powder. Says it\u2019s poison, and she don\u2019t want to die.\u201d I could hear his elegant guffaws carrying through the crack in the door.</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want powder, then don\u2019t use powder!\u201d he shouted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut sir\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts, Cleavers. It\u2019s her choice. She\u2019ll stand out no matter what she does. Being unfashionably tawny is the least of her troubles.\u201d</p><p>When she turned back to glare at me, I smiled smugly.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she snapped. \u201cNo powder. But you\u2019re wearing rouge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cSo long as it\u2019s not made of battery acid and Drano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what those are.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cBut you\u2019re wearing it, just the same.\u201d</p><p>This time, she had a delicate little brush and a porcelain pot of bright red paste. I imagined my cheeks painted with big, circular stains like a china doll. But apparently, rouge was their word for lipstick, because she carefully painted my lips with the sticky red stuff, which was brighter than blood. No one but movie stars could pull off that color red in my world. I tried to imagine how it would look against the white powder and the burgundy dress and decided that I was doomed to resemble a playing card. Like the Queen of Hearts.</p><p>\u201cAll done,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thank goodness. You\u2019re tougher to prettify than a spoiled child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to cause you trouble,\u201d I said, remembering my manners.</p><p>I could tell that she was one of those seemingly inconsequential people who actually hold great power. I didn\u2019t want to burn a bridge with her. Plus, she reminded me of my grandmother, who acted gruff just to test your mettle and see if you were worth getting to know.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the ways here. Thanks for helping me.\u201d</p><p>I went to hug her, and she drew back with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cThings must be very different where you come from,\u201d she said with an odd tinge to her voice, and that\u2019s when I finally realized that she was the same thing as Criminy, a blood drinker. I don\u2019t know why I hadn\u2019t made the connection sooner, like, say, when I saw the black claws. Did Criminy have those, too, under his gloves? That would be one more downside of getting involved with him, no matter that I nearly melted every time he smiled at me.</p><p>Mrs. Cleavers selected a bottle from a small table and poofed a big spritz of perfume over my head. I could feel the tiny cold drops settle on my face. The scent of red roses enveloped me, and I sneezed.</p> <p>She inhaled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s better. But don\u2019t try to huggle a Bludman, eh? And here\u2019s your shawl.\u201d</p><p>She offered me a piece of black netting, but I said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster might let you refuse paint, but all ladies wear a shawl,\u201d she said, scandalized.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I said.</p><p>As I turned to the door in a huff, some part of my hairdo fell, and my arm shot up to catch it before everything came tumbling down. At the same time, Mrs. Cleavers clucked and reached up to fix the offending ringlet, and somehow her beaky nose grazed across my bare hand, skin to skin.</p><p>And I felt a jolt, as if I had been struck by lightning.</p><p>6</p><p>We both reacted as if we\u2019d been electrocuted, jumping back and breathing heavily. When our skin had touched, an image appeared in my head as if part of a forgotten memory, one that made no sense. I saw a tiny golden monkey in a green top hat opening a window under the darkness of night and pouring something into the powder jar with which Mrs. Cleavers had tried to whiten my skin.</p> <p>As quickly as it came, the image was gone. Not a second had passed, barely a breath.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI felt it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019ve got two hundred years of self-control, birdie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that,\u201d I said. \u201cDid you see the picture, the thing with the monkey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat monkey?\u201d she said, her eyes suspicious slits.</p><p>\u201cI felt this jolt, and I saw this image of a monkey in a hat putting something in your face powder,\u201d I said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that why you gasped, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis monkey,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat did it look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a tiny monkey, smaller than Criminy\u2019s, and it was wearing a green top hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElvis.\u201d She spat. \u201cI should have known.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the jar of powder and sniffed it, then held it up to the lamplight.</p><p>\u201cNo scent, no color,\u201d she muttered to herself. Then she pierced me again with her sharp, dark eyes. \u201cYou say you saw it? Just now? In a dream?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou ever seen such things before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>She opened the door and called softly, \u201cMaster, she\u2019s ready for you.\u201d</p><p>When Criminy walked in, his face was hopeful in a way that I found very endearing, even if I didn\u2019t want to. He saw me, and his eyes lit up. I could have sworn I saw shadows dancing against fire there, and he reached for my now significantly smaller waist and lifted me up in a twirl, then attempted to lead me in a little dance step. I hoped the skirts would hide my lack of skill and prayed that my face would hide the thrill that zipped through me when he touched me, even through all that fabric.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vision, Letitia,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jeff had always called me Tish, thinking that \u201cLetitia\u201d sounded old-fashioned and silly. But I liked the way it sounded when Criminy said it, feminine and charmingly formal.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Cleavers. You\u2019ve gilded the rose.\u201d</p><p>She bobbed a curtsy, but her sly eyes never left me.</p><p>\u201cMaster, did you know she\u2019s a glancer?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>He dropped my hand and stared at me. The combined weight of their regard was crushing.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong? I don\u2019t know what a glancer is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked us both.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, sir, but we got tangled up and touched skin,\u201d she said, a little sheepish. \u201cI jumped away right quick, so no worries on that count. But she had a glance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cPlease elucidate, darling.\u201d</p><p>I repeated the dream to him in as much detail as I could remember, desperately hoping I wasn\u2019t as crazy as I felt. He listened, deadly serious, and said, \u201cBring me the powder.\u201d</p><p>She put it in his hand, and he opened the top and smelled it. He grabbed his coat from the floor where I had left it and put it on, straightening his collar and shooting his cuffs. He pulled a tiny vial from an inside pocket, untwisted its top, and let one drop of blue liquid fall on the powder. It sizzled, and a curling plume of green smoke rose into the air, making my eyes burn.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cCyanote.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Cleavers gasped and put her hand to her forehead, as if she might faint. From another pocket in his coat, he pulled a black silk handkerchief. Working quickly, he tied little knots to form a bag, then placed the entire jar of powder in it. He waved one hand over it, said an unintelligible word, and snapped, and the entire package disappeared.</p><p>He wiped his gloved hands off on his breeches and then turned back to us. Noting my dropped jaw, he said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just impressed,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, the top hat and handkerchiefs and rabbits and juggling are pretty standard with a few years of practice, but that looked like it really disappeared. You\u2019re really good.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again, and Mrs. Cleavers chuckled, too. \u201cStandard? You think that\u2019s all it is? A little practice? It takes fifty years of legerdemain to banish that little jar to my writing desk just a few yards away. It\u2019ll be another fifty years before I can actually make it disappear. And have you forgotten that I made you disappear this morning, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that was real magic?\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. Are you telling me you just saw the past in a vision? That a monkey in a top hat was trying to murder my chief costumer and head accountant with the most powerful poison in existence using her makeup jar? If so, perhaps I\u2019m not the crazy one here.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, fine, I am the crazy one, but I think we\u2019re a matched pair,\u201d he answered. \u201cThis glancing of yours is a lovely surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when I touched her skin, I saw ... the past? Am I psychic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat remains to be seen. We\u2019ll have to test your powers before we paint your wagon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wagon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, love. We\u2019ve been needful of a fortune-teller, and you\u2019ve just saved me quite a bit of trouble in the hiring process. You\u2019d think a true glancer would know when and where to show up for a job interview, but somehow the old bluffers never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being awfully presumptuous,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it your way. Madame Letitia Paisley Everett, I\u2019m pleased to offer you employment as a fortune-teller in my caravan. Payment will be room, board, and two hundred coppers per annum. Would you care to accept, at least until you manage to gain control of interdimensional travel and return to your old world?\u201d</p><p>I thought of the bunnies, the horses, the Coppers, the other, less gentlemanly Bludmen, and the huge, heavy world outside. I didn\u2019t have a choice, but I appreciated his recognition that I needed to feel as if I had one.</p><p>\u201cI graciously accept your offer, Mr. Stain,\u201d I said with an awkward curtsy.</p><p>\u201cBut sir,\u201d Mrs. Cleavers broke in, \u201cwhat about Elvis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a chat,\u201d he said darkly. His mouth quirked up in a cruel, heartless smile that reminded me of a pit full of sharpened stakes. Whatever he was to me, I was glad he was on my side.</p><p>\u201cBut first, let\u2019s find some gloves,\u201d he said, putting his smile away like a gunslinger holstering a pistol. \u201cYou were both lucky this time, but it shouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Cleavers opened another chest and brought me a pair of dove-gray gloves with pearl buttons. I could feel her holding herself away, trying to stay apart from me. I wondered what scared her more\u2014the thought of touching me and feeling whatever had shocked her or of me touching her and seeing something else, whether the past or the future. I slipped on the gloves and stretched my fingers and shrugged my shoulders. My outfit was confining, and I couldn\u2019t get away from feeling claustrophobic. And trapped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so covered up,\u201d I said. \u201cIs it always this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a smart little Pinky, yes,\u201d said Criminy. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>He led me out the door and down the steps. People had finally started to appear around the wagons, and it was very hard not to stare, because they were very strange people doing very strange things.</p> <p>Closest to us, a taut rope hung between two posts, and a bored young woman painted like a marionette was riding a unicycle back and forth. Her costume was made of lurid purple leather with yellow harlequin diamonds, laced at the neck, wrists, and ankles, with a flouncy leather tutu. With all that lacing, she had to be human. A Pinky, like me. Spotting us, she perked up.</p><p>\u201cGood day, Master Stain,\u201d she called. \u201cWho\u2019s the new girl?\u201d</p><p>Criminy nodded politely but didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Underneath her tightrope stood a young man with a nest of wavy auburn hair, his blouse undone to show a hairless bird chest. A big-nosed puppet drooped around his neck on invisible strings. Several other puppets were strewn over a trunk nearby. The man\u2019s gloves were scarlet, and he was so focused on the cyclist above that he didn\u2019t even acknowledge us as we passed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Criminy whispered, his breath tickling the curls that hung in the tender spot behind my ear. \u201cHe keeps hoping she\u2019ll fall and break her neck, so that he can turn her without guilt and be her knight in shining armor.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to that. In the vampire stories I\u2019d read, the vampire usually just did whatever he wanted and damn the consequences. There was an odd balance of power at play in this world, if the blood drinker spent his life gazing longingly at a bored girl on a unicycle.</p><p>The next car was an aquarium. Behind the thick, wavy glass, floating in crystal-blue water and framed by softly waving water plants, was a mermaid.</p><p>I had to look twice to confirm it. Yep, a mermaid, complete with silvery blue tail.</p><p>Beautiful blond hair billowed around her head, and she had white clamshells over her breasts. Her eyes were dark with kohl and pinned to Criminy. When we were right in front of her, she swam up to the glass and kissed it with a saucy wink at my escort.</p><p>\u201cSirena,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cThe mermaid. Bit of a trollop. Tried to teach her magic once, but she didn\u2019t get on at all.\u201d She was waving madly, so he waved back with a bored smile, saying, \u201cYes, yes, we see you. Get on with it.\u201d</p><p>The mermaid scowled at us and did a backflip, slapping the surface of the water with her tail. I shrieked as cold droplets sprinkled over me, and Criminy pulled me a little closer. My heart sped up as he gently dabbed at my face with a bright red handkerchief.</p> <p>\u201cMissed a drop,\u201d he said, voice quiet and husky. \u201cJust there.\u201d</p><p>His lips barely brushed mine. I wanted to push him away. I should have turned my head and slapped him for taking advantage of me. But I was too busy keeping my knees from buckling and melting into a puddle at his feet. The touch was brief and searing, and it was all I could do to pull back and clear my throat. Criminy didn\u2019t apologize. He just grinned.</p><p>Sirena smacked the glass with her hand and went to sulk behind a water plant. Before I could ask if she was fake or real or really magic, Criminy steered me to the next wagon and the strong man, Torno. He was almost a giant, with huge muscles and a waxed black mustache with curled tips. He wore a tan leather suit that extended up his neck into the oddest top hat I had ever seen, molded tightly around his ears and chin. I couldn\u2019t imagine how uncomfortable and sweaty it had to be inside his costume.</p><p>As he did squats, he held a red velvet fainting couch over his head. Seated primly on it was a two-headed boy of fourteen or so. Both heads had scraggly hair the color of nothing and dark eyes that were crafty and sullen. The open collars told me that they were Bludmen, and I watched as each hand lifted a teacup to a different mouth, which slurped and sucked as only a teenager can. When the cups returned to the saucers, the lips were painted with blood. Both heads grinned luridly at me, showing red-stained teeth. I shuddered, and Criminy yanked me forward, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s rude to stare unless you\u2019ve paid, pet. They were born that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t staring at their heads,\u201d I said. \u201cI was staring at the bloody teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Just then, a strange woman walking past us caught my attention. She was actually swallowing a python head-first as if it were the most normal thing in the world. Her skin was a deep indigo black, and her hair fell in braids to her waist. She wore nothing but a shiny corset, bloomers, and snakeskin boots that came to her knees.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell,\u201d I whispered to Criminy when she had walked past. \u201cWhat is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVeruca Lindenfain, Abyssinian swallower of swords, fire, and snakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAbyssinians are human, but their blood is so powerful that nothing will drink it. Not even a bludrat wants to go blind and mad. Makes a pretty penny for us, you know, draws a huge crowd wherever we go. Not a lot of her type around, able to walk both worlds and swallow fire, too.\u201d</p><p>Next was the lizard boy, stretched out on a log, asleep. He seemed like a perfectly normal teenager who happened to be covered in scales of a sickly pale green. A long forked tongue flapped as he snored.</p><p>\u201cHe needs sunlight,\u201d said Criminy. \u201cSo he says. I think he\u2019s just a lazy bugger.\u201d</p><p>The trailer beside the lizard boy was painted purple and pink. I smiled at the two pretty girls whispering on the roof. Even when doing handstands on chairs ten feet off the ground, they just seemed so innocent and girlish and happy.</p><p>\u201cCherie and Demi. The Twisty Sisters,\u201d Criminy mused with a fond wave. The girls waved back\u2014while standing on one hand each. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014they\u2019re both bludded, so even if they fall, they\u2019ll be fine. I found Cherie in a London orphanage, and Demi was a Stranger, bleeding on the moor. Now they\u2019re as close as real sisters and the finest contortionists I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019ve a bit of luck about me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not luck,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he murmured, but I could tell that he was pleased with himself and took an almost fatherly pride in his strange carnivalleros. There was more magic about Criminy Stain than what he pulled out of his hat.</p><p>More and more people emerged from the caravan to practice, but we stopped in front of a lonely light blue wagon that showed a bit of wear. Painted words had been scraped off recently and violently. Criminy removed a ring of skeleton keys from another of the mysterious pockets of his coat, selected one, and worked the door open. It was musty and dark inside, with broken furniture jumbled about. There was a distinct smell of dog. My nose wrinkled.</p><p>\u201cSorry, love,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wolfboy left it a bit of a mess before he ran off.\u201d</p><p>He led me inside and pushed a button on the wall. A series of lamps buzzed into life, bathing the dark room in flickering orange light and revealing old wallpaper with black velvet stripes over shiny silver.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s considered a good size,\u201d he said, \u201cfor someone just cutting her teeth. We\u2019ll beat the rugs, wash the linen, fix the furniture. Good as new by bedtime. Will it suit you?\u201d</p><p>I walked around, touching things. A dainty chair had been reduced to a pile of kindling, and the stuffing was popping out of a silk couch in parallel rips. It was going to take a lot of work to make it livable, but I wasn\u2019t going to mention my doubts about his powers as a magician or a taskmaster. Everyone we\u2019d passed on our walk had bowed or curtsied with deep and somewhat fearful respect. Criminy Stain was a man who made things happen.</p><p>\u201cSo long as I have a safe place to sleep, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease tell me pajamas here don\u2019t lace up to the neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe door locks from the inside,\u201d he said, pointing out four different types of locks on the front door. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only entrance. No windows. Made for Pinkies, you see. But we\u2019ll get you a clockwork as soon as possible, too, to stand guard.\u201d</p><p>His eyes traveled over my dress like those of a dog looking in the window of a butcher shop. \u201cYou can sleep in whatever you like,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I blushed and pretended to inspect a painting in a gilt frame. It showed a herd of elephants trampling a lion.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cNow that we\u2019re alone, I\u2019d like you to try glancing,\u201d he said. \u201cAs your employer, I need to know what you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt was more something that happened to me, not something I did on purpose. I didn\u2019t mean to touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry,\u201d he said, and he took my left hand, the one with the compass stained on the palm. He looked into my eyes as he slowly unbuttoned the three buttons and pulled each finger of my glove to loosen it. I just stood there, mesmerized and breathing faster. With a sly smile that made my legs feel like jelly, he brought the glove to his mouth and gently bit the tip of the middle finger. As he held my wrist in one hand, he slowly removed the glove with his teeth. I have no idea how I managed to remain standing, as it was possibly the sexiest thing that had ever happened to me. And our skin hadn\u2019t even touched.</p><p>The glove dropped to the floor, and he guided my bare hand to the open neck of his shirt. He closed his eyes just before I touched him, his head falling back.</p><p>And then the jolt.</p><p>In a second, I saw it, the image filling my mind and threatening to burst out of me. I gasped and fell to my knees. He followed me to the floor and held me by the shoulders as if I was going to fly apart.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it? Letitia, are you all right? What did you see?\u201d he said, searching my face as I blinked with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d he said.</p><p>I was silent. He lifted me back to my unsteady feet, and we stared at each other, another contest of wills.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. I wasn\u2019t getting out of this one so easily.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what I saw,\u201d I finally admitted. \u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I couldn\u2019t tell him that I was shaken to the core.</p><p>I shrugged away from his grasp and picked my glove up off the floor. I turned my back as I slipped it on and clumsily buttoned it. It was as intimate as dressing after a one-night stand, and I couldn\u2019t face him until my hand was safely covered again. But I felt his eyes on my back, exerting his power. Or trying to.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me, love? Was it something bad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you,\u201d I repeated dumbly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, if it\u2019s important, I need to know,\u201d he said. \u201cWas it the Coppers? A fire? Imprisonment? Poison? Draining? Death?\u201d He paused and, with a defiant tilt of his head, asked, \u201cOr did you see something of my past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not accustomed to being exasperated,\u201d he said, his voice ragged with feeling. \u201cI don\u2019t want to force you to tell me, but I will, if I must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t force me to do anything,\u201d I said. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>He spun me back around to face him, and the look on his face was terrifying and more than a little thrilling. Anger and danger and excitement and desire were eloquent in his sharply cut features. No one ever had power over him, and now I did, an insignificant Pinky. A human.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said. \u201cNothing is going to happen to the caravan. It\u2019s my problem, not yours.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on my shoulders, and I could feel the tension between us through the gloves and the thick brocade, like magnets that couldn\u2019t decide whether to repel or attract.</p> <p>\u201cYour problems are my problems, for as long as you\u2019re in this world,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? I brought you here. I\u2019m responsible for you. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I barked. \u201cYou don\u2019t own me.\u201d I tried to jerk away from him, but he held me tightly, his hands as strong as iron wrapped in velvet.</p><p>Jeff had called me his responsibility, his baby, his darling. His, his, his. My instinct was to run away from Criminy, too. Still, I sensed that he meant something different when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d But whatever those words meant in this world, whatever they meant to him, I wouldn\u2019t let myself give in.</p><p>I tugged away, but he only held tighter, and my heart wasn\u2019t in it. The vision had stolen my fire. Part of me was tempted just to melt into him. Sure, I felt what he felt, the energy and heat and inexplicable longing between us. But underneath it, at the very core of me, was a fierce need for freedom. A stubborn rebelliousness.</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t forget the constant worry about Nana, far away in another place, waiting for me, needing comfort and care that only I could give. I had a life there, in my other world, a life I was just starting to rebuild. This new, confusing vision of my future was just too much. I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not yours. I don\u2019t even work for you yet. My name is Tish Everett, and I belong to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, pet,\u201d he said, taking a menacing step closer. \u201cYou belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and pulled his top hat from somewhere inside his coat. He beat it against his leg once and twirled it up onto his head. Then he looked at me with eyes full of secrets and grasped both of my hands. Warmth bloomed between the gloves, a whisper of cloth always between us.</p><p>\u201cThink what you will, love, but you know what they say of glancers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I said, looking down to avoid his burning gaze.</p><p>\u201cThey can see everyone\u2019s future but their own.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and shook my head.</p><p>He was wrong again, though. Touching him, I had seen what would happen to me.</p><p>And I was scared.</p><p>7</p><p>It was a long, charged moment, him waiting for me to look up, me waiting for him to let go. When the knock came at the door, his hands dropped, and my eyes opened. We stepped away from each other. I crossed my arms over my chest and tried to compose myself. He smoothed his hair and kicked a chair, reducing it to another stack of scrap wood.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he said, composed and commanding once again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to interrupt, sir,\u201d came a high, twitchy voice. \u201cBut you summoned me?\u201d</p><p>The head that poked through the door seemed alien, until I realized that the man was wearing leather aviator\u2019s goggles that covered his head and neck. His eyes were rendered huge, and he blinked fearfully and hiccupped like a screech owl on speed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Vil,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cPlease see to it that this wagon is made habitable for our newest star. By tonight.\u201d</p><p>The man pulled a worn journal and a brass pen from his flapping leather jacket and licked the tip of the pen, saying, \u201cAnd what\u2019s to be painted on the side, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave it say, \u2018Lady Letitia, Fortune-Teller,\u2019\u201d Criminy said grandly. \u201cIf that suits you, of course.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a lady, and I don\u2019t know if I can actually tell fortunes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say you are and you can,\u201d he said to me. \u201cAnd paint it burgundy to match mine, Vil,\u201d he added. \u201cWith gold lettering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, of c-course,\u201d the man stuttered before disappearing.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like an awful lot of trouble,\u201d I said softly. \u201cEspecially if I can\u2019t be what you want me to be. If I leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cUnless you have an enormous natural talent for magic or you know how to open a door to your world, which is one of many. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. Not for a few hundred years, at least. Best get comfortable, love. You\u2019re a gypsy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... Me? A fortune-telling gypsy? It\u2019s laughable,\u201d I said, staring at my feet and blushing.</p><p>He spun me around by my shoulders and whipped a dusty sheet from a full-length mirror. Claws had raked across the surface, leaving four slashes that gouged across the silver and into the ornate frame. The wolfboy must have been furious.</p><p>And there we were.</p><p>It was a vision, like those phony portraits tourists have made of themselves dressed as knights or Old West whores, except it was real. He stood behind me, his gloves framing my shoulders, and together we were resplendent. Where I was lush and curved, flush with blood and paint and glitter, he was spare and elegant and hard as glass. The fascinator\u2019s skull winked from my piled hair, and my face rose from the high, tight neck of the gown like a full moon over a dark landscape.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Laughable\u2019 isn\u2019t the word I\u2019d use,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said, turning my head back and forth, trying to convince myself that it was real.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you are where you came from,\u201d he said, \u201cwhatever you think you are, here, you\u2019re a lady and a glancer and a gypsy. And true glancers are rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I see something when I touch them\u2014something I don\u2019t want to see?\u201d I asked. \u201cSomething horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can help them avert trouble, like you did with Mrs. Cleavers, then you\u2019re performing a vital service,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll pay for it. Not everyone in this world is happy and safe. Most aren\u2019t, actually. If you can\u2019t see anything or if you see something unavoidably wretched, learn to lie well. You\u2019ll pick it up quick, and you can practice on the carnivalleros tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never performed,\u201d I said. \u201cI get stage fright.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a pocket watch from his vest and, after checking and winding it, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t open for another day. With a little practice, you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my alternative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour alternative?\u201d He said it slowly, letting the word roll out in a deadly warning.</p><p>\u201cYes. If I don\u2019t want to live here and put on a goofy turban and read palms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving second thoughts, love?\u201d</p><p>Hands on hips, he considered his boots. I chose the strongest-looking chair and sat, a puff of dust rising around me.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want what I offer\u2014what you\u2019ve already agreed to\u2014you\u2019ve got two choices. Strike out on your own and be eaten by the woodland creatures, leaving behind an awfully pretty skeleton. Or I can take you to the next city and turn you over to the Coppers while you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow to explain it?\u201d He sat down on the ruined chaise and leaned over a low, oval table. With one gloved fingertip, he drew a rabbit in the dust. \u201cThis world of ours, it runs on blood. There used to be balance, but now there are too many of us. Something changed, and all of the animals turned on one another until every creature running wild had fangs.\u201d He drew fangs on the rabbit and then snapped, and there were suddenly dozens of tiny, fanged rabbits in the dust.</p><p>He had made dust bunnies. I grinned. But he was serious.</p><p>\u201cSo the Pinkies took every normal animal they could catch and put them behind high fences, where nothing could turn them. Cities were fortified, with mazes of walls around their precious cattle and hogs and sheep. Now the city folk spend every second with clothing tightly laced around throats and wrists to keep from rousing the Bludmen they can\u2019t avoid and high boots to crush the bludrats that they can never quite eradicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds horrible,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI happen to agree,\u201d he said with a wry smile. \u201cBut a few hundred years ago, one of the strongest cities elected a group to maintain the balance between blood drinkers and supposed innocents. The Copper Equilibrium Consortium, they called it. Because, of course, blood tastes of copper and is worth money, which is made of copper. So clever. And it spread from city to city until the Coppers took complete power. They make rules. They punish rule breakers. And they make sure that the blood drinkers, whether animals or Bludmen, never gain control. Of anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo the Bludmen in the city\u2014are they like normal people?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWhat\u2019s normal, love? They run businesses and accept vials of blood as payment, as we do. But they\u2019re tamed, cowed, perverted, as I see it. The Pinkies love it, because blood is, after all, a renewable resource. But any Bludman found drinking directly from a Pinky is immediately destroyed.\u201d</p><p>I could hear the disgust in his tone. He leaned over and wrote some strange figures in the dust between the bunnies, and when he snapped, a moth popped into existence and fluttered around my head.</p><p>\u201cDomesticated, as colorful and benign as parrots,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not tame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cI\u2019m a gypsy. A rogue. Wicked as they come. The caravan has a special certificate that allows us to travel as we wish and stop outside of cities and villages. I make my own rules, save one: None of my people can feed on Pinkies. Customers use money or vials of blood to buy their tickets, and in return, they get to rub elbows with monsters and freaks, walk the fine line of danger absent in their gilded cage. We give them excitement; they give us the food we crave.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, low and bitter. \u201cSometimes I think we\u2019re just mutual parasites, feeding on each other in an endless, vicious, flawed cycle. There\u2019s a little too much magic in this world, maybe. But shows like ours are one of the last reminders of a life free from control.\u201d</p> <p>Funny. The life he was offering me, the one I resisted so strongly, was based on freedom. We both wanted the same thing, yet he didn\u2019t seem to understand that love was itself a cage, and I wasn\u2019t ready to hear that gilded door snap shut. I reached out a hand, tentative, and barely brushed his arm. He smiled at me and leaned to kiss my glove.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind me, love. Getting all philosophical. I\u2019ve never had someone to talk to before. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, too. It was a tender moment, a peek behind his mask. And a glimpse at what my life would be like outside of his caravan. Unlike in my world and my time, I had to admit to myself that in Sang, a woman couldn\u2019t be both independent and safe, whether she was full of blood or hungry for it. And then my confined stomach grumbled, making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cBut enough of philosophy,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s feed you.\u201d</p><p>It was noon, and the dining car was crowded with hungry carnivalleros. Little booths lined both sides of the long wagon. At one end, a short buffet served stew, bread, and little crabapples. At the other end sat a small table, covered with a cloth of mauve paisley. A mysteriously smoking black cauldron squatted on the cloth, and I watched as Criminy reached in for a small glass tube of red liquid.</p><p>Blood.</p> <p>\u201cIs that all you eat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d he said mysteriously. \u201cTwo vials a day, when possible, but I can subsist comfortably on one, as long as it\u2019s human. With animals, it takes much more to satisfy. Without any blood, I could last a few weeks if I had to, although I\u2019d be weak and peevish and eventually wither to nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s not diseased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s diseased?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSurely you have diseases here?\u201d I asked, dumbfounded. \u201cColds, flu, rickets, measles. Plain old infections. Any sort of sickness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf a person doesn\u2019t eat or drink, he gets sick. Is it different, in your world?\u201d</p><p>I, a nurse, had landed in a world without viruses or bacteria. Was that even possible?</p><p>Carrying my tray, he guided me to a larger, curtained booth in a corner. We slid in, one on either side of the table, and he fiddled with the curtains until we were in a cozy little nook lit by a buzzing orange lamp, the thick velvet muffling the sounds outside. The king\u2019s table.</p> <p>I had forgotten to get a drink and started looking around for something, but Criminy smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be wanting wine, won\u2019t you? Just a moment, love.\u201d</p><p>As he left me alone in the private nook, I pondered a world without illness. How was I going to describe modern medicine to a blood drinker living in a world of clockwork machines and magic?</p><p>Goblet in hand, he slid back into our booth.</p><p>I took a sip of sweet red wine and said, \u201cWhere I come from, people get sick with diseases caused by tiny, invisible monsters called viruses and bacteria. But there are no blood drinkers and no magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvisible monsters but no magic,\u201d he said, thoughtful.</p><p>He removed the cork from his vial and poured it into his own goblet, swirling it around. The thick red liquid clung to the glass, and he sipped it politely. My gorge rose, and I dropped my eyes to my stew, which smelled divine.</p><p>\u201cNo magic,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut lots of science. We have huge buildings called hospitals where doctors work, and they can do all sorts of surgery and fix people on the brink of death. When a person loses a lot of blood, they can replace it with someone else\u2019s donated blood. And you can get sick by sharing diseased blood.\u201d</p><p>He seemed charmed. \u201cThat\u2019s fascinating,\u201d he said. \u201cA world where people go around giving each other blood, but no one wants to drink it.\u201d Then he gazed at me, a soft light in his eyes. \u201cWere you happy, where you came from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was starting to be,\u201d I said, \u201calthough there were always challenges. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was maybe a little sad, before,\u201d he said quietly. He reached out to stroke my hand, a gesture so fast and light that I wondered if I had imagined it. \u201cI\u2019m one who always yearns, in any case.\u201d</p><p>We ate for a while in companionable silence. Or I ate, and he occasionally sipped at his glass, his lips stained bright red.</p><p>\u201cYou know, in my world, blood drinkers are storybook monsters,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, delighted. \u201cThat\u2019s marvelous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are stories about blood drinkers called vampires, who are supposedly dead. Some people think they can turn into bats or fly and that they\u2019re afraid of crosses and mirrors and garlic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what you called me earlier. But that sounds nothing like a Bludman, apart from the drinking blood bit,\u201d he said, then grinned slyly. \u201cOf all the things you could accuse me of, being dead is definitely not one of them.\u201d</p><p>I sputtered a little and changed the subject. \u201cThis stew is delicious,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegetables, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cPotatoes. And bludbunny. They\u2019re the easiest things to catch. Cook just takes off a glove and stands around, and they come running. Bop \u2019em on the head, and dinner\u2019s on the table.\u201d</p><p>My spoon clattered to the table.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m eating something that might have eaten a person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. Not that it matters. Everything eats living things. Bludbunnies mostly eat each other, when they aren\u2019t mating to make more bludbunnies, which is what they do most of the time. Blood is good for the constitution, pet,\u201d he said.</p><p>I should have been more grossed out, but I wasn\u2019t. Maybe it was the hunger talking, but the stew was wonderful, fragrant and thick. If I hadn\u2019t been wearing a very restrictive corset, I would have gone back for seconds. As it was, I finished chewing a hard, tart apple as he drank the last drops of blood from his glass, and we smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe wine is lovely, too,\u201d I said. \u201cSweet, like berries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a special vintage,\u201d he said. \u201cA gypsy secret.\u201d</p><p>I noticed that before he flipped the curtains back, he did that same move where he shook like a wet dog throwing water, and his entire persona changed from the open, curious, tender but dark man I saw in private to the sly, hard-edged, imperial gypsy he appeared to be in public.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said wolfishly. \u201cTime to shine.\u201d</p><p>As he stood in front of the assembled carnivalleros in the grass outside, I was amazed at the change in his figure. He wasn\u2019t actually a large man, but he now seemed larger than life, a born showman. He paced for a moment, lithe as a jungle cat, inspecting the crowd, then stopped, facing us, and threw something invisible onto the ground.</p><p>Purple smoke enveloped him, and the audience rustled around me where I stood, front and center. But no one gasped. They were carnies. They weren\u2019t easy to impress.</p><p>When the smoke cleared, he stood on a colorful pedestal in a sequin-spangled coat, high collar, and tight black breeches, the perfect ringmaster. He removed his top hat, revealing Pemberly the clockwork monkey sitting on his head. She doffed her fez, and fireworks erupted from underneath, showering us with streamers and glitter.</p><p>The people around me dusted the little bits of paper off their shoulders with a grumble, but as the paper fell to the ground, each piece flickered into a butterfly. The swarm of color rose around us, quivering, and then flickered into the afternoon sky, spelling, \u201cWelcome Lady Letitia, Fortune-Teller.\u201d</p><p>The crowd laughed and clapped, and the people around me patted me on the back with gloved hands. Mrs. Cleavers gave me a push, propelling me toward Criminy, who gave me a hand up onto the pedestal. I smiled nervously.</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d he said, his voice booming. \u201cAllow me to introduce Lady Letitia, glancer extraordinaire and world traveler.\u201d</p><p>Technically, I suppose, it was the truth.</p><p>My eyes roamed the crowd, trying to take in all the strangeness. Everyone I had met so far was there, smiling in welcome. There were probably thirty of them, all told, and I had many people left to meet. Oddly, I didn\u2019t have a bit of stage fright. Standing before them seemed natural, and I struck a pose, hands in the air, and flashed my most brilliant smile.</p><p>And then everything went black.</p><p>8</p><p>My eyelids fluttered, fighting to stay closed. So hard to wake up. Impossible.</p><p>The world faded to black. An awful, sulfury smell made my eyes water, and then Criminy\u2019s concerned face swam up against the blue sky.</p><p>\u201cLetitia, love, where are you?\u201d</p><p>Then blackness descended again. I heard an annoying song like mad puppets playing the kazoo. I hadn\u2019t asked Criminy\u2014were there fairies or gnomes or other magic creatures roaming around Sang? And if so, did any of them play kazoos? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My body shook, and my teeth chattered together. I needed to find the gnomes with the kazoos and smash them.</p><p>Something dug into my chest and prickled before I could breathe again. It was a familiar feeling, and I realized that Mr. Surly had just jumped off of his favorite sleeping perch: me. And in the background, still the maddening music kept repeating.</p><p>I blinked again.</p> <p>My cell phone. Nana\u2019s special ring.</p><p>The familiar outlines of my bedroom materialized from the darkness. The foot of the bed, the lamp, the overly large numbers on the alarm clock. 2:21 a.m.</p><p>Ring, ring.</p><p>I rolled over and groped on the night table for my phone.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTish, are you OK, sugar?\u201d came Nana\u2019s worried voice.</p><p>Why was she worried about me, when she was the one calling at 2:21 in the morning?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Nana,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a nightmare,\u201d she said. She sounded as if she was annoyed with herself. \u201cAnd I woke up with heart palpitations. Do I need to worry about that, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty normal to wake up from a bad nightmare feeling like your heart is hammering,\u201d I said, trying to sound patient and not worried. When someone was as old as Nana and in such poor health, almost anything could be a bad sign. But I never wanted her to know that. I needed to take her mind off her heart, help her relax. \u201cWhat was the dream about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sugar, you were lost, somewhere far away,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you were lying on a road in an old dress, and these big red rats were eating on you. It was the most horrible thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>A shiver crawled over my skin. I hadn\u2019t asked Criminy what color bludrats were, but now I could guess. I had also never asked him if glancing\u2014or other sorts of prognostication\u2014ran in families.</p><p>\u201cWell, Nana, I can give you a one-hundred-percent guarantee that I\u2019m safe in my apartment, asleep with my cat,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just fine. And you\u2019ll be fine, too. Do you think you\u2019ll be able to go back to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could only get up,\u201d she said peevishly, \u201cI\u2019d go make me a cup of chamomile tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you one first thing in the morning,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t need it then,\u201d she grumbled, but I could already hear the sleep sneaking up on her. I didn\u2019t tell her, but I always slipped a little Ambien in with her nightly meds to help her sleep. \u201cNight, night, sugar,\u201d she said, her voice fading.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Nana,\u201d I answered. \u201cSleep tight.\u201d</p><p>As I closed my eyes and tossed the phone onto the comforter, I heard myself say, \u201cAnd don\u2019t let the bludrats bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming around,\u201d someone said.</p> <p>I opened my eyes. The glare was blinding, and I put up a hand to shield myself from the sun. I couldn\u2019t breathe, and I clutched at my belly. My hand crashed against brocade, the stiff stays of my corset threatening to puncture me as I gasped.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to hang up,\u201d I said stupidly, trying to swim back into whichever reality seemed easier.</p><p>\u201cLetitia, love, are you with us again?\u201d</p><p>A shadow loomed over me. It was Criminy Stain, his stark face whiter than usual and his eyes frantic and fierce with concern.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us space,\u201d he barked, and the circle of curious faces hovering over me disappeared. \u201cGo back to practice, you lazy lot.\u201d</p><p>His eyes traveled up and down my body, checking for damage. I wiggled my toes for him before I realized that he couldn\u2019t actually see my toes.</p><p>He stroked my face with a gloved finger, saying, \u201cYou scared me, pet. You fainted and fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would explain why my arm is bruised,\u201d I said, rubbing my elbow.</p><p>In hindsight, I think that was when I finally understood that I wasn\u2019t dreaming. You don\u2019t get bruises in dreams. You don\u2019t ache. And you definitely don\u2019t sit around talking about where you went when you wake up, afterward.</p><p>\u201cWe thought you were asleep, but we couldn\u2019t wake you,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou came back for a moment with Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s smelling salts, but your eyes rolled back, and you were gone again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I remember that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all fuzzy. Something stank.\u201d</p><p>He smiled tenderly and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it. But you\u2019ve cemented your flair for the dramatic. The nosy buggers think you went into a glancing trance and will wake up with tidings of doom.\u201d Then he whispered, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me stand,\u201d I said. \u201cI need air.\u201d</p><p>He scooped me up as if I weighed nothing and placed me on my feet. I wobbled a bit. We attempted a dignified stroll toward his trailer. He was mostly carrying me, actually.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cPut me down. I need to walk. My feet are all pins and needles.\u201d</p><p>He set me down and waited for me to stop swaying, then offered his arm. We set off for the open field in the opposite direction of the wagon tracks. My skirt tangled around my legs, and I had to kick it to make a trail through the grass.</p><p>When we were well away from the caravan, I said, \u201cI was back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in your original world, you mean?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, in my own bed, in my pajamas, with a big fat cat on my chest, waking from a dream at two twenty-one in the morning. As if this was a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat woke you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy phone was ringing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone. It\u2019s a machine for communicating. My grandmother thought she was sick. It was hard to open my eyes, though, and it felt like this world was trying to tug me back. I saw you here, for just a second, but then I was there again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the salts worked,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI did what I had to. Assessed the situation as a professional, made Nana feel better, and promised to make her tea in the morning. And then I was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>We walked for a while, each lost in thought, a light breeze stirring the ringlets that had fallen from my hairdo when I collapsed. At one point, he stopped to remove his sequined coat, revealing the black one I had worn earlier underneath. With a coy smile, he folded the sequined cloth again and again until it was the size of a handkerchief, and then he stuffed it into one of the inside pockets of the black coat. I grinned, as delighted as a child, knowing that his magic would never seem quotidian to me, no matter how accustomed I became to his strange world.</p><p>\u201cSo the real question is, why did you go back?\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cNo, the real question is, how do I get back to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument, that both worlds are real. If every time I sleep here, I\u2019m awake there, and every time I sleep there, I\u2019m awake here, I\u2019m going to go crazy. If there are no real dreams, if my brain can\u2019t rest, it\u2019ll be torture.\u201d</p><p>I kicked a rabbit that was sniffing at my boot. Tears welled up in my eyes, and I hugged myself and turned away from him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, love. We\u2019ll find a way,\u201d he said gently, moving close to draw me into a hug. With my back against his body and his arms around me, I relaxed a little. Whether it was his smell or just the closeness of another person, I couldn\u2019t stop the words from tumbling out, couldn\u2019t help unburdening myself of what I was feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying because I\u2019m sad. I\u2019m just so relieved. If it\u2019s back and forth, that means I\u2019ll still see my grandmother. I was so scared that I would be trapped here forever, and my grandmother would worry about me and mourn me and die alone. But it looks like I get to live both lives, even though it makes no sense and will probably make me completely insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsanity isn\u2019t too bad.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI know plenty of mad people, and they get on fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are so many questions,\u201d I said, sobbing. \u201cIf I die in this world, do I die in that world? What if I go unconscious while driving? What if I\u2019m asleep there, and a patient dies because I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, pet. But I\u2019ll try to find out. I\u2019ve got some old books I can check,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps this has happened before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no magic in my world,\u201d I said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a disease called narcolepsy. People just fall asleep standing up wherever they are for no good reason. Maybe this is where they go. Maybe I\u2019m a narcoleptic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne might think it\u2019s the best of both worlds, no pun intended,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>\u201cBut I want a choice,\u201d I said.</p><p>I jerked away from him and stumbled, and when he tried to steady me, I swatted him away.</p><p>\u201cLook, I have commitment issues, OK? I had a fianc\u00e9, and he almost destroyed me. He treated me like a child, or a doll. He hit me. I was barely a person. And then I decided to fight back, never to be controlled again. And now here I am, trapped.\u201d</p><p>He watched my outburst with concern, hands in pockets and mouth drawn down. I kept expecting him to interrupt and tell me how to fix my problems, the way Jeff would have. Instead, he just listened.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I like it here better? Nothing\u2019s ever equal. What if I spend all my time there longing for Sang and every moment in Sang feeling guilty for not wanting to go back to Earth? What if I start to care about someone, what if I start to care about you? I could never make the choice to stay here. My grandmother needs me. Without me, she\u2019ll quit fighting, just give up and die. It would rip me in half!\u201d</p><p>I plunked to the ground, the skirt of my dress billowing out around me like a burgundy mushroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d I sniffled. \u201cI can\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>Dropping to the ground beside me, he said, \u201cI beg to disagree, love. It is fair, and you can win.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just too used to playing by the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my world, if you don\u2019t follow the rules, bad things happen,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cIn my world, which is now halfway your world, there are ways around everything. Loopholes. Nudging a toe over the line,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t nudge a toe over from one world to the other. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as I see it, no one gets much of a choice, and everyone is forced to live between worlds, and you\u2019ve got it a good deal better than most. After all, if you haven\u2019t any choice, you must capitulate, and there\u2019s a comfort in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds a lot like being trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d he said. \u201cTake me, for example. I drink blood. But I\u2019m forced to live in a world that perverts my natural nature, reduces me to measured sips from a cold glass instead of deep gulps of hot, pulsing life. You think that\u2019s easy for a creature? It\u2019s like giving you a sandwich made of one onion and two pieces of parchment. Keeps you alive, barely. But I\u2019ve found a way to make the best of things, beat them at their own game. I live by my own rules. You can do that, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a gift here, a rare one. That gives you power and, as long as you travel with me, prestige. You won\u2019t want for the things you need, you won\u2019t go hungry. That\u2019s a lot more than most people can say. And hell, pet, maybe you\u2019ll learn to love me. Perhaps not. But what woman in any world wouldn\u2019t give her little finger to have the love of one good man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man?\u201d I asked, eyebrows raised in surprise.</p><p>\u201cDepends on the criteria,\u201d he said with a grin. He looked down and said more soberly, \u201cBut I\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time. Whether you believe it nor or not, you\u2019ll discover one day that we\u2019re two halves of a whole. I just have to keep you close and alive long enough to learn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You think we\u2019re going to live happily ever after, like some stupid fairy tale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His stare dared me to laugh or, worse, to argue.</p> <p>\u201cBecause the whole thing is ridiculous,\u201d I said. I despised the bitterness in my own voice. I sounded so damaged. Good. If he thought I was his soul mate for some mysterious reason he wouldn\u2019t let on, let him see the worst of me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ridiculous to me. Perhaps that\u2019s the difference between predators and prey, love. I\u2019ll never stop hunting. But I expect that one day, you\u2019ll stop running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you want to live.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, trying to puzzle out the monster from the man. He looked so confident and graceful, even squatting in the grass. His grin mixed darkness with humor, hunger with promise. Something in me yearned toward him, it\u2019s true. But what did he see in me? I was confused, stubborn, rude, naive, untrusting. I was straddling two worlds, and it was getting increasingly harder to separate Tish from Letitia. I had just learned to see myself as something other than what Jeff had made me. Caught between Sang and my other life, what sort of person would I become?</p><p>What\u2019s more, I hadn\u2019t told Criminy what I\u2019d seen when my hand touched his skin, the vision of our future, of my ultimate destiny. Of my doom.</p><p>I shivered involuntarily, staring into the distance.</p><p>In two worlds, I had seen only one future. And for the life of me, I didn\u2019t know how to stop it.</p> <p>9</p><p>As the afternoon sun slunk over the moors, we remained in the grass. We were only three feet from each other but acres apart. I\u2019d kicked more bunnies than I could count. The last one had been brazen, hopping over a dazed comrade to nibble my bootlace. I picked it up by the ears and launched it at the pink clouds with a feral howl.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything in this world that is what it seems?\u201d I said. \u201cIsn\u2019t anything simple at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve found,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you must admit it\u2019s colorful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may be colorful, but I\u2019d rather it was easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy things are worth nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should know that. Is your other world easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time,\u201d I had to admit.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a trade, or do you live with your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nurse,\u201d I said, feeling huffy. \u201cI help sick people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can stop the diseases?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I mostly help the people who are already dying, trying to make their last days comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou help people die,\u201d he mused. \u201cThat sounds quite sinister, and that\u2019s coming from someone who drinks blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI help people to end their lives with dignity, in their own homes, on their own terms. I change dressings, offer them pain relief, that sort of thing. It\u2019s a calling, and it\u2019s something I\u2019m good at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they all old?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAlthough I have one patient who\u2019s only a few years older than me. Mr. Sterling was in a motorcycle crash on Christmas Day, and he never woke up. He was a concert pianist, so we always keep music playing for him.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I said the name, Criminy\u2019s attention focused on me, his gaze sharpened. \u201cYour Mr. Sterling,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s his given name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d I said softly. \u201cJason Casper Sterling.\u201d Thinking about him always made me a little sad.</p><p>Criminy glared up at the sunset, his mouth pursed and his fingers drumming on his knee. I watched him, wondering if I would ever know what was going on behind those cloudy eyes. Finally, he said, \u201cYou must be peckish, my dear. Shall we find supper?\u201d</p><p>He stood and held out his hand. I took it without thinking. We walked slowly, side by side, toward the caravan, silent. I felt we had said too much, but I expect he felt we had said too little. Neither of us had yet brought up what would happen that night, when I fell asleep. Would I dream bland dreams about forgotten tests and flying through the air, or would I wake up in my other world and make my grandmother\u2019s breakfast and go to work while my body slept here, insensible and inert?</p><p>Oh, and there was another thought. A creepy thought. If my body was here, sleeping, while I was living in my own world, I would be utterly vulnerable. Anyone could do anything to my poor body, and from what it seemed, I might not wake up in response.</p><p>\u201cYou said I\u2019d have a clockwork guard, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cMurdoch\u2019s been working on it all day,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you like snakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any personally,\u201d I said slowly, then, \u201cWait\u2014my clockwork is a snake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonkeys are complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes more than a day to fit one. They have personality, you know. But a snake is flexible, fast, and good for protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s not some giant boa constrictor,\u201d I said.</p><p>I eyed an enormous clockwork bear juggling balls as it rode a unicycle. It was shaped like a polar bear but had copper markings around its eyes like a panda bear. Along with all the clockwork animals, Herr Sigebert had emerged from his wagon that afternoon for oiling and polishing. We had already passed a brass giraffe doing a bizarre contortionist dance and a silver and black ostrich that laid, and then ate, a golden egg. The creatures were surprisingly realistic, beautiful, and more than a little eerie, with softly glowing eyes that actually blinked.</p><p>\u201cNo, your clockwork will be something small. Wouldn\u2019t be useful if it was ungainly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too horrible,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about your body, aren\u2019t you? While you\u2019re away,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnything could happen to me,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I might never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t. I\u2019ll be there tonight. I\u2019ll guard you myself. Until we know more about how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful ...\u201d I began, and I trailed my hand along a royal blue car with a brighter, greener version of the lizard boy painted on it. I didn\u2019t really have the words to continue.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re worried about locking your unconscious body in a wagon with a known killer and probable lecher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there someone else you\u2019d prefer?\u201d His tone was guarded, but I could hear the dare behind his words.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, opting for honesty. \u201cFor some strange reason, I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart lass,\u201d he said.</p><p>We\u2019d reached the dining car by then, and he held the door open for me. I stepped up and in, and he followed and took my arm. But instead of leading me to the buffet, he escorted me to a man sitting alone in a booth. He was handsome, that man, staring out the window, lost in thought, fingers tapping on the table, his long hair cascading down his back in light brown waves. His poet\u2019s blouse was open at the neck, the sleeves pushed up to bare elbows. Instead of breeches, he wore trousers cut off at the calf. He was barefoot, and after one day in Sang, I was a little scandalized. He had to be a Bludman, and a cheeky one at that.</p><p>\u201cLetitia, my love,\u201d Criminy said affably, \u201cthis is Casper, our harpsichordist.\u201d</p><p>The man blinked away his daydreams and turned with a slightly annoyed smile, saying, \u201cNice to meet you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I cried, cutting him off mid-sentence.</p><p>I\u2019d never seen the sapphire-blue eyes blinking at me from their delicate fringe of auburn lashes. But I knew the mouth, the raven tattoo on his forearm, and especially the long, agile fingers constantly tapping out phantom notes on the booth\u2019s table. I\u2019d cut those fingernails back for months.</p><p>\u201cHave we met before?\u201d he asked, polite but confused.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI just ...\u201d I looked to Criminy, who was irritatingly amused. I was amazed, flummoxed, and more than a little vexed that he had sprung this chance meeting on me. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d I asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo I know what?\u201d Casper said, starting to get irritated, too.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re a Stranger,\u201d Criminy said matter-of-factly with a charming smile.</p><p>Casper shrugged. \u201cEveryone in the caravan knows.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s one, too,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cAnd she knows you.\u201d</p><p>With a pat on my arm, he smugly strolled down the dining car and slid into a booth next to a nervous and twitching Vil. Probably getting an update on the trailer he was going to lock me into later, the sly bastard. I could feel his eyes on my back from all the way across the wagon.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Casper said, gesturing to the empty seat across the table. I slid in. With Criminy out of hearing range, the man before me seemed to open up and relax. And smolder. \u201cYou\u2019re from America? Because I don\u2019t think I know you. I\u2019m sure I would have remembered.\u201d He searched my face, and I searched his, too. His face was ... very searchable.</p><p>It was amazing, the difference between a pale, wasting, inert body and a living, breathing man. The Mr. Sterling I knew had a shaved head and scrawny arms and drooled. But the Casper before me was tanned and gorgeous, like a poetic version of Robinson Crusoe. And I couldn\u2019t believe how many sponge baths I\u2019d given him, without him even knowing it. I caught my eyes wandering down his open shirt and snapped my gaze back up to his face. I had to tell him something unpleasant, but I didn\u2019t want him to stop smiling that gorgeous, movie-star smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no good way to say this, but I\u2019m your nurse in our world. You had a motorcycle accident six months ago, and now you\u2019re brain-dead. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrain-dead,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cFigures. My mom told me that bike would kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked. I had to know.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. I just showed up here on the ground one day, naked. After the first rabbit bit me, I kept a big branch with me. Killed a deer with it, too. And then I came across a body without a drop of blood on it or in it. I put on his clothes and wandered around until I found the caravan. When Master Stain heard my story and saw me play the harpsichord, he offered me a wagon and a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he asked with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true. I\u2019m a concert pianist, and these people have never heard of Beethoven or Mozart. They think I\u2019m a god!\u201d</p><p>I had to giggle at that. He was gorgeous and charming in a gentle, bluff sort of way\u2014the complete opposite of Criminy\u2019s dangerous allure. I liked him immediately and felt at home in his presence, as if we\u2019d known each other forever. I leaned closer.</p> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your story?\u201d He smiled, showing dimples. Was he actually flirting with me? I was suddenly self-conscious and had to resist the urge to fiddle with my hair.</p><p>I told him my own story, from locket to fainting. But I left out the part about how I was supposed to be Criminy\u2019s magic mail-order bride.</p><p>\u201cAre you really stuck here?\u201d Casper asked anxiously. I got the feeling he wanted me to say yes.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, pet. Are you stuck?\u201d Criminy asked, appearing suddenly at my side and sweeping me out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cWhat choice do I have?\u201d I called over my shoulder as Criminy\u2019s arm snaked around my waist and whisked me away to a steaming basket of what looked and smelled like fried chicken but was probably extra-crispy bludbunny.</p><p>I was more than a little distracted and kept stealing glances at Casper. He leaned back in his booth, smiling at me with dimples as he flipped a coin back and forth over his knuckles. After I fumbled my fork to the floor, Criminy sighed and took over, filling my plate and guiding me to our private booth. He lashed the curtains closed more forcefully than necessary.</p><p>\u201cLad was acting a bit familiar,\u201d he said, swirling the blood in his goblet with narrowed eyes. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak to anyone much. I think I preferred him when he was sulky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know him,\u201d I said, still amazed. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of his body for months. And he\u2019s been here all along\u2014his mind has, at least. What a strange coincidence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually think it\u2019s a coincidence, love,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cI take in whatever Strangers I find, if I can use them. I like to confound the Coppers, and misfits go well with misfits. He found us quite near here, so perhaps locations in your world coordinate somehow with locations in Sang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you took him in just because he was a Stranger?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd because of his songs. Starting to regret it a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you turn him, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Turn him? Hell, no.\u201d He laughed, one sharp note. \u201cThat\u2019s not a Bludman. Whatever made you think he was one of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way he\u2019s dressed,\u201d I said, feeling confused and silly.</p><p>\u201cAh, that,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a different story altogether. He\u2019s a clever boots, that one. You\u2019ll have to ask him one day.\u201d</p><p>By the time we finished dinner, Casper was already gone. For Criminy\u2019s sake, I tried to conceal my disappointment. We stepped into the twilight with calls of farewell from the carnivalleros, and I admired the stars as we strolled through the misty night. The constellations were very strange, and, just like the clouds, they seemed impossibly close. The moon hung like a broken dinner plate caught in the branches of a far-off tree.</p><p>We stopped in front of a burgundy wagon so shiny with moonlight that I could see myself reflected in the still-wet paint. It didn\u2019t look like the shoddy car of the ex-wolfboy, and my name wasn\u2019t painted on the side yet, but I knew it was mine.</p><p>\u201cLadies first,\u201d Criminy said with a bow.</p><p>I opened the door, careful to touch only the knob.</p><p>It was lovely inside, freshly scrubbed and smelling of roses instead of old dog. A new carpet on the floor and some scratchless furnishings had turned the little wagon into a cheerful space. Criminy gestured to an open door at the end, and I found a small bedroom with an ironwork bed covered with a patchwork quilt of shimmering silks.</p><p>\u201cIt was the best we could do on short notice,\u201d he said with his crooked smile.</p><p>I opened the door of an armoire crammed in beside the bed. Two more dresses hung there, and drawers held gloves and stockings. And, to my horror, a turban.</p><p>I held the offending item out to him on one finger, a mauve jumble of layers with a big paste jewel on the front. I raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cCostumes,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cYou get used to them.\u201d</p><p>I tossed it back into the drawer and slammed it shut.</p><p>\u201cSo what happens while I\u2019m asleep?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the other room with my books and grimoires, trying to puzzle out your peculiar condition. I don\u2019t need much sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you,\u201d I said, my gloved hand trailing over the bed. I realized how inviting the gesture might appear and jerked my hand back. He snickered, a surprisingly dark and intriguing sound that made me forget all about the handsome shipwrecked harpsichordist from my world.</p><p>\u201cWill it suit you?\u201d he asked me. I took a moment to answer, part of me enjoying his anxiety.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have much to compare it to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than any city, I promise you,\u201d he said with a sneer. \u201cFlats jammed together, everyone cheek to jowl. The air is putrid. The streets are filthy. No matter what you do, the muck gets into your pores, under your skin. Inside, it\u2019s very opulent and colorful and shiny, to make up for the darkness outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spent much time in a city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born in one. Devlin, across the sea from here. I ran away when I was nine and never went back.\u201d He paused for a moment with an odd, faraway look. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. I\u2019ve traveled with this caravan for decades, but no one\u2019s ever asked me where I came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re scared of you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd well they should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re as vicious as you think you are,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen me on a bad day,\u201d he answered. \u201cI have to keep up the show, terrify them, keep them in line. It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge, to run a band of misfits, monsters, beggars, and thieves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love it. Because it\u2019s what I am. And they\u2019re not so bad. It\u2019s you who\u2019s different. You were supposed to be my solace, my heart\u2019s ease. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you so much. I probably shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m supposed to be anything,\u201d I said, feeling touched but also weary of his assumptions. \u201cYou said you brought me here. Tell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, pet. Why don\u2019t you get undressed and into bed, and I\u2019ll tell you while you fall asleep? Maybe I can bore you to dreamland.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he slipped out the door and closed it, and I heard his footsteps creaking across the wagon. I hunted through the armoire until I found a long white nightdress. Then I realized that I couldn\u2019t get undressed by myself. But I\u2019d get as far as I could.</p><p>I unlaced the neck first, and it felt wonderful. Then the wrists. Then I was able to tug the various laces loose enough to wiggle the dress over my head. Twisting and turning to untie the corset, I caught myself in the mirror in heavy makeup, black corset, black petticoats, and black boots. I looked like the cancan dancer of the damned. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t get the corset loose enough to wriggle out.</p><p>How inconvenient.</p><p>\u201cCriminy, I need help,\u201d I said softly at the door.</p><p>His voice came from the other side, saying, \u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get the damned corset undone,\u201d I said. \u201cCan you yank out the laces? Or can you be that close to so much skin? Maybe your monkey could help?\u201d</p><p>Whoa. That didn\u2019t sound good at all. I felt my cheeks go scarlet and turned my back to the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I heard him slip into the room behind me. \u201cHave you forgotten that I found you completely unclothed this morning and managed to get you here in one piece? I told you, pet. You\u2019re different. For me.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he began pulling at the corset more roughly than I would have preferred. I concentrated on not falling over, and as I felt it loosen, I put up a hand to my chest to hold it there when he was done.</p><p>I could hear Criminy breathing, feel his eyes on my bare back. Nana\u2019s bathing suit revealed more skin than what he was seeing. But I couldn\u2019t forget that it had been three years since any man except Jeff had seen me naked. Well, if you forgot about that morning.</p> <p>In a world where people were forced to cover everything, I\u2019m guessing a bit of back was considered the height of risqu\u00e9. I was still trying to regrow my self-confidence, after Jeff\u2019s constant complaining that I was ten pounds overweight. But his ragged breath in the small space told me that Criminy Stain had no complaints whatsoever about my body.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cUm, you can go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go when I\u2019m ready,\u201d he breathed, his voice low.</p><p>I spun around, clutching the corset over my chest. I took a step toward him, trying to shoo him toward the door. He didn\u2019t budge. He looked hungry. I took a step back. Then another. His hands were in fists. He licked his lips. If there was a gentleman in there, I was losing him.</p><p>\u201cNot this way, Criminy,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes squeezed shut, and he shook himself, then stepped out the door and shut it. I didn\u2019t realize until that moment that I was scared. And excited. But I wouldn\u2019t admit anything more than that, even to myself.</p><p>As quickly as I could, I shrugged into the nightgown, dropping neither corset nor petticoats until I was covered. Still, I felt exposed and vulnerable, and I undid my boots as quickly as possible and sought the protection of the bed\u2019s covers. It was chillier in Sang than I was accustomed to.</p><p>Part of me didn\u2019t trust him, didn\u2019t want to let him into the room. The other part knew that there were worse things than Criminy Stain in the world and that he was better protection than two wooden doors and four locks.</p><p>\u201cYou can come in now,\u201d I called, and the door opened just enough to show me his face, which was carefully blank. Reserved.</p><p>\u201cWell, you look cozy,\u201d he said politely. \u201cAre you ready for a bedtime story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said. I felt very much like a child, small and fragile, with the nightgown\u2019s bow tied innocently under my neck. \u201cAm I going to like it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cDoesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does it start?\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cA long time ago, I had my heart broken by a Bludwoman in the caravan. Her name was Merissa, and she did tricks on the backs of a pair of white bludmares. She was a wicked lass, and she used me and left me for a necromancer. I was just a simple magician then, nothing more, and I was distraught. The caravan was parked near a heavy wood, and I ran away to find solace in the wilderness.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were far away, and I reached out a hand to him. He picked it up absentmindedly and held it in his glove, not noticing that the skin was bare.</p><p>\u201cOne morning, I woke up to the sound of screaming, and I found a man, naked, being attacked by a bludstag. I chased it off, of course, and nearly made a meal out of him myself, but I was too curious. He had the most peculiar haircut. We got to talking, and he told me that he was under the care of a sort of chirurgeon in his world, and they put him to sleep, and then he found himself here, in Sang. I was fascinated. I had heard of Strangers before, but I thought it was just a trick by the Coppers, an excuse to drag in anyone suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, maybe fifty years ago. Strangers were more rare then. He started to tell me about his world, but then he vanished mid-sentence. I always supposed they woke him back up. Is that normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, surgeons put people to sleep and wake them back up every day at the hospital. I wonder how many of them end up here for a little while. And do they never remember it or just assume it was a dream?\u201d</p> <p>And then I had to wonder about all the people who died mysteriously during surgery, their pulses dropping for no good reason. Had they found their own bludstags on the lonely moors of Sang?</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I had no idea what had happened. But I was very curious, so I went about making inquiries, doing research. I finally found a witch who wanted to be a Bludwoman, and we made an exchange. I gave her what she wanted, and she gave me a spell called the Drawing. I won\u2019t bore you with all the details, but I enchanted the locket and sent it away to find you in whatever world you waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of the spell involved describing exactly what I wanted, but a measure of mystery is involved, too. The Drawing is supposed to draw the other half of your soul, wherever it is. But it\u2019s tricky. You could have arrived at any time and in any place. I\u2019ve been looking for you for a long time, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s me? That there\u2019s not some other Stranger out there, working her way toward you?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat if I was meant for ... someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said darkly, and I knew that he knew what I was thinking. He sneered at the door, showing fangs. We could both hear the delicate strains of a harpsichord coming from outside. Only I knew it was a nocturne by Debussy, the notes filled with longing, a lullaby just for me.</p><p>\u201cBut what if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cLook into my eyes again.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to, because I knew what would happen. But I did anyway.</p><p>His eyes gave me the same feeling I got on roller coasters, going down the first hill. As if my stomach was being turned inside out but in a good way. Even though I knew he was of a different species, unabashedly wicked, and apparently much older than he looked, I couldn\u2019t help but feel the tug.</p><p>\u201cLike a magnet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I had to admit. \u201cBut are you saying you brought me here with magic because you were scorned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. She just made me realize that what I thought I wanted wasn\u2019t necessarily what I needed. I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life chasing shadows, waiting for someone to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Criminy Stain,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re a romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m fiendish and unscrupulous, a vicious killer and a thief and a bloodthirsty monster. And maybe a little romantic. But don\u2019t tell anyone, or my reputation\u2019s shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about me?\u201d I said. \u201cDoes it bother you that you\u2019ve reached through to another dimension and pulled out a broken woman just trying to get her life back? I was weak for so long I barely even know who I am anymore. I feel so dull compared to you. I don\u2019t understand what you see in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you in you,\u201d he said, tracing my face. \u201cAnd as we\u2019ve already learned, whatever you are in your world, you\u2019re something else entirely here. Now, if I can just get you to give up this other life of yours and love me, I\u2019ll be a very contented creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask a lot,\u201d I said, troubled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to disappointment.\u201d</p><p>He smiled warmly, gently, and leaned over to kiss my forehead.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s time for you to sleep, love,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see how you feel when you wake up.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>I rolled over and snuggled into the down pillow. Criminy turned off the light and left the room, and I heard him rustling around in the other half of the wagon. The dark pressed down on me, as oppressive as the morning sky of Sang, and before I could even think about his confession or daydream about Casper, I was asleep.</p><p>An alarm was going off somewhere far away. The insistent bleating was infuriating, and I had a vision of a bludbunny with large red numbers on its side, hopping around and beeping, trying to lure me closer so it could bite me. I wanted to find it and toss it tail over teakettle into the field until the beeping went away.</p><p>\u201cShut up, you stupid rabbit,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Then something brushed my face, and I was sure the numerical bludbunny was purring. I opened my eyes and saw Mr. Surly\u2019s blue eyes only inches away. The color was eerily similar to that of Casper\u2019s eyes, and I smiled. Dream or not, I had to admit that there were two ridiculously cute guys in Sang.</p><p>Back to reality. I got out of bed to turn off the alarm and scratch my ankle, which itched like crazy. Right where the bludbunny had nipped me, there were two puffy pink bug bites. Was it evidence that Sang was real, or did Mr. Surly have fleas?</p><p>I guess I would finally know for certain the next time I went to sleep. The alarm clock, which wasn\u2019t actually a bunny, said 7:32, so I had a little more than twelve hours before I would find out the truth. I was definitely going to bed early. I hated to admit it, but it was going to be a really long day, just waiting to go to sleep again.</p><p>All I could think about was Sang. And Criminy. And Casper.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait to visit him on my nursing rounds. Sure, his body in my world was wasted away, the mind empty. But I could look around his house with new eyes, learn more about him. When I thought of his piano and his nimble fingers stroking up and down the keyboard, I had some very unprofessional thoughts.</p><p>While I showered and got ready for work, I thought about the way I looked in the mirror after Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s ministrations, with the paint and the hair and the heavy layers of clothing. Only the locket remained, and it no longer shone. But I could open it whenever I wanted and study Criminy\u2019s face and think of his scent, red wine and vines. I sniffed my usual perfume, but it seemed rank and fake, so I didn\u2019t wear it.</p><p>While I dressed, I felt exposed in my T-shirt and scrubs. I was amazed to realize that I missed my corset, which molded my least favorite body part into a pleasing shape. I felt downright frumpy, actually. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I stared at a cabinet full of cereal trying to decide between Wheaty-O\u2019s and Oatey-Squares, I got stuck. What was the difference? It was all packaged crap, none of it real. My life felt idle, easy, bland, safe, a neutral-colored apartment crying to be beautiful and interesting. And that brought to mind the estate sale where I had found the necklace. I had to go back to Mrs. Stein\u2019s house and see what was in that bloodred book.</p><p>When I showed up at 8:30, Nana was her usual sprightly self, her early-morning nightmare and subsequent phone call forgotten. I didn\u2019t bring it up. I always took good care of her, but today I took super-extra-great care of her, making sure that she was in the best health possible.</p><p>\u201cSugar, you seem sweeter than usual. Is there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d she asked in her most innocent Southern-belle voice.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Nana,\u201d I said just as sweetly. \u201cJust doing my job for the grandma I love.\u201d And I planned on giving her an extra half an Ambien that night, hoping to keep those nightmares away.</p><p>When she was all squared away for the day, I backtracked to the estate sale. No signs, no cars in the driveway, no lights on in the house. The sale was clearly over. But I had to get that book and see if it had the answers to my double life in Sang.</p><p>I tiptoed up to the house and peeked through the window beside the front door. Lots of the stuff inside was gone. The table where people had paid for their purchases was still there, but the cash box and notebook were missing. I wondered what happened to all the things that hadn\u2019t been sold, if they had been trashed or given to Mrs. Stein\u2019s greedy kids or sold to the junk man. Surely no one would miss a grungy old book, if it was still there.</p><p>Wait, I thought. You already stole one necklace. Now you\u2019re trying to justify breaking into the house and stealing the book. What are you becoming?</p><p>I\u2019m not a thief, I told myself sternly in answer.</p> <p>You already are a thief. What\u2019s one more thing that no one wants?</p><p>Stop talking to yourself, I thought, trying to shake the voices out of my head.</p><p>I walked around the side of the house, hoping to look inconspicuous. When I glanced up and down the street, I couldn\u2019t see a single neighbor. Mrs. Stein\u2019s neighborhood was always quiet. I felt as if I was alone in a huge world. And I felt as if the house was waiting for me.</p><p>Unfortunately, I had already turned in my key. I ran around back and tried the door, which had an old-fashioned keyhole. I jiggled the knob, but the lock held. Beneath the old welcome mat, I found a key. I couldn\u2019t believe that a suspicious old biddy like Mrs. Stein had actually kept a key in such an obvious place.</p><p>The house was silent, except for the boards creaking under my nursing clogs and my heart pounding in my ears.</p><p>I ran past her closed bedroom door and up the stairs, checking every window I passed for movement outside. I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my body, and I could hear every gasp of dust and tiny groan in the ancient house. As I pounded up the dark, rickety stairs to the attic, I realized that I would be cornered up there if anyone showed up. And I\u2019d never been a very good liar.</p> <p>The bright red book was easy to spot. I didn\u2019t even stop to open it, just ran back down the stairs and out the back door, twisting the lock and slamming it shut. Once I was standing in the grass, I allowed myself to breathe again.</p><p>Just then, I heard tires crunching on gravel, and I tossed the book behind some big hydrangea bushes fighting for space against the back of the house. I walked around the corner, pretending to inspect the grass.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, young lady,\u201d came an annoyed Southern drawl. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d She was built like a ship, in a lavender power suit and black hose. Judging by her makeup, she spent her days lawyering and her weekends pushing Avon.</p><p>\u201cOh, I hope so,\u201d I said, my voice steadier than I expected. \u201cI was at the estate sale yesterday, and I think I dropped my wallet outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one turned in a wallet,\u201d she said, her shifty little eyes roving over me suspiciously. \u201cCan you describe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s light blue with flowers and a zipper.\u201d</p><p>My wallet was actually tan leather. I didn\u2019t even know why I lied to her, where the mental image of the nonexistent wallet had come from. It came to me so easily. The lies were just blooming, one after the other.</p><p>\u201cDid you buy anything with your credit card? I might have the records,\u201d she said with a cloying sweetness that told me I was being hustled. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sugar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cValerie Taylor,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t actually buy anything.\u201d</p><p>She flipped through her pink leather notebook anyway, muttering \u201cValerie Taylor, Valerie Taylor\u201d under her breath. As if it might actually be there somewhere.</p><p>\u201cNo, no record of anything. Sorry I couldn\u2019t help you. Perhaps you should take this matter to the police?\u201d She held out her arm toward our cars and put on her best hostess smile. I didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to keep hunting around the grass, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s out here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s appropriate. Private property and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said with a warm smile. \u201cBut I promise not to bother anyone. The house is empty, right?\u201d</p><p>She spluttered and turned red right down to the pearls looped around her neck. \u201cYes, well, um, but yes, well, you see ... property rights and all ... transition of ownership ... deeds ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Don\u2019t let me get in your way. I\u2019m just going to be poking around in the bushes. Thanks so much for your help, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I turned my back on her. She turned to the door, still blustering, and opened it with her own key. She had to turn sideways to get through the narrow door, and the second she disappeared, I dove for the book and dropped it into the waistband of my scrubs. I poked around in the bushes for a minute before calmly walking back to my car and driving away with Mrs. Stein\u2019s spare key still in my pocket.</p><p>That was so easy, I thought. I put my hand on the book and grinned from ear to ear.</p><p>But then my brief high of smugness was replaced with horror.</p><p>I was a thief now, and a liar, too.</p><p>Lying had been so ... natural. And so completely not like me. The normal Tish would have been terrified of the pushy old battle-ax and run back to her car, and she would have worried for the rest of the day, expecting trouble.</p><p>Letitia, on the other hand, was a born actress.</p><p>It bothered me the whole drive to Mr. Rathbin\u2019s house. I was early, so I parked my car in a shady spot down the street and picked up the book. It was very old but in good repair, with gold-edged pages and a bloodred leather cover shiny from years of handling. There was no title on the spine, and a gold compass rose surrounded by vines was embossed on the front, just like on the locket.</p><p>I opened it to a random page, and saw ... nothing.</p><p>The book was empty. Just hundreds of age-stained pages with nothing on them.</p><p>I flipped to the inside of the front cover. There was a long list of names written in faded ink the color of dried blood. Which it probably was, actually. Names and dates and notations. Every few entries, the handwriting changed, although all of the letters were cramped and ornate, with lots of flourishes.</p><p>The first entry read Vetivern Stain m. Isly Tatters, 1281. Next came Crumm Stain, b. 1283. Births, marriages, and deaths, all down the line. Strange names, all seeming one-offs from anything in my world. And they lived a lot longer than anyone in my world, too. Jerebiah Stain had apparently lasted 343 years before d. by draining.</p><p>Eek.</p><p>But the last entry caught my attention. Criminy Stain, b. 1793.</p><p>His parents\u2019 names were just above it, Angero Stain m. Frey Pallor, 1793.</p><p>Same year. Interesting.</p><p>I reached out to touch the old words, and the moment my hand connected with the page, I felt the familiar electric jolt and saw new words written there in wet, bright red.</p><p>Criminy Stain m. Letitia Paisley, 1905.</p><p>I jerked my hand back, and the words were gone.</p><p>I would have expected such a thing in Sang, but to glance in my world, in my car, in my scrubs, was really scary. What if it happened every time I touched a patient? Would gloves prevent it, as they did in Sang? Thank goodness I never went anywhere without a big box of latex gloves.</p><p>Out of curiosity, I put my palm on another page, but nothing happened. I slammed the book shut and slid it under my seat.</p><p>I knocked on Mr. Rathbin\u2019s door and walked in with a smiling face. Thus began the usual six-hour shift of work that I could do with my eyes closed, familiar rituals of cleanliness and healing. But today all I could think about was Sang and Criminy and Casper. In every room, I checked the clock. Time passed more slowly than usual.</p><p>Finally, I found myself at my next-to-last stop. The beautiful historic town home of former concert pianist Jason Sterling. I knocked and was let in by his cousin, a quiet music student who was paid to live in his apartment. He went back to his room, and as soon as I heard his keyboard, I walked softly over the bare wood floors to take the hand of the empty husk of the man I now knew as Casper. It hung limp and pale in my glove, the long fingers topped with nails that needed trimming. His various machines beeped softly in the background, overlying a CD of his own concertos.</p><p>Although I\u2019d never done so before, I gently unwound the gauze around his eyes and lifted one eyelid. Bright blue, unfocused, dead. But so beautiful, like a butterfly preserved under glass. I shut the eye and replaced the wrapping, briefly running my hand through the inch-long light brown hair and wondering what it would feel like if it were long and loose. As I changed his IV, I studied the tattoo for the first time, a black circle containing a raven holding a key on a ribbon. It was a little raised, almost like a brand. I\u2019d have to ask him about it in Sang. That is, if Criminy let me get near him again.</p><p>His town home was clean and airy. There were photographs of his family, one of him on a black Harley, one of him in a black tuxedo, smiling by a baby grand piano at Carnegie Hall. In each one, he was gorgeous, full of life, exactly the kind of man I would love to bring home to Nana. His bookshelves held loads of books\u2014a respectable collection of classics, music theory, poetry, and some science fiction. In a little glass locking case, he had what looked to be a first-run edition of Leaves of Grass, faded green with gold edges. I nearly swooned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If he were conscious and I had come here after a first date, I would most likely have consented to making out on the couch for a while based strictly on his good taste.</p><p>Once my tasks were done, I reluctantly left this version of Mr. Sterling to his comfortable, slow death. He could last thirty years, if he didn\u2019t catch an infection. And I hadn\u2019t seen a bedsore yet. But I couldn\u2019t help but suffer a little shiver, thinking about his body, just lying there in the quiet house, dying slowly as his cousin practiced scales down the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, sugar?\u201d Nana asked me as I washed her dishes that evening. I was daydreaming of Sang as I scrubbed her already squeaky-clean plate.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find yourself a beau?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can spot the look of a pining woman, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said. I could lie to estate-sale clerks, but I wasn\u2019t about to try lying to Nana.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he\u2019s good enough for you, you be sure to bring him by,\u201d she said, shaking her old feather duster at me. \u201cA good boy always visits the kinfolk. That\u2019s manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d I said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s long-distance.\u201d</p> <p>And it was true. Both of them were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy the boy a plane ticket, if he\u2019s worth your time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know how it was with your grandpa and me. Hit me like a truck of watermelons, the first time I saw him. Fifty years of marriage, and we were still in love when I lost him.\u201d She sighed wistfully and stared at the picture on the mantel of Grandpa in his judge\u2019s robes. \u201cYou listen to me, sugar. You go with your gut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said automatically, and she nodded sagely. She had no idea what was going on in my gut, and neither did I.</p><p>All of my choices were actually pretty hard to digest.</p><p>11</p><p>That night, I went to bed early. Just in case it mattered, I brushed out my hair, washed my face, and flossed my teeth. Then I crawled into bed, curled my hand around the locket, and closed my eyes. I was nervous and excited, and if I had been anyone else, I probably would have had trouble getting to sleep.</p> <p>But I\u2019m me, so I was asleep immediately. I blinked and found myself in total darkness. I gasped in fear. Nothing was familiar. And I was exhausted.</p><p>Then a seam of orange light appeared, and a soft voice called, \u201cLetitia, is that you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCriminy?\u201d I said, rubbing my eyes and sitting up.</p><p>The door opened, and I was bathed in the warm glow of the something-like-electric lamps from the main room. A Criminy-shaped shadow blocked the glare, and as my eyes adjusted, I saw concern and relief on his face. He sat on the side of the bed and held out a gloved hand as if to touch me, but then he stopped at the last moment.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019m so sleepy.\u201d My eyelids started to droop closed.</p><p>\u201cStay with me, pet,\u201d he said. \u201cStay in this world a while. It\u2019s my turn to have you.\u201d He smoothed the hair off my face and said, \u201cHow was it?\u201d Just that little touch gave me the tingles. I wondered if I had morning breath and ducked my head.</p><p>\u201cIt was ... totally normal. I woke up in my bed, took care of my grandmother, went to work. It felt like I didn\u2019t get any sleep, but it was fine.\u201d Then it occurred to me that he looked exhausted, too. \u201cWait. Did you sleep at all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot much,\u201d he said wryly as he rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I fell prey to a little catnap in the early morning, but the door was locked and Pem was on guard. Had the strangest dream. I was watching you through this big glass window, and you were in a giant castle all surrounded by short green grass, like someone had cut it with scissors and a ruler, and it was raining. And I was soaked to the bone, water pelting down my collar, through my hair. And you sat inside in a sort of ugly blue dress on a plaid sofa, watching a glowing box. I yelled and knocked on the window again and again, but you wouldn\u2019t look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a nightmare,\u201d I said, but it struck me to the heart. He was describing my old house, Jeff\u2019s house, the carefully trimmed yard, and my favorite robe.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d he said. Then, with a smile, as if it didn\u2019t matter, he added, \u201cIf you ever hear me calling you in the rain, let me in, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said.</p><p>But I could tell something in him was unsettled from the dream, and I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, either. I may have felt a little strange in his world, but he would be entirely out of place in mine.</p><p>\u201cOh, and I went back to the estate sale where I found the locket. I got the book it was in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He said it lightly. \u201cAnd what sort of book was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn empty one,\u201d I said. \u201cRed leather, no title, no words on the pages. Only a family register on the front cover. Your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, from the twelve hundreds until now. What year is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s spring of 1904,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re saying the names were there, but the pages were blank?\u201d He leaned toward me, intent on my words.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bizarre,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhen I sent it out to find you, it was a family grimoire, my most prized possession, full of every spell, incantation, recipe, curse, scam, and joke in the family. And in your world, it\u2019s just empty pages. I wonder if you can bring it back with you somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the locket is the only thing that transfers. I mean, I\u2019m wearing the same clothes and hairstyle I fell asleep with here. The makeup doesn\u2019t even pass over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the grimoire was enchanted along with the locket. There\u2019s a spell on it, a strong one. It wanted to find you, and it wants to come home to me. It belongs in Sang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s under the front seat of my car now, but I can try falling asleep with it in my arms tomorrow night. Although that\u2019s going to feel a little silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, love. I wouldn\u2019t trade you, but I\u2019d be glad to have both prizes.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes met, and we both smiled a bit shyly. He began to move toward me, leaning in for a kiss, but I put a hand against his chest to stop him, paying careful attention to be sure that I only touched his shirt. My stomach flipped inside, but I wasn\u2019t going to give in.</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve just woken up in another world. I can\u2019t go kissing strange men before breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a strange man now?\u201d he said, pulling back to pin me with his sharp eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you for one day,\u201d I said, pushing him farther back so that I could get out of bed. I went to the washstand and looked at my bed-rumpled face and hair in the mirror. With the smudged black makeup, I looked a little like a Victorian consumptive. It wasn\u2019t entirely unbecoming.</p><p>\u201cOne day, and still a stranger. How many days until I cease to be strange?\u201d he asked playfully, peering over my shoulder at his own tired but well-groomed image in the mirror. Despite having spent the entire night in my wagon, he didn\u2019t have a bit of stubble. His hair was pulled back into a low ponytail, and it made him seem a little less unruly, a little more proper. Whereas I was a mess, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>I could feel the prey animal within urging me to keep away from his predatory grin. But he was just a person. He could walk in the daylight, he showed up in mirrors, he didn\u2019t sleep in a coffin. He wasn\u2019t dead. But I somehow kept expecting him to be more of a monster.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll always be strange,\u201d I said softly, looking down at the red flowers painted on the china bowl. \u201cWhere\u2019s the pitcher of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPitcher of water?\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat do you think this is\u2014the sixteen hundreds?\u201d</p><p>He reached to a small dial on the side of the washstand and flicked a switch, and water began to pour out of the mouth of a ceramic cherub set into the wood under the mirror.</p><p>\u201cWe tap the caravan\u2019s pump into the aquifer whenever we park, you see,\u201d he said. When the bowl was filled, he flicked the switch, and the water stopped. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done, the drain is below the bowl. Just pick it up and dump it down. It\u2019s a little old-fashioned, but it\u2019s better than beating your stockings against a rock.\u201d Seeing the look on my face, he laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t you have running water in your world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI guess I thought things were less modern here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess modern? You don\u2019t even have clockworks where you come from, you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, OK. You win. You\u2019re more modern,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I get dressed now?</p><p>\u201cOf course. Do you need any help with your laces?\u201d He said it casually, but there was a hungry curiosity in his voice that amused me.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I need help with everything. Can you send Mrs. Cleavers over?\u201d</p><p>He laughed that high, wild laugh of his and said, \u201cMrs. Cleavers doesn\u2019t make house calls, pet. She\u2019s a very important lady. But I\u2019ll send a girl over. I\u2019m better at taking the laces off, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He sauntered out the door with a smile on his face and his copper monkey on his shoulder, calling, \u201cAnd come to the dining car for breakfast when you\u2019re ready, love. Lots to do.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, someone tapped on my door, and when I opened it an inch, I saw the back of a head plastered in strawberry-blond curls and a riot of purple and yellow leather. A small clockwork bat clutched her shoulder, rubbery wings folded and red eyes blinking bright. It was the girl I\u2019d seen on the tightrope yesterday.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I said.</p><p>She spun around and gave me a bright but fake smile. It reminded me of the look a popular girl once gave me in high school right before she asked to borrow my homework. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, doll,\u201d she said with something like a cockney accent. \u201cMaster Crim said you needed lacing up and whatnot, so here I am.\u201d</p><p>She stepped past me into my car and looked around, appraising. I could almost see dollar signs in her light blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid this up quick for you, didn\u2019t they, love? Nice couch, redid the chaise, brought a new mirror. Fixed all the scratches Pietro left behind, poor lad. You must be quite the fancy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, not really,\u201d I managed to squeak out before she\u2019d shoved open the door to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d she said. \u201cSilk bedding, too! I know what Master\u2019s thinking there, eh? Lovely little nest for the lovebirds. Where\u2019s your corset and pantalettes, now, love? We got breakfast still.\u201d</p><p>She was like a sparrow, sharp and quick, and her words flowed out in a musical stream. Gone was the bored look I\u2019d seen yesterday, replaced with the cunning eyes of a pickpocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Emerlie,\u201d she said. \u201cEmerlie Fetching. Originally from Blackchapel, of course, which you\u2019ll notice from the accent, eh? Learned the tightrope and tricks from me pap, he was an old hand at the caravan. I do the unicycle, rope dancing, fiery hoops, the lot. Been with this show for three years now, and it\u2019s fine enough, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh,\u201d I said, handing her the black corset and stepping into the petticoats before pulling the nightgown over my head. Her chatter made it hard to concentrate on anything.</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s lovely stuff, now. Fine lace on those, must be from Franchia. Now, this cincher\u2019s good, thick stuff. That Mrs. Cleavers knows her way about a closet, eh? Sewed this suit for me, said that if I wouldn\u2019t dress as a lady, I wouldn\u2019t dress as a man, neither.\u201d She dimpled and giggled, as if we were best friends sharing a secret. \u201cGot one in the works for me as\u2019ll pop your eyes, all lime and magenta. Now, clutch the door frame while I start pulling, and hold in your breath, that\u2019s a good lass.\u201d</p><p>I obliged, and she started yanking, nearly as cruelly as Mrs. Cleavers. When she finally tied off the laces and I exhaled, I felt oddly at home in the tight garment. It was uncomfortable, but everything was in place, right where it should be. Emerlie flung open the armoire and whistled.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the big day, eh, love? That\u2019s the fanciest damn wedding gown I ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding gown?\u201d I choked.</p><p>\u201cSurely, lass, you\u2019ve noticed, as there\u2019s a frothy white confection here in your armoire? Or did it skulk in at night, when you was sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know it was a wedding dress. I just thought it was white.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd for what other reason does a lady wear white?\u201d she scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s a dirty damned life, and that\u2019s for sure. So the master hasn\u2019t asked you, then, eh?\u201d I could see calculations behind her eyes. I guessed that gossip was currency among the small family of the carnival.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I squeaked.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, it\u2019s only a matter of time, then, what with him giving you this loverly wagon to yourself and a boxful of fancy dresses. Now, let\u2019s see, which dress? Must be this one. The burgundy. Suits you. Let\u2019s get it over your head, then.\u201d</p><p>She held out the dress to me, and I dove into it, just as I had the day before. She continued chattering as she laced all the laces and smoothed the dress down over me, but I was silently shrieking in a corner of my mind. Why had that presumptuous lecher installed a wedding dress in my closet? Was I going to wake up one day from my other life already dressed and standing at an altar? Just like in my glance at the book?</p><p>She found some little pots of makeup in a drawer and went to work on my face. It seemed Emerlie never stopped to breathe, her words just tumbling over one another like a box of puppies as she worked.</p><p>\u201cI gots me own Bluddy hopeful, I do. And how he ever expects me to love him, I\u2019ll never know, the odd bugger. Stands around mooning at me all day, waiting for a word, and what am I to say? Go away, ye perverted bloodthirsty monster? I\u2019m not like you, miss, I was raised to be against that sort of thing, and the thought of kissing him, and him wanting to eat me the whole time, it\u2019s just wretched, eh? I don\u2019t know how you do it, miss, and I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow I do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove a Bludman,\u201d she said, her nose wrinkled up. \u201cWith the strange eyes and the smell and the skin and the blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the eyes and the smell and ... whatever you said?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t you smell him? The blood and death, all meaty and coppery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCriminy doesn\u2019t smell like that,\u201d I said, confused. \u201cHe smells like ... berries. Wine. Something herby and green. Maybe it\u2019s cologne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bludmen won\u2019t wear a fake scent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it wouldn\u2019t help, as strong as they smell. And the eyes, always looking like there\u2019s a flame there, fire and shadows. They look like hell to me, miss, and no offense. Like the devil\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of pretty,\u201d I admitted shyly.</p><p>She looked at me, doubtful, and said, \u201cWell, at least you must agree it\u2019s hard to watch them drink the blood. See it coloring their teeth, turning their lips red?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. She was holding a little pot of bright red rouge and a small brush, and apparently she hadn\u2019t noticed the irony.</p><p>\u201cFood is food,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re killing anyone.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cThey\u2019re a heartbeat away from it every second. Like a bludrat gnawing at a carcass and watching you, and you know what it\u2019s thinking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat boy, the one who cares for you. What\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie Dregs,\u201d she said with an exasperated sigh. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not half bad, for a Bludman. Best Punch and Judy show I\u2019ve ever seen, the way he works them puppets and clockworks. But still. How could it ever work out? My parents would kill me. My grandfather would come after him with a torch. The children would be halfbluds, and nobody likes them. Why buy your trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Casper?\u201d I asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cThe music man?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cRight handsome, if he weren\u2019t a Stranger, and no offense.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to inquire further without seeming nosy, and I sensed that anything I said would soon be on the lips and ears of everyone else in the caravan. She lapsed into a very welcome silence as she finished painting my eyes. Her prejudice confused me. I supposed that if one were raised to hate and fear Bludmen, one couldn\u2019t help feeling that way. But I just didn\u2019t feel such revulsion around Criminy, and in Sang, I supposed that made me very odd.</p><p>\u201cThere, now, miss. You look lovely, if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>I considered my reflection in the mirror, and I looked about the same as I had yesterday. Apparently, having thick black rings around your eyes was the height of fashion in Sang. She\u2019d painted a little outside my lips to make a fat cupid\u2019s bow, and she\u2019d stuck the fascinator on the top of my head, and I felt ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cIs this how makeup and hair are normally done here?\u201d I asked as gently as possible.</p><p>\u201cOh, cor, yes. I forget Master said you was from far away,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the young ladies wear their hairbobs in front now\u2014Mrs. Cleavers is a little behind on Citydom. And the lips have to be painted this way, if you want any lad to look twice.\u201d</p><p>Her face was next to mine in the mirror, and she did have her lips done the same way. She had a tiny maroon top hat surrounded by pheasant feathers nestled in her curls, and she smiled at me, showing yellow teeth.</p><p>\u201cSee now? Master will be pleased,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you can put in a spare word about my wagon, I\u2019d be ever so obliged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your wagon?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cExcept as I don\u2019t like sharing it with that Abyssinian. She\u2019s a loverly girl, but there\u2019re ever so many snakes about, and it always smells of smoke. I had hoped ...\u201d She trailed off, staring forlornly around my trailer, then glanced at me and smiled that same bright, utterly fake smile. \u201cBut that\u2019s all well and good. Fortunetellers come before tightrope walkers, and that\u2019s ever the way of things. Shall we get on to breakfast, then?\u201d</p><p>Walking arm in arm with Emerlie was painful. She never stopped talking, and most of what came out of her mouth was complaining in a cheerful voice. She whispered about everyone we passed, just loudly enough to make it clear that she was gossiping. I was embarrassed and hoped that being seen with her wasn\u2019t turning anyone against me.</p><p>Most of the time, I just tuned her out. I had enough to think about on my own.</p><p>She threw open the door to the dining car and squealed when she saw two other girls sitting in a corner.</p><p>\u201cLater, love!\u201d she called over her shoulder as she trotted to her friends, one of whom had a spectacularly long beard but was still kind of pretty. The other was rail-thin, with buck teeth, and she threw me an evil look as I scanned the room. Criminy raised an eyebrow from his booth, where he was waiting for me. There was no sign of Casper. I was more than a little disappointed.</p><p>After I\u2019d collected my breakfast of hot porridge, some little citrus fruits, and a strange amber-colored liquid, he ushered me into the booth and closed the curtains.</p><p>\u201cWhy the curtains?\u201d I said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem weird\u2014us eating in the same room as everyone else but hiding in a tent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of what we say is secret, love,\u201d he said, sipping his blood. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not healthy for me to get too close to the others. I have to keep control. Once they see me warbling love songs at you, I\u2019m done for.\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a bloody grin, the sort that probably made Emerlie want to gag, but it didn\u2019t bother me anymore.</p><p>\u201cSo about last night?\u201d he said, making it into a question.</p><p>\u201cI was back in my real world. My clock was ringing, my cat was purring. It was just like waking up from a normal dream on a regular morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you were tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, exhausted. Still am. No sleep. I\u2019ll probably start going crazy soon.\u201d</p><p>He waved that off. I blew on my porridge and nibbled a spoonful.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to figure out a way for you to sleep without going back to your other world,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cMaybe a charmed sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth a try,\u201d I said. \u201cAs long as you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said with a smoldering glance that unsettled me.</p><p>I fumbled as I picked up one of the little citrus fruits, which was smooth and golden. I dug in my thumbs, and red juice welled up and stained my gloves, dripping on the table.</p><p>\u201cUgh, what is this?\u201d I cried, looking for a napkin.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tangerine, love,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all red inside,\u201d I said, dabbing at my sleeve. \u201cIn my world, they\u2019re not all dark and gooey.\u201d I sighed. \u201cMore blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re half right,\u201d he said, removing his gloves and taking the fruit from me.</p><p>I saw his hands for the first time, black and scaled like Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s, with clipped white claws halfway between fingernails and talons. I should have been disgusted, but I wasn\u2019t. They were really quite pretty, and effective, too, as he sliced open the peel and removed the sections of rich, red fruit with much less mess than I would have made.</p><p>He popped one section into his mouth and sucked it, saying, \u201cTangerine is the only thing besides blood that I like to eat. Tastes a little like blood but sweeter. Not as nutritive, mind you, but better than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike candy,\u201d I said with a smile.</p> <p>He returned the smile, swallowing the fruit and holding out another piece to me. \u201cA little like candy, yes. Try it.\u201d</p><p>I could see the dare in his eyes, so I popped it into my mouth. Braced for the worst, I found that it was actually lovely, like a cross between a ripe cherry and a clementine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s delicious,\u201d I said, \u201cif a bit staining. My gloves are ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a tangerine yourself, Letitia,\u201d he mused, toying with the curled peel. \u201cSweet, intriguing, ripe, and juicy. But not quite what you seem. Still wrapped up in a bit of a shell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m a-peeling?\u201d I said, and then I started giggling, and he joined me.</p><p>\u201cYes, my sweet tangerine. Very appealing. But it\u2019s time to drop the shell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe show opens tonight, and we\u2019ve got to get you ready to perform. You need to get your patter down, practice glancing on the carnivalleros. And my hope is that you\u2019ll glance on the person who tried to poison Mrs. Cleavers. Be ready for it. Learn to keep your face closed, reveal only what you must. Get comfortable with lying, and do it fast. Do you think you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot to learn in one day,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not like you. I\u2019m not a born performer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m betting you are, pet,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see it in you, waiting to come out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I said. I suddenly felt very small and hopeless. Not that I was so worried about the glancing, because it didn\u2019t seem as if I could stop it if I tried. I just didn\u2019t want to disappoint him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be great,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be with you to help.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what scares me.\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>My first victim was Torno, the strong man.</p><p>\u201cMy fortune, never has it been read,\u201d he said with a galloping sort of accent. \u201cI hope my future, you will see, is a good one.\u201d A small clockwork dog sat on its haunches at his feet, still as a statue except for an odd, robotic panting.</p><p>I smiled. I had no idea what to say.</p><p>I was sitting behind a crystal ball in a colorful little tent outside my wagon. Bold, curling letters in bright gold proclaimed me a fortune-telling gypsy, so it was definitely too late to back out. I was wearing the highly offensive mauve turban, a black net shawl, and a coin-speckled scarf tied around my hips.</p><p>I felt like a big old phony.</p><p>Criminy stood behind me in the shadows. He was supposed to be feeding me lines. But he was waiting quietly, giving me a chance to try first, I guess. Before we\u2019d sat down, he had told me, \u201cYour accent is very foreign and exciting, so that\u2019ll help. But you must learn to ham it up, make it seem more important than it is. Most folk have never seen a real glancer, and they\u2019re expecting magic.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t help me a bit. I was still smiling at Torno, and he was smiling at me. His clockwork dog yipped, and I jumped. My mind was a total blank.</p><p>\u201cI see that you are very strong,\u201d Criminy whispered in my ear. \u201cAnd you are a fighter. You fought in the war?\u201d</p><p>Of course, he was strong, and he did have scars on his face, including a big slash under his left eye. But I repeated Criminy\u2019s words, trying to inject authority and spookiness into my voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Torno said. \u201cBut these things, they are known. They are past. What else can you say to me? What of the future?\u201d</p><p>Again, silence.</p><p>\u201cTouch him,\u201d Criminy whispered.</p><p>\u201cIf you will be so kind as to remove the glove of your right hand,\u201d I said as I removed mine and held my bare hand out to him.</p><p>Torno was surprised and stared at my hand as if it were something fascinating and scary. Then he blushed. But he removed his glove and held out his hand.</p><p>I grasped it. The jolt wasn\u2019t so bad when I was expecting it. Torno didn\u2019t appear to feel it, though, and he just sat there, staring at me, his face beet red. I supposed that in Sang, he might not have touched another human\u2019s skin in years.</p><p>It came to me then, and the words rose from my mouth unbidden, deep, and husky. \u201cThe boys will betray you,\u201d I said. \u201cNot for blood but money. They know the hiding place. If you begin with fists, it will end in teeth. Only the master can bind them.\u201d</p><p>His bulging shoulders hunched inside the scarred leather suit. \u201cMaster?\u201d he said, his deep voice tremulous with fury.</p><p>\u201cIt will be done,\u201d Criminy said softly from behind me.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady Letitia,\u201d Torno said. He pulled a gold coin from somewhere in his suit and laid it on the table before me, then walked back toward his trailer, clenching and unclenching his gloved fists. The clockwork dog trotted in his wake, doing an occasional backward somersault.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Criminy said, picking up the coin. \u201cI knew it. You\u2019re a natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely understand what I said. But I guess he knows what it means?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe knows. And I do, too. Catarrh and Quincy have always looked up to him, but apparently, they were going to steal something valuable from him. I\u2019ll give them a firm talking-to. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind having attempted thieves here?\u201d I asked, then I laughed. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh,\u201d he said. \u201cI trained them myself. But we don\u2019t steal from our own. They\u2019re young. They\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p><p>The next person stepped up. It was the lizard boy, Eblick. I\u2019d never actually seen him vertical thus far\u2014just passed out in the sunshine. He was thin and sickly-looking, with pale green scales and watery black eyes, and he wore only a brown vest and trousers. He was one of the few people I\u2019d met who let any part of their body show, but he certainly didn\u2019t look very tasty.</p><p>\u201cMaster,\u201d he said, bowing respectfully. \u201cLady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, and Criminy shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHi doesn\u2019t really set the stage, love. Try something more ominous, like Greetings from the beyond or Your future awaits or something dramatic. Or just skip it and stare them down.\u201d</p><p>I pinned Eblick with my fiercest stare, and he quaked and gulped. \u201cIf you\u2019ll be so kind as to give me your right hand,\u201d I said, \u201cI will look into your future.\u201d</p><p>He held out a claw-tipped, scaly hand. The palm was grayish-white, with long scales like a snake\u2019s belly. I grasped it with my own hand and waited for the jolt, but nothing happened. I looked at Eblick, and he was braced as if for electrocution, his eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>Time to wing it.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are fearful, but you must overcome this fear to reach your full potential. Claim your power in the world by gaining strength and ... eating healthfully and ... using a magical oil. See the master later,\u201d I said, trying to imitate the same husky voice that had come over me with Torno.</p><p>\u201cThank you, lady,\u201d Eblick said, worship in his eyes. He placed a transparent silvery scale on the table before me. \u201cI will do as you say.\u201d</p><p>When he had left, staring at his hand as if secrets were written there, Criminy said, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a glance, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I made that one up,\u201d I said. \u201cJust give him some sort of nicely scented oil so he won\u2019t look so patchy. He needs to bulk up and get some exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done, love,\u201d Criminy said with a chuckle. \u201cNow you\u2019re getting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the scale? People are allowed to pay with body parts now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can always pay with blood, but nobody wants lizard blood,\u201d he said. \u201cThat scale is quite a gift, really. Great healing properties there. Or it can be pulverized and added to draughts and spells. Clever girl, to see that power was what the lad wanted most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious when you just look at them.\u201d</p><p>My next customer appeared, the thin, buck-toothed girl I had seen with Emerlie in the dining car. She was wearing a ridiculous floppy hat that barely fit in my tent. She flounced into the chair and said, \u201cI wish to know how to solve my ... problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll remove your right glove,\u201d I said, and held out my own bare hand.</p><p>\u201cNothing doing. I\u2019m a lady,\u201d she said with a sniff.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to be a lady with or without a job?\u201d Criminy growled over my shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019m twenty-two, and I\u2019ve never touched anyone outside of my family,\u201d she said, disgusted. \u201cAnd your pardon, sir, but I don\u2019t know this ... person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve let her touch me. That should be good enough for the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>I could almost see her tucking away that bit of gossip for later, but she knew she didn\u2019t have a choice. She daintily removed the glove and held out a hand with fingernails chewed to the quick. She huffed and stared into the air over my head.</p> <p>I grasped her hand and waited for the jolt.</p><p>There.</p><p>\u201cThe answer lies in the city of Bixby. There is a chirurgeon there.\u201d I stumbled over the odd word on the sign from my glance. \u201cHe\u2019s a pioneer. But the price will be very high. Think carefully before striking a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d she said in a shocked whisper.</p><p>I pinned her with my eyes. \u201cHigh,\u201d I said. \u201cThe spirits will not allow me to say more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, lady.\u201d She absentmindedly set a coin on the table and wandered away, patting her huge hat. The poor girl had mule\u2019s ears hidden under there, and every spell she\u2019d attempted to remove them had backfired. The chirurgeon was apparently a sort of magical surgeon and could fix her. But she was poor, and it was costly. In the end, she\u2019d have to agree to marry him, and he was old and ugly. It was fascinating, my little window into the lives of these bizarre people.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing marvelously, love,\u201d Criminy said.</p><p>\u201cHow many more are there?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a little tiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve required every carnivallero to come,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be even more glancing tonight, so you\u2019d better get used to the strain. Relax more. Have some wine. I can see the worry in the lines of your shoulders.\u201d</p><p>He massaged my pinched shoulders for a moment. I focused on relaxing and took a sip of wine from the flask hidden under my little table. The glancing wasn\u2019t as hard as I was making it. Then I felt Criminy\u2019s hands slip from my shoulders down my arms, and his chin settled possessively on my shoulder. When I looked up, I saw Casper waiting, even more gorgeous than yesterday, his eyes guarded but hopeful. Was he as glad to see me as I was to see him?</p><p>\u201cHow does this work, exactly?\u201d he asked with a polite smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou touch her hand,\u201d Criminy snapped. \u201cOnly her hand. She tells your fortune. You pay her.\u201d</p><p>Casper held out his hand. I was drawn to his eyes, but he was having a staring match with Criminy over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really work with you perching on me,\u201d I said in a playful tone.</p><p>He released me, but not before his black-gloved hand caressed my face. I could feel him in the shadows of my tent, tense and lurking behind me. \u201cGet on with it, love,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I focused on Casper. His poet\u2019s blouse was open, revealing a tanned chest with some sparse golden hairs. His hair was brushed to a wavy sheen and pulled back, and he had silver rings in one of his ears, like a pirate. Those long, beautiful fingers were held out to me as if we were going to go on a picnic in a magical meadow. For just a moment, I forgot all about the possessive Bludman behind me. I took Casper\u2019s outstretched hand.</p><p>There. The jolt, like sunrise piercing the clouds.</p><p>Interesting. Such a secret he had, this boy. And now I had one, too.</p><p>I had to keep control. I struggled to keep my voice even. I fought to smile, wondering if it came out as more of a grimace.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found what you were looking for,\u201d I said. \u201cYour future is long and filled with greatness. You\u2019ll find one heart\u2019s desire and lose another. Loss will be your salvation. Happiness lies over the rainbow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cA mystic, baffling wonder,\u201d I answered softly.</p><p>\u201cAll truths wait in all things, and you like Whitman. Tell me more,\u201d he said, leaning closer, blue eyes bright. His other hand grasped our already clasped hands, bare skin wrapped around my fingers, and it felt so intimate an embrace that I blushed and dropped my eyes.</p><p>\u201cPay her and get on,\u201d Criminy growled. \u201cYour fortune\u2019s been told, boy.\u201d</p><p>Casper laughed softly, his fingers subtly stroking mine as he released me. \u201cSo it has, Master Stain,\u201d he said as he stood and dropped a coin onto the table. \u201cBut things can always change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot glances, lad,\u201d Criminy said from the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI hope we can talk more soon. When we\u2019re alone,\u201d Casper said with a pointed look and a disarming smile before ducking out of the tent.</p><p>I watched him walk away, back proud and hair blowing softly in the breeze. I\u2019d keep his secret, and he\u2019d never know mine. I picked up his coin, a simple copper, rubbing it between my bare fingers before tucking it into my blouse. It was the same one I\u2019d seen dancing over his knuckles. This one I wanted to keep for myself.</p><p>Then the bearded lady appeared, blocking my view. I pasted my smile back on and reached for her hand. In the hazy distance, I heard someone playing \u201cSomewhere over the Rainbow\u201d tenderly on a harpsichord.</p><p>An hour later, I was almost through the line. I\u2019d seen secrets, hopes, dreams, crises, tragedies, and a few strange comedies. Most people seemed to want the same things\u2014love, sex, power, riches, beauty. I supposed it was the same in any world.</p><p>The next person in line was Veruca, the Abyssinian. Most people had approached me with either fear or disdain, but she seemed completely ambiguous. I couldn\u2019t read her. I hoped a real glance would come, because otherwise, the only thing I would know to say was that she was fearless and unique, which I was betting she already knew.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wearing gloves, and it was hard not to stare at the dark, oiled skin of her exposed body. She held out her hand without a word. I took it.</p><p>There.</p><p>That was odd.</p><p>\u201cYou have everything you wish,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cBut still you will have more. You will always find what you seek, and you will perform a great service. But your end will be a grisly one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know,\u201d she demanded. Her voice was high and guttural, and her tongue was pierced.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a tall, dark stranger,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd something involving a bee.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s cryptic,\u201d she said. Then she looked over my shoulder at Criminy and said, \u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>She tossed a coin onto the table and left.</p><p>As I considered the strange and colorful future I had glanced for Veruca, I felt Criminy tense behind me. A small, stiff man hesitated before my tent. His face was scrunched up in disgust under a green velvet bowler hat that extended in faded leather down his throat and buckled under his chin with shiny brass. It was too tight, and his chin bulged with fat wrinkles underneath.</p><p>Although every Pinky I\u2019d seen other than Casper kept his skin covered, this man took it to the extreme, with straps, buckles, and flaps crisscrossing his body. I imagined that if he were chopped open, he would have concentric rings of old leather, like a tree.</p><p>\u201cI fail to understand why this unholy foolishness is necessary,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cBecause I say it is,\u201d Criminy said darkly. \u201cLose the glove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, lady,\u201d he said, failing entirely to meet my eyes. \u201cBut I was raised to believe that glancing was irreligious tomfoolery. I think you\u2019re a charlatan and a bride of the devil. I do not wish to participate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a debt, Elvis,\u201d Criminy growled. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if you believe her or not, but you\u2019ll play along, just like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>The man fumed, and I could hear his teeth grinding. With jerky, angry movements, he removed a thin cloth glove. Underneath it was a leather glove, and when he finally managed to yank it off his hand, I could smell his skin. I really didn\u2019t want to touch that foul, sweaty hand.</p><p>But if he had to, I had to.</p><p>As I reached out, he drew back and looked away as if I were going to slap him across the face. The second our skin touched, I felt the jolt.</p><p>Oh, this was going to be bad.</p><p>Now I remembered where I had heard his name before.</p><p>Instead of letting the glance speak through me this time, I fought it. Now my own teeth were grinding, and my hand clutched his in a death grip.</p><p>\u201cSay it, love,\u201d Criminy whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t fight the glance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed her,\u201d I said softly. \u201cWhile she was dancing in the woods. But she couldn\u2019t help what she was. You think it\u2019s your holy mission, but you\u2019re just a small-minded coward. You want to kill Criminy, too. There will be a reckoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lying bitch!\u201d he screamed, spit flying from his dry lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a murderer,\u201d I said.</p><p>Criminy flashed past me. His hand settled around the man\u2019s throat, his arm rigid and his face feral as he lifted the leather-wrapped body from the ground with more strength than I would have imagined. My hand ripped free of his grasp, and I wiped it off on my skirt.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t glanced this part, just the aftermath.</p><p>\u201cSay her name,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWho, me?\u201d I squeaked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Him. I want him to say her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Elvis said. \u201cShe was unclean. She deserved worse than anything I could have done.\u201d</p><p>The hand squeezed tighter. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>Elvis\u2019s face was turning purple. I felt detached from the violence, as far away and uninvolved as someone watching a lion killing an antelope on TV. I had seen what would happen, and I calmly accepted it as fact. He deserved it, and the only justice to be had in Sang was of the vigilante sort.</p><p>\u201cBelleen,\u201d Elvis whispered.</p><p>Criminy dropped him, and the man choked and gurgled as he struggled back to his feet, reaching frantically for his glove. As he shoved his hand back into the safety of leather, the words tumbled from his mouth, staccato and cruel.</p><p>\u201cBelleen the immoral temptress, the evil demoness. She preyed on men\u2019s souls, flaunted her vile body in depraved gyrations. And then she drank their blood. And they liked it, paid her for the privilege. I caught her in the woods, dancing naked for the moon, and I cut out her heart and burned it. I threw her body in the swamp, watched the crocagators nudge her foul flesh until it sank below the surface.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Criminy watched the confession, silent, his expression unreadable.</p><p>Since Criminy made no move against him, Elvis began to shout, his voice filled with an ugly, prideful righteousness. \u201cThe gods speak through me. I am their instrument. The Coppers are taking too long. The Bludmen must be destroyed, the earth scoured of their pestilence. Only man is pure, only man can return Sang to the glory of eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d Criminy asked.</p> <p>Everyone nearby had stopped to stare, crowding around my wagon. I could hear whispers and chittering, but I couldn\u2019t tell if the crowd was hungry for blood or just entertainment.</p><p>\u201cI will never be finished,\u201d Elvis said, his voice rising and gaining force like that of a preacher on a roll. \u201cFor my path is righteous, and I am protected by a greater power than your vile spirits of blood. And you can\u2019t kill me because there are witnesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re righteous and special and on a mission,\u201d Criminy said, a wicked and sweet smile spreading across his face. He pulled Pemberly from his shoulder and whispered into the monkey\u2019s shiny ear. She darted down to the ground and loped along the line of wagons.</p><p>Elvis didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. He just nodded once as if accepting fealty.</p><p>Criminy crossed his arms and rocked back on his boots, humming to himself. \u201cOh, it\u2019ll just be a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut please believe that I\u2019m entirely understanding. Your feelings have been taken into account, and your path is perfectly reasonable.\u201d</p> <p>The crowd twittered. There were a few giggles. Elvis deflated a little and began to cast around for support.</p><p>There was a flash of copper, and Pemberly was again on Criminy\u2019s shoulder, her tail wrapped around his arm. Criminy took something from her little black hand.</p><p>It was the jar of powder from Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s trailer, wrapped in his handkerchief. The poison.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, though, Elvis,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that you deserve a promotion in the caravan. You\u2019ve been dusting off the clockworks and running the locomotive for years, and it\u2019s your turn to take center stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t,\u201d Criminy said, cutting off Elvis. \u201cBut you will. You see, I\u2019ve been thinking we need a clown. A good, old-fashioned Pierrot. And you\u2019re going to do your makeup all by yourself. We\u2019ll start with pure white, just like your soul.\u201d</p> <p>Elvis took a step back, and the color drained from his face. His mouth opened and closed, but nothing came out.</p><p>Criminy unscrewed the top of the glass jar and held it out to Elvis. The terrified man turned to run, but Catarrh and Quincy appeared and held him by the arms. They were stronger than they looked. The crowd stepped in closer, a solid wall of bodies. Half of them were angry, half were curious, but none showed even a hint of sympathy.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this!\u201d Elvis shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s murder! It\u2019s against the laws! You\u2019ll lose your license! My human brethren will see you punished!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder?\u201d Criminy said, drawing back in feigned confusion. \u201cMy dear sir, I\u2019m giving you a promotion. It\u2019s just powder. A simple bit of makeup. Mrs. Cleavers uses it on everyone. Why on earth would you be frightened of powder?\u201d</p><p>The crowd had made a tight circle around them by now, and I had a front-row seat from behind my crystal ball. Mrs. Cleavers pinned Elvis with her darkest glare and bared her teeth.</p><p>\u201cI use it myself, you silly man,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fear from powder.\u201d</p><p>Elvis struggled, but there was no escape.</p><p>Criminy held out the jar again and said, \u201cGo on. Paint your face, clown. Unless you\u2019d like to tell your friends and coworkers anything special?\u201d</p> <p>Elvis looked at the powder, then at the crowd. He hung his head, apparently realizing that the Bludmen would end him, one way or another, now that they knew what he had done.</p><p>He dipped a gloved finger into the powder and looked at it sadly. He drew a stripe from his forehead down to his chin, then reached for another finger full and drew a line from cheek to cheek. With a cross drawn on his pallid face, he looked up at the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI regret nothing,\u201d he said, and blood spilled from his mouth. He fell to the ground, eyes open. Dead.</p><p>Emerlie screamed, but one of her friends clapped a hand over her mouth. The bearded lady fainted into Torno\u2019s arms. One small man just as leathery as Elvis crept forward to close the dead man\u2019s eyes with an apologetic nod to Criminy. Shocked whispers and fierce glares darted across the crowd, yet no one seemed all that surprised. I couldn\u2019t tell if that was because they knew Elvis was a bad seed or because Criminy\u2019s word was accepted as law.</p><p>Criminy pulled a long black silk sheet from inside his coat as easily as if it were a handkerchief. He stepped forward to drape it over the still form in the dust, and the whispering reached a frenzy.</p><p>\u201cEverybody stop!\u201d Criminy shouted.</p><p>The carnivalleros immediately quieted and stilled.</p><p>\u201cThis is a family, and we take care of our own. Crimes will be punished accordingly. Belleen has been avenged. Now, get on with it.\u201d His voice rang with confidence and finality.</p><p>The carnivalleros drifted off. The show was over.</p><p>13</p><p>The pale, lemony sun lingered at the horizon as I watched the caravan come alive for the first time. Barely refreshed by a few quiet hours alone in my wagon, I was now back in my fake tent in front of my fake crystal ball wearing my fake turban while providing one-hundred-percent real fortune-telling.</p><p>Strange double-decker vehicles appeared, first as three distant spots spewing smoke. Then their heavy chugging carried over the hills, and finally they arrived, parking a respectful distance away. They were like a cross between English sightseeing buses and tanks, and their treads left ugly scars across the serene green of the moors. City people apparently took safety very seriously on their country jaunts.</p><p>Each bus was accompanied by two Coppers, who galloped ahead on feisty bludmares to check our paperwork with Mrs. Cleavers. In addition to the caravan\u2019s license and certificates, every carnivallero was required to have papers, and mine had been freshly forged and magically aged earlier in the morning. I was officially Lady Letitia Paisley. I had argued in favor of my last name, but Criminy had explained that Everett was neither a surname nor a word in Sang and might draw questions, so we had gone with the much more common Paisley. I couldn\u2019t think of a single argument that wouldn\u2019t expose what I\u2019d seen when glancing on his book, so Paisley it was.</p><p>I tried to focus on my breathing and ambience. My biggest criticism from the day\u2019s customers had been that I seemed perky but shy until I touched them, when I instantly became somber and mysterious. I needed to maintain that same exotic aura consistently instead of depending on the glancing.</p><p>My car was between Emerlie and Veruca\u2019s and Torno\u2019s, and the wagons had been circled to separate the public and private spaces of the caravan. Clockworks inhabited the spaces between the wagons, doing their tricks and ensuring that no outsiders ventured into the circle within. The juggling polanda bear and dancing leoparth on either side of my wagon were more than a little daunting.</p><p>To my left, Emerlie rode her unicycle and juggled plates, looking more bored than ever. Her really dangerous stunts wouldn\u2019t begin until the crowd was excited and gathered like a flock of leather sheep by Criminy\u2019s hawking. Just beyond her, Veruca stood in a booth painted to look like a lush jungle and practiced swallowing a sword. On my right, Torno lifted big blocks of stone and giant barbells, also warming up for his more impressive show later on.</p><p>I had asked Criminy why there wasn\u2019t a big top, a giant tent with bleachers for the main show.</p><p>\u201cThey used to have those,\u201d he said, thoughtful. \u201cA couple of hundred years ago, before so many were bludded. But in today\u2019s world, herding a bunch of Pinkies into a place with only one exit would be like inviting a flock of geese into a cage with a leoparth. Even if you could keep them safe, they\u2019d never relax. The people of Sang need to see what\u2019s coming, make sure nothing is sneaking up behind them.\u201d</p><p>It was also the reasoning behind our circled wagons. It was like fighting back to back, making sure that we were all on the lookout for whatever might be coming. We needed a space of our own. They were a little scared of us, but we were also a little scared of them. I had to admit that the bulk of my own wagon behind me was reassuring. I closed my eyes and leaned back against it, wishing the glancing was already over and I could try the charmed sleep Criminy had promised me.</p><p>\u201cReady for your first show, my lady?\u201d</p><p>I startled. As I pushed up my slipping turban, I found Casper standing before me in a spectacular costume, smiling. He wore a billowing white shirt that laced up to his chin, and over that a sequined waistcoat of sky blue dancing with black music notes. His breeches were black, his boots were polished, and his hair was plaited and tied with a bow.</p><p>\u201cYou look like Mr. Knightley,\u201d I said. \u201cWith maybe a little bit of Elton John thrown in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be the nicest compliment I\u2019ve ever received, and that includes the time the queen of England told me I played like an angel,\u201d he replied, flashing even more dimple.</p><p>As hard as it was to look elsewhere, I peeked over his shoulder, to where the tanks were parking. I fidgeted with my turban some more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said. \u201cNot used to performing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m scared of what I\u2019m going to see, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. The glancing.\u201d He sat on the stool across from me, the one reserved for customers, and looked around to check that we were alone. \u201cSpeaking of which, you know my secret now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really clever,\u201d I had to admit. \u201cDrinking a drop from every Bludman you meet so they don\u2019t want to feed on you. Criminy never mentioned that their blud could do that. But why\u2019d you start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand the gloves,\u201d he said, flexing his bare hands. \u201cPlaying the harpsichord in gloves ... it\u2019s like making love with your clothes on. You can\u2019t feel the skin under your hands, the electricity. There\u2019s no magic there. What\u2019s the point?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Visions of pianos and hands and bodies in candlelight tumbled through my mind, and I had to bite my lip. He definitely had a way with words. It was strange, being a little infatuated with him. Already knowing that he wanted me, having seen it in the glance. Wanting him, too.</p><p>\u201cYou should take some blud,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep yourself safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said. I\u2019d already been thinking about it, of course. \u201cI\u2019d rather be free than safe, and drinking someone\u2019s blood and becoming something I\u2019m not ...\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not a compromise I\u2019m willing to make.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no\u2014it\u2019s all about being free,\u201d he argued. Seeing him animated and passionate made me a little breathless, even if I disagreed with him. \u201cThat\u2019s the point. Do you know any other humans walking around barefoot and gloveless around here?\u201d He looked down at his boots and tugged at his collar with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m dressed up now for the show, but most of the time, I\u2019m the only person who isn\u2019t wrapped up in fear and cloth.\u201d</p><p>His lip curled up, and his hands were in fists. The old Tish would have apologized and moved on, changed the subject. But Letitia was more willing to argue for what she believed.</p><p>\u201cBut how long are you a human, when you\u2019re drinking from Bludmen? I don\u2019t have anything against them, obviously, but when do you start to crave blood? When does it take you over completely? You might be free to dress differently, but you become a slave to your choices all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI choose to disagree,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut then again, you\u2019ve never died. I have. And I don\u2019t want to do it again. And I don\u2019t want you to, either.\u201d</p><p>We were silent for a moment, watching the Pinkies disembark and mill about in a tight cluster. I subtly studied him. He was just as pretty when he was angry. Criminy was right to call him sulky, but it suited him. It was odd to yearn toward two such different men at once when I wasn\u2019t even sure how I fit into their world. Loving either one of them would be easy, if I let myself. Choosing between them would be the hard part. I would have to ignore the glancing and listen to my gut. I trusted Nana\u2019s wisdom more than magic.</p> <p>He caught my eye, and I was lost for a moment in the startling blue. Despite his bravado, there was fear there, and I wished that I had some solace to offer him. But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you saw for me, then? Becoming a Bludman?\u201d he asked, almost pleading. \u201cIs that the great loss\u2014my humanity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Or I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He put his head down and chuckled sadly. \u201cYou can see it, but you won\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not talk of the beginning or the end,\u201d I quoted with a sad smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou can quit quoting \u2018Song of Myself,\u2019 \u201d he said bitterly. \u201cThis is Sang. The words were never written here.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and walked away.</p><p>When he was out of range, I muttered to myself, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they never will be.\u201d</p><p>The Pinkies cut a path through the grass, moving toward us in a giddy but skittish herd. My skin tingled as a ripple of magic rolled over me. I looked up and smiled. Everything seemed brighter, sharper, more fascinating. Glitter danced in the air, and a calliope began to play. I wondered if that was Criminy\u2019s doing, too, or if Casper\u2019s fingers were the magic behind the cheery pipes. Emerlie\u2019s smile became genuine, Torno\u2019s muscles seemed to bulge a little more through his leather suit, the jigging leoparth let out a very genuine-sounding roar. I sought Criminy in the crowd and saw him in front of his wagon, his hands playing in the air as he grinned. Just another one of his talents, this glamour.</p><p>The crowd flowed in little groups, and I could feel their fear and excitement. A gaggle of Pinkies approached me in a rustle of skirts and whispers, my first customers for the night.</p><p>Oh, great. Teenagers.</p><p>They looked like teens from my own time, except for their heavy, suffocating clothes. Frilly, silly, catty, whispery, scared but hiding it with bravado. The boldest of them broke off from the group and stepped up to me with a flounce and a sneer as her friends giggled behind her.</p><p>\u201cCan you really tell fortunes?\u201d she said. \u201cMy pa says it\u2019s a trick.\u201d</p> <p>I lowered my head and looked up at her through my painted eyelashes, trying to appear mysterious. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trick, miss,\u201d I said, my voice husky. \u201cTouch my hand and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much is it, then?\u201d she said as if bored, but I could tell that she was caught.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think it is worth,\u201d I said. \u201cTo know your future.\u201d</p><p>I held out my hand, with the glove already removed. Mrs. Cleavers had filed my nails to talons and shellacked them, bright red as cherries. When the girl saw it, she gasped.</p><p>\u201cRemove your glove,\u201d I said with a knowing smile.</p><p>She looked back to her friends. They urged her on, and she knew she couldn\u2019t back down. She removed her glove with a dainty, unwilling tenderness. She likely hadn\u2019t shown her hand to anyone but her parents in her entire life.</p><p>When I touched her skin, the jolt was quick.</p><p>\u201cThe lad you love doesn\u2019t return the sentiment,\u201d I said, my voice low. \u201cBut another does. Beware the one with golden eyes, for she will betray you. Tell your father not to bet on the black mare. Listen to your mother, and don\u2019t marry the first one who asks, and you will find happiness.\u201d</p><p>I dropped her hand. Her eyes bugged out unbecomingly, showing me how young she truly was. \u201cThank you, lady,\u201d she said.</p><p>She slipped her glove on and dropped some coins onto the table. I whisked them into a little bag at my feet, as Criminy had told me never to let them see the money. Her circle of friends enveloped her, but she shook her head at their questions.</p><p>\u201cShe sees true,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say.\u201d</p><p>Of course, her six friends fell into line before me, and my bag of coins grew heavier. Every time I grasped a hand, I was terrified that I would see something horrible, some hideous end that I couldn\u2019t prevent with a few well-chosen words. Or even worse, that I wouldn\u2019t see anything and would have to make something up on the fly. But life in the city, from what I glanced, was dull and mostly safe. Only one girl\u2019s palm held a tragedy, and I was able to help on that one.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what your boyfriend says, never sneak out at night,\u201d I said, my tone dark and foreboding. \u201cOr else your death will come from the shadows of the alleys, and your mother will find your bones nibbled by bludrats.\u201d</p><p>It sounded bad because, well, it was bad. But it could easily be averted. Stay inside, stupid. I hoped I had scared her sufficiently.</p><p>Fortunately for business, nothing spread the word like a group of impressed and terrified teenage girls. Soon I had a line, and Criminy\u2019s clockwork monkey came by to do tricks for pennies, which she gathered in her little fez. After turning several back flips, she brought me a note in elegant handwriting signed with a C.</p><p>Well done, love, you\u2019re a star was all it said, but my mysterious mask cracked into the goofy smile of a kid receiving a love note in high school.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d said the next customer. \u201cCan we make this quick?\u201d</p><p>I looked up into the anxious face of a Copper. I recognized the spade beard and mustache. It was Ferling, the nicer of the two I\u2019d seen on my first morning in Sang while I was invisible.</p><p>I discreetly tucked the monkeygram into my sleeve.</p><p>His nervous fidgeting told me that whatever Coppers were allowed to do at the carnival, fortune-telling wasn\u2019t on the list. With shifting eyes, he yanked off his leather glove, which had already been unbuttoned. He was ready. And he was worried.</p><p>\u201cI need to know if my wife is true,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cQuick.\u201d</p><p>I grasped his hand, and the jolt was powerful.</p><p>Oh, gracious. This wasn\u2019t good at all.</p><p>\u201cYour wife is true, but she is being forced,\u201d I said. \u201cProof lies in the spice chest. The baby is yours. Stay faithful, and all will be well. The bones can knit. Seek vengeance, and all will be lost in blood. When the time comes to choose, remember this.\u201d</p><p>His face was stricken, his hand trembling in mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said in my regular voice.</p><p>\u201cThank you, lady,\u201d he said, tossing a vial of blood onto the table and disappearing into the crowd.</p><p>It was a tough fortune, and I felt sorry for the man. What I hadn\u2019t told him was that his wife was being blackmailed by his partner, Rodvey. It was a fast, confusing jumble of visions, but I could see that if he confronted Rodvey, the resulting duel would leave them both dead. In the bottom of the spice chest, he would find the documents that his wife was winning from Rodvey with her body one page at a time, a fake declamation of Ferling\u2019s supposed illegal dealings with the Bludman\u2019s Guild. She was doing it to protect him from a false accusation and certain execution.</p><p>As I had first deduced, Rodvey was a very bad man.</p><p>I had seen something else when I touched Ferling\u2019s hand, though, something even scarier that I was absolutely positive not to mention. It was a secret meeting of hooded figures, all in copper-colored velvet robes and surrounded by candles in a stone chamber. In the center of their circle lay a Bludman, whiter than white, his blud draining into strange channels carved into the floor. The faces of the cloaked men were in shadow, and I didn\u2019t recognize the voice that spoke.</p><p>\u201cAnother demon drained. But he has many brothers, and we will bring a plague on their kind, sent from the gods to purge the wickedness of Sang,\u201d the voice boomed. \u201cWe will destroy all the creatures of blud once and for all. The Stranger will come to make our world pure again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d came the answering chant.</p><p>The Coppers were planning a secret genocide, and I had no clue how to stop it.</p><p>My mind was elsewhere, which made the glancing even easier. Everything seemed so petty after Ferling\u2019s revelation, and I didn\u2019t have any problem seeming mysterious and far away.</p><p>It was amazing how many people needed to be told not to go out alone in the dark of night. It just seemed so obvious, like telling people not to jump out in front of cars. But being cooped up in their clothes and their homes seemed to lull the Pinkies into a false sense of safety. It wasn\u2019t even Bludmen they had to worry about, swooping in like dark angels to drain them in the shadows. No, it was the stupid bludrats. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Faces blurred together, and glances streamed into glances. I forgot most of them almost immediately, like passing faces on a busy sidewalk. I\u2019d only been glancing for a few hours, but I was starting to get sleepy. It must have been time to wake up, in my other world.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, madam,\u201d came a deep, fatherly voice with a cultivated English accent.</p><p>I had been drifting off. Oops.</p> <p>With my head still hanging low, I looked up through my eyelashes. A kind-looking old man with a big, gray walrus mustache smiled at me and held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a great deal about your talent,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to know my future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d I said, and grasped his hand.</p><p>Despite myself, I gasped. His glance was just as jumbled and fast and confusing as Ferling\u2019s, but the secret went even deeper.</p><p>First, I saw this man in the city, in an office, speaking to a roomful of Coppers. He was wealthy and powerful, something like a mayor. Outside his window, I saw a soaring white church with broken windows and a strange spire shaped like an X.</p> <p>Next, I saw him throw back the hood of his copper-colored robe in the empty ritual chamber and kick the drained Bludman\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cOne down, a million to go,\u201d he said to himself.</p><p>Lastly, and most chillingly, I saw the old man asleep.</p><p>But in the vision, he wasn\u2019t wearing this tall top hat, buttoned down his throat. He wasn\u2019t wearing gloves or boots or a copper-colored, bloodstained robe.</p><p>No, he was reclining in an expensive bed, tucked into rich, fluffy blankets. On his right was a small table with a telephone and a clock radio. On his left was an IV stand. An older woman in nursing scrubs changed out his IV bag, saying, \u201cWell, then, Mr. Grove. That\u2019s better, ain\u2019t it? Y\u2019all missin\u2019 a beautiful spring day, you know.\u201d</p><p>She looked out the window at a magnificent magnolia tree in full bloom within a high brick wall. In the fancy driveway was a minivan with Helping Hands Homecare on the side next to two purple hands forming a heart.</p> <p>I startled as the old man asked, \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d in a playful, patronizing tone.</p><p>The British accent sounded fake to me, and I wondered what his real one was like. I knew that I had to lie, but I had only a split second to decide whether to seem genuine or ham it up. I went with fake and threw in several of the trite phrases Criminy had taught me.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir. You are a very powerful man, a great leader. You will live a long and fulfilling life. Your destiny is cloudy. The spirits watch over you. Beware a dark-haired stranger.\u201d</p><p>I focused on his mustache as I finished, and it twitched. His eyes narrowed. He was suspicious. Whether he believed me or not, I couldn\u2019t say. Most people aren\u2019t prepared for a true fortune-teller who speaks lies.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said. \u201cI see.\u201d Then his eyes traveled over my face and down to my chest. I drew back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely chain,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re brave, my dear, to wear so little clothing around these monsters.\u201d</p><p>Criminy and Mrs. Cleavers had decided to dress me in a Bludman\u2019s blouse for the actual crowd, since they would all be Pinkies. It upped the exotic factor and would help draw their attention away from my occasional blunder. The top of the locket barely peeked out from my cleavage, the ruby glinting in the flickering light.</p><p>I wrapped my hand around the locket defensively. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes roved over me. I shifted and drew the shawl over my skin, clearing my throat and looking at the ground. At that signal, Pemberly stopped her cavorting and ran up to tug on the man\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cOur time appears to be up,\u201d he said in the same kindly voice. \u201cThank you so much for sharing your talents, my dear.\u201d</p><p>He dropped a gold coin onto the table and strode purposefully back into the crowd. My next customer stepped up, a middle-aged woman with desperate eyes.</p><p>\u201cOne moment, madam,\u201d I said.</p><p>Fortunately, there was a feather quill on my table, along with the crystal ball, skull, and other props. I scrawled on the back of Criminy\u2019s earlier note, Old man big mustache head of Coppers wants to kill Bludmen is really Stranger!!! I crumpled it up and gave it to Pemberly.</p><p>\u201cTake it to Criminy,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Her eyes clicked closed and open again in acknowledgment, and she scampered into the crowd. I put on a professional smile for the waiting customer and held out my hand.</p><p>Then I went unconscious.</p><p>14</p><p>Even before my eyes opened, I was overwhelmed. The cacophony was dizzying. My alarm was buzzing, my cell phone was jingling, and my cat was meowing.</p><p>9:47. Crap.</p><p>First the alarm. Slept in for more than two hours. Oops.</p><p>Then the cell phone.</p><p>\u201cNana, I\u2019m so, so sorry,\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cWell, sugar, you\u2019re the one who has to clean up if I wet myself,\u201d she said in her most peevish tone, \u201cAlthough breakfast would be nice, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way, and I\u2019m bringing doughnuts,\u201dI said.</p><p>\u201cI might forgive you, then,\u201d she said.</p><p>I was so exhausted that I could barely stand up. I made a beeline for the coffeemaker.</p><p>My morning was blurry and heavy, like being drunk without the fun. I showed up at Nana\u2019s just in time to prevent a laundry crisis and mutual mortification, served her hot doughnuts and hotter coffee, and sleepwalked through my chores there, barely able to focus on what she said. I was so tired that I was scared to drive to my next patient.</p><p>I ran a red light and nearly got T-boned on the way to Mr. Rathbin\u2019s. When I parked in the driveway, I barely registered that two tires were in his grass. I didn\u2019t bother to repark.</p><p>\u201cHaving a good day, Mr. Rathbin?\u201d I asked with a yawn.</p><p>He was pretty jolly for a terminal patient\u2014unless I was late. Luckily, I had brought him one of Nana\u2019s extra doughnuts, so he was in a great mood. I set up his meds and helped him brush his teeth. Then, as I was carrying his used bedpan to the toilet, I passed out and hit the floor in a puddle of Mr. Rathbin\u2019s urine.</p><p>As I slowly rose to consciousness, I had the marvelous, achy, breathless feeling that I only got from several hours of uninterrupted sleep. It was completely delicious. I wiggled my toes and stretched my arms and legs and yawned. It was good to feel rested again. I opened my eyes to complete darkness.</p><p>I knew immediately that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>I felt around blindly until I found a side table with a button. I pushed it, and orange light filled the room. It was my wagon.</p><p>\u201cCriminy?\u201d I called. There was an answering rustle in the other part of the wagon, and the door opened. He looked confused. And sleepy.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, love?\u201d he said, rubbing his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s barely morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI was at work, and then I woke up here. What happened?\u201d</p><p>He came in and sat down on the bed, his hand warm on my cheek. I was still in the blouse and skirt from my costume, with my corset laces mercifully loosened. And I was scared.</p><p>\u201cYou fell after nine,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the middle of glancing. It was very dramatic, and I suspect your line will be doubly long tonight. I carried you here and put you to bed. But you shouldn\u2019t be awake now, I don\u2019t think. Unless you fell asleep in your dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just after lunch,\u201d I said. \u201cI was helping a patient, and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just opened my eyes, and I was here. But I feel rested. How is that possible?\u201d</p><p>I tried to look into Criminy\u2019s eyes, but they were focused on my exposed cleavage.</p><p>\u201cUp here, mister,\u201d I said with a playful grin.</p><p>\u201cMy locket,\u201d he said simply. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>I reached down, and he was right. Both locket and chain were gone.</p><p>\u201cWhere? How?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered, angry. \u201cI was right outside. I only fell asleep for a moment. No one came near the door. Pemberly\u2019s been on guard. There hasn\u2019t been a sound. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it mean I\u2019m stuck here? Is that why I\u2019m not exhausted\u2014because I was actually asleep? In Sang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be possible,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>\u201cSo what am I doing in my other world? Am I asleep there? Am I dead?\u201d I said, voice trembling, fearful. \u201cWho\u2019s going to take care of my grandmother? Am I on Mr. Rathbin\u2019s floor? Oh, my God. What\u2019s happening to me?\u201d</p><p>Tears coursed hot down my cheeks. Criminy wrapped his arms around me and stroked my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, love,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I asked. My nose was buried in his neck, and the scent was calming and powerful. I somehow hadn\u2019t imagined him being this warm and comforting.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that, either,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to find out how it happened.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and whistled, and Pemberly capered in through the door.</p><p>\u201cPem, someone got into this room. Search it. Find a hole, a trapdoor, anything.\u201d</p><p>The little monkey began to skitter along the walls. Red beams flickered from her eyes, scanning. Criminy watched her, and I couldn\u2019t read him. He should have seemed more worried, more angry. But he wasn\u2019t. He almost seemed relaxed. I was missing something.</p><p>Then I realized why. If the loss of the locket meant that I was trapped here, then he didn\u2019t have to share me.</p><p>It meant that I was stuck here. I couldn\u2019t leave him.</p><p>\u201cCriminy,\u201d I said, low and flat.</p><p>\u201cYes, love?\u201d he asked calmly.</p><p>\u201cDid you take the locket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it means, if you don\u2019t find it,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t think I can\u2019t see. And I\u2019m not playing along. If you don\u2019t find the locket, I\u2019m not just going to give up and live here as your personal plaything. It\u2019s all or nothing. If I\u2019m trapped here, I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019ll never love you. I\u2019ll go live in the city. You can\u2019t keep me here against my will. I get both worlds, or I get none.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should have expected that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t a wild sort of creature, I wouldn\u2019t love you. It would be easy if you just gave in, but easy isn\u2019t worth anything, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said so yourself,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find it, then,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Once Pemberly showed us the perfectly round, rat-sized hole along the baseboard, the story was easy enough to piece together. The culprit had been a clockwork, and it had known exactly what it was looking for.</p><p>\u201cNibbled through the chain\u2019s links with titanium teeth, most likely,\u201d said Criminy. \u201cWhoever took it must be powerful and rich. And determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetermined?\u201d I said. \u201cIs it worth much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDepends how much your other world is worth to you, pet,\u201d he said, thoughtful as he sipped his breakfast from a cup delicately painted with pansies. \u201cThe ruby is big enough but not worth such trouble. He must have known it was enchanted. Tell me\u2014has anyone spoken to you about the locket?\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Suddenly, it all made sense. The old man, a Stranger himself, interested in my pretty locket. A Stranger who wanted to destroy all of the Bludmen. A Stranger who might want a way back to my world. In between meeting him and passing out, I hadn\u2019t had time to piece it together. I told Criminy everything, from Ferling\u2019s glance to the old man\u2019s curiosity about the necklace.</p><p>He went very still as he listened, his lips compressing into a thin white line and his eyes growing hard. \u201cI never got that note,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been tampering with my clockworks. And planning a secret genocide. Did you get a name?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cBut he\u2019s the boss of the two we saw on the moor, Rodvey and Ferling. He\u2019s an old man with a big, white mustache. And he\u2019s a sort of leader\u2014of a city and of all of the Coppers. Like a mayor. And he works way up high, near a big, ruined, white church with an X on top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Manchester,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cCathedral of Saint Ermenegilda. He must be the Magistrate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did no one recognize him, though?\u201d I asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t he important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me, not until now. I live outside his laws. It\u2019s not an elected position, see? He\u2019s in power, he makes the rules, and everyone in the city has to live by them. But he\u2019s not going to advertise. Still, he shouldn\u2019t be hard to find, and I have friends there. Wisest course of action would be to beat him at his own game. Steal the locket back.\u201d</p><p>We planned to set out after breakfast, traveling the road on foot. There was much to do before leaving, from briefing Mrs. Cleavers on caravan business to gathering up food and blood. We took a little money but not much. It wouldn\u2019t pay to appear suspicious or remotely like a target. Besides, we could always earn our supper on the streets with Criminy\u2019s magic or my glancing.</p><p>While Criminy was talking to Mrs. Cleavers, I sat on the steps of her wagon, gazing at the morning haze hanging over the moors and thinking about my grandmother. I had never felt so far away from comfort and safety.</p><p>\u201cReady to go fetch your wonderful cities?\u201d someone asked, and I looked up to find Casper leaning against the wagon, his smile playful. As if he had forgotten our earlier disagreement. So I played along.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, Mr. Whitman,\u201d I said coyly. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little scared of the contemptible dreams part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how that feels,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about your dreams, too. And I don\u2019t like to think of you alone on the moors with him.\u201d He looked thoughtful and inviting, hair down and smile warm. Being around him made me feel young and special and full of hope, and I liked it. With a quick, guilty thought of Criminy, I patted the wood board beside me.</p><p>He sat down next to me on the step, and I was hyper-aware of his hip and shoulder touching mine. The wind blew his hair in my face, and it smelled of soap. Not berries and vines and darkness but good, clean soap. And his skin smelled so human, so manly, of a life lived in the sun.</p> <p>\u201cCriminy says that glancers can see everyone\u2019s future but their own,\u201d I said, feeling a blush creep up my cheeks. \u201cBut I truly believe that in the end, you\u2019ll have what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019ve ever wanted before now was music,\u201d he said. His shoulder pressed against me, and I unconsciously leaned into him. \u201cI was so busy practicing and traveling and writing. I never had time for people. And now I have so much time and no one to share it with.\u201d</p><p>A breeze came up, and a lock of my hair whipped across my face. He gently tucked it behind my ear, and his fingers left velvet trails of fire on my skin. I closed my eyes, lost in the moment, and his lips pressed against mine, warm and soft and tender. I felt like a teenager having her first kiss on the doorstep, a stolen moment where everything is golden and shimmering and achingly beautiful. And so, so fleeting.</p><p>Just when I hoped the kiss would get deeper, he pulled away and stroked my face. \u201cYou\u2019re so lovely,\u201d he said. \u201cGentle and curving and beautiful, as a woman should be.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows rose at the word should, and I had to ask, \u201cWhat else do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a nurse, so you must be kind and good-hearted. You know Leaves of Grass, so you must be educated and poetic. You\u2019re beautiful, but anyone can see that. And you\u2019ve got that monster Stain wrapped around your little finger, which is pretty clever. The girls fawn at him all day, and he ignores them, and here he\u2019s already given you your own wagon. But being my girl won\u2019t keep you on his good side, I\u2019m sorry to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not anyone\u2019s girl,\u201d I said, pulling away and peeling my shoulder off his.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you kiss me?\u201d he asked, beautiful blue eyes pleading in a way that somehow made me like him less. \u201cYou just feel right to me. I feel so close to you, like you\u2019re home. And I think you feel that way about me, too.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t answer. I did feel that way about him, and I longed for closeness and peace. He was my only link to my world, to the future I\u2019d always wanted. But I wasn\u2019t sure if this was the right way to get it. There was something in his desperation that reminded me of Jeff. And it wasn\u2019t his business how I felt about Criminy. I turned my face away and sighed. The breeze became a chill wind, and a cloud passed in front of the sun. He reached for my hand, but I shrugged away, tucking my hands into the billowing fabric of my skirt. The moment was gone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen your own future, haven\u2019t you? And you think you can\u2019t change it. You\u2019re not willing to take a chance on me.\u201d He put his head down and chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s a little scary, what you do.\u201d</p><p>His words wounded me deeper than I would have guessed. As I tried to figure out how to respond, Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s door gently shut, and with words as sharp and cold as the blade of a knife, Criminy said, \u201cIf you\u2019re scared of her talent, then you don\u2019t truly know what fear is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to wish you luck,\u201d Casper said stiffly. He stood and lifted my limp hand from my lap, kissing my glove with that same pleading look in his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s continue this discussion sometime, Letitia. Under more pleasant circumstances.\u201d He nodded curtly and added, \u201cTake care of her, Stain.\u201d He walked away into the grasses, glowing in a sunbeam, and I wondered if we would ever find our golden place again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Master Stain to you, maestro,\u201d Criminy growled at his back. \u201cAnd never fear; I\u2019ll keep her close enough.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me to my unsteady feet and gently slipped off my gloves, tossing them into the grass. The wind felt strange and wild on my fingers. With a meaningful look in his stormy eyes, Criminy brought my hand to his face and kissed the palm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never fear you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThe maestro\u2019s a fool.\u201d Then he rapped on Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s door and shouted, \u201cCleavers! Bring my lady a clean pair of gloves.\u201d</p><p>I slipped on the new gloves, which were black like Criminy\u2019s. His kiss, so light and soft, still burned against my palm. It was nice to know that at least one man wasn\u2019t intimidated by my gifts, but I had to admit that I was maybe a little worried about his own talents. And teeth.</p><p>\u201cAre we going alone?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI had assumed so,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cUnless you have a special friend besides the maestro? He wouldn\u2019t be much good for drawing the bludbunnies off you, but he\u2019d be fine for target practice.\u201d</p><p>He winked, and I blew a raspberry. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d I said. \u201cFor safety, I was thinking. Or help when we get where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Criminy\u2019s mouth quirked up, and he said, \u201cLove, you\u2019re traveling with a very dangerous person. I have razor-sharp teeth, I\u2019m difficult to kill, and then there\u2019s the whole \u2018magic\u2019 thing. Do you think Licky the Lazy Lizard Boy would be much help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, feeling stubborn. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it odd\u2014a Bludman and a woman traveling alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to our traveling papers, which Mrs. Cleavers is fashioning now, we\u2019re husband and wife. I\u2019m Ecrivan Paisley, and you\u2019re my wife, Petula. I took your name,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, my prickly little hedgehog, it\u2019s the safest thing for us both,\u201d he said. \u201cTraveling together without a proper relationship makes me a predator and you a trollop. It\u2019ll be bad enough when they think we\u2019re married. And there\u2019s still the caravan tonight, so everyone else is needed. It was lucky, you passing out in front of last night\u2019s crowd. We\u2019ll say you\u2019re in communion with the spirits, and no one will dare knock on your door.\u201d</p><p>Just as we were setting off, Vil galloped into view. \u201cMurdoch says it\u2019s ready, sir,\u201d he said, and he held out a small wooden box, about five inches square. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d Criminy said, snatching the box and opening it. He held it out to me and said, \u201cWedding present, Petula. Try it on.\u201d</p><p>Nestled within on a bed of soft cloth was a brass bracelet shaped like a snake. Copper diamonds shone among the scales, and dull ruby eyes were set in the head.</p><p>\u201cDo I just pick it up and slide it on?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Vil blinked at me, his twitchy eyes huge behind the goggles. \u201cNever had a clockwork before?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere\u2019d you say you were from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s from Bruzzles,\u201d Criminy snapped. \u201cFrom good country folk. Don\u2019t make her feel self-conscious, you dolt.\u201d He picked up the bracelet and handed it to me. I didn\u2019t know what to expect as I slipped it over my glove and onto my wrist.</p><p>Nothing happened. I looked at it as if it might bite me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to imprint on you, love,\u201d Criminy said, reaching over to press a raised jewel between the eyes, which lit up. I must have looked distrustful, because he grinned slyly and added, \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>He moved my wrist in front of my face. With an odd whir, the little snake\u2019s head turned toward me, blinding me with red light.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s scanning you,\u201d Criminy said softly. \u201cDon\u2019t blink.\u201d</p><p>I kept my eyes open wide while the light went back and forth, flickering on and off. The snake made a grinding noise, and then the mouth opened and released the tail. I held my other hand underneath, afraid to drop it, and it slithered onto my glove. It was amazing how lithe the little robot was, how the scales flexed like those of a real snake.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a little Uroboros,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo tell him,\u201d Vil said, losing patience.</p><p>\u201cTell who what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him his name, lass, so he\u2019ll know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUroboros,\u201d I said, putting my mouth near his head. \u201cUro is what I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Another grinding noise, then a click, and the eyes flashed once with red. Then a black tongue made of thick wire flickered out and back in.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all set, then,\u201d Vil said. He pulled out a little slip of paper and read, \u201cPress the head scale to move from rest mode to active and back. All the common commands. Guard, hide, find, and such. He\u2019s not nearly as complex and useful as a monkey, but honestly, I only had two days. Oh, and for defensive purposes, he\u2019s programmed to bite, and he\u2019s loaded with two doses. Signed, the elusive Mr. Murdoch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo doses of what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Vil grinned. \u201cSomething I cooked up myself. Instant and profuse vomiting, followed by unconsciousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds effective,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He beamed.</p><p>I watched the small snake spread out on my palm, red eyes flickering occasionally and small tongue poking out and in. I pressed the head scale, and he curled into a hoop, bit his own tail, and turned back into a very peculiar piece of jewelry. I slid him over my wrist and took Criminy\u2019s arm.</p> <p>We were off.</p><p>15</p><p>We followed the deep tread marks of the bus tanks that had carried the city folk to the caravan. The brown scars snaked through the hills and disappeared in the distant fog. As we walked in silence, I watched the countryside, comparing it with my world. It was a strange place, and I\u2019d never seen so much wide-open space in my life. No houses or barns or even ruins. Just miles of grass, small copses, and the occasional bludbunny.</p><p>When we saw a fawn peeking out from behind a bush, I stopped to stare at the wide, liquid brown eyes. Then a shower of leaves erupted behind it, and a red-eyed doe towered over the little brown form, dropping a mauled rabbit corpse to hiss at me with bloodstained fangs. The placid fawn copied its mother, the vicious hiss ridiculous coming from the tiny, toothless mouth.</p><p>\u201cBack away, love,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cIf you think the bunnies are bad, you haven\u2019t met a bluddoe. They\u2019re rather protective.\u201d</p><p>I did back away, and I continued walking backward until the doe closed her mouth and nuzzled the fawn sweetly. Criminy laughed at me, but my eyes were a little sharper from then on, contemplating the dark possibilities of a forest where Snow White had more to fear from her animal friends than from any wicked queen.</p><p>Criminy carried most of our things in an old leather satchel, and he looked dashing with his top hat and traveling cloak. I wore a wool shawl and a heavy black bonnet that buttoned under my chin. With my gloved hand in the crook of Criminy\u2019s arm, walking across the moors made me feel as if I\u2019d stepped primly out of a Jane Austen book or an Impressionist painting. But I bet even Elizabeth Bennet had never punted a rabbit before, and my current count was 137.</p><p>\u201cHow far is it?\u201d I finally asked, chewing on an apple from the bag.</p><p>He had several chains looping across his waistcoat, and he stopped to pull one out. It was a large brass compass, but it ticked like a wind-up watch. \u201cWalking, I\u2019d say we\u2019re half a day away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Manchester in my world, too, you know,\u201d I said thoughtfully. \u201cI wonder why some of the places here are a couple of letters off from what I know? Bruzzles sounds like Brussels. Franchia sounds like France. And Manchester is the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent worlds run that way, I suppose,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ve read enough about them, and there are always similarities. I suppose it\u2019s like a slight warp in a mirror. You\u2019re still you, just a little fatter or thinner or more wobbly. Just a tiny change with grand repercussions.\u201d</p><p>And then it clicked.</p><p>\u201cStein. I found the locket in Mrs. Stein\u2019s house. And that\u2019s just one letter away from Stain. Maybe you guys are related?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless she drinks blood, darling,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help wondering what tiny catalyst had caused our worlds to split, if that supposition was correct. If it went back to the Big Bang or if something had gone wrong with an overly aggressive paramecium in the primordial soup. \u201cFunny thing is,\u201d he continued, \u201cManchester used to be called Bludchester. It was an old city built by Bludmen, and they took it from us in a grand slaughter centuries ago. The cathedral was originally dedicated to Aztarte, the goddess of Bludmen. But now they say it belongs to the Pinky saint Ermenegilda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried?\u201d I asked. \u201cAbout going there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said with a grim grin. \u201cBut I\u2019m going anyway. It\u2019ll take a good bit of acting, but I like acting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just make me invisible again?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, thinking things should be easy,\u201d he said with a fond chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be invisible out on the moors with plenty of space and quiet. But in the city, people will bump into you, carriages could strike you, and bludrats will smell you there, anyway. And if something happened to you, if we were separated or you were hurt, I wouldn\u2019t be able to find you again. You would be stuck that way forever, dead or alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said with a shudder. \u201cBut why can\u2019t you just pretend to be human, then?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, his eyes hard and flinty. \u201cI don\u2019t mind pretending to be inferior to you personally, and I very much don\u2019t mind feigning marriage,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll never betray what I am. The fine people of Manchester may think me a fiend, but prejudice runs both ways. I\u2019ve a bit of pride about me, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with what you are,\u201d I said shyly. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to mess up, and you\u2019re much better at this sort of thing than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll enjoy playing along. You\u2019ll have to be haughty, and I\u2019ll have to act beaten down, when we\u2019re in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds kind of fun,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s a ruse, love,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause once we\u2019re outside the walls again, you\u2019ll be entirely in my power. And I\u2019d hate to have to spank you.\u201d</p><p>I choked on the apple I was chewing and couldn\u2019t quite figure out how serious he was. Or how serious I wanted him to be.</p><p>A few hours later, a giant form began to shimmer in the distance. As we walked closer, I could see it, but it didn\u2019t make sense. Gravity shouldn\u2019t have allowed such a place to exist.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d Criminy said, handing me a brass spyglass. \u201cManchester.\u201d</p><p>I had to blink. The spyglass was incredible. I could see everything in amazing detail. Not that I really wanted to.</p><p>The city rose like a tumor on the landscape, like the shell of a hermit crab with extremely bad taste and a powerful glue gun. It was so much larger than I would have thought possible, an enormous mountain covered in stone and brick and wood. Around the base, in a valley, I could see fields and mines and quarries and refineries and factories belching smoke. A high, hideous wall of dirty gray stone surrounded everything. Razor wire curled around the top edge like deadly cake icing.</p><p>The empty moors seemed harmless and peaceful by comparison.</p><p>Within the wall, the buildings tottered from the mountain and from one another at odd angles, shored up by cables and poles and metal beams. An oily gray fug hung over everything. It was possibly the most depressing place I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>On the very top of the mountain perched a gigantic white church of a Gothic flavor, with flying buttresses and broken stained glass. At the very pinnacle was the large X from my glance, like a cross fallen on hard times.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where our boy will be,\u201d Criminy said, reading my mind. \u201cRight in the \u2018holier than thou\u2019 seat, at the very tip top of the broken city, standing on the backs of the suffering.\u201d</p><p>I had a strong feeling that he was right. And I really didn\u2019t want to be inside those walls.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go in through the front gate,\u201d Criminy said, taking the spyglass back. \u201cAnd there are only two gates, so we\u2019ll have to leave through the other one right fast, because they\u2019ll be looking for us after the deed is done. So try to hide your face and act as normal as possible.\u201d He reached up to my bonnet and pulled down a delicate black veil that made me feel like a goth beekeeper. He smiled at the effect and asked, \u201cCan you put on an accent? Try to sound more like me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow will this do, then?\u201d I said, rather proud of myself.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNice try, love, but that\u2019s a bit much. Tone it down a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rain in Spain lands mainly on the plain,\u201d I said carefully.</p> <p>\u201cThe rain in Vane never touches the plain,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cVane is mostly jungles. Do you have any other accents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs annoyed an accent?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just pretend you\u2019re a mute.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at him, and he laughed that wild laugh of his. For just a second, I forgot the insurmountable odds we were up against and my worry for Nana. I laughed that way, too, and it felt good.</p><p>By that time, the wide treads of the bus tanks had turned into a dirt road. The ground was starting to get muddy as the grasses dwindled, the few straggling tufts by the road stunted and brown. Bludbunnies were fewer and fewer.</p> <p>And then I learned why.</p><p>16</p><p>I saw the thing in the road before I smelled it, but the smell was a close second. I couldn\u2019t tell what it was. Just enough meat had been nibbled off the bones to remove hair and obscure the details. But it was definitely a carcass. And right on top of it was the biggest rat I\u2019d ever seen, about the size of a house cat and covered with bristly, rust-colored hair.</p><p>Criminy didn\u2019t even slow down, but I crowded closer to his side as we approached. The rat didn\u2019t seem concerned by us, either, not until we were about twenty feet away. Then it looked up, tubes and sinews dripping from its mouth, and hissed. The effect of its bloodred eyes in the maroon fur was disturbing.</p><p>Criminy kept walking, dragging me along toward the nasty rat monster. The thing swallowed whatever it had been chewing and jumped off the carcass, hopping toward us with hackles raised. The fur stuck up in spines behind its neck, and it screamed at us. The scream sounded just like that of a human child.</p><p>Without breaking his stride or letting go of my arm, Criminy pulled something out of his boot and threw it. I barely saw the dark blur shoot out of his left hand, and then the rat was twitching on its side, with a black knife sticking out of its forehead.</p> <p>We kept walking, and just as we reached the dead rat, Criminy withdrew his knife with a jerk. As he cleaned it on a handkerchief, I pondered the pile of meat.</p><p>\u201cIt was a sheep, if you\u2019re wondering,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>And I could see it now over my shoulder, the fuzzy white wool dangling from the general shape of a very chewed-up sheep.</p><p>\u201cHow could it possibly get out of the wall?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey have to bring the grazers out for the fresh grass. They can\u2019t grow enough inside the wall to feed the animals. So they bring a team of shepherds bristling with weapons. But if the blud creatures swarm, they just leave one animal behind, a sacrifice for the rest of the herd. Fits in with their general philosophy.\u201d</p><p>The knife disappeared into his boot. We didn\u2019t break our stride. I looked back at the giant rat and said, \u201cSo that\u2019s a bludrat. And the city is full of those things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they try to kill them all. But they\u2019re wily buggers. Bold and clever. No matter what the Coppers do, they always find a way back in. If I didn\u2019t hate the things so much, I\u2019d be impressed.\u201d</p><p>The city loomed bigger and bigger as we approached. The wall had seemed tall from far away, but standing in front of the gargantuan door made me feel helpless and tiny. I couldn\u2019t begin to imagine how the two guards could open the two-story metal monstrosity. They each stood in a small building about the size of a closet, one on either side of the door. And they barely looked human, leather top hats laced down the neck, high collars digging into their chins, and bug-eyed goggles obscuring their eyes.</p> <p>\u201cPapers,\u201d barked the guard on the right through some sort of speaker, and Criminy led me to the glass wall of the booth. He slid our folded, faded traveling papers into a metal box and withdrew his hand before the guard jerked the box into his booth with a clang.</p><p>Criminy smiled and did his best to look harmless and weak. I stuck my nose in the air and rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cState your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re visiting relatives, sir,\u201d Criminy said, his voice humble and obsequious. I knew he was an actor, but I was still floored that he sounded nothing like himself. \u201cThe wife and I. My cousin Anders and his family want to meet the new bride. He\u2019s a clockmaker, sir, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToll!\u201d the guard shouted. \u201cFive coppers or one vial each.\u201d</p><p>The metal box popped violently back out of the booth, and Criminy snatched out our papers and dropped in a handful of coins. The box shot back into the booth.</p><p>\u201cStand back,\u201d the man said, and Criminy dragged me backward.</p><p>The guard pulled a lever, and with a loud whirring and several clanks, one of the giant doors began to swing outward. I looked at the guard and quickly glanced away. Nothing but his nose and lips was visible under his uniform, but I could read his disgust for me in his sneer. I straightened my shoulders and snuggled my head into Criminy\u2019s shoulder, giving the guard a look of disdainful rebellion. Criminy kissed me on the forehead and chuckled, and the guard spit on the floor and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only going to get worse,\u201d Criminy muttered into my ear as we walked through the doorway. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, darling. Everyone\u2019s going to hate us.\u201d</p><p>As the door clanged shut behind us, my throat constricted. I wasn\u2019t sure what I had expected to find within the tall wall, but it was worse than I could have imagined. The cobblestone streets were narrow and dirty, rife with puddles. The buildings towered above, blocking the sky. The windows all had a dirty film on them, and the people rushed from place to place as if they were being chased. They all looked at me with disgust, just as the guard had done.</p><p>Head down, Criminy quickly led me through the streets. We were on the main thoroughfare, a winding road lined with restaurants, inns, haberdashers, and milliners, all with painted signs swinging above their doors. Criminy didn\u2019t know where he was, but he knew what he was looking for.</p><p>We ducked down an alley. Red lights glittered from the shadows, and I heard a familiar hiss. All of the hairs on the back of my neck rose. It was darker there and more narrow, and I had to jog to keep up with him, my boots\u2019 staccato tapping echoing in a way that made me think of bones in oubliettes. Finally, we stopped before a sign showing a vial of blood and a pair of scissors, with the words Arven Ariel, Barber and Letter calligraphed underneath.</p><p>We stepped through the door and brushed past heavy, moldering curtains. I was expecting a cross between a morgue and a medieval barber, darkness and cobwebs and the smell of meat. But it looked more like a Mexican restaurant. Bright colors, fake palm trees, patterned fans and curtains. The walls were a vivid orange, and the floor was a sparkling, patterned mosaic of blue and lime green. Three plush chairs of maroon velvet waited in a row, each with a tasseled ottoman. A purple parrot on a stand squawked, \u201cMaster Arven, ye\u2019ve custom!\u201d</p><p>Criminy was smirking at me. \u201cNot what it seemed, eh?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always like that in the city.\u201d</p><p>A very normal-looking man in a bowler hat brushed through a beaded curtain and approached us with a blank, professional smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, sir? Letting, shave, or haircut?\u201d he asked, rubbing his hands together in burgundy gloves.</p><p>\u201cA letting,\u201d Criminy said cheerfully. \u201cAnd information, if you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t madam have a seat?\u201d the man asked, leading me to the middle chair. On a tray beside it sat a variety of scissors, straight razors, glass tubes, and antique-looking hypodermic needles. They didn\u2019t look entirely clean.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, what?\u201d I said, planting my feet.</p><p>\u201cYour blood, darling,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cThree vials, I think.\u201d</p><p>The man tugged on my hand. I didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d I said sweetly through clenched teeth, \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware I\u2019d be donating blood today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Criminy answered me, \u201cwe bring different gifts to the marriage, and right now, we need your blood. So won\u2019t you have a seat and relax? I\u2019m told it doesn\u2019t hurt a bit. Just a pinch.\u201d</p><p>I glowered at him. He smiled. I plunked into the chair and gripped the armrests. My gloved fingers tapped. I wasn\u2019t scared of having blood drawn, and especially not of drawing it myself. But I didn\u2019t trust those primitive instruments, even in a world without infection or disease.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I growled.</p><p>\u201cIf madam would unbutton her necklet? I assure you, my professionalism is unparalleled.\u201d He smiled like a gynecologist.</p><p>I reached up and struggled with the buttons, and the man gently rolled down the neck of my gown.</p><p>\u201cJust a pinch, if you\u2019ll hold still, madam,\u201d he murmured, and I turned my head and closed my eyes.</p><p>Something cold and numbing swept over my skin, and then I did feel just a slight pinch. I heard Criminy\u2019s footsteps move away to the other side of the room, and he pretended to be interested in a painting on the wall. I tried to sit very still and forget that a stranger was draining my blood out through my neck. I did the same thing every day for my patients, albeit from the arm. Was it all that different, just because someone was going to drink it instead of testing it?</p><p>Mr. Ariel held a soft cloth to my skin, swiped something cold over it again, and applied something sticky. \u201cWe\u2019re done, madam,\u201d he said, and with my eyes still closed, I struggled to rebutton my dress.</p><p>Criminy appeared at my side, his nimble fingers gentle on the buttons as he patted my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering, sir,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhere we might find Antonin Scabrous.\u201d</p><p>The man was fiddling with his instruments, and Criminy chose one of the three vials of blood on the tray and subtly nudged it toward him next to a silver coin. Both items disappeared into the man\u2019s vest, and he didn\u2019t turn to us as he murmured, \u201cTailor, West Darkside. Look for the Inn of the Old Black Dog. Watch out as you cross High Street. They won\u2019t like the two of you. Coppers here are harder than elsewhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd the Magistrate?\u201d</p><p>The man grunted. Criminy shoved over another vial.</p><p>\u201cJonah Goodwill. Lives in the priory beside the church. He\u2019s well guarded and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany thanks,\u201d Criminy said.</p><p>I tried to get up from the chair, but the man stopped me with a patronizing hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to sit a moment, madam. And have a biscuit.\u201d</p><p>It was tough not to give him an earful about phlebotomy, but I kept my mouth shut and took one of the cookies from the tin in his hand. I sighed, and the man looked at Criminy with great curiosity.</p><p>\u201cYour lady doesn\u2019t know much for a Bludman\u2019s wife,\u201d he said.</p><p>Criminy whisked me to my feet and said, \u201cShe\u2019s of a gentle constitution, and we\u2019re only newly married.\u201d</p> <p>Taking the remaining vial of blood, Criminy guided me out the door and half-dragged me through the maze of streets again. I gripped his hand hard, forcing him to slow down.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I am, your personal walking blood factory?\u201d I whispered out the side of my mouth. \u201cYou could have at least warned me. Was that even sanitary?\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around me, and I felt his breath on my ear as he whispered, \u201cWe needed information and collateral, and we got them both. And of course it\u2019s sanitary. Didn\u2019t you feel the alcool? It numbs and cleans at once. We\u2019re not aboriginals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going now? Are we off to sell my hair next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, why would anyone want your hair? Not that it isn\u2019t lovely,\u201d he said. \u201cYou heard the man. We\u2019re going to the Bludmen\u2019s district to speak to an old associate of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to be surprised again,\u201d I said, feeling a bit prickly.</p> <p>\u201cYou will be, no matter what,\u201d he said. \u201cMight as well expect it.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring my reticence, he pulled me along at a clipped pace, my heels slipping in muck on the cobbles. From time to time, he hugged me to the wall as a horseless carriage went by, leaving only inches to spare between us and the jerky machine. Like the engine of the caravan\u2019s train, the odd carriages had machinery and tubes and wires bursting from the place where horses should have stood. The drivers, perched on rickety benches above and pulling levers, all wore aviator\u2019s hats and goggles and navigated the narrow roads with little regard for pedestrians.</p><p>No wonder the air was so smoggy\u2014the engines puffed green steam out one side and gray smoke out the other. The lack of horse manure was a bonus, but there was also a certain level of disdain inferred by the machines. If a horse stepped on you, it was personal. But if a horseless carriage clipped you, it was indifferent and cruel, and the driver just kept on driving as the snobby faces behind the window turned away.</p><p>We were trotting along a broad avenue when we passed two expensively dressed ladies wearing high platform boots and strange rose-colored glasses. Their pink-tinged eyes shot daggers at me, and the older one hissed, \u201cBludhoney.\u201d I felt Criminy tense and snarl, but I kept moving forward, pulling him with me before he tried to defend my honor.</p><p>At the next cross street larger than a drainage ditch, he took a right, murmuring, \u201cThat\u2019s enough of High Street.\u201d</p><p>We turned onto an alley specializing in foodstuffs. Butchers and bakers and wine shops stood open, while occasional carts offered lackluster fruits and vegetables. No wonder everyone looked either sickly or florid\u2014even the green things weren\u2019t green. The broccoli was gray, and the apples were the gold of old urine. The entire rainbow of plants ran from whitish yellow to yellowish brown.</p><p>But the bread smelled heavenly, I\u2019ll admit that. And the coffee. And something wafting from a store labeled Chocovanerie. I slowed down to sniff.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that, pet,\u201d Criminy said, dragging me along. \u201cWait until we get somewhere healthy. This stuff is all ersatz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s ersatz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFake,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cNo nutritive value. Made of ground-up meal and flavorings, sometimes even sawdust. It\u2019s all the poor can afford. Those vegetables are half-rotten.\u201d</p><p>And then I could smell it, the subtle sickness wafting from the baskets. I rubbed my nose along Criminy\u2019s shoulder, trying to drown the stench with berries.</p><p>At the next big cross street, he started to take a left and then looped back when he saw a Copper on a bludmare standing sentinel. \u201cResidential,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll just make \u2019em nervous.\u201d</p><p>So we went, past booksellers and weavers and pet shops crowded with droopy magpies and small, yappy dogs. We wove through poor streets and rich streets, past beggars and dukes and Coppers. I was getting a headache from hunger and thirst and overpowering smells, and my eyes were so full of new things that they were nearly crossed.</p><p>\u201cMr. Paisley,\u201d I murmured, \u201cdon\u2019t forget to feed your pet Pinky.\u201d</p><p>He stopped to look at me tenderly and murmured, \u201cSorry, love. I was so busy trying to keep you safe that I forgot how your kind wilts without food and drink.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed the air and made several turns until we were in a brighter, altogether richer part of town. When he stopped at a shiny green cart with delectable steam rising from a closed bin, I started drooling a little.</p><p>\u201cWrappy and a squeeze,\u201d he said, flipping the man a coin.</p><p>\u201cGonner try some real food, eh, Bluddy?\u201d the man said sourly, but he handed over a cup made of thick, waxed newspaper folded origami-style and brimming with golden liquid. With his other hand, he used tongs to select an oblong packet wrapped in the same greasy newspaper. He dropped it into Criminy\u2019s hand with a smirk, and we left quickly without thanking him. I could tell that Criminy was furious. That seemed to happen a lot in the city.</p><p>\u201cThat is for me, right?\u201d I said. Whatever it was, it smelled good. Like fast food.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you, but it\u2019s piping hot. Chappy bastard was hoping to burn one of us. I\u2019ll hand it to you as soon as it\u2019s cool enough to eat, I promise.\u201d</p><p>He put the cup into my hand, saying, \u201cDrink fast. These cups don\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>After a moment of examination, I turned the cup sideways and poured the golden stuff into the side of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cGrape juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why they call it a squeeze,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cBut city grapes don\u2019t grow purple or red\u2014only yellow.\u201d</p><p>I gulped the juice, and he threw my cup onto the ground and handed me the thing he\u2019d called a wrappy. It was a sort of burrito, filled with boiling-hot lava that tasted a lot like shepherd\u2019s pie. It was gristly and heavy on the potatoes and beans, but it had a perfectly satisfying oil-to-salt ratio. I thanked him and licked the sauce off my gloves as we walked.</p><p>At last, he turned down a dark alley under a riveted sign reading Darkside. I could have sworn the temperature was ten degrees lower on the other side of that sign. The road was poorly kept, with missing cobbles and graffiti in white chalk.</p><p>Drain U, one said.</p><p>Bluddy go home to the ground, said another.</p><p>It was a residential area, but the windows were blacked out or covered with neatly nailed boards. The doors were all painted blood red. There were no window boxes or decorations. No one would live this way on purpose, not unless they were forced. The dismal streets and Criminy\u2019s tense silence spoke volumes about the oppression of his species by mine.</p><p>The next cross street was more open, with wooden signs hanging just like those on High Street\u2014but darker. I saw a jeweler, a pawn shop, an apothecary. Then, up ahead, a sign featuring a black dog on its back, feet in the air, with an X for an eye. That had to be the Inn of the Old Black Dog. Next door, a spool with a needle\u2014Criminy\u2019s friend, the tailor.</p><p>We ducked through the burgundy door into a bright room painted with harlequin diamonds in light blue and violet. It was just like Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s wagon but neater, with mannequins and mirrors abounding and bolts of cloth stacked neatly on shelves. Directly facing us, head down over a tabletop sewing machine of brass and black iron, was the first Bludman I\u2019d seen in the city.</p><p>He looked up at us with a mouthful of pins and grinned like a voodoo doll. His skin was light brown, which contrasted oddly with golden hair and ice-blue, piercing eyes. But his face was jolly, and he seemed glad to see us. That was really starting to mean something.</p><p>Stashing the pins in a jar, he stood to stretch his back with a series of pops. He locked the front door, then faced Criminy with open arms, saying, \u201cCrim! How long\u2019s it been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long, Antonin. Too long. How goes it?\u201d</p><p>They hugged and beat each other on the back. Apparently, that male gesture crosses world and species lines as the only acceptable way to show masculine friendship.</p><p>\u201cManchester\u2019s not what it used to be,\u201d Antonin said, running a hand through his curly gold hair and making it stand on end. \u201cThe Coppers get rougher every year. Did you ever think you\u2019d see the day when I\u2019d be stuck sewing in Darkside? But the Magistrate\u2019s put up new restrictions, and here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed,\u201d Criminy said, taking in the room. \u201cNice spot, though. I guess the fine ladies and masters of High Street secretly send their footmen to you with measurements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do.\u201d Antonin chuckled. \u201cNo Pinky can make a finer seam than I. Business is good, if society ain\u2019t. And who\u2019s this lovely creature?\u201d</p><p>When his eyes turned on me, I could sense a latent but polite hunger underneath. Criminy\u2019s arm snagged my waist, and he drew me close, saying, \u201cMy wife, actually. Letitia, this is Antonin Scabrous, formerly of Scarborough and the best tailor in Sang. We started out in the same caravan as lads and bunked together for our apprentice years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. The tale of two tailors\u2019 sons who ran off to join the circus. You got the exciting end of the bargain, and I still ended up with a needle in my mouth,\u201d Antonin said with a laugh. \u201cHow\u2019s the caravan, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, in general,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cThat is, until some rowdy bastard stole my lady\u2019s wedding present, a fine ruby locket. We think he\u2019s in the city.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cAnd we think you might know of him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Antonin winked. \u201cWon\u2019t you come back to the sitting room, have a drop to drink? I might have a biscuit for your lady somewhere, too.\u201d</p><p>We followed him through a curtain of jingling beads and down a narrow hallway cheerfully decorated with hundreds of painted thread spools mounted on nails. We sidled through the tall door at the end of the hall, and I had to blink. It was a narrow sitting room so bright and yellow that it was like sitting in a lemon. The velvet chaise was yellow, the chairs were white with yellow spots, and the walls were yellow and white damask. It was so bright that my teeth hurt.</p><p>Criminy swung Pemberly off his shoulder and muttered, \u201cPem, guard the hall.\u201d She scampered to the center of the hallway and stood on her hind legs, and her head began slowly spinning, her eyes casting red lights on the walls, dancing over the rainbow of spools. She had become a copper disco ball. I had completely forgotten the sleeping snake on my own arm.</p> <p>\u201cNice monkey,\u201d Antonin said. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. Owlice is always watching in the rafters of the front room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can never be too careful,\u201d Criminy murmured. \u201cNot these days.\u201d</p><p>Antonin pressed a button on a small, white-enameled cube that looked like a safe. The door popped open, and a breath of warm air wafted out. Inside sat rows of blood vials in cartons, much like the containers that held eggs in my world. He picked up a vial, checked the date scrawled on the glass, and split the contents between two demitasse cups. He handed one to Criminy, who took a dainty sip and sighed.</p><p>\u201cRefreshing,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The two men sipped their blood, ignoring me. They started talking about eighteen-something-or-other and people with odd names who did odder things. I yawned. I read the spines of books on the yellow bookshelf and gazed at the paintings in yellow frames. Here I was, trapped in a fantasy world, worrying about my grandmother and my real world, tapping my toes as vicious blood drinkers enjoyed teatime.</p> <p>\u201cCriminy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a meal with a friend while you squirm like a child,\u201d he said serenely.</p><p>I glared.</p><p>Antonin laughed and said something in a slurry foreign tongue full of s\u2019s and z\u2019s.</p> <p>Criminy laughed, too. In the yellow room, their red-stained teeth gave me the creeps.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re laughing at me?\u201d I said. \u201cYou bleed me and then laugh at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love,\u201d Criminy said, trying not to snicker. \u201cIt\u2019s just an old saying. Humans are like kittens, their teeth tickle when angry. You do look so very much like an angry kitten.\u201d</p><p>It was a horrible position to be in. I couldn\u2019t storm out; I had nowhere else to go. In Sang, it was too dangerous to risk even a moment out of their sight. But alone with two predators, I felt less like a kitten and more like an object lesson waiting to happen.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t felt that way with Criminy before. Inferior, and silly. I hated it, having someone outside our little circle laughing at me. I fought tears. Fighting tears made me think about my other world, my fallen body, and my suffering grandmother. Would I ever see her again? And then I was snuffling into my sleeve.</p><p>Antonin looked embarrassed and studied the wall. Criminy set down his cup and moved close to put his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, now,\u201d he murmured. \u201cEven angry kittens have their claws. We don\u2019t mean to be unkind. Old friends sharing a joke, that\u2019s all. We\u2019ll get your locket back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a joke.\u201d I sniffled. \u201cI miss my home. My grandmother.\u201d</p> <p>Antonin cleared his throat and was about to say something when a bell rang, followed by the unmistakable call of an owl. Antonin\u2019s eyes went round, and he whispered, \u201cCoppers,\u201d and kicked back the yellow rag rug at our feet, revealing a trapdoor. Criminy grabbed the iron ring and pulled it open as Antonin rattled teacups and slammed cupboards, calling, \u201cI\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d</p><p>I held up my dress as I stumbled down the stone steps into an unlit cellar that smelled of earth and age. Criminy was at my heels. He closed the trapdoor, dousing us in darkness. I heard the shuffling sound of the rug overhead and sighed, pressing back against Criminy.</p><p>That\u2019s when I felt something heavy and warm on my boot.</p><p>17</p><p>Whatever it was, I jumped up and down until it fell off. I wanted to punt it, but I had no idea what sort of rakes or glass jars or pipe organs were around us, waiting to make the noise that would betray our hiding place to the Coppers above.</p><p>I put my mouth to where I hoped Criminy\u2019s ear might be and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s something in here with us. It was on my foot. Kill it!\u201d</p><p>His lips moved against my cheek, his breath warm against my skin as he said, \u201cYou just kicked a very nice house cat, darling. And a forgiving one. Can\u2019t you hear her purring?\u201d</p><p>When I slowed my own breathing and stopped listening to my heart thump, I heard it. A soft, low rumble from the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhy does Antonin have an underground cat?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cTo keep her safe, I\u2019d guess,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing the bludrats would love so much as a nice, juicy cat. Probably lets her up at night, when the front door is bolted.\u201d</p><p>I felt him fold gracefully to the ground at my feet, and the purring intensified. The blood-drinker was petting a cat. And humming.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cA cellar,\u201d he said. \u201cSurely you know what a cellar is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know what a cellar is,\u201d I hissed. \u201cWhat else is down here?\u201d</p><p>He stood and whispered a word, and a tiny blue flame sparked in the darkness. The first thing I saw was his face. The next thing I saw was a skull hovering slightly behind him. As I opened my mouth to scream, his gloved hand sealed my lips.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMmph-mm-hm-mph!\u201d</p><p>His eyes flicked back. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a skeleton. It\u2019s chained to the wall. It was probably a very bad man. Antonin is part of an underground resistance movement against the Coppers. Did you know that they sometimes steal our children off the street and drain them before crowds as abominations? They do. And this fellow has been dead for quite some time, and he deserved it, so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much.\u201d</p><p>I tried to take my mind off the skeleton by looking around the rest of the cellar. It was about ten feet square, with walls of mortared stone like a crypt. Cobwebs and dust were everywhere. If I hadn\u2019t known better by then, I would have looked for a coffin.</p><p>On the ground by the skeleton, I saw some instruments that made me look away. Clippy things and poky things and something that looked like a golf-cart battery.</p><p>And then the door opened above us, and light flooded in. Antonin\u2019s face appeared.</p><p>\u201cCome on up. They\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>I nearly leaped out of the cellar. Criminy followed at a more stately pace.</p><p>\u201cI take it you met Anabella and Mr. Rapture,\u201d said Antonin.</p><p>\u201cA little warning would have been nice,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d prefer the dead Copper to the live ones upstairs,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for you. Now, why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d Criminy said, sinking into a chair.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a price on her head,\u201d Antonin said. \u201cA female Stranger of bad intentions in a burgundy dress of last year\u2019s fashion accompanied by a Bludman in a black cloak and tall hat with a copper monkey. Last seen at the Fleet Street letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean the recently deceased Fleet Street letter?\u201d Criminy asked.</p><p>\u201cI do believe that something unfortunate is in the cards for Mr. Ariel, actually,\u201d Antonin said with a wicked smile. His innate potential for violence flashed out for just a moment, like a shark\u2019s fin breaking water, but then he was just a tailor again, ruffling his curly hair in a lemon-yellow room.</p><p>Pemberly appeared, and Criminy swung her back onto his shoulder. \u201cWe should be going before we get you into any further trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed information?\u201d Antonin pressed.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. So much for small talk over a companionable vial. What can you tell us about the Magistrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonah Goodwill. Old bastard with a big mustache and a bigger hatred of anything inhuman. Lives in the priory beside the cathedral at the top of the mountain, has his own little paradise full of gardens and fruit trees. Eden House. All of the things his grateful citizens can never have. We\u2019ve tried to gain access for years, but no one can get close. They all disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s who we\u2019re after,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Stranger himself. And he apparently knows we\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met him at the caravan, but I still don\u2019t understand how he knew I was a Stranger, too,\u201d I said glumly.</p><p>Antonin\u2019s hand shot toward me, but Criminy intercepted it. Antonin shook him off with a snort and gently stroked my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cDo you think anyone in this godforsaken world would purposefully punch holes in their skin?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I reached to my earlobe, feeling the hole that had been there since my eighth birthday.</p><p>Luckily, when you\u2019re in need of a disguise, the tailor\u2019s shop is one of the best places to be. Gone was my beautiful burgundy dress. Now I was in navy-blue taffeta, the shiny ruffles rustling whenever I moved. My black bonnet was gone, too, replaced by a wide straw hat with a spray of feathers. The hat had come from a very nervous old lady, so my betraying ears were snugly covered by a black lace panel that made my neck itch horribly.</p><p>Criminy was resplendent in emerald green, his favorite top hat somehow hidden up the sleeve of his new tailcoat. Instead, he wore a wool bowler, which made him look more dangerous and disreputable than usual. His favorite coat, the one with the hidden magic pockets, was hanging in the cellar by the skeleton. Most of the gadgets and doodads had been stuffed into his waistcoat, and I couldn\u2019t understand why it didn\u2019t bulge more. Pemberly had been sent back to the caravan with carefully coded messages for Mrs. Cleavers, and Criminy\u2019s shoulder looked a little empty without her. We were ready. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you give her some blud?\u201d Antonin asked, leaning close to look into my face. \u201cJust to color her eyes, give her some stamina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u2019s not the time,\u201d Criminy said gruffly. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not ready yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Bludman\u2019s wife, ain\u2019t she? Or is she scared?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not drinking any blud,\u201d I said. \u201cBut the fact that I\u2019m here should tell you enough about how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re after Goodwill is good enough for me,\u201d Antonin answered. \u201cIf you\u2019re against him, you\u2019re on my side.\u201d</p><p>We left with more male back pounding, a chaste kiss on my glove, and a hand-drawn map showing a shadowy route to Goodwill\u2019s home in the old monastery. Now that the Coppers were looking for us, we needed to move fast.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be looking for us to come after him,\u201d Criminy reasoned. \u201cPowerful man like that. Won\u2019t expect us to bring the fight to his door. Probably too busy looking for us to watch his own back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if he isn\u2019t?\u201d I pressed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat choice do we have, love?\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou want the locket. I\u2019m trying to get the locket. We\u2019ll follow this plan until things change, then we\u2019ll follow a new plan. If you need more of an answer than that, I can\u2019t give it to you. You\u2019re the one who sees the future, not me.\u201d</p><p>We followed the alleys of Darkside as far as we could up the mountain. When we reentered the brighter streets of the Pinkies, we clung to the shadows and tried not to draw attention to ourselves. At one point, a Copper turned to stare at us, and Criminy spun around, putting his back against the slimy brick wall of the alley and using my huge hat to shield us both in a wild pantomime of passion that managed to leave me a little breathless. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2014lips were still lips, and hips were still hips, even if we were pretending. Behind me, I heard the Copper spit in disgust. By the time he turned again, we were gone.</p><p>Near the cathedral, the neighborhoods grew grimier and duller, and the people seemed more downtrodden and pitiful. Their clothes were ragged and patched, their faces hollow and hopeless.</p><p>We huddled in the shadow of the church\u2019s high roof. Above our niche was a broken stained-glass window of a figure on a cross bleeding into a cup. Oddly, it wasn\u2019t Jesus. It was a woman with red hair. And she looked pissed.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends on whom you ask. To me, that\u2019s the goddess Aztarte, the first Bludwoman,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cTo the Pinkies who now run Sangland, it\u2019s Saint Ermenegilda. She died to drive the bloodthirsty demons from the land, to make it safe for the second kingdom of mankind.\u201d He examined his map for a moment and muttered, \u201cShe was a witch and a virago, but the church tries to play that bit down and just remind everyone of her sacrifice. For humanity.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled out Antonin\u2019s map. \u201cGoodwill\u2019s place is on the other side of the monastery, behind high walls. The inside of the cathedral is guarded, and the walls are patrolled by Coppers with dogs that can sniff through my illusions. I have no idea how we\u2019re going to get in without him knowing about it yesterday.\u201d</p><p>We heard voices coming around the corner, and I froze. Criminy pulled me to his side.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d he said, and he tossed some powder from one of his pockets over us both. I suddenly felt very dusty and dry, similar to the feeling of a mud mask right before it begins to flake off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Criminy said out of the corner of his mouth. And it would have been very hard to move, even if I had wanted to. My face and body were completely stuck, and the lone corner of my gloved hand that I could still see was the aged gray of old stone. He\u2019d turned us into a statue.</p><p>Moving only my eyeballs, I watched a pack of small, filthy children scamper around the corner, giggling. Their exposed necks told me they were Bludmen\u2014or Bludchildren. They all huddled around a brown object except for one who squatted by the corner, pretending to defecate.</p><p>\u201cDid he see you, Les?\u201d said one. I couldn\u2019t tell by look or voice what gender or age the child might be. They all looked the same, really\u2014huge eyes in gaunt faces wrapped in grime-covered rags.</p><p>\u201cNaw, the skinny one was too busy calling Bertie a stinkin\u2019 bat-faced bludbag to notice me lifting the fat one\u2019s wallet. Stupid Coppers.\u201d The child emptied the bag and divvied up the coins within, then wedged the wallet under my stone skirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think them Coppers taste like?\u201d asked a third urchin wistfully.</p> <p>\u201cI bet they taste like shite,\u201d said the tiniest one of all.</p><p>\u201cCheese it\u2014here comes Rudy!\u201d the lookout hissed. They all ran away, melting into the shadows.</p><p>Even frozen beside me, trapped by his own magic, I could feel Criminy\u2019s fury. The plight of the starving, filthy Bludchildren had touched a nerve. If he could have shot lightning out of his eyes, the people coming around the corner would have been cinders.</p><p>Two young Coppers appeared, their shiny uniforms creaking as they walked behind a giant dog on a chain lead. The dog was copper-colored, too, like a cross between a German shepherd and a mastiff, its boxy head as high as my waist. It was slavering and whining, drool dripping down its chops. The Coppers ignored it.</p><p>\u201cSomeone oughtta drain those brats,\u201d said the skinny one. \u201cCor, I hate church duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d said the short, fat Copper holding the dog\u2019s lead. \u201cDownright spooky, even in the daytime. Nobody believes in ol\u2019 Ermenegilda anymore, anyway, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know,\u201d said the skinny one. \u201cMy mum always told me she was just a nice story about helping other humans. About making a sackerfice. Back when people cared.\u201d</p><p>The dog sniffed Criminy and me energetically. I held my breath. The fat one yanked the dog back, hissing, \u201cIt\u2019s only a statue, Rudy. Some other dog prolly pissed on it. Cut it out.\u201d Then he looked up at the naked saint in the window and grinned, showing teeth like crooked tombstones. \u201cI\u2019d let that ripe little plum make me a nice sacrifice, eh, Gerren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s blasphemy, that is,\u201d said Gerren. \u201cBut yeah.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down from Saint Ermenegilda, looked me straight in the eye, and began to untie the leather laces on his pants, if my hearing was correct. Then I heard his stream, and he sighed as he urinated on us.</p><p>Talk about blasphemy.</p><p>At least I didn\u2019t feel any wetness. Thank heavens for magic.</p><p>\u201cDunno why we didn\u2019t get to go to the island with everyone else,\u201d the fat one whined. \u201cNothing here to guard, anyway. What, are the poor folk and the Bludmen gonna overrun us for a barrel of apples and one old, runty cow that don\u2019t even give milk no more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new, so you don\u2019t know yet. Got to keep up the image,\u201d said Gerren, puffing out his bird chest as he redid his fly. \u201cMake it seem like there\u2019s something worth guarding, even if there ain\u2019t. It\u2019s funny, all the secrets you learn once you\u2019re a Copper.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and stretched, the leather of his new uniform squeaking. The dog danced around us, straining toward me and Criminy. Gerren smacked it on the nose, and it sat, dejected.</p><p>\u201cDo you think what they say about Goodwill is true?\u201d the fat one asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat, that he\u2019s really a Stranger?\u201d Gerren said mockingly. \u201cThe secret society and the underground lair and all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, that is,\u201d Gerren said as they ambled off, dragging the huge dog behind them. \u201cHe\u2019s just an old hypocrite gone to see a doxy on his magic island or handle the trouble at Brighton. Manchester\u2019s so dull and horrid that everybody thinks everybody else is up to no good and that there\u2019s some better place. There ain\u2019t. All the cities is like this, Joff, me boy, and they ain\u2019t never gonna change. Not with them Bludmen about. You\u2019ve got a lot to learn, lad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBluddy Bludmen,\u201d agreed the fat one as they turned the corner and moved out of sight.</p><p>I was magically petrified, but I was so tense with shock that it would have been hard to move, anyway. Jonah Goodwill wasn\u2019t here\u2014he was on an island somewhere far away. We had no idea where the locket had gone, and the low sky was swelling with the purple streaks of evening. I felt a tear trickle inside the weird crust over my skin, and then I fell to my knees, the spell broken.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, love?\u201d Criminy asked, squatting beside me and searching my face.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t all right, not by a long shot. I put a hand to my cheek, but it was clean and normal. I had expected to feel the slurry mud of dust and tears or some residue from the magic. But there was nothing.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d I said, my voice cracking. \u201cI want my locket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll find it, no matter the cost. Both for you and for those children, to stop whatever Goodwill\u2019s planned. But for now, we\u2019ve got to get off the street. We\u2019ll talk to Antonin again in the morning,\u201d he said. He dusted off his waistcoat and grinned at me. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky those bastards stopped to take a piss on a holy relic. At least now we know where to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to gossip, there\u2019s a secret island where innocent animals still roam, a paradise free of the creatures of blud. If they say he\u2019s on an island, that\u2019s got to be the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how are we going to find it? One island, in all the world, with nothing to go on but rumors? It\u2019s hopeless.\u201d I threw my arms around his neck and buried my head in his shoulder.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me. \u201cSweet little kitten,\u201d he said as I rubbed my tears away against his jacket. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that rumors are almost always true? And I have other ways of knowing.\u201d</p><p>I sniffled, gazing at the mazelike town unfolding below us. All the way down at the base of the high wall, a flock of ash-gray, sickly sheep was huddled, as tiny as ants. They should have been grazing, but the ground was just a foul mass of mud. Their bleating sounded like crying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything is so wrong,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d Criminy said, stroking my hair. \u201cBut it appears that Mr. Goodwill isn\u2019t all that he seems. I can\u2019t wait to ask him myself.\u201d</p><p>Thanks to the prejudice of the city, we were confined to Darkside for the night. No Pinky inn would dream of opening its doors to a Bludman. We stopped at the Inn of the Magi on the opposite side of the mountain from Antonin\u2019s shop. Entering the bloodred door under the wooden sign showing three men in turbans, I felt Criminy relax a little. The front room was very elegant, and a dainty teenage Bludwoman stood behind the counter, wearing a very tall hat.</p> <p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d she said with the same bouncy cockney accent I\u2019d heard all over town. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like a room, please, miss. My wife and I,\u201d Criminy said with a low bow. \u201cDaggern and Fevrier Blur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a two-bedder available on the second floor, sir, or the penthouse,\u201d she said, bobbing a curtsy. \u201cFive coppers for the two-bedder, ten for the penthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take the two-bedder, thank you,\u201d he said, producing several coins from his waistcoat and sliding them across the counter. He smiled kindly and leaned forward to pluck another coin from her ear. \u201cAnd look at this! Miss, you must wash more carefully.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, and I could see that she was younger than she looked despite her low-cut gown. As we bowed and left with our key, she scribbled in a giant black ledger, her tongue sticking out in concentration.</p> <p>The room was small but bright and neat. Dainty plates in colorful patterns hung from ribbons and clashed cheerfully with the wallpaper, which was white with green vines. Criminy shrugged off his new coat and put out his hand to me. I didn\u2019t know what he wanted, but I held my hand out anyway, with a little flutter in my stomach. He surprised me by reaching for the snake around my wrist.</p><p>\u201cTime to see what your little Uro can do,\u201d he said.</p><p>He pushed the button, and Uro came alive, flattening out on the table. His head swiveled until it found me, and then the lights blinked, and the black tongue shot out once in what seemed like satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cTell him to guard,\u201d Criminy said.</p><p>\u201cUro, guard,\u201d I said.</p><p>The red eyes flashed once, and the snake\u2019s head rose as his body went rigid and his tail split into three separate sections. He was now a sort of tripod, and his head slowly spun around, taking in everything. What a handy device.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re safe here,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cNew clothes, different names. And I\u2019ll wager that little lass at the front counter wouldn\u2019t give us away for all the world. Let\u2019s sleep, and we\u2019ll start over in the morning. I get the bed closer to the door.\u201d</p><p>I disappeared into the bathroom to change. Fortunately, the new dress unlaced in such a way that I could get out on my own, and I now had enough experience with a corset to handle that myself, too. I splashed water on my face and used a towel to scrub off the makeup, then shyly emerged in my white nightdress.</p><p>To my profound surprise, Criminy was already in bed, breathing deeply under the covers. I had forgotten that he had spent the previous nights watching over my body as I slept\u2014he had to be exhausted.</p><p>His back was to me, and I was undeniably drawn to him. It was rare to see him when he was still, when he wasn\u2019t already observing me or taking firm control of the situation at hand. His bare shoulder peeked from under the blanket, smooth and white, his dark hair falling to either side. There was a small scar there, pink like a burn, and I unconsciously reached out to trace it with a finger, wondering what sort of creature or weapon could actually wound him.</p><p>Just as I touched his skin, surprised as ever to find him so warm, his hand closed around my wrist. I gasped as he rolled to his back, pulling me down on top of him on the narrow bed.</p><p>His eyes burned into mine, dark and dancing.</p><p>\u201cSurely this is a dream. My fair Letitia, coming to me in the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were asleep,\u201d I said. I tried to draw away, but his bare hands settled on my hips. Even through the blankets and my nightgown, I could feel the hard planes of his body and the hint of claws prickling my skin.</p> <p>\u201cAsleep? With you that close and watchful? A predator like me? Never,\u201d he said, voice husky.</p><p>\u201cYou must be tired. I\u2019m sorry I bothered you.\u201d</p><p>I was flustered, and I tried to press up with my arms. That just settled my hips more firmly against his. A slow smile spread over his face.</p><p>\u201cKeep trying to escape, love. It\u2019s heavenly. No bother at all.\u201d</p><p>He shifted sinuously beneath me as if asking a question I wasn\u2019t ready to answer. I let myself collapse forward, tucking my flushed face into his neck before he could see my embarrassment. I couldn\u2019t ignore his body and my response to it, but I could avoid his eyes. I sighed into his hair, awash in his scent. With an answering sigh, he shifted me to the bed so that I was nestled against his side, his arm around me. We barely fit on the mattress, but it didn\u2019t occur to me to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still skittish, little love. Now, why is that?\u201d he whispered in my ear. Goose bumps rippled down my back, and he groaned as I shifted against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d I whispered back into the darkness of his hair.</p><p>He firmly lifted my face, his eyes catching mine.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips settled over mine, cutting off the list of everything I feared. The city, the Magistrate, the bludrats, the Coppers, people like Elvis, my world, my grandmother, my own sanity, my freedom. It all fell away as his hand gently cupped my face, his thumb stroking my cheek like a whisper. There was nothing in all the world but him and me and the point where we met, mouth to mouth and heart to heart. The kiss was soft and warm, restrained and gentle. An answer and a mercy. A comfort. I relaxed against him, my fingers tangling in his hair.</p><p>He pulled away first and looked into my eyes. The fire in his gaze had fled, leaving an endless, cloudy blue.</p><p>\u201cSo long as you\u2019re not afraid of me, I think we\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNow, go get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>I took my cue and crawled into my own bed, which was crisp and cool and smelled deliciously of sage. Oddly, the kiss had calmed me. I knew he could have kept me there, whether by force or just with the simple magnetic tug that pulled me to him again and again. But he hadn\u2019t. Instead, he had given me exactly what I needed. Not fire. Not flames. Just warmth.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I murmured, just loudly enough for him to hear it a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>In moments, I was asleep.</p><p>I awoke the next morning feeling a little dreamy. Part of me had still expected to wake up in my own world. Part of me had also expected a certain darkly handsome magician to slip into bed beside me and reignite the passion held tightly controlled in the kiss. I couldn\u2019t decide if I was grateful or disappointed that he had kept his distance. The kiss had felt like a promise of things to come, and now that I was awake and rested, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted them. I sat up and looked around as the weak sun filtered in through the curtains.</p><p>Criminy sat on his bed, legs crossed, fully clothed but bootless. He was wearing mismatched argyle stockings. In front of him was an old-fashioned map. I leaned over to examine the painted images so similar to Europe, part of Asia, and the upper bit of Africa. But the borders were all wrong, and the names were peculiar, and I had a feeling that the little creatures by \u2018Here there be dragons\u2019 were an actual threat.</p><p>I sat down on the edge of the bed, unobtrusive but close enough to see the map. There were also some strange little gewgaws strewn across the paper\u2014jewels and bones and rocks. Criminy swept these into a velvet bag, which he stowed in his waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cSo here we are,\u201d he said, pointing to what would have been Britain.</p><p>Manchester was in the center, right where Manchester would be on my own maps. But lots of the other place names were off. France was Franchia, right next to Vane. There was Bruzzles\u2014in Belgum. London was still London, though, I noted with a smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s where I think Goodwill\u2019s island is, according to the bones,\u201d he said, pointing to a collection of smudges in the sea just south of Brighton. \u201cSomewhere near the Isle of White. Shouldn\u2019t be hard to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHis will be the one with the wall around it,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cThe man\u2019s awfully fond of walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do we get there?\u201d I asked. \u201cI can\u2019t walk that far. Not in these boots, not with bludbunnies chasing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get the caravan involved, so that\u2019s out. We don\u2019t have money enough for a conveyance, and they\u2019ll be looking for us to do that, anyway. And we can\u2019t trust the banks, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with banks?\u201d I asked, completely confused.</p><p>\u201cThey move too slowly, and we\u2019d be easy to catch,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cWhere I come from, banks are buildings that store money for you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWho on earth would trust someone else to store their money?\u201d Criminy said, horrified at the idea. \u201cBanks are those giant transports you saw on opening night. Bus tanks, you see. But we can\u2019t take that route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t walk,\u201d I said again. \u201cIt would take days. We have to move faster. Can we steal something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready turning to a life of crime, pet?\u201d he said with an affectionate stroke of my hair. \u201cBut no. That would be far too easy to track. We need something fast and free that nobody else wants. And there\u2019s only one answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds ominous,\u201d I said.</p><p>He grinned, showing me his pointy teeth. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>Once I heard the details of his plan, I liked it even less. I maintained an irritable silence as we departed the inn, leaving the counter girl with another coin pulled from her ear. Criminy had a spring in his step, sure that we were on the right track. But I was determined to think of an alternative that didn\u2019t scare the crap out of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heads down, we sped toward the gates on the opposite side of the city from those we had entered through the day before. On the way, he bought me a wrappy brimming with buttery eggs and white cheese and lavender mushrooms. We stopped at a strange store called Apollinaire\u2019s Everything Shoppe, which did indeed seem to have everything. It was like a five-and-dime crossed with my grandmother\u2019s attic and a magic store. I marveled at the peculiar array of goods that Criminy stuffed into his pack. His leather satchel banged against his back on the way out with a metallic clang.</p><p>As we neared the gate, Criminy yanked me into a dark alley and blew powder into my face, muttering a spell. I didn\u2019t feel a thing, so I shrugged. He stood back and laughed, saying, \u201cThis one won\u2019t hold up long, thank heavens. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201d</p><p>The guards at the back gate were just as unfriendly as the ones at the front gate. As the guard looked at me, then down at my even newer set of fake papers, he sneered in disgust and, oddly, pity. But he waved us through, and the giant gate squealed open just enough for us to pass through.</p> <p>Once we were out of earshot, I reached to my face and asked, \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d</p><p>Criminy pulled a small brass mirror from his waistcoat, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just a glamour, not something you can feel with your hands. I was trying to make you as different as possible from what you really are. It\u2019s already fading.\u201d</p><p>In the mirror, I saw the most hideous woman I\u2019d ever seen. Warts, chin whiskers, a vein-covered nose shaped like a squash.</p><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s like being thirteen all over again,\u201d I said. I had to laugh, too. It was awful, but it was a lot better than getting caught.</p><p>Criminy took out his spyglass and scanned the moors. With an annoyed hmph, he pulled out a different compass, one I hadn\u2019t seen before. Instead of having four arrows, this one had tiny pictures all around the outside of the circle. Criminy turned the dial and fiddled with the mechanism, then sighted along the arrow and started walking. I followed, nervous.</p> <p>We walked through the empty moors for some time before he put a hand out to stop me, right on the edge of an abandoned orchard. We were in the middle of nowhere and hadn\u2019t seen a living thing other than bludbunnies since the city gate shut behind us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just over that hill. Now, unlace your gloves and neck, and stand right here, very still. You\u2019re going to have to trust me.\u201d He kissed my forehead and disappeared up a tree.</p><p>I was alone. With a shaky breath, I began shyly unlacing things, releasing the scent of my flesh on purpose for the first time in this dangerous world. I stood there feeling the breeze on my skin but unable to enjoy it, imagining myself as Andromeda, chained to the rock and ignoring the sea. At least we were hunting something a good bit smaller than a kraken.</p><p>The bludbunnies were the first to arrive, hopping innocently out of the cool morning and lolloping to my feet, where Criminy dispatched them one by one with a slingshot. I could barely see him through the leaves, perched on a branch with his neatly folded coat beside him.</p><p>Soon the ground around my boots was littered with cute, fluffy corpses in white and soft brown and dappled gray. They reminded me of the fur jacket I\u2019d received for Christmas when I was eight, except that my coat hadn\u2019t wanted to eat me.</p><p>Next came a fox, which was more than happy to snatch up some bludbunnies and run, not picky at all. Then a doe emerged from the bushes, its steps tentative. Criminy pinged it in the bum with a stone, and it hissed and bounded away.</p> <p>At last, we heard our quarry thundering over the hill, and my heart beat quick in my throat.</p><p>It was so hard not to run away. As if that would have helped.</p><p>She was a big one, and she was coming right at me.</p><p>In my world, she would have been a Percheron, probably. But in this world, she was a bludmare and built to kill. Feet the size of dinner plates, long and flowing mane and tail, foamy mouth full of pointy teeth. Her huge red eyes were fixed on me. And she was drooling.</p><p>She stopped to scent the air. Her glossy black sides quivered as she inhaled deeply. With a roar of triumph, the bludmare reared and galloped straight at me. I tensed. She weighed as much as a VW van, and she was going for the kill.</p><p>The ground quaked beneath my boots as she pounded toward me. I steeled myself to hold still. It went against every instinct, just waiting for death to strike. But it\u2019s not as if I could have outrun her, anyway. I had to trust Criminy.</p><p>When the bludmare was so close that I could see the insides of her pink, huffing nostrils, something flew at her feet. She screamed and went down, thrashing on the ground with three of her legs caught in a bolus. The rope had wrapped several times around her thick ankles, and she wasn\u2019t happy about it.</p><p>I was frozen in place, in shock but fascinated. Criminy appeared in a blur of emerald green and a flash of silver. In his hands was the bridle cap he had bought from Apollinaire\u2019s Everything Shoppe. He fit it over the bludmare\u2019s nose and mouth, and her screams stopped, replaced by a furious whuffling. He ran the leather trappings behind her ears and buckled them under her jaw. She was effectively muzzled.</p> <p>He stood up to grin at the bludmare. Her eyes bulged with rage and reproach. I could almost hear her thinking, We\u2019re creatures of blud, you and I. How can you abuse me so? and I had a moment of pity.</p><p>But then I remembered the teeth and said, \u201cMaybe you should tighten that a notch?\u201d</p><p>He did tighten it, and the bludmare sighed against the metal. He cut the bolus from her legs and stood back, holding the leather reins tightly as she heaved her great bulk off the ground and shook. He stepped closer, petting her thick, elegant neck.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beauty,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat should we call her?\u201d</p><p>I was scared, but I stepped forward nonetheless. As her eyes rolled down to stare at me, the prey turned captor, I tentatively put a still-ungloved hand out to stroke her neck. Her skin quivered against my touch, as if she was shaking off a fly.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Erris,\u201d I said gently.</p><p>Criminy looked at me, thoughtful. \u201cDidn\u2019t know it worked for animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d I said.</p><p>Such close scrutiny was making her nervous, and the giant black bludmare jigged in place, shaking her head and snorting. Just as I had seen on the Coppers\u2019 mares, froth started to drip from the metal cap.</p><p>\u201cHave you ridden before?\u201d Criminy asked me.</p><p>\u201cA little, at summer camp,\u201d I said, looking into her intelligent red eye and finding myself uncomfortable with her own measurement of me. \u201cI like horseback riding. In theory. She\u2019s just so big. And wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe journey that would take us two days on foot will take half a day on her back,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut I imagine it\u2019s going to be a bit hard on your fundament. Especially without a saddle. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I remember my days on horseback,\u201d I said with a wicked smile, \u201cit\u2019s going to be even harder on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d Criminy said, patting her broad back. \u201cShe\u2019s a wide lass. Well fed. And I like a nice, fat bum. I just need to break her to saddle first.\u201d</p><p>As I put on my gloves and relaced my dress, I watched the quick, handsome man work the horse. The mare tried to back away from him, pawing and snorting. He released the leather rein a little bit, giving her room. Rushing at her flank, he spun the leather strap, whipping her hip. She jumped away, trying to keep her hindquarters away from him. But he kept pushing into her, making her move. And she kept moving. I watched, transfixed by the give and take of man and beast, by his elegant balance of aggression and patience. He caught me staring and winked. I had to look down to hide my blush.</p><p>After a few minutes, she lowered her head and blinked, sides heaving. I could hear her licking her lips inside the cap. Criminy smiled and reached out to stroke her neck.</p><p>\u201cI would never want her dead broke, a wild spirit like that,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJust obliging. She and I have a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself, thinking about my own dead-broke years with Jeff. He probably would have put a shock collar on me if it had been legal. Even scared, it felt good to be free now.</p><p>The horse followed him willingly to a fallen tree and stood as he helped me swing my heavy, rustling skirt over her back. She crow-hopped, and I grabbed her mane in my gloved hands. I managed to stay on, and Criminy swung up behind me gracefully. It was a shock to feel his body mold around mine, his thighs tense against me and his arms wrapped around me. I would not have guessed that riding a monster horse could feel so intimate and electrifying. Taking the reins in both hands, he murmured, \u201cHold on, sweetheart,\u201d and kicked her in the ribs.</p><p>Erris settled back on her haunches before leaping into the air. I squeezed with my knees and clung to the mane for dear life, and she hit the ground running. Since she was pointed in the right direction, this wasn\u2019t such a bad thing, and Criminy just gathered me closer to him and let her gallop.</p><p>She was big but nimble and very fast. Once I grew accustomed to the rhythm, staying on wasn\u2019t hard at all. It reminded me of driving fast on a bridge on the highway, the car seeming to soar between the metal bumps. Ka-thunk, ka-thunk. For hours.</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak. The air would have sucked our words away. The heavy body beneath us was hot and sweaty, and I was more than aware of Criminy\u2019s hard thighs behind mine, pressing into the horse\u2019s flesh. His arms held the reins, trapping me within, and I could feel his eyes and thoughts hovering, close but miles away.</p><p>My own thoughts wove in and out from the reality of galloping on a bloodthirsty horse across a strange world, to the fear of what would happen when we stopped galloping, to the constant ache in my heart for my other life. As refreshing as last night\u2019s sleep had been, part of me was horrified not to wake up in my own world, slightly crazy and very sleepy. Just like when you\u2019re having a nightmare and you keep expecting to wake up, but you don\u2019t. I had taken the locket\u2019s magic for granted.</p><p>If my guess was correct, my body was unconscious and unresponsive. I was hooked up to monitors, and a nurse I\u2019d never met was turning and bathing me, keeping me clean and without bedsores. The mental image made me shudder. Knowing what I did about Casper and my brief glance of Jonah Goodwill in my world, it seemed to be the only answer. If you were in a coma in my world, I was betting you were in Sang. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt naked without my locket. Naked and trapped. Bit by bit, Criminy was becoming an anchor, the most familiar thing in Sang. And he was full of surprises. When I\u2019d first seen him and thought of him as a naughty Mr. Darcy, I had been close to the truth. He called himself wicked, and I\u2019d seen him kill. But I\u2019d also seen him be fair, kind, brave, merciful, and loyal. For a monster, there was much to admire in him, and that\u2019s before you got to his physical presence, which was pressing against me in the loveliest way.</p><p>For a while, I even drifted into a little nap, held safe in his arms and lulled by the monotony of pounding hooves and endless, grassy moors. I didn\u2019t dream, and my sleep was uneasy. I fought to open my eyes as the smooth gallop eased into a lope, and then my teeth clacked together as our mount dropped down into a trot. Criminy\u2019s arm around my waist was the only thing that kept me on horseback.</p><p>\u201cAre we there yet?\u201d I asked muzzily.</p> <p>Criminy chuckled. \u201cNot even close,\u201d he said.</p><p>19</p><p>Once I had wiped the sleep and dust from my eyes, I was surprised to see a small village coming up on either side of the dirt road. It looked like a movie set of a ghost town in the Wild West. False-fronted buildings faced the street, painted in odd, muted tones. Mauve, powder blue, mustard yellow. A few people bustled furtively between buildings but not nearly as many as I would have expected. They were all wearing shades of gray and black, which was unusual in Sang, from what I\u2019d seen.</p><p>Criminy steered our mount between two sturdy poles that were driven into the ground on the edge of town. She switched her tail and danced, looking hopefully from me to Criminy, probably hoping that her unwanted master would give her one of my pinky toes as a reward for good behavior. He slid off and helped me down. A young boy darted out from the closest building and clipped Erris\u2019s muzzle cap to the poles with a chain. The big horse threw her head, snorted, and tried to rear, but she was surely stuck.</p><p>Patting her neck, Criminy said, \u201cSorry, lass. It\u2019s only for a short while. You\u2019ll be free again soon,\u201d and then he tossed the boy a coin.</p> <p>When he looked up eagerly to catch the copper, the boy\u2019s open collar and overly pointy grin told me that he, like the urchins at the cathedral, was a Bludman. With a lifetime of movies and books firmly pounded into my head, I still couldn\u2019t believe that Bludmen could bear children in this world. That this little lad would grow up knowing nothing but blood\u2014no cookies, no ice cream, no cupcakes. Still, his smile was bright and innocent, even if he wasn\u2019t dreaming of penny candy.</p><p>\u201cThankee kindly, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cWill you want the inn, then?\u201d</p><p>Criminy looked at the sun. It was late afternoon, and the sky was the dull, bruised lavender of the milk in the bottom of the cereal bowl after all of the marshmallows were gone.</p><p>\u201cIs there only one?\u201d Criminy asked the boy. \u201cAnd where are the Coppers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeverish is a small village, sir. The Coppers come only for the monthly tithe to Brighton. We\u2019ve just the one inn. And this is our only tie-up.\u201d</p><p>With an understanding smile, Criminy gave the boy another coin.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you there, sir.\u201d</p><p>The boy trotted ahead of us into town, and I noticed that his clothes had been many times mended, the breeches patched in similar dark colors and the shoes worn in the heel. The buildings were in need of paint\u2014that was why they were such strange colors. They were faded. It was a poor town, a lonely outpost before the big city on the sea.</p><p>Stopping in front of the only three-story building, the boy said, \u201cThere you are, sir. And please, don\u2019t mention the Coppers to Master Haggard. They drained his wife last year, and it puts him in a right mood.\u201d And then he ran off.</p><p>We looked up at the sea-green storefront. The sign showed a black diamond, outlined in white, with the words Haggard Inn below in heavy, serious script. Not the most promising name for a hotel.</p><p>Criminy held open the door for me, and a bell rang as we entered. A fluffy white cat sat on the counter, eyeing us disdainfully. Lucky creature\u2014without Pinkies about, the bludrats must have left Feverish alone. The room was sparse but well kept, the floors spotless and the wavy, green glass sparkling in the windows. An old gramophone resembling a giant brass lily was playing a dirge. It felt like a funeral parlor.</p><p>A man in a dusty gray suit appeared from the back room, his sad, ancient eyes full of pride and dignity above a frilly tea-stained jabot from another time.</p><p>\u201cHave you a vacancy, Master Haggard?\u201d Criminy asked with a stately bow. I\u2019d never seen him so deferential.</p><p>\u201cWe do, lad,\u201d the man said, his voice sonorous and grave. \u201cOne room or two?\u201d</p> <p>It was like listening to a statue, witnessing something so old that it had started to erode, watching bits of itself wash away in the rain. Just being near him made me feel hopeless.</p><p>\u201cOne, please, sir. For my wife and me,\u201d Criminy said.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Master Haggard said, pinning his soulful eyes on me. \u201cThat creature is not thy wife. But one room ye shall have, nonetheless, for I do not judge those who succumb to heathen trends.\u201d</p><p>Criminy bowed again, murmuring, \u201cForgive me, sir.\u201d</p><p>The old Bludman nodded. \u201cLife today must be full of lies, youngster. But I see you remember a time when it wasn\u2019t so. Born or made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn, sir, in 1793.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re younger than you look,\u201d Master Haggard said. \u201cI was born as well, 1438. Right here, when the county seat was Bludshire. Do you remember what it was like, lad, before Brighton belonged to the prey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, sir. A lovely place, all parks and springs and gardens. And the opera and dancing every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what have they done?\u201d the old man moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s a dark place now. Filthy, dangerous, polluted. Ruled by the Pinky monsters. Our people are starving. The factory workers are on the verge of rioting. The foremen threaten to toss them into the sea. And what does anyone expect, when the Coppers hold sway? No Bludman can live on two drops a day. It\u2019s madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were headed to Brighton, sir,\u201d Criminy said carefully. \u201cWe have business in the isles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d best hurry, lad,\u201d Master Haggard said. \u201cBut what of your lady? How came you to love one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called her, sir,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cShe\u2019s a Stranger.\u201d</p><p>Master Haggard gazed at me and snorted. Then chuckled. Then let out a big guffaw.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s grand. That\u2019s just lovely. She\u2019s special, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a glancer,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cBut she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake my hand, woman,\u201d Master Haggard said to me, and he removed his glove. His scaly black hand was old and shriveled, the nails twisted white talons. I knew better than to show any distaste as I removed my glove and reached for it. He may have looked as slow and melancholy as an antediluvian basset hound, but I could feel his power lurking underneath. Waiting.</p><p>His hand was cool in mine. The jolt was gentle, and I was surprised.</p><p>\u201cBut why do you want to die?\u201d I said. \u201cThings can change. They can get better.\u201d</p><p>He released my hand and wagged his head. \u201cThe things I love are gone. But you saw the flames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I said solemnly. Then I turned to Criminy and said, \u201cWe have to go. Now.\u201d</p><p>20</p><p>Grasping the old Bludman\u2019s hand, I had seen Brighton in flames under dark, threatening clouds low enough to scrape the tops of the burning buildings. Screams filled the air, and the lightning was purple and wicked. I wanted no part of the once-lovely seaside resort.</p><p>\u201cIf we go there, we die,\u201d I said again to Criminy as Erris walked down the dirt road toward Brighton, warming up her muscles. \u201cI know we have to hurry, but there\u2019s got to be another way to the islands. We can\u2019t just run through a riot. Or a fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no other way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a boat. You heard Master Haggard say they were threatening to throw the Bludmen into the sea? It\u2019s because the sea is deadly to us. The salt makes us sick, and we\u2019re too heavy. We sink and drown. I\u2019ve seen it. And Brighton is the only place with boats for hundreds of miles.\u201d</p><p>I sighed deeply, leaning back against him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, either,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019d seen it,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be horrible. Fire and lightning but no rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll skirt the city, head straight for the docks. In all the brouhaha, no one will notice us, especially not the Coppers. It\u2019ll be all the easier to steal a boat and be away.\u201d</p><p>I felt his legs behind me, urging our mare into a gallop. We topped the hill, and the city appeared below us, a gray blot on the landscape. It splayed out like Manchester squashed flat but just as ugly. Smog hovered miserably overhead. Thunder roiled in the heavy sky, and violet lightning sparked between angry black clouds.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he mused, \u201cit\u2019s a very well-timed riot, for our purposes. It should be easy to get to the harbor.\u201d</p><p>Standing sentinel on a rocky outcrop was a black-and-white-striped lighthouse, its lamp spinning slowly and flashing across the city and the sea. Underneath it, ships bobbed in a dark gray harbor. Amazing, the weird mix of technology and anachronism in this world. Giant, threemasted wooden pirate ships nudged the docks alongside shiny brass footballs from 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of ship do you plan on stealing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething larger than a dinghy but small enough to pilot with just the two of us,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be climbing the rigging in that dress. A sub would be ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can drive a submarine?\u201d By that time, I didn\u2019t know why I was surprised.</p><p>\u201cHow hard can it be?\u201d he said. \u201cI can drive the caravan\u2019s engine. It can\u2019t be much different. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a bloody zeppelin.\u201d</p><p>We were getting close enough to see the giant doors set in Brighton\u2019s wall. They had a spiked, medieval-looking portcullis, and I was more than happy to go around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHold on, sweetheart,\u201d Criminy said, and he jerked Erris\u2019s nose to the right. She tossed her head but obeyed, lurching off the packed dirt and finding new speed in the soft grasses of the moor. A picture-perfect gathering of bludbunnies hissed and screamed in terror, diving for cover as the huge hooves tore up swaths of grass in their bucolic meadow. I laughed.</p><p>We were headed toward the harbor. But there was a problem. The high wall, topped with barbed wire just like the one at Manchester, extended out into the sea at least a hundred feet. All of the boats were on the other side of the wall.</p><p>\u201cUm, Criminy? How do we get around the wall?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to scale it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to swim. You can swim, can\u2019t you, pet? I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s as easy as floating, for your kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have a choice,\u201d I said.</p><p>I wanted that locket, more than I\u2019d ever wanted anything. Without it, my old life was gone. I would never see my grandmother again. And according to my own promise, I\u2019d have to leave Criminy behind, too, maybe end up living in one of these wretched cities, ruled by the Coppers and their leader, a man who had taken away everything I loved. What\u2019s more, that same man wanted to use my locket to kill thousands of people he wrongly considered monsters, people who had been kind to me. People like Criminy. I watched the dark waves crashing against the wall and breathed in the salt wind.</p><p>\u201cI can do this,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this,\u201d he agreed.</p> <p>A small ball of solid dread began to form in my corset-constricted belly. I could barely walk in this outfit, and now I had to swim. What about the waves, the current, the flotsam, the jetsam, the rocks, the lightning, the wall? What sorts of animals lurked under the foamy brine? Were killer whales actually killers here?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. I was doing it anyway.</p><p>Criminy kicked Erris. As we galloped toward the wall, his arm around my waist seemed to anchor me to the world. Surely he could feel my panic. How did he seem so cool and collected? My swimming wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but he had to scale a smooth wall expressly designed to prevent said scaling. I knew he wanted the locket to prevent a genocide, but the fire in his eyes told me that part of his fight was for me alone, and I liked him more for it.</p><p>The smooth gallop jerked into a trot and then a bouncy walk, and then Erris was blowing against her muzzle before the wall. I looked up. Way up. It was two stories tall and smooth, without a single handhold that I could see.</p><p>Criminy slid off the bludmare and helped me down. My legs nearly collapsed, but he caught me and drew me close. Then I felt a rude shove in the behind from Erris\u2019s muzzle.</p><p>\u201cFine, lass,\u201d Criminy said, pulling me behind him and patting the horse\u2019s neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned your freedom.\u201d</p> <p>In one motion, he pulled the cap and halter off the wild mare\u2019s head and used the leather reins to slap her hindquarters. She tossed her nose and took off running for the hills, apparently deciding that freedom was better than a solid bite of measly old me.</p><p>Criminy watched her go with a crooked smile. My heart was beating in my ears, and my mouth had gone completely dry with fear. He reached out and stroked my face, tucking an errant curl behind my ear. I looked into his eyes and saw the sea behind me reflected there, the unceasing waves topped with foam. Calm descended over me. The pounding of the waves became soporific. I knew that he was using some sort of magic on me, but I didn\u2019t care. I needed whatever he could give me.</p><p>\u201cLook, love,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do this. You\u2019ll have to fight your way out, use all your energy to get around the wall. Once you\u2019re on the other side, simply float in to shore. I\u2019ll be there, waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so easy,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt is easy,\u201d he said. \u201cA simple act. And then we\u2019re almost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do this,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d he said.</p><p>And then he kissed me, gently, and his lips were wet against mine. I should have resisted, but I couldn\u2019t. I wanted it too badly, wanted to make sure that if I died in the sea, I\u2019d have this last memory burning in my blood. No matter what I told myself, I was attracted to him more than I wanted to believe possible. And he was a really good kisser.</p> <p>My mouth tingled, my entire body suffused with heat and hunger. For him. I kissed him back, my tongue breaking past his lips, surprising us both. He changed his angle, moved with me, sure and powerful but gentle. The kiss deepened. I realized that I was straining against him, hungry, panting. Lightning arced to the moors, the light flashing violet against his dark hair. As the thunder boomed, I pulled away, my sight sharp again. I felt unconsciously strong and confident, like an animal.</p><p>And, finally, I knew I could do it.</p><p>He put his forehead against mine for just a second and murmured something that sounded like \u201cRemember that I did this for you,\u201d and then he was moving up the wall like a spider, his black hands stark against the stone.</p><p>I turned to face the sea.</p><p>I was almost ready. I opened my little bag and found the folded knife inside. Criminy hadn\u2019t taught me how to use it yet. But I didn\u2019t need instructions for what I was about to do.</p><p>The dress had a bunched and bustled overskirt, and the first thing I did was cut off the heavy bustle at the waist to reveal the lighter, straight skirt below. I gathered a handful of my skirt and then chopped that off at the knee, just above the tops of my boots. I stepped out of my petticoats and threw my hat to the ground, too. And then I realized that I had to get into the water before something hungry smelled me.</p><p>I put the knife back into the bag and tied it around my waist. With a deep breath, I waded in. The heavy gray clouds seemed as solid as the stone wall at my side, pressing down from the sky against the sea, and I imagined that in Sang, it probably was possible to sail off the end of the globe, just as old sailors in my world had feared. The horizon was a flat line broken only by jagged islands far in the distance, a goal as unreachable as my grandmother\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>When the first waves licked at my boot, I shivered. The water was freezing, and I could feel it through the leather. I waded deeper. Then I felt the cold lapping against my stocking-clad knees and gasped. This was going to be so much worse than jumping into a pool in a bikini on a summer day, corset or not. And I\u2019d forgotten to loosen my corset.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>It was too late now. I was up to my waist, and the laces were wet. The remains of my dress were tangled around me. I had to use my arms to keep myself steady, to keep the current from tumbling me into the waves, out of control.</p><p>I\u2019d never feared water before, but the sea of Sang was just as bloodthirsty as the land.</p><p>And then I was up to my shoulders, dog-paddling, the jagged cloth of my dress pulling me down toward the darkness. The waves smacked against me, cold and impersonal, and I found myself flailing, fighting. Criminy had said that Bludmen could only sink, but I could barely keep myself above the water. The salt stung my eyes, and I could taste it in the back of my throat.</p><p>I floundered along parallel to the wall, closer and closer to my goal, the open sea. I was twenty feet away, and then ten, and then I could see the barnacles clinging to the degrading stones at the end of the wall, their hungry purple mouths grasping into the water. The little bastards were probably razor-sharp. I paddled away from them, giving myself room to mess up. I was almost there.</p><p>And then I felt something that made my blood run cold.</p><p>Just as I rounded the wall from ten feet away, something nudged against my leg. Something large and smooth and hard, just brushing by. Almost impersonal, like bumping a stranger\u2019s shoulder in a crowd.</p><p>But it was cold.</p><p>My first thought was Shark, and my second thought was Sea monster.</p><p>Then my caveman brain kicked in, and my third thought was Swim, run, escape, kick, swim harder, go go go!</p><p>So I did. I started kicking like a frog, putting power behind the sharp heels of my boots. My arms were cutting through the water in a breaststroke, and the current was finally on my side. I rounded the wall, and the waves began pushing me in toward the shore.</p><p>Then I felt it again. The nudging.</p><p>More insistent this time. Against my thigh.</p><p>Despite myself, I looked down. The water was too dark and roiling for me to see anything, even my own body. I kicked harder, frantically, with every ounce of strength I had. My feet were numb now, my legs burning. I focused on the shore, a hundred yards away. It felt like forever. Impossible. But then I thought of Nana fighting to stay alive every day and realized that I couldn\u2019t do any less. I took a deep breath, determined to reach land again.</p><p>Then I felt teeth around my calf, almost gentle. Teasing. Like a dog testing a stick to see if it will break or stand up to a little rough playing.</p><p>I gasped and got a mouthful of water. With my other boot, I aimed a kick just to the side of where I felt the teeth, and my heel connected with something thicker than a fish. Something rubbery.</p><p>SHARK! my brain screamed. SWIM NOW!</p><p>I kicked again, and the teeth shook a little and released, and then I was floundering, kicking, thrashing, willing myself toward the shore.</p><p>Something nudged my belly from underneath. It felt slightly pointy, like the end of a nose. But larger.</p><p>A sob rose, choking me.</p><p>I was so close.</p><p>My fingers sought the tender points of whatever was nudging from beneath me. It felt like a slimy reptile, an alligator covered in a frilly doily. I shuddered and pushed away.</p><p>And then it felt like teeth. Fast as lightning, they grabbed my arm and dragged me under, and I inhaled water, and everything was lost in darkness.</p><p>21</p><p>\u201cYou have to open your eyes,\u201d I heard in my mind as I floated in the cool blackness. \u201cYou have to swim.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed. I opened my eyes to an eerie, floating, greenish-gray darkness. I could see tendrils of something in front of my eyes, and after a moment, I saw my hand, trailing inky blood, the glove half ripped off.</p><p>I was underwater.</p><p>And there was a gentle, cool glow radiating from the other side of my hand.</p><p>A girl.</p><p>But she was made of light, floating weightless in the water, her bobbed hair and long dress untouched by the shifting currents. I hung suspended, my lungs cold. I wasn\u2019t breathing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shouldn\u2019t have been alive.</p><p>Her mouth moved.</p><p>\u201cYou have to swim to shore,\u201d she said in my mind, her voice musical and sweet. \u201cKick up, get above the waves. You\u2019re so close.\u201d</p> <p>Am I dead? I thought.</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have to make it to the lighthouse. You have to free me.\u201d</p><p>How?</p><p>\u201cOpen the door upstairs. Find my bones and bury them. I\u2019ve been waiting for years. Help me, and I\u2019ll save you.

Go now!\u201d she cried.</p><p>A burst of white-hot lightning shot through my muscles, shocking me into action. I gave a mighty kick, and my head broke the surface. Water dribbled from my mouth, and then I was gasping for breath, starving for air. My arms churned in the water, my legs kicked, and the waves seemed to help me, pushing me toward the shore.</p><p>I hit the sand hard, the waves driving me into the rocky beach. I coughed and dragged myself forward with my elbows, until Criminy lifted me from the sand. He sat on the beach with me collapsed across his body, his arms holding me tight.</p><p>\u201cI knew you could do it, love,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cI knew you could.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, holding up my ragged glove and ripped sleeve. When he saw the blood running down my fishbelly-white arm, he licked his lips and shuddered, and I tucked it under my armpit and scooted away to a safe distance. \u201cSomething dragged me down. But then there was a girl, and she helped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl?\u201d Criminy asked, eyes sharp.</p><p>\u201cI guess she was a ghost,\u201d I said, hugging myself tightly and shaking, the fear finally catching up with me. \u201cOr my mind playing tricks on me. She made me promise to go to the lighthouse and find her bones and bury them. She said she\u2019d been waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we must,\u201d Criminy said, patting me from farther away than we would both have preferred. \u201cGhost curses are hard to break. But first you need to wrap up that wound. I can be good, but not that good.\u201d</p><p>He looked toward the lighthouse, and I followed his glance up the tall building, the upper story lost in thick clouds. More time lost.</p><p>As we picked our way along the large rocks and tide pools, I asked, \u201cGhosts are real here?\u201d I wasn\u2019t surprised, not really. But I wanted to know more. Was I going to be seeing ghosts all over the place now?</p><p>\u201cAs real as they are anywhere, I suspect,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one, only the results of their handiwork. It\u2019s only natural that a glancer would see such things. You walk the line between the worlds in more ways than one, you know.\u201d</p><p>He was trying very hard not to look at me, not to smell me. Despite his self-control, it was still difficult for him to ignore my freshly bleeding arm. On the beach, he had tossed me a handkerchief and kept his distance as I tied it around the wound. And then he\u2019d found a vial in his pack and chugged it, his bright eyes never leaving me. I briefly wondered if it was the one taken from my own veins in Manchester.</p> <p>The lighthouse loomed over us, a sagging tower of loose boards and peeling paint. The stripes that had seemed so fresh and new from the hill, pitch black and snowy white, were faded to light gray and darker gray, desolate and reproachful. I didn\u2019t want to get near it, but I was bound by my promise to a dead girl. Criminy said that she had the power to curse me, and I believed him. I didn\u2019t want another enemy in Sang, especially not a paranormal one.</p><p>Criminy kicked the door open. It smacked against the wall, making the entire building shake. The stark room inside was coated with dust, the furniture leaning and splintered.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s come here for years,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cThe ships have enough instruments and clockworks to tell the navigators where the rocks are. It\u2019s crude and outdated technology, shining a light around the darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I saw it,\u201d I said, puzzled. \u201cEarlier, when we looked down from the hill. It was orange, and it spun slowly and hit the water.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look down at me, troubled. \u201cYou saw a light? Here? In this lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say. Why was I seeing things that weren\u2019t there?</p><p>Criminy pointed to the spiral staircase. \u201cIf you must do this, that\u2019s the only way up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t think any less of you if you want to walk right back out that door and bugger the ghost. There are ways around curses, although they aren\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already here,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and bowed. \u201cAfter you, love.\u201d</p><p>My boots squelched up the tight curve of the stairs, and the ancient wood creaked threateningly under my heels. I picked up the pace, eager to be done with this errand and on to my own treasure hunt. The city, the storm, the sea, the ghost\u2014it was high time to be gone from Brighton.</p><p>Around and around we went, Criminy\u2019s step light behind me. I hadn\u2019t asked him much about his own journey over the wall, but he looked as fresh and crisp as if he\u2019d just stepped out of his wagon. But he was missing his satchel.</p><p>Finally, the staircase opened up in a smaller, sparse room. It was the living quarters, with one narrow metal bed against the wall, a tiny potbelly stove, and dozens of sharp metal hooks hanging empty from the faded white wood. I felt as if I was being watched, but there was nowhere for a watcher to hide.</p><p>\u201cThis is where the lighthouse tender lived,\u201d Criminy said softly. \u201cOne lonely person, tending the flame above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that was her, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any bones,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even a chest or a box or a cupboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said there was a door upstairs,\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to go, love,\u201d he said, pointing his chin at the stairs. \u201cYou\u2019re not scared of heights, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think most of the glass has blown out, and it\u2019s going to be windy up there.\u201d</p><p>I stepped gingerly back onto the staircase and clung to the inside rail on my way up. The tight curve opened onto a narrow walkway with a waist-high wooden railing. He was right. It was a long, long way down, and most of the glass was gone. The jagged remains of the windows that had once sheltered the flame invited the wind to whip us with an impersonal, random violence. Thunder boomed, making the lighthouse shake and quiver beneath us.</p><p>There was a small, cylindrical room in the very center of the roof, about five steps away. A metal ring that reminded me of a giant cigarette lighter sat on top of the room. She had to be there, in the metal closet under the flame. It was the only place we\u2019d seen where bones might be found, and a sinister place it was for a young girl\u2019s eternal rest.</p><p>I edged away toward the door. I felt blind and tiny, with nothing to hold on to, and the wind played with me like a cat toying with a mouse. I tried the handle, and it was unlocked. I glanced behind me to make sure Criminy was close. He raised his eyebrows at me but said nothing. When I opened the door to look inside the small room, his hand was on my shoulder.</p><p>The room had riveted metal walls, and it was about six feet square. The warm air hit us like a puff of breath, carrying the stale scent of death. The evening light from the open doorway showed a grisly scene.</p><p>Rusty bloodstains remained where fingers had once clawed helplessly at the walls. A figure huddled in the corner, mostly preserved by the dry, salty air sealed within. A mummy. The bobbed black hair was intact, and the skull was covered with taut black skin. Her dress was so thin now as to be transparent, white with a high, lacy collar.</p><p>\u201cThe poor girl,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Before Criminy could speak, the door slammed shut behind us.</p><p>And we were trapped in the blackness with a ghost.</p><p>22</p><p>\u201cThat little bitch!\u201d Criminy shouted.</p><p>I found his hand. \u201cShe\u2019s here, you know,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>In response, eerie, girlish laughter echoed off the metal walls. \u201cThree ghosts in a lighthouse,\u201d she whispered, and the voice was different from the calm, pleading sweetness I\u2019d heard underwater. Up here, the voice was filled with madness.</p><p>She giggled, and Criminy growled, \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to spend eternity with a little strumpet like you.\u201d He pounded on the door. It didn\u2019t budge. It was airtight, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never get out,\u201d she sang. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. And you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, and I could hear myself and Criminy breathing.</p><p>And then came the gruesome scratching of fingernails on a chalkboard.</p><p>Or bones on metal walls.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I asked, my voice flat, guarded.</p><p>\u201cHe was a Bludman, and I was a maid,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe fell in love. But I was betrothed to my brother\u2019s best friend. My love and I were going to stow away on a ship, go to Almanica and start over fresh, where people wouldn\u2019t hate us for loving each other. But my brother found our letters. He knew where we were meeting. When I came here, he and my betrothed found me, locked me in to die alone. Told me I deserved it for loving a filthy Bludman. Called me an abomination.\u201d</p><p>She tittered in my ear. \u201cJust like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the Bludman?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI never found out,\u201d the voice echoed. \u201cI died here. And I\u2019ve been lonely.\u201d</p><p>I felt Criminy\u2019s hand on my arm, and it traveled down to my wrist. I could sense his urgency, so I coughed, trying to cover up the furtive noises as he pressed Uro\u2019s head and the little snake whirred with gears. I waited to see red lights, but Criminy must have planned ahead and shielded the ruby eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour Bludman\u2014what was his name?\u201d I asked, my voice loud in the tiny room.</p><p>\u201cHis name was Scarab Crumbly,\u201d the voice said, dreamy. \u201cWe met in the market. His hair was golden and wavy, like a lion. He had eyes as deep as the sea. And he loved me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI knew Rab Crumbly,\u201d Criminy broke in, his voice booming in the tiny room. Under his words, I heard metal on metal, scraping. \u201cHe was drained twenty years ago by the Coppers. They put his head on a pike for killing a girl named Evangel. Was that you, by chance?\u201d</p><p>A strangled cry reverberated off the walls. \u201cDrained! Oh, Rab, my love! You were always true!\u201d</p><p>A nightmare apparition appeared inches from my face, the ghost girl with the bob, her mouth now a gaping hole into hell. Her strangled moan turned into a shriek, and that made me scream, and our voices merged and echoed in the blackness. I imagined the metal warping, pressing out, ready to explode. My eardrums ached with pressure, and pain shot through my head in bursts of red.</p> <p>But through her, illuminated by her, I saw Criminy\u2019s back, and he was doing something to the door, and so I shrieked louder. Which wasn\u2019t hard, because I was terrified. I hadn\u2019t feared the quiet ghost under the waves, but this thing was nasty.</p><p>As the ghost expanded, her hands became claws, and her eyes sank back into empty black pools. I was forced backward until I felt bones scraping against the heels of my boots, clutching at my ankles. I was still screaming, couldn\u2019t have stopped if I\u2019d tried. She loomed over me, mouth open, and something in the back of my brain idly wondered if there was such a thing as a soul, and where hers was, and where mine would go when the ghostly lips sucked it out through my eyeballs.</p><p>And then the door flew open, and the ghostly screaming suddenly stopped, leaving only silence and the tang of salty wind behind. I blinked, and there was Criminy, grinning, holding out his glove.</p><p>\u201cI think you kept your promise, love,\u201d he said, handing Uro back to me. \u201cThank goodness for clockworks and their lockpicks, eh? Let\u2019s leave this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I said. \u201cHold the door open.\u201d</p> <p>I looked behind me, where the sunset let in just enough light to see the sad, moldering skeleton of a mad girl with a broken heart. I reached out to smooth the black hair, and the jolt came, soft as leaves dancing on a summer night\u2019s breeze.</p><p>\u201cMy G-god,\u201d I managed to stutter.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything she said was true. But her betrothed was Jonah Goodwill himself, and Rab Crumbly was the Bludman who incited Goodwill\u2019s crusade against your kind. And against women like me. Goodwill still wears Evangel\u2019s engagement ring on a chain around his neck. All of this, everything he\u2019s done. All of the horrors he committed. It\u2019s all because of her.\u201d I paused, studying the white dress. A wedding dress. \u201cBecause he loved her, and she chose a Bludman instead of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible to hate him more,\u201d Criminy said, holding out one of his many handkerchiefs, a large square of sea-green silk. \u201cBut I do.\u201d</p><p>As tenderly as I could, I wrapped the body in the cloth and picked it up. Edging toward the railing, I threw it into the ocean.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re free,\u201d I said in benediction as I watched the bones clatter against the rocks.</p><p>23</p><p>The city was in flames, and the docks were silent. I was still in shock. I was also half-naked and soaked through and starting to chafe with salt water. Still, there was a lot I didn\u2019t understand. And I was in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cIf the city\u2019s on fire, why isn\u2019t everyone running to the docks?\u201d I asked. \u201cBoats are a better bet than the city gates, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you don\u2019t know the politics here. Brighton is a city ruled by a few rich Pinkies. Beneath them are the poor Pinkies, the servants, and the Bludmen who work in the factories. The people have been oppressed for decades. They\u2019re not used to fighting or tactical thinking. They probably didn\u2019t plan very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, even from the lighthouse, we didn\u2019t see a single person,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI have a theory,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not pretty.\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking to look at him. He was troubled, more so than I had ever seen.</p> <p>\u201cThe clockworks are getting quite good, you see. The mechanics are reaching a new level of genius and subtlety. Tell me, if you could use machines instead of dangerous, barely restrained workers, what would you do with the workers? You can\u2019t let them go\u2014bloodthirsty, penniless, and with a grudge.\u201d</p><p>I just stared at him, my jaw set.</p><p>He looked up at the smoke barreling from deep within the city and said more softly, \u201cDo you smell that? Doesn\u2019t it smell like meat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that the people in charge locked up the workers and set them on fire?\u201d I said, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cIn the end, the winner rewrites history. Call it a bloody revolution, become the heroes who made the city safe for innocent, harmless Pinkies. And such a shame that Dark-side Brighton was lost in the workers\u2019 riotous flames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we help them?\u201d I said. \u201cCan we do anything?\u201d</p><p>Criminy turned to me, the muscles in his face taut with fury and concern. \u201cWe are doing something,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man who has your locket is the mastermind behind every atrocity against a Bludman today. He probably planned this riot. He\u2019s the leader, and he\u2019s just a little farther away, trapped on an island. Getting your locket back isn\u2019t my only goal.\u201d</p><p>There was a fierce beauty in his determination, a strength of purpose that spoke to my own will. For possibly the first time, I looked at him and didn\u2019t see a hint of monster or charlatan or trickster\u2014just a man, and a powerful one. In that moment, I would have followed him anywhere. But he turned toward the sea.</p><p>Our ramble along the dock took us past cutters and rowboats to a smart brass submersible, about forty feet long. It still shone with polish and didn\u2019t have a single barnacle clinging to the hull.</p><p>\u201cThis is our girl,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cThe newer the model, the easier to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if someone\u2019s inside?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThen they help us or die,\u201d he said cheerfully, and I surprised myself by agreeing with him. Sang wasn\u2019t a world for middle ground.</p><p>The sub was mostly underwater, leaving perhaps two feet of curved metal above the dark gray waves. She was shaped like a pill, with a propeller at the back and a shiny periscope at the front. Just visible under the waves was a glass window with banks of instruments, dark and waiting. The ship appeared empty. And the sky was getting darker.</p><p>Criminy leaped onto the roof and began to turn a brass wheel. It creaked and creaked, and then, with a pop, the door opened. I could see a strip of crimson velvet around the edge, and it made me think of a cat\u2019s mouth.</p><p>I did not want to go down there, get swallowed up by the ship, and ride underwater, where we were vulnerable and trapped. I wanted to take a nice, breezy ship with sails and lifeboats and emergency vests. But for someone who couldn\u2019t swim in the sea, like Criminy, I supposed this vehicle was safer. We both had to take risks.</p><p>He disappeared down the ladder, and I scanned the docks until he returned. Nervously, I stepped onto the brass hull and then followed him down into the ship. The crimson velvet continued inside and coated the walls and ceilings. The floor was dark wood, with Turkish carpets running down the middle.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t smell a living thing on the ship,\u201d Criminy assured me, \u201cbut keep your wits about you, just the same. Can\u2019t be too careful about stowaways on a submarine.\u201d</p><p>The sub was more like an apartment than a boat. The walls had paintings, odd sepia-toned photographs, and shadow boxes of bizarre insects, all firmly screwed to the velvet walls. We were in the sitting room, and a little damask sofa with tasseled pillows beckoned my aching bottom. The hours riding bareback were taking their toll on a body that had been through more than its share of fear and pain in the last few days.</p><p>Just before I collapsed on the sofa, I stopped. The Nana in my head chided me, and I sighed. I was sopping wet. I couldn\u2019t leave a mark on someone else\u2019s good furniture.</p><p>\u201cCriminy?\u201d I called. He had disappeared further into the ship. \u201cI need a change of clothes.\u201d</p><p>His head popped around the corner. \u201cI\u2019m setting our course, love,\u201d he said. \u201cPoke around and see what you can find. I\u2019m afraid I lost our bag going over the wall when they started shooting at me. My apologies. The bedroom\u2019s down the other way. \u201d</p><p>I squelched down the narrow hallway, passing the tiny kitchen and bathroom. The bedroom was at the back, in the rounded end of the pill. The bed was approximately six feet square, and the room wasn\u2019t much bigger. I slid aside a panel in the dark wood wall to find a gentleman\u2019s wardrobe. It was rich and new and a bit big. But it would do.</p><p>I slid the bedroom door shut behind me, curious to know if the smell of my naked skin would draw Criminy out. I wondered if it bothered him at all, whether it was nagging, like smelling a hamburger when you were starving. Or if it was more like showing a teenage boy a half-clothed woman. Was it hunger, lust, curiosity? An animal instinct or a human longing?</p><p>It didn\u2019t really matter. He was at the opposite end of the ship, busy, and I had to change. I couldn\u2019t infiltrate Jonah Goodwill\u2019s lair half-naked.</p><p>I sat down on the edge of the bed and heard a whirring purr behind me as the engine started. It was surprisingly quiet, not at all the unsophisticated grinding I had expected. The ship shuddered and began to move. I slid a little sideways as it changed course. We were under way.</p><p>The wet boots were off first, although it was hard to get the swollen laces undone. Then the sopping stockings, thank goodness. Then the shreds of the dress, peeled off like a second skin. Then the corset, after I had used my knife to slash the laces, which involved more than a little gleeful revenge. Then Uro and the gloves, cold and moist as frog fingers, one whole and one shredded and bloody. Finally, I was completely naked.</p><p>I lay back and exhaled, my eyes shut in bliss. When I opened them again, I was gazing straight up into a mirror set in the ceiling over the bed. Seeing myself there, laid out naked on some strange rich man\u2019s red velvet coverlet, I let out a little shriek and scrambled back to the foot of the bed, away from the mirror and toward the dry clothes in the closet. I couldn\u2019t help looking again, and that\u2019s when I noticed the brass rings set into the ceiling around the mirror. And a leather whip on hooks set in the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whoever owned this bed was a sex fiend. We had stolen a real Love Boat. The red velvet everywhere suddenly made sense.</p><p>\u201cLetitia! Love, are you all right?\u201d Criminy called from the other side of the flimsy wooden door. Panicking, I wrapped myself in the scarlet coverlet, the tassels tickling my damp skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. \u201cI just startled myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he said, and the air suddenly seemed very thick and very still. The thin sliding panel between us bent in a little bit, and I could imagine Criminy on the other side, his hand and face pressed against the black wood, his sharp eyebrows drawn down in concern. His nostrils flaring wide, catching my scent.</p><p>I heard him inhale and sigh.</p><p>I clutched the blanket more tightly around me.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d I said nervously. \u201cI just saw something that surprised me. And shouldn\u2019t you be steering the boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve programmed it already,\u201d he said, his voice low and soft. \u201cIt\u2019ll take us to the open water around the islands and stop. If anything shows up on the sonar, we\u2019ll hear an alarm.\u201d</p> <p>He inhaled again, then exhaled with a soft hum.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re alone. Love.\u201d</p><p>Despite myself, I felt drawn to the door. My determination to resist Criminy and Sang itself was crumbling.</p><p>I felt as if he were pulling an invisible string, as if there were a golden hook around my spine leading me forward. I stepped lightly off the bed, trailing the red coverlet behind me. It was over my shoulders and crossed in front of me with both arms, like wings wrapped possessively around my fragile skin.</p><p>I pressed myself against the door, feeling the tension of his body pressing back through the flimsy wood. I breathed in. I could smell him, too, his scent rising sharp above the brass and new-cloth odors of the sub. Raspberries and blackberries, sweet and sun-warm, but with a fierce herbal undertone, crushed weeds and thorns. Burgundy and wine and the green of shadows. Eyes shut, velvet coverlet drawn up to my chin, I was taking in the scent with such deep breaths that I was starting to get a little light-headed.</p><p>The wood bent in against me a little more. I took a step back.</p> <p>The door slid to the side, and there he was.</p><p>We studied each other in stillness. He leaned against the door frame, at ease but focused. He wasn\u2019t much bigger than I, but I suddenly felt quite small. The painting of him in the locket had so cunningly captured the intensity of his gaze and the single-mindedness of his will.</p><p>His eyes were dark now, as gray and stormy as the sea through the portholes, captured and infinite at once. The eyebrows that had at first seemed cruel now seemed elegant, speaking volumes with the smallest angle. His mouth was just a little open, and I wanted to kiss it.</p><p>No, I wanted to bite it, worry it.</p><p>I wanted to bite it? That was strange.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter. I inhaled deeply, taking in more of the scent. My eyes were drawn to the open neck of his shirt, so rebellious in its carelessness. His hair had fluttered loose, drifting over his shoulders. It was smooth and fine and dark, and my hand untangled itself from the blanket to reach out and brush it back. He closed his eyes as my naked skin brushed his jaw.</p><p>I half-expected a jolt, but none came. The electricity between us had nothing to do with foresight. I didn\u2019t need a glance to tell me what would happen next.</p><p>My breath caught in my throat as the blanket fell around me, and his hand snatched it just in time. We both stopped, my hand barely touching his face, his hand holding the blanket, the air between us humming like a plucked string.</p> <p>I looked down and reached to take the blanket back from him. He didn\u2019t let go. I tugged a little, still refusing to meet his eyes. And then he tugged back, pulling me to his chest as he let go of the blanket and wrapped his arms around me. I was caught.</p><p>My head was tucked under his chin, and as my nose brushed his throat, I found myself nuzzling his neck. I felt drunk, woozy, swooning. As I rubbed my cheek on his collarbone in a daze, he swallowed hard, and I felt his muscles tense. He was like an animal held in check, barely contained.</p><p>Then he stepped back a little, his gloved hands lifting my face to his, cradling my jaw. I shivered, but I kept my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said, his voice husky and low, compelling.</p><p>I exhaled, steeled myself, and opened my eyes.</p><p>He was gazing down at me, and his eyes were endless, deep pools of pleading and fire and barely restrained something or other, and they were magnetic, like black holes, but full of flames, and yet gray, and yet full of colors and see-through and dancing with little flecks of glitter, and I couldn\u2019t look away, and what pretty eyelashes he had, as long and dark as a woman\u2019s, as a kitten\u2019s, as a panther\u2019s, and the smell, oh, the smell, like crushed heather and berries and springtime in the morning and bodies rolling over and over in the grass and everything covered with dew like cobwebs making mandalas of raindrops, and I couldn\u2019t stand it, couldn\u2019t hold back for one more second.</p><p>But I had to know first.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing this?\u201d I whispered, head tilted up and lips so close to brushing his that I imagined our molecules dancing in the air together. \u201cAre you doing something to me? Is this a spell or some sort of glamour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have this kind of power alone,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>\u201cIs it inevitable?\u201d</p><p>My words hung there, suspended, trapped in the spangled amber of the moment. I couldn\u2019t see it, but somehow I knew that he smiled, sharp teeth glinting.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want it to be,\u201d he said.</p><p>And then the cool suede of his glove stroked over my lips, and they felt full to bursting and ripe, and I shivered and breathed out, and the blanket slithered off my shoulders and puddled on the floor at my feet as his lips crashed into mine.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his neck, my skin rippling with goose bumps as his hair brushed over my collarbone. The kiss was hungry and determined, and I barely registered the heat of his skin as his tongue slipped past my lips. He tilted his head, and a tiny sigh escaped me as the kiss grew deeper. As I had hoped, as I had expected, he tasted of berries, like wine, dark and deep.</p><p>His gloves stroked down my shoulders and back like an artist\u2019s brush, skimming every bone and curve with tender force. I pressed against him shamelessly, and the smooth linen of his shirt rubbing over my nipples made my eyes roll back. He shrugged off his heavy coat, and I could feel the imprint of his hands where they had touched me.</p><p>I wanted them back. I wanted them lower.</p><p>I squirmed closer, rubbing against him, begging for his touch, and he withdrew from the kiss, licking my lips and chuckling low in the back of his throat. He tossed his vest to the floor and drew the shirt over his head, saying, \u201cFair\u2019s fair. Now, come back to me, beauty.\u201d</p><p>My body was bereft without his touch, and I suddenly realized that I was completely naked. I was overcome with shyness. I\u2019d never been aggressive in the bedroom, and I hadn\u2019t been with anyone but Jeff in years. I had never felt this passion, this fire\u2014not with Jeff, not with anyone.</p><p>What did he want from me? What did he expect?</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I crossed my arms in front of my stomach and muttered, \u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me, the corner of his mouth quirking up in the way that made me melt. \u201cBecause you want to,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d I said, stubborn to the last.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, and he reached out to cup my face tenderly. I looked down, because I couldn\u2019t meet his eyes. Now I was facing the elegant, muscled skin of his chest and, even lower, the spare, beautiful curves where flat stomach met hipbones. The scent rising from his warm skin was doing strange things to me.</p><p>He lifted my face, caught my eyes with his own. I was stuck, struck, hypnotized. Again, his thumb rubbed over my lips, which were now swollen and tender from his kisses. Then it moved down, tracing over my chin and down my throat, where it rested for a moment in the hollow.</p><p>\u201cYour heart is beating fast,\u201d he said. \u201cI can feel it, just there.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t deny it. I couldn\u2019t stop my heart from beating any more than I could still my breathing or make myself quit aching for his touch.</p><p>The hand traveled farther downward, spreading over my chest and lightly skimming over one breast, pressing gently over the nipple. My body surged toward that hand without thought, and I gasped and blinked and pulled back, unsure. His eyes seemed to go a shade darker, and his head tilted toward me as he licked his lips.</p><p>Lower still the hand traveled, too slowly for my liking. When it found my arms crossed tightly over my stomach, wrist grasping wrist, it stopped, and he raised his eyebrows and waited. I didn\u2019t budge. I had to keep some sort of power from him, had to feel that I had a choice in what I was doing, if not what I was feeling.</p><p>One dark eyebrow arched up in challenge. I shook my head, just the tiniest gesture. I smiled slyly.</p><p>Then, swiftly but gently, his hands tugged my arms apart and spun me around. I ended up facing the bed, my wrists held together behind my back in one gloved hand as the other continued right where it had left off, stroking my hip, causing tingles to race over my bare skin.</p><p>I took a deep breath and tugged my arms, but he stepped closer, pinning them between us. My captured hands were pressed between our bodies, and a little thrill ran down my spine when I realized how badly he wanted me. I felt the warmth of his breath on the tender hollow behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you want to play coy, Letitia,\u201d he whispered, his lips brushing my skin just enough to make me buck. He licked a line from the curve of my ear down my neck, and I shuddered. \u201cBut I do aim to make you surrender.\u201d</p><p>His lips nibbled my neck as his hand stroked relentlessly down the crease of my thigh. Without thinking, I arched just a little bit toward that hand, straining toward the touch that I craved. He chuckled again, and I could feel his teeth scrape against the nape of my neck. My nerves were screaming different messages, Run and Stay and No, touch here, damn you. I had never felt so alive, as if every cell of my body was focused and yearning and feeling and hungry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The teasing hand changed direction, tracing the lines of my body back upward with deliberate slowness. When it reached my breast, I held my breath. The suede over his thumb rubbed my nipple, circling, and I moaned a little.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I begged.</p><p>\u201cSurrender,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The thumb circled lightly, lazy and maddening. I thought I might explode.</p><p>I turned my head and nipped his earlobe, whispering, \u201cHaven\u2019t I already?\u201d</p><p>The hand left my breast to catch my face there, and his mouth sealed over mine, another promise, his tongue seeking and ravenous. I had never kissed anyone like that, reckless and messy and gasping. He released my wrists and spun me back to face him, and then I felt both of his hands on my ass, pressing me against him. I was straining toward his body, trying to rub every inch of my skin against whatever I could reach.</p><p>My mouth was in a frenzy against him, but his tongue was slow, deliberate. I was getting desperate. He was holding back, teasing me, enjoying himself. Playing with me, drawing out the torture now that he\u2019d gotten the surrender he wanted. He was treating me like a kitten again.</p><p>I\u2019d show him a kitten.</p> <p>My hands moved to his back as the kiss grew more ferocious, and I lightly trailed my nails up and down his skin. They were still blood red from Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s paint, still filed to points to impress the Pinkies at the caravan. He murmured approvingly into the kiss, and I murmured back while softly and sensually drawing one single nail ever so gently up his spine.</p><p>And then I made my hand into a claw and ripped my talons down his back.</p><p>He drew back from the kiss and hissed at me, teeth bared. I smiled smugly.</p><p>\u201cMeow,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he growled, his voice dripping with ferocity.</p><p>For just a second, I registered that I could smell the blood on his back, and I was filled with a wild desire to run my tongue up the wounds I had made. And then the full force of his body drove me to the bed and pinned me there, pressing me down into the cool sheets.</p> <p>The studied tension of his kiss was gone, all veils of playfulness dissolved in the blood on my hands. When he kissed me this time, he meant it.</p><p>I meant it, too. I wanted him, more than anything I\u2019d ever wanted in my life. My hands held his face right there, daring him to stop kissing me for even a second. Somewhere at the other end of the bed, he was ripping off his boots and stockings with one hand, but his tongue kept lapping at me, pulling me in. I heard things hit the ground, and then he pressed back over me, and I sighed against his lips, arching my back and finding the heavy fabric of his breeches still there, between us. Between me and what I needed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to wait another second to feel the full, hot length of his skin along my body, to find him poised at the brink of me. I wrapped my legs around him and ground my body against the hardness there, whimpering, all pride and modesty forgotten.</p><p>He pulled away to whisper raggedly in my ear, \u201cIt takes two hands to do this, love,\u201d and I understood.</p><p>My hands fumbled for the ties on his breeches as he licked down my throat and between my breasts, and I mumbled, \u201cDon\u2019t they have kilts in your world?\u201d</p><p>Finally, the laces were loose, and I tried to push down the cloth with clumsy fingers. Just then, he started circling a breast with his tongue, and I dropped the laces to clutch the sheet underneath me, gasping as he took my nipple into his mouth and sucked. I threw my head back and moaned, twining my fingers in his hair.</p><p>He kissed me as he shucked his breeches, and the kiss built in intensity until the full weight of him finally covered me, skin meeting skin until there was nothing left between us. I could hear myself whimpering again, feel myself wiggling, but still he held back.</p><p>\u201cAre you mine?\u201d he whispered in my ear, and his knee nudged my legs apart. His gloved hand teased me, stroking, dipping and caressing. I was so close. So close.</p> <p>His finger worked faster, and he licked the hollow behind my ear. I threw back my head and looked up at the mirror then, at the dark fall of his hair and the pale, powerful ripples of his back. I saw the four straight red lines where I had clawed him, already healing. It was only a second that my attention wandered, but then the finger was gone, and he was pushing against me, poised at my last barrier, waiting for my word.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>I was panting, wanting, groaning, a beast of emotion and yearning that couldn\u2019t be denied. And he wanted words from me, wanted me to think. Wanted me to make a choice.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d I whispered back in his ear.</p><p>Then, so quietly, \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>And with a chuckle of fierce triumph, he plunged into me, again and again and again, and I was already there, somehow. I cried out in release, fireworks blossoming behind my closed eyes as he touched something inside me that I hadn\u2019t known existed. He stroked again, and again, and I kept waiting for him to bite me or draw blood or do something definitively inhuman. But instead, he just kissed me as I came, his tongue tasting every inch of my mouth with the same hotness that burned below.</p><p>\u201cStop, stop. I\u2019m dying,\u201d I said. Inside me, everything felt swollen, loud, overtouched, sensitive beyond belief. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>But he rolled to his side, taking me with him, and his hand moved down to caress me even as he kept moving. Forehead pressed to mine, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. You don\u2019t want me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take any more,\u201d I said. \u201cOne\u2019s all I\u2019m good for. This is too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too much.\u201d He chuckled, his finger moving faster again.</p><p>And then I felt it, deep inside me, blooming like some bright flower in the darkness, something new and strange. And I was riding it, consumed by it, the pleasure sweet and sharp as a violin note, rocking me to my core. And we both cried out in release, quaking together before collapsing in a heap, laughing.</p><p>24</p><p>Sometime later, I woke up curled against him under the red velvet coverlet, my head on his chest. And quite surprised at myself. His arm was around me, his dove-colored glove absentmindedly stroking my wrist. His gloves were the only things he was still wearing. I, of course, wore nothing.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, poppet,\u201d he said with a sleepy grin.</p><p>\u201cPoppet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019re technically pirates now. And you smile in your sleep. I probably did, too.\u201d</p><p>Warm and rested and satisfied for what felt like the first time in forever, I stretched, my knuckles and toes grazing the walls. For someone on an impossible quest, in that moment, I felt marvelous.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wash that glove,\u201d I observed. \u201cOr throw it away.\u201d</p><p>He examined his hand, grinning, and said, \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll have it framed instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t glance, you know,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen we touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t want you to see what\u2019s in my head when I\u2019m touching you. That would take away all the fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it only work once?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe glancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery gift is different.\u201d</p><p>I should have felt shy, and it seemed strange that I didn\u2019t. But I was comfortable there, in a rich deviant\u2019s bed on a submarine, cradled by the blood drinker who inexplicably adored me.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you love me?\u201d I asked, lured into candor by the strangeness of the situation.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious. I show up out of nowhere, and you all but pledge your undying love to me, even though you don\u2019t really know me. Just because of a broken heart and a spell. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said, chuckling. I smiled, to feel his chest rumble with it. \u201cBut don\u2019t you believe in love at first sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that other people believe in it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019m just too practical for that sort of thing. There are too many variables, too many chemicals and likes and dislikes and shared interests and the timing of it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a romantic,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you could take everything you were looking for in a person and whisper it into someone\u2019s ear, and they brought that person to you? And then, when you saw them for the first time, even if you didn\u2019t know they were the one for you, you suddenly knew it anyway?\u201d His finger traced my eyebrows, my cheekbones, as he thought a moment. \u201cWhat if your heart stopped when you saw that person, and only after that did you realize that they truly were everything you ever wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, that would be nice,\u201d I had to admit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happened for me,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you ask for?\u201d I needed to know. It was a tall order to live up to the feeling he had described.</p><p>\u201cCleverness, courage, beauty, humor, strength, slyness, curves, magic, talent, understanding. An equal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask for someone ... you know ... like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d he said, considering. \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem. If it ever comes down to it, I can make you like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve only done it once. Whatever it felt like, to her, it was better than dying. Asking another Bludman anything about the process is considered terribly gauche. But as you\u2019ve seen, there are advantages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImproved strength and healing, longer life. And with all of those, of course, come courage and humor, because you don\u2019t have to worry so much. When you\u2019re less likely to die and you don\u2019t have to fight for food, the main concern is keeping those you love safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s all, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, that can be a tall order.\u201d He chuckled again.</p><p>\u201cI have other questions,\u201d I said, trying to seem uninterested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat keeps you from draining me dry? I mean, you want to, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little. Not as much as I did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took precautions,\u201d he said, somewhat defensively.</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d I could hear myself sounding like a schoolmarm, but I had the feeling that there was a secret somewhere eluding me, swimming under the murky waters of our relationship. Deep down, I knew that he was lying to me somehow.</p><p>He gently lifted me off his chest and turned me to face him. He looked grave but hopeful. \u201cWhen I tell you this, don\u2019t overreact. It\u2019s important that you hear the whole story.\u201d</p><p>I straightened, pulling the velvet blanket back up to cover me. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p> <p>He looked down, thinking. Then he met my eyes and said, \u201cI gave you some of my blud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d I said, backing away a little. \u201cWhy? Why didn\u2019t you ask me? What about informed consent?\u201d</p><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t mention my unexplained interest in licking his back wounds mid-coitus. That didn\u2019t count.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for consent for anything else I did with either of our bodily fluids recently,\u201d he said with a wolfish grin. \u201cAnd giving you my blud has probably already saved your life several times over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to explain it,\u201d I said through clenched teeth. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t get it, and I\u2019m pretty pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he said, but before he could explain what exactly was simple about secretly force-feeding me his magic blud and turning me into an enormous hypocrite, an alarm siren erupted from the other end of the ship. He leaped up to shove his feet through his breeches and lurched down the red velvet hallway, leaving me naked and speechless in a rich man\u2019s bed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked from the pilot\u2019s room door a few moments later.</p><p>The sirens were still shrieking, and a red light flashed on and off from the ceiling. All I could see over his shoulder was hundreds of blinking instruments and gray water through the viewing window\u2014no obvious emergency.</p><p>He paused in his frantic button pushing to glance at me and did a double take.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of odd things, but I\u2019ve never seen a woman in men\u2019s clothing before,\u201d he said with an amused snort before turning back to the panel of lights. \u201cNot that you don\u2019t look dashing.\u201d</p><p>I snickered.</p><p>Dashing wasn\u2019t the word I\u2019d use. The breeches were baggy, the suspenders didn\u2019t work with my B-cup chest, and the frilly shirt was ridiculous. And I was still testy about the blood sharing. But I didn\u2019t want to interrupt an emergency with something petty.</p><p>I did anyway.</p><p>\u201cSo about the blood,\u201d I said, hating myself a little.</p> <p>\u201cCan it wait until after I\u2019ve saved you from this kraken?\u201d he asked, eyes never leaving the screen.</p><p>I moved closer to the instrument panel, unconsciously putting my hand on his shoulder. If there was a sea monster, I wanted to see it. Sure enough, there was a round, black sonar screen with a red crosshair on it. And smack dab in the middle of it was a big, squid-shaped blip. And then there was a loud gong and a creak, and we were thrown sideways.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhere\u2019s the stunner? He\u2019s going to dive soon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we looking for?\u201d I asked, holding on to his shoulder with one hand and the captain\u2019s chair with the other, trying to stay upright as the ship shuddered and tossed and flashed red around us. I felt like an extra in Star Trek. The ship jerked to the side, and my throat constricted as I realized that this was in no way a movie set. This fairytale monster was real.</p><p>\u201cThe stunner,\u201d he said, his fingers dancing over the controls. \u201cTo, um, stun it. Most ships have one, I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers over the switches and buttons on the console, and I began investigating the overhead instruments. The nose of the ship lurched downward, and I was thrown against the ceiling. After banging my head on something, I looked closer.</p><p>\u201cThis thing has a picture of lightning on it,\u201d I said. \u201cDoes that help?\u201d</p><p>His hand curled over mine where it lay on the brass handle, and he winked at me as we pulled it together. There was a whirring somewhere below us, then a building buzz, and our hair stood on end. A loud crack and a sudden impact smacked our skulls together, and we got all tangled up as the sub shuddered and righted itself. Then the red lights stopped flashing, and everything was back to normal.</p><p>We watched the sonar, and the green squid blob dwindled to a speck, which faded away to nothing. I sighed in relief. Being in a submarine under attack by a giant squid was one of those things so far outside of reality that I couldn\u2019t digest it. It felt like a ride at Disney World.</p><p>\u201cThat went well,\u201d Criminy said, falling into the brass and leather captain\u2019s chair. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close, sea monsters notwithstanding. I expect we\u2019ll be there within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. If the ship was moving the entire time we were asleep, how are we just now getting close to the island? It should have only been a few hours, right?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI never said it was moving the entire time. I may have slowed it to a crawl for a while. There was business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could anything be more important than finding Goodwill and getting my locket?\u201d</p><p>I was exasperated. After all we\u2019d been through to get here, we\u2019d lost valuable time. Still, his eyes were soft and kind, and he reached out to chuck me under the chin.</p><p>\u201cLook, little love. I admire your determination and tenacity, but you can\u2019t press on forever. If we\u2019d stormed the island in the wee hours of morning, you would have fallen over from exhaustion and hunger. You needed respite and rest. You needed to be taken care of, if only for a few hours. Even if you didn\u2019t know it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we could have been there. We could have already won. We could have avoided that kraken!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter how much you like control, some things are simply out of your hands,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, it was exciting, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was fun zapping that squid with you,\u201d I said, leaning back against the wall to pin him with my glare. \u201cNow stop changing the subject. About the blood.\u201d</p><p>Criminy leaned back and rubbed his eyes. I tried not to ogle his chest and instead showed an interest in a preserved butterfly in a case on the wall.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d he said. \u201cMy blud saved your life. Not only because it makes me less likely to hurt you but because it gives you strength and resilience. You nearly drowned, you know. Or maybe you don\u2019t know. But you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I glazed over that bit, what with the near murder by ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve had even a drop of my blud, you no longer drive me crazy with hunger,\u201d he said. And then he grinned, flashing his teeth. \u201cAt least, not in the way that ends up with you drained. The other kind ... well, there\u2019s no hope there.\u201d</p><p>I blushed and cleared my throat as he went on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always entice me, as my smell will entice you, because that\u2019s part of the bargain. But unless I smell your actual blood, I won\u2019t be a danger to you. My blud is like an antidote. I guess the maestro told you that\u2014he\u2019s got an odd sort of cleverness, that one. The droplets on your skin from the locket helped a little, which is how we managed to get to the caravan with you mostly uncovered.\u201d He shifted a little. I think a weaker man would have blushed.</p><p>\u201cBut it was still tempting,\u201d he admitted. \u201cSo I figured the faster I got a few more drops in you, the better. Plus, that way, if anything happened to you here, you\u2019d have a better chance of surviving it. Of fighting off bludrats or swimming a mile in the ocean, or something even worse.\u201d</p><p>I tapped my fingers on the burled instrument panel, eyebrows up, waiting.</p><p>\u201cBut yes, I suppose it would have been gentlemanly to ask first. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat first meal, in the dining car. In your wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly,\u201d he said with a grin, \u201chow would that have worked? Oh, hello, dream lover. Would you drink some of my blud so I won\u2019t murder you in front of all these nice people?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cSo I took a chance. And I think it paid off, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrudgingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a little more by the Brighton wall,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIn the kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought there was something going on there,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you said something about Remember, I did this for you, isn\u2019t it? You were trying to give me strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you forgive me, then, Letitia?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t joking anymore. He needed my forgiveness.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you,\u201d I muttered, looking down at my baggy pants and adjusting my suspenders. \u201cBut I wish you would have asked.\u201d I looked up at him. \u201cAnd don\u2019t do it again without telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I give you more blud,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll damned well know it.\u201d</p><p>He stroked my face and turned back to the instrument panel and started pressing buttons. I went back to the bedroom and got his shirt and jacket and folded everything and carried the stack up to the control room. And I admit that I sniffed myself dizzy, too, because everything that had lingered near his skin smelled marvelous, all thanks to that unwanted but helpful blud.</p><p>It was obnoxious to know that by the time I had condemned Casper for drinking from Bludmen, I had already had a taste myself. Sure, I hadn\u2019t known it at the time. But how could I face him again? I was a hypocrite. The blud had saved my life, just as it had probably saved his, even if he had done it for what I considered to be the wrong reasons. I had tasted blud, and I wanted more. Without my consent, being in Sang had changed me.</p><p>When I returned to the instrument room, my inhuman lover was leaning intently over a thick leather book, poring over maps. Without looking up, he handed me a tin of cookies. Too ravenous to bother asking where he had found them, I began stuffing them in my mouth as I examined the map. There were several islands clustered just off the coast of Brighton, surrounding the Isle of White. They were too small to have names, and there were at least a dozen. And we hadn\u2019t even discussed what to do when we found the damned place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something binged above my head, and Criminy hit a button to stop the noise. The sub shuddered to a stop, and we were bobbing, drifting, a different sensation from the smooth forward motion to which I had grown accustomed. I started to feel a little seasick, actually.</p><p>Criminy pulled down a sort of goggle contraption hanging from the ceiling and looked through it, then held it out to me, saying, \u201cThere they are. The lesser Isles of White.\u201d</p><p>I put my eyes to the brass goggles of the periscope and blinked at the relative brightness of the morning outside. Through water-spattered glass, I could see one large island that reminded me of Greece. It was settled, with an older, faded white city around a church. To the right were three much smaller islands. One of them had a ribbon of sparkling white around the edge. Blinding glints promised razor wire across the top. How welcoming.</p> <p>\u201cGuess which one we\u2019re aiming for,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe one with the wall?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew if the locket worked for him,\u201d I said. \u201cIf he can get back to my world with it.\u201d Then a horrible thought struck me. \u201cOh, God, Criminy! What if he\u2019s broken it? What if I can never get back?\u201d I flung myself against him, and he caught me and stroked my hair, which I\u2019d tied back with a ribbon.</p><p>\u201cHe has no reason to break it, even if it doesn\u2019t work for him,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if it didn\u2019t work, perhaps he won\u2019t be guarding it so well. We\u2019ll find it, little love. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not with him? What if he left it in Manchester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible. A man like that keeps his weapons close at hand. Like Evangel\u2019s ring. He\u2019ll trust no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he knows we\u2019re coming?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking for you, we know that much,\u201d Criminy said.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, looking around. \u201cHow do we get off of this thing and onto the island?\u201d</p><p>Criminy\u2019s mouth compressed into a thin line. Then his lips started to twitch. Then he started to shake. And then he cackled, head thrown back, as if it was the funniest joke he\u2019d ever heard.</p> <p>\u201cDarling, I have no idea whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that far ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone who can\u2019t swim, you\u2019re awfully cavalier,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit it\u2019s funny,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you have to know I\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>With the sub bobbing cheerfully in place, Criminy left me at the periscope to search the rest of the ship for ideas. I\u2019d have guessed we were half a mile away from the island. I could see red tile roofs and palm trees rising behind the wall, but that was pretty much it. There weren\u2019t Coppers or guard towers or machine-gun turrets, but I didn\u2019t even know if those things existed in this world. Yet.</p><p>Metal and wood and flesh collided in the hallway. Criminy cursed and appeared with a coil of dirty rope around one arm and a big canvas bag dragging behind him. He was bursting with energy, like a little kid on a Boy Scout trip.</p><p>\u201cFound a raft,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me I\u2019m not going to tow you in to the island,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, that could be fun,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t the 1600s, sweetheart. It comes with a propeller.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about weapons?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019re going to storm the island, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it stands to reason. If there\u2019s something worth guarding, they\u2019re going to be ... you know. Guarding it.\u201d</p><p>He looked through the periscope. \u201cI don\u2019t see guards. Or weapons. Not even the glint off a clockwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me, that makes it look like a trap. Like they\u2019re waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you propose we spring this trap, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, exasperated. \u201cWhat else do you have in your wacked-out world? Heat sensors? Mine fields? Dirigibles? Booby traps? Machine guns? Shrink rays? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from dirigibles, which are rather expensive and rare outside of trade routes, most of what you just said made no sense whatsoever,\u201d he said, as delighted as a child hearing a foreign language for the first time. \u201cBut it all sounds very dangerous. And fun. Especially the part about the boobies.\u201d</p><p>I waited, eyebrows raised.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cLook, love, I know I seem like a tactical genius, but really, I\u2019m just a magician who occasionally kills a bunny or drives a train.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re just going to putter up to the beach in our raft and walk up to the gate and kindly request an audience with Jonah Goodwill?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou keep forgetting our two greatest strengths,\u201d Criminy said.</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy magic and these harpoons.\u201d</p><p>25</p><p>We were still inside the sub when Criminy did his invisibility spell on us both. Just as I remembered from the field on my first morning in Sang, I felt a cold trickle that spread until I could see through myself, my manly clothes, and even Uro on my wrist. It was very strange, seeing a framed luna moth hanging on the red velvet wall through Criminy\u2019s half-see-through, grinning face, as if he were made of glass. With another wiggle of his fingers, the raft and the harpoons joined us in near-transparency.</p><p>Then we clambered up the ladder and out onto the roof of the sub. Criminy threw the nearly transparent raft into the air, and it exploded into shape and landed in the water with a slap. I was glad that we could half-see each other and our gear, because leaping into a truly invisible raft would have been impossible.</p><p>Criminy hopped in with his harpoon and helped me down. With the touch of the propeller\u2019s button, we were buzzing toward the beautiful but most likely deadly island. It was a short trip, and Criminy used our time by showing me the simple mechanism for shooting the harpoon.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got one shot each, love,\u201d he said, slipping my finger around the trigger in an all-too-intimate manner. \u201cSo make it count. And don\u2019t forget we\u2019re invisible. A nice harpoon butt to the face will do wonders. And then we steal their weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do we do?\u201d I asked. \u201cBesides break teeth and steal things? How do we know where to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sneak around until we figure that part out,\u201d he said. \u201cJust follow me. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d</p><p>When the raft was almost to the sand, I jumped into ankle-deep water and turned to drag it in. I expected Criminy at my side, but he was still sitting in the raft with a funny smile on his half-invisible face.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019re going to have to drag me in. I touch that salty stuff, and I\u2019m not going to be much help to you. Might even make the magic waver.\u201d</p><p>So I lugged the raft in by myself and beached it, marking its place with a large clump of driftwood. Criminy stepped off onto the sand, dry and chipper. I now had sopping-wet boots, sagging socks, and scratchy, damp breeches. But it was worth it to know that my locket was finally within reach.</p><p>With a blithe \u201cShall we?\u201d he ran toward the jungle, faster than I could keep up. We ducked into the shade, dodging droopy tropical trees and flowering bushes. Up close, about twenty feet from our hiding place in the jungle, the wall was actually quite pretty, with glittering shells and sand dollars and bits of sand and mica mixed in. It was warm and breezy and absolutely nothing like any island that had ever existed near Britain. It would have done wonders for the tourist trade in my world.</p><p>But the effect was ruined by the skulls lined up along the top of the forbidding wall, right under the razor wire.</p><p>Criminy exhaled out his nose the way men do when they\u2019re about to return to their caveman roots and beat something unconscious. \u201cThey\u2019re all Bludmen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd women. And children.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell the difference at first. But then I saw the teeth. At least the skulls were old, bleached white in the sun. Nothing fresh.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard\u2019s going to pay,\u201d he growled under his breath.</p><p>Under cover of the jungle, we trotted along the wall, looking for a way in. There were no windows, no arrow slots, no people. Nothing. Not for a long time. Just strange noises from within, crashes and snuffles and the sounds of movement. Finally, when it seemed as if we had run all the way around the island, we came across a set of double doors lashed together with heavy, rusted chains and an enormous lock.</p><p>Criminy looked at it and laughed.</p><p>\u201cAll that, old man? All that, and it\u2019s just a lock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe there are guards on the inside,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s bolted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d he answered, and he handed me his harpoon.</p><p>Before I could ask him how he expected me to shoot two invisible harpoons at once, he had jogged to the wall and skittered up it like a cat climbing a tree. I dropped his harpoon and set mine to my shoulder, waiting for something horrible to happen, for the trap to spring finally.</p><p>He glanced quickly over the wall into the compound and ducked back down. Then he slowly looked back over and cocked his head at a strange angle. He slid under the razor wire and disappeared. I was nearly hyperventilating with worry and curiosity, and my finger was slippery on my harpoon\u2019s trigger.</p><p>Something boomed inside. The chains fell away, and the door squealed open. Criminy walked out, no longer transparent, with the strangest smile on his face, disbelieving but amused.</p><p>\u201cCome along, Letitia,\u201d he called. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here.\u201d</p><p>Still nervous and distrustful, I picked up his harpoon and tiptoed out from the shade and into the bright glare of the sun. I could not fathom that the island was empty, that someone wasn\u2019t waiting to hurt me. Criminy extended his gloved hand. I took it, and he half-dragged me through the door and beyond the white wall.</p><p>It was entirely deserted.</p><p>We had found Jonah Goodwill\u2019s fabled island, that was for sure. But he wasn\u2019t there, and neither was anyone else. Just lots and lots of animals, a veritable Noah\u2019s ark that explained all of the weird noises I\u2019d been hearing. Some of them were creatures I\u2019d never seen before, and not a single one was a predator. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Criminy shut the door softly behind us, muttering, \u201cWe don\u2019t want these poor creatures wandering into the jungle or the sea. Might as well tie tags around their necks with \u2018Eat me\u2019 on them.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself at the irony of a vicious, cutthroat predator worrying about the safety of the soft, squishy innocents of the animal world. He was right, though. The animals had no fear. As soon as he\u2019d made me visible again, deer and giraffes and cows and a strange sort of club-tailed porcupine were all nosing and snuffling hopefully at me, and I felt a little sorry that I hadn\u2019t brought a bag of bread or bananas for them. They all shied away from Criminy, though, and a llama even spit on him.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hide the blud,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p> <p>I shoved past the hungry animals, and we headed straight up to the main building, a two-story manor that looked as if it had been lifted straight out of an American\u2019s version of quaint Mexico. White walls, dark orange roof tiles, a fountain in the courtyard. It was beautiful, inside and out. But no humans at all. Just echoes and creepiness. Someone had been there recently, as the fruit bowl on the table was filled with fresh mangoes and pineapples. I was too anxious to eat, but I scooped water out of a fountain with my hand after suddenly realizing I was parched.</p><p>We checked every room, harpoons at the ready. And we found no one.</p><p>Criminy searched the closets and checked under the beds. I sifted through chests and dressers and anything that might conceivably hide treasure. My locket was nowhere to be found.</p><p>We tried the cookhouse next. The ashes of the fire were still warm under the spit, which held an abandoned haunch of meat, burned to the bone.</p><p>Beyond that, we found a sandy field with a tall tower, several iron rings sunken into the ground, and a windsock.</p> <p>\u201cBastard\u2019s got a metal cladder,\u201d Criminy said grimly. \u201cNo wonder he keeps beating us. It\u2019s only two hours to Manchester by dirigible.\u201d</p><p>I felt as if the breath had been knocked out of me.</p><p>\u201cFrom here to Manchester?\u201d I spluttered. \u201cMy locket\u2019s all the way back in Manchester now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret, little love,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it back.\u201d</p><p>He folded me into his arms, harpoon and all, and I started sniffling, then full-out crying. Whether the old man had tricked us, outrun us, or just coincidentally left his island was unclear, but he was undoubtedly very far away, as was the locket.</p><p>I clung to Criminy as if he was the only thing between me and madness. Maybe he was. He held me, patted me, and muttered kindnesses into my ear. I couldn\u2019t help thinking about my other world, wondering if my body was in a hospital yet and, if so, how long it had taken my proud grandmother to break down and hire a new nurse for her homecare. What if she tried to get out of bed by herself and broke a hip? And who was feeding Mr. Surly? But I wasn\u2019t going to sit around, uselessly indulging my own frustration. I needed to act. I took the handkerchief he offered and blew my nose.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be a clue here somewhere,\u201d I said between sniffles. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something else we can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can eat and sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause wherever he\u2019s gone, we\u2019re not going to catch him today. Might as well get dried out and well rested.\u201d He chucked me under the chin. \u201cAnd let your bum rest after that horse ride, eh?\u201d</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t done. I saw one more building on the other side of the landing strip, and I squelched through the sand, leaving wet bootprints behind me. Criminy caught up with me, holding his harpoon at the ready.</p><p>The last building looked like a storage shed, a simple windowless hut with the same smooth white walls and orange tile roof. In my world, it would have held a couple of rusty, nonworking lawn mowers and the neighbor\u2019s long-forgotten weed eater.</p><p>As we got close, I felt Criminy tense, and he aimed his harpoon at the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I whispered, whipping my own harpoon into place against my shoulder much less gracefully and almost smacking myself in the nose.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone inside,\u201d he said. \u201cA Bludwoman. I can smell her.\u201d</p><p>The island was silent as we crept toward the hut. Well, except for the random mooing and bleating and occasional horn clashing of the animals, but those noises were normal and comforting. No sound came from within the outbuilding.</p> <p>When we were right outside the door, Criminy barked, \u201cWho\u2019s in there?\u201d in his most fearsome voice.</p><p>There was a small noise inside, a scraping. Then a cough. Then a word, barely a ragged whisper.</p><p>\u201cHelp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming in!\u201d Criminy shouted, and he kicked in the door.</p><p>It was pitch black inside, except for the perfect rectangle of sunshine radiating through the door frame. Tiny motes of dust and sand danced in the air, and we waited.</p><p>The cough came again, followed by scraping and rattling. Chains.</p><p>\u201cCriminy?\u201d she whispered from the darkness.</p><p>\u201cTab?\u201d he said, rushing into the room. \u201cWhat have they done to you, lass?\u201d</p><p>I stood just outside the door, wishing I could see what was happening within but afraid to get too close. I heard a loud clang and a whooping gasp, and I leaned in through the doorway.</p><p>From the darkness, something flew at me too fast to see. I tried to scream, but the sound was choked off as I crashed to the sand with a body driving me into the ground. Claws settled around my throat, pressing down on my windpipe.</p><p>So I did what any sensible person would do.</p><p>I passed out.</p><p>26</p><p>\u201cLetitia, love, come back to me.\u201d</p><p>Criminy\u2019s desperate voice buzzed from far away, annoying.</p><p>Then I heard a stranger whisper, \u201cWhat do you see in that thing? It\u2019s unnatural.\u201d</p><p>I heard gulping and a wistful sigh.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know the voice, but the tone was all too familiar, calling me back to consciousness. There was something to fear there. I kept my breathing even, my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing unnatural about loving someone,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cYou just think it\u2019s unnatural that I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should have been me,\u201d she said. \u201cThirty years ago, when Merissa left you, I was there. And you taught me parlor tricks, chucked me under the chin. I\u2019ve been here all along, waiting. And then she showed up and started hovering over that stupid glass ball, and you insisted on acting like a lovesick child. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweet girl, Tab, but it\u2019s just not to be,\u201d Criminy said, then made a slurping noise and cleared his throat. I was touched by his devotion, but it occurred to me that there was only one thing that he ate, and he had left his blood vials in the lost satchel.</p><p>What on earth were they slurping?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late, you know,\u201d the female said, her voice taking on a sprightly but seductive air.</p><p>Oh, please, I thought, inwardly rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was too late the day she arrived,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cLook, Tab, you\u2019re beautiful and lovely and clever and all, but there\u2019s never been a spark here. You\u2019re going to make some Bludman very happy one day, but it\u2019s never going to be me. You\u2019ve got to get over it, girl. You\u2019ve got to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like you moved on?\u201d she purred. \u201cI remember you, in the days after Merissa left. I remember those nights on the moors. Just you and me on the blud altar under the moon. Those were good times, Crim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was fun,\u201d Criminy said, and I could hear annoyance creeping into his voice. \u201cBut it was nothing more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be. I could end it now. We can both take her.\u201d</p><p>Quick as a snake, there was the odd slap of a scale-covered hand on a hard face.</p><p>\u201cNever speak it,\u201d he growled. \u201cOr I\u2019ll end you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, Tab, I\u2019m curious. How\u2019d you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know I was missing, did you?\u201d she cried. \u201cYou self-centered bastard! Some gypsy king you are, not even knowing when one of your own is gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmerlie said you had a difficult case of ladies\u2019 troubles,\u201d he said, sounding oddly prissy.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t know she was lying? She\u2019s always lying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens between your legs is none of my damned business,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI had other concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran away, if you must know.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cRight after I heard she was to glance on the carnivalleros. I didn\u2019t want her to touch me, vile thing.\u201d</p><p>Criminy chuckled. \u201cDidn\u2019t want her to see your true feelings for me, eh? That\u2019s understandable. But I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t run away to this charming island on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took my carpetbag and followed the tracks back toward Wolvenhampton. I figured I could scratch by for a few decades, wait for your doxy to die off or get old and ugly. But the Coppers found me, just outside the caravan. Two of them and the old man.\u201d</p><p>She went quiet. Criminy waited. I almost opened my eyes and told her to get on with it, already.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nasty character, that Jonah Goodwill. Almost drained me, as you can see. Seemed awfully interested in you and your lady.\u201d She paused, and I heard something snap. It sounded like a bone. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to tell \u2019em everything, but I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture and draining not your bag, kitten?\u201d Criminy asked, and I imagined the quirk in his lips, the humor in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot unless I\u2019m on the other side of the whip,\u201d she whispered, a seductive purr in her voice. I\u2019d had just about enough of the minx, and I\u2019d never even seen her.</p><p>I sat up. But when I opened my eyes, I realized that I had seen her before, although she had looked very different then. It was Sirena, the mermaid from the caravan, but she had legs. Quite a lot of leg, poking out from her dress in ripped fishnet stockings and sky-high heels. And, of course, she was sprawled in the sand, giving Criminy quite an eyeful.</p><p>Even more disturbing, though, were the dead things strewn around in front of the shack. Cows, goats, sheep, a giraffe with an awkwardly bent neck. Not a drop of blood could be seen, and the deflated bodies were all placed calmly, side by side. It was like a grisly slumber party at the San Diego Zoo. I cringed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLetitia, love, how are you?\u201d Criminy asked, reaching to stroke my face.</p><p>The recently tortured but gorgeous blond Bludwoman smirked at me from Criminy\u2019s side. Reading my face, she grinned, showing me all of her sharp little white teeth colored with animal blood. She reminded me of an ermine, something small and sleek that would curl quietly around your neck for years and then one day rip out your eyeball for no good reason.</p><p>\u201cNot so good, actually,\u201d I said, pulling myself to standing and backing away from them toward the shade cast by the shack. I felt my neck, which had one of Criminy\u2019s scarves tied snugly around it. \u201cDid she bite me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, pet, or she\u2019d be dead. She bruised you, and I added the handkerchief so she wouldn\u2019t try it again.\u201d He glowered at her, and she giggled.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I heard your entire conversation. Second of all, how is the mermaid walking?\u201d It seemed a ridiculous question, but it was going to bug me until I knew.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not really a mermaid,\u201d Criminy said, avoiding both of our gazes. \u201cBut little Tabitha Scowl didn\u2019t have an aptitude for anything else at the caravan. She had no place else to go, so I gave her a fake tail and a breathing spell and threw her into a tank of pond water to fool the Pinkies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had an aptitude, but you still wouldn\u2019t take me as apprentice,\u201d she said fiercely, curling her lavender-gloved hands into claws.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Criminy said, grinning. \u201cSomehow I felt I couldn\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImagine that,\u201d I said, backing away. I tripped over the leg of a dead gazelle. Criminy caught me and drew me down to the sand, tucking me into his side and putting his arm around me.</p><p>Across from us, Tabitha stood and dusted the sand off the plum taffeta of her ragged dress. It was ripped at the thigh and burned in places, and the effect was quite alluring. I felt plain and silly in my men\u2019s clothes, and I missed my burgundy dress more than ever.</p><p>She stomped into the shack, kicking up sand. She was dwarfed by the doorway, tiny, probably not even five feet tall.</p><p>\u201cCriminy, is she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA child?\u201d he asked, guessing my question. \u201cShe\u2019s more than a hundred years old. But she was only fourteen when she was turned. Apparently, she didn\u2019t have a glancer to tell her to stay out of dark alleys at night.\u201d</p><p>She stomped right back out, holding a little beaded bag and a dramatic, floppy hat covered in black plumes. Dropping to the ground, she pulled a compact out of the bag and started doing her makeup.</p> <p>\u201cGoodwill and his men left to deal with the burning at Brighton,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cSo when are we leaving?\u201d</p><p>The raft was awfully crowded on the ride back to the sub. For a tiny creature, Tabitha Scowl took up a lot of room.</p><p>Before setting off, we looted the house and found some expensive silver and trinkets to steal but, unfortunately, no secret diary outlining Jonah Goodwill\u2019s evil plans. We didn\u2019t even find a secret door, and, of course, a shallow island couldn\u2019t have a basement. My glance of the cabal in the cellar had definitely been in a city.</p><p>Criminy opened the hatch on the sub, and Tabitha was the first one down the ladder. Personally, I had half a mind to lock her in and take the raft back to civilization.</p><p>\u201cWhen we get to Brighton,\u201d Criminy said to her, \u201cyou\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had it with being a talking fish, anyway.\u201d Then she smiled slyly and said, \u201cAnd who knows? You might change your mind. I can be useful.\u201d</p><p>Then she flounced back into the bedroom and slammed the door shut as loudly as possible, which wasn\u2019t loudly at all. Criminy and I both sighed in relief and slid to the floor. The hallway was so narrow that we sat on opposite sides, knees meeting in the middle. I pinned him with my glare, and he rolled his eyes dramatically.</p><p>\u201cCan I help it if all the young fillies fall for me?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the accent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone here has the accent,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the hair.\u201d</p><p>He moved to my wall and put his arm around my shoulders. \u201cHonestly, love, I\u2019ve been fending off that little minx for years. Had no idea she was so diabolical. If I had, I might have liked her more. Or snapped her neck. Could have gone either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even start,\u201d I said, nudging him. \u201cShe told Goodwill everything. She betrayed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, she betrayed you because she loves me,\u201d he teased. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit endearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stays in Brighton,\u201d I said. \u201cOr I\u2019m throwing you off at the lighthouse, and you can hang out with that ghost for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she could prove helpful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe. Stays. In. Brighton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine. She stays in Brighton,\u201d he said, kissing my forehead before standing and moving to the instrument panel. \u201cSo let\u2019s get there and dump her off on the poor, unsuspecting fools.\u201d</p><p>The trip back was uneventful, especially compared with our previous hours in the submarine. I felt a bit anxious about what had passed between us, and as much as I disliked our new passenger, I was glad to avoid idle hours in the conspicuously useful bedroom. My feelings about him were even more complicated after giving in to his magnetic pull and my own lust. I felt closer to him, but I also felt less like myself. I didn\u2019t know what I needed most: time to think, time to sleep, or time to explore my feelings. Or Criminy\u2019s heart. Or his body.</p><p>Criminy was unusually quiet. I didn\u2019t know if it was because he was worried about me, about finding Goodwill, about dealing with Tabitha, or all of the above. I didn\u2019t want to ask.</p><p>I knew that Criminy had explored the ship, but the only door I\u2019d opened had been the bedroom. It occurred to me that I had eaten nothing but cookies in the past twenty-four hours. No wonder I was so wobbly and emotionally spent. I went straight to the galley.</p><p>A little enameled cube like the one at Antonin\u2019s flat was bolted to the wall. The air within was cold, though, not blood-warm. Inside were chilled tins of strange, thick milk and some shriveled fruit. Behind the sliding doors of the cabinets, I found cans of soup and several packages of ship\u2019s biscuit, which were apparently an ancient form of Pop-Tart constructed entirely of cement.</p><p>I ended up with a bowl of cold, filmy soup, a glass of heavy cream, and tepid fruit salad. The apple was pink inside, and the tangerine was mostly dry. I wasn\u2019t going to try the rock biscuits. I sat down on the stool bolted to the floor and stared at my lunch. My main thought was ick. Probably the same thing Criminy thought when he and Tabitha had feasted on Goodwill\u2019s menagerie. It tasted like crap, but you could live on it.</p><p>After forcing down lunch and finding the bathroom, I curled up on the floor of the hallway and fell asleep. I was only vaguely aware of Criminy gathering me up, depositing me on a small couch, and sliding another paneled door shut, leaving me in the sitting room of the gently purring sub. The kiss I expected on my forehead never came. I slept uneasily the entire way to Brighton.</p><p>I awoke several hours later as the sub ground to a halt. The door to the bedroom was still shut, and I found Criminy alone at the instrument panel. I smiled sleepily and put my head against his shoulder, but he shrugged me off irritably and went to the periscope.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still smoking,\u201d he said with a frown. \u201cEvery ship on the docks is gone, and I can\u2019t see a single living creature.\u201d</p><p>I yawned. \u201cI\u2019m glad they finally had the sense to run away,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Someone could have cut the ships loose, set them adrift to deny the people within an egress. Or they might have been sunken. Or burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe anyone would do that,\u201d I said, although I knew very well that even worse things had been done in my world. \u201cAnd anyway, we\u2019d see chunks of them floating or smoking, and you don\u2019t see any of that, do you?\u201d</p><p>He stepped back silently to offer me the goggles.</p><p>My vision focused, and my jaw dropped. \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>And it was. Heavy smoke billowed up from several large, flaming buildings and a wide swath of devastation on the west side of the city. It was a strategic burning. Black spires of wood stuck up against the gray sky like jagged, broken teeth in sharp contrast to the rest of the city, which appeared unharmed.</p><p>\u201cThe factories,\u201d Criminy said quietly. \u201cAnd Darkside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many people lived here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe fifteen thousand,\u201d he said. \u201cOne-quarter Pinkies to three-quarters Bludmen, almost all working in the factories or indentured. It was a slave city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought that you couldn\u2019t be hurt. As easily as humans, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He laughed bitterly. \u201cOh, no. We can be hurt, and we can die. We burn just as easily as you do. Our blood may be different, but we\u2019re still made of meat. Most of the Bludmen in that city are dead.\u201d</p><p>We heard the bedroom door slither open, and Tabitha strode down the hallway and snatched the periscope from my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dropping me off there,\u201d she said, glancing up at Criminy with a wicked smile. \u201cIt would be tantamount to murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re leaving you in Feverish, which is just a few miles up the road,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t doom you, but I won\u2019t travel far with you, either. And by the way, you\u2019re fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d She cackled. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire me. I quit.\u201d</p><p>Criminy tapped on the instrument panel, turning dials and flicking switches. I felt a soft pull as the sub changed course.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going around the city. We\u2019ll walk the moors to Feverish and find a way back to Manchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if Goodwill\u2019s still in Brighton?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll beat him home and wait it out,\u201d Criminy said firmly. \u201cSomething tells me the old codger likes his comfort and his safety. He\u2019ll only stay in Brighton long enough to foist the clean-up on somebody else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a good decision. I was grateful that we hadn\u2019t tried the docks. Even as our raft neared a lonely beach farther down the coast, I could still smell the smoke of the smoldering city, and it smelled like barbecue and winter fires. I salivated for a second before I remembered the source of the tantalizing smell, then I threw up over the side of the raft before we reached land.</p><p>Tabitha snickered. \u201cShe\u2019s a tough one, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it to yourself, lass, unless you want a tender shove,\u201d he said, but he grinned.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind a tender shove from you,\u201d she purred.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t tender things I\u2019m picturing, Tab.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a dazzling smile and licked her fangs. He chuckled.</p><p>I was more than a little amazed. Was he actually flirting with the murderous harpy?</p><p>I wiped my mouth and huddled in the bottom of the raft, miserable.</p> <p>Out of irritation, I didn\u2019t offer to tow the raft through the deadly salty sea, but the breaking waves did it for me. We were tossed up onto the beach with a crash, and Criminy hopped out to drag me onto the sand. Tabitha leaped nimbly to the ground and strutted toward the moors. His eyes followed her ass as I heaved and choked at his feet.</p><p>I apparently had a rival, and Criminy didn\u2019t seem to mind as much as before.</p><p>I was a lot more bothered than I wanted to be.</p><p>It was half a day\u2019s walk to Feverish, which was unchanged. No fires, no influx of new citizens or inn visitors, which proved Criminy\u2019s point. The Bludmen of Brighton were gone. We were grim and waterlogged when the same young boy ran to greet us. I had remained sullen and silent the whole way as Criminy and Tabitha chatted and flirted. He held the door open for her, and she let it slam on me. I barely had the energy or the will to catch it. And then we stood before Master Haggard.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a vacancy, sir?\u201d asked Criminy as if they had never met.</p><p>\u201cWe do, lad,\u201d the old man replied. \u201cHow many rooms?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree, please,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cIf you\u2019ll accept this as payment.\u201d</p><p>I was surprised to feel my heart drop like a stone. Three? As Criminy pulled a handful of Goodwill\u2019s engraved silver from his waistcoat and Master Haggard nodded solemnly, my mind was racing. Three rooms? What was he doing?</p><p>And why did I care so much? Just because he made my toes curl in bed didn\u2019t mean that I loved him or that we\u2019d made any promises.</p><p>If Tabitha was feeling victorious, it didn\u2019t show. In fact, she looked more annoyed than ever. But we both followed resignedly as Master Haggard showed us to three rooms in a row on the long hall. Criminy took the center room. Tabitha and I glared daggers at each other. It felt like a middle-school field trip, and I was the dork in braces.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Criminy called softly as he shut his door.</p><p>My door and Tabitha\u2019s door slammed shut at the same moment.</p><p>In the pitch-black early morning, my door shivered open. I rose from my dreams smiling.</p><p>He had come back to me.</p> <p>I moved over on the bed to make room for him, hoping that the darkness hid my relief and girlish giddiness. I didn\u2019t want to seem too eager.</p><p>The door shut softly. I couldn\u2019t see his shadow or hear his footsteps. Had he just checked on me and gone back into the hall?</p><p>\u201cCriminy?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>And then a glove clapped over my nose and mouth, driving my head into the pillow.</p><p>\u201cDid you actually think it would work?\u201d came the fierce whisper.</p><p>I struggled, shaking my head back and forth, but the glove\u2019s pressure didn\u2019t lessen. I whimpered against the soft leather and started to buck and thrash in panic. I couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Tabitha\u2019s face appeared inches from mine, her eyes feral with fury.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what spell you used, but I\u2019m going to drain you for taking him away from me,\u201d she growled, a sound so low that I could barely hear it. The scent of copper and death and raw meat rolled off her, and I tried not to gag.</p><p>I flung my bare hands up, clawing for her eyes and raking across her cheeks with my pointed nails. When I touched her skin, the jolt came unbidden, and the surprise made me bite down on her hand through the glove.</p><p>No wonder she hadn\u2019t wanted to touch me, before or later. He\u2019d have flayed her alive for this.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t actually been captured by Jonah Goodwill. She had sought him out as soon as I arrived, a Stranger with an unusual gift. She was helping the Coppers in return for money and leniency when he unleashed his genocide on her people. She was a spy, a decoy, and an assassin.</p><p>But she was supposed to kill Criminy, not me.</p><p>I sank my teeth in deeper, hoping to hear her bones crack.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bite me, you little bitch!\u201d she shrieked, and then she gasped when she realized how loudly her screech had rung out in the sleeping inn.</p><p>Doors banged open in the hallway, and footsteps pounded to my door. Tabitha scanned the room in terror, ripped the window open, and leaped out, trailing the long bustle of her dress behind her. All I could do was lie on the bed, gulping for air and trying not to pass out, because I had expressly forbidden myself to do that again.</p><p>Seconds later, Criminy cradled me in his arms. Master Haggard leaned out the window in a long gray nightshirt, his basset-hound eyes penetrating the dark.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d Criminy said with finality, and he held me closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, little love,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I shivered for an hour in his arms before falling asleep against his chest, and I had restless dreams until dawn broke, red and streaky through the open window.</p><p>27</p><p>Criminy was furious with himself, and I couldn\u2019t get him to calm down.</p><p>\u201cHow did I not know?\u201d he fumed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you were a little focused on me and the locket,\u201d I said patiently. \u201cAnd the ghost, and Brighton, and Erris, and the caravan. And the genocide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the damned witch put a love spell on me, and I didn\u2019t even notice. Slipped it right into my pocket, probably while we were feeding on the island.\u201d</p><p>He showed me a little bag of plum taffeta, torn from her skirt, tied with long blond hairs. It was light in my hand, and I felt tiny bones inside and something soft.</p><p>\u201cBird bones, moor grass, rose thorns, and my hair,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cProbably skinked a look in my own grimoire when I wasn\u2019t looking. A love spell.\u201d He snorted. \u201cThree rooms. I should have known then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d asked for two rooms and taken her into yours, I would have pitched an unholy fit,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut I thought ... Well, it doesn\u2019t matter what I thought. It\u2019s over now. Let\u2019s just get to Manchester as fast as we can. Before she can get to Goodwill.\u201d</p><p>He seemed more than happy to let it go. Travel was problem enough.</p><p>Erris was long gone, of course. Luckily, Master Haggard said that the village had an archaic but serviceable conveyance and that we were welcome to rent it for ten vials of my blood. With Brighton in flames, times were going to be lean in Feverish. I kept reminding myself that ten vials was less than it sounded like, that I had drawn just as much from my infirm patients. Still, as soon as Criminy had drawn the blood, I felt light-headed. I hoped the transportation was worth it.</p><p>When Master Haggard threw open the creaking doors to an old stable to show us the conveyance, I couldn\u2019t help laughing. I had envisioned tanks, mopeds, miniature trains, even an electric horse. But in a throwback to my own world, there sat an old-fashioned, fairy-tale carriage in silver and rust-dotted light blue. It looked a little like a four-legged octopus. All it needed was a team of white horses and a footman, and I would have felt like Cinderella. But where the horses should have been was air, and on the back was a big brass box with a large key on it.</p><p>Criminy and Master Haggard rolled it into the weak sunshine and stood on the box to wind and wind and wind the key, just like a music box. The further it went, the harder it was to wind. Both men were panting and sweating as the tension increased. Finally, they let go, and Criminy helped me through the heart-shaped blue door onto a dusty velvet bench. He hopped in beside me and grasped the brass steering wheel in both hands.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Master Haggard,\u201d he called.</p><p>The old man stood back with a slow, doleful wave, calling, \u201cGood luck, lad. Keep her safe. And don\u2019t forget that spells work both ways, the Drawing included. She\u2019ll pay her own price, in time.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand his final words, but he made it sound like I was under a curse instead of a charm. Then he lifted a vial of my blood to his lips and drank, eyes closed in pleasure. Which was creepy. I was not at all sad to see the last of the little town of Feverish.</p><p>Criminy pulled a lever, and the carriage whirred into life and rumbled along the dirt road on rickety wheels. Through the glass windshield, the road ahead seemed to stretch forever, like a brown ribbon among the moors.</p><p>For the first few hours, we chugged along in silence. I was weak from losing so much blood, and Criminy, I think, felt helpless and wounded for having used me as a mule yet again. With his bag lost in the ashes of Brighton and no crowds to amaze for a handful of copper coins, I was the only ATM in the area. And we were both concerned about Tabitha Scowl.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said at last. \u201cGoodwill hired her to kill you and kidnap me. But she was a heartbeat away from draining me and running away to the caravan with you. Like you wouldn\u2019t have noticed that I was gone. And like Goodwill wouldn\u2019t have hunted her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove makes fools of us all, darling, and love spells are sneaky,\u201d he said. \u201cThey prey upon your baser instincts and natural inclinations. Eventually, I would have believed it myself. With you gone, with that in my pocket, with her nearby ... in time, I would have loved her. Damn her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you get three rooms instead of two?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take her with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the spell wasn\u2019t done correctly. Maybe she was too weak. Maybe you and I, what we have\u2014maybe that\u2019s too strong. It\u2019s hard to remember now. It was all muddled. Like being drunk, maybe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad,\u201d I said as evenly as possible. \u201cShe probably would have betrayed you, in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said with a sideways smile. \u201cShe probably would have. Not that you\u2019re jealous or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about the facts,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd she would have smelled like fish.\u201d</p> <p>He burst out with that overly loud laugh, and I had to join in. It was pretty funny, from a certain perspective. A love triangle with a magician, a fortune-teller, and a professional mermaid, two of whom drank blood and one of whom was an alien from another world.</p><p>Laughing like that lightened the mood considerably. I think we both felt a little like idiots. One of his hands crept over to hold mine, but then the carriage lurched over a rock, and he needed both hands to keep us on track.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to keep doing this,\u201d I said, \u201cbut can I take a little nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou went four days without sleep, then you swam a mile and got gnawed on by beasties, then you were nearly scared to death by a ghost, then you were ravaged by a suitor in a submarine, and then you were nearly murdered twice by a vicious, lying spy. Oh, and then you lost a couple of cups of blood on your way to go face an evil Copper.\u201d</p><p>I giggled. He had a point.</p> <p>\u201cYes, sweet tangerine. I\u2019d say you deserve a nap.\u201d</p><p>We had to stop several times to rewind the key. The first winding lasted the longest. Criminy alone wasn\u2019t strong enough to wind it all the way again, and I was too weak to be helpful. I slept through most of the journey, waking only when the grating noise of the winding key dragged me up from dreams. Each time, I collapsed back onto the seat after swigging some tepid water from my canteen or munching on stale shortbread cookies that Master Haggard had found in some old luggage. I did wake up once with the frantic need to pee, only to run screaming out of the copse with my shirt untucked, trailed by a madly chittering family of ravenous bludsquirrels.</p><p>When night fell, we stopped to build a fire. Criminy caught and roasted a bludbunny for me, and I tried not to swallow it whole. We sat on old logs, warming our hands at the merry flames, and Criminy told me Sangish fairy tales and little stories from his childhood in Devlin. He was such a natural entertainer that I nearly forgot my problems. It was easy to lose myself in his words, following along with laughter and tears and imagining him as a child, handsome and mischievous on the streets of a far-off city.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>With a grin, he danced and did magic tricks and sang a plaintive lullaby in the low, slurry tongue of the Bludmen. He made shadow puppets against the smoke and threw glitter that made the fire glow blue, and when I looked at his eager smile, I was overcome with adoration and gratitude. I was beginning to think that there was nothing he couldn\u2019t do. Here we were, on the road, on the run, and he could make me feel as if we were kids on a camping trip. It was a valuable gift, and not his only one.</p><p>\u201cEnough, love. Plenty of time for making merry. But tonight you need more sleep,\u201d he finally said.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m having fun,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want tomorrow to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to pretend, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, reading my mind. \u201cThat this is all there is? To be in the moment, without a care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say. Easy things aren\u2019t worth much,\u201d I said with a rueful smile, holding out my hand.</p><p>\u201cYour hand in mine is worth a great deal, Letitia,\u201d he said, helping me to my feet. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll be fighting for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>For my own safety, we slept just off the road in our carriage, crushed together at odd angles. I was afraid it would be awkward, but we were so dusty and exhausted that we crumpled into a companionable heap and went insensible after a kiss as brief and bright as a snuffed match.</p><p>The next morning, I woke with my head on his shoulder, smiling. My dreams had been peaceful, all twilight and twining vineyards and far-off music like his Bludman\u2019s lullaby. In my dream, he taught me how to conjure a butterfly. I didn\u2019t want to wake up. But I did anyway, because I felt as if our time was somehow running out.</p><p>As I yawned, Criminy\u2019s eyes popped open, and he reached out to stroke my cheek. I smiled back at him as he sat up to stretch.</p><p>\u201cTime to beat back the bunny hordes,\u201d he said gallantly, knowing that any blood-hungry animals in the area would be waiting outside for a taste of me.</p> <p>He threw open the door, shouting, \u201cBunnies, prepare to meet your doom!\u201d</p><p>He froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he said, his voice low.</p><p>He stepped down from the carriage and shut the door in my face. I peeked through the curtains and found myself in awe, yet again, that Sang could be so impossibly bizarre.</p><p>Dozens of bludbunnies surrounded our carriage, all dead. Parked on the opposite side of the road was an old-fashioned gypsy wagon hooked up to a white bludmare, her grizzled head hanging dejectedly. The sign nailed to the faded red wagon read, Madam Burial\u2019s Snake Oils: Liniments, Salves, Potions, and Tinctures for Ev\u2019ry Malady of Boddy and Spirit. The wagon was locked up tight, and the driver\u2019s box was empty. Someone swung gently in a hammock chair on a little back porch, a thin stream of smoke billowing from a long pipe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d called a rich, husky voice.</p><p>\u201cI see you changed your last name, Hepzibah,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cMerrywell didn\u2019t suit,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least it almost rhymes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, madam,\u201d he said, his voice tired and annoyed. \u201cWhat more do you require?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf you? Nothing,\u201d she said. The shape in the chair unfolded and stood in a haze of smoke. I couldn\u2019t see her face from my window, but somehow I knew that she was staring right at me. The pipe pointed in my direction. \u201cIt\u2019s her as needs something. Is it not so?\u201d</p><p>Criminy turned to look at me, his face pained and resigned. \u201cLetitia, love. Would you come speak with us, please?\u201d</p><p>Another mysterious woman from Criminy\u2019s past. How did they all manage to find him? When I had touched him the first time, I had seen only the future, not his speckled history, and I was beginning to think that was a good thing.</p><p>With my back straight and my chin up, I walked to Criminy\u2019s side. He took my hand and squeezed it. \u201cLetitia, my love, this is Madam Hepzibah Burial. She\u2019s the one who gave me the spell for your locket.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so a late-turned Bludwoman, then. Up close, her face was like that of an old woman whose wrinkles had been erased and softened or maybe smudged with wax. She had drawn sweeping black cat\u2019s eyes over her lids, and her lips were deep burgundy. Her hair was in long dreadlocks of black and red, and she was entirely covered by a wool cloak.</p><p>\u201cHello, my dear,\u201d she said with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answered. Criminy squeezed my hand. I said no more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost your locket,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was careless of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was stolen,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cWe are currently en route to retrieve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the only way, Stranger,\u201d she said to me. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>She ducked into her wagon. With a loud crack, the shutters flew open under the sign. Leaning through the window, framed by shelves of magical-looking bottles and objects, she crossed her arms on the counter and smiled like a hungry crocodile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, little Pinky,\u201d she purred. \u201cMadam Burial knows what you need.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Criminy, trying to project my extreme doubt and bone-deep fear into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, love,\u201d he said, resigned. \u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>I walked up to the window and stopped just beyond arm\u2019s reach. Criminy leaned against the wagon, feigning amusement, but I could see the tension in his jaw and the anger in his eyes. The man certainly didn\u2019t like a foxhole without an emergency exit. We were apparently stuck with the old broad until she decided otherwise.</p><p>Madam Burial placed a dainty glass bottle on the counter, and her mouth twitched in grim amusement. \u201cSee that, Dorothy? That\u2019s your ticket home. Those are your ruby slippers, right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe speaks in riddles,\u201d Criminy muttered. \u201cSometimes I think she actually believes them.\u201d</p><p>But I knew exactly what she meant, of course. Any Stranger would.</p><p>\u201cBefore I click my heels three times, what\u2019s the catch?\u201d I asked, and she chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou learn quickly, Letitia. The catch is this: it takes two people. You can\u2019t go alone. The spell only works with two people holding hands, a complete circle. So you can take your fine magician there, or you can take ... someone else.\u201d She said this last bit with a sly wink and added, \u201cI laid out the cards. You\u2019ve stolen two hearts in our strange land. You work fast.\u201d</p><p>I was flustered, and Criminy glared at the Bludwoman with disgust.</p><p>\u201cSo the harpsichordist is infatuated with her,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cHe\u2019s insignificant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo say you,\u201d she shot back. \u201cBut she can give him back his life, take him home to Grandma. She can take back her safe, comfortable world. She doesn\u2019t need your land of lies and blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what she needs,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cHow does it work?\u201d I asked, and Criminy turned to me, taking both my hands.</p><p>\u201cLetitia, love, you can\u2019t seriously be considering a bargain with this monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one,\u201d she said, puffing on her pipe.</p><p>\u201cYou bargained with her once,\u201d I said. \u201cI just want to know my options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works like this,\u201d she said. \u201cIn return for a small token, I give you this bottle. When you\u2019re ready to go home, you take the potion into your mouth and kiss your chosen companion, sharing and swallowing it while holding both hands. Then you say exactly where you want to go, and you\u2019re there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the small token?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this: tell me my fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can give me a potion that\u2019ll take me to another world, but you can\u2019t tell your own future?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cOne day, you\u2019ll learn that power doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d she said with another deep chuckle. \u201cEvery time I lay my cards, I draw the Witch.

And my palms are smooth as glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell your future.\u201d</p><p>Criminy broke in, almost pleading. \u201cLetitia, love, there\u2019s bound to be a catch. A trick. She won\u2019t give you something for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlancing isn\u2019t nothing,\u201d I said, my hackles rising. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable talent. You said so yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very valuable,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut there\u2019s something else she wants, or it wouldn\u2019t be so simple.\u201d</p> <p>We had a little staring contest, each willing the other to give in. I refused to drop my eyes. What Madam Burial wanted seemed a simple enough request. He just didn\u2019t want me to have that potion. And it wasn\u2019t even that I wanted it so badly, not really. I just wanted my own bolt hole, my escape hatch in case the locket was broken or gone forever. I wanted a choice.</p><p>I took off my glove, and Madam Burial smiled like a vulture folding its wings over a carcass.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her!\u201d Criminy snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Love, she tricked me once, and she won\u2019t let you go so easily. I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell her what to do, Master Stain,\u201d she warned. \u201cYour sweet little kitten doesn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Caught between the two of them, I was furious. And I wasn\u2019t about to back down.</p><p>Madam Burial took off her black lace glove, and her scaled hand hovered in the air, waiting. I grasped it and gasped. The jolt was explosive and strange, a black vortex drawing me in deeply. I dropped her hand as if it was on fire and staggered backward.</p> <p>Criminy was there immediately, his arms around me, asking, \u201cAre you all right, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d Madam Burial asked, her tone conversational and teasing.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you take?\u201d I said, my voice low and dark. I had a sudden vision of what it would be like to rip her throat out with my blunt little Pinky teeth.</p><p>\u201cJust five years,\u201d she said. \u201cA pittance. I\u2019m surprised you even noticed. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>She giggled, a high, mad sound. The hair on my arms rose.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you feel it, little kitten? Doesn\u2019t time here seem to run fast for you? Haven\u2019t you noticed the crow\u2019s feet marching across your face? That locket draws the years from you as surely as my hands. You\u2019ll wither in his arms yet, if you don\u2019t make your choice soon. Or break the locket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true, Criminy?\u201d I asked, my ungloved fingers going automatically to my face, to the tiny ridges that I was sure hadn\u2019t been there yesterday, that maybe hadn\u2019t been there five minutes ago. \u201cAm I really older?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a catch, my love,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re beautiful to me, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>So I couldn\u2019t have both worlds, both lives. I\u2019d seen it all in that desperately dark and dizzying glance. The locket was stealing my life, taking my time, drawing my youth and transferring it to the witch as I aged supernaturally fast. I was going to have to choose, and choose soon. It all came down to the potion, the blud, or the locket. Every moment I spent in Sang as a human meant that I grew older faster. My dream of having everything was gone, replaced by images of my hair turning gray with a locket around my neck and a forever-young lover in my arms.</p><p>And then there was Criminy\u2019s glance, which made a little more sense now.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter. The witch was going to pay.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell your fortune,\u201d I said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw nothing,\u201d she said, drawing up and pulling her cloak tightly around her.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d I said.</p><p>Pushing away from Criminy, I rubbed my temples and stretched my shoulders, feeling tired to the bone. When I stepped up to the counter, Madam Burial looked just a little more lively, the lines on her face smoother and her smug smile brimming with joy at having bested me. But underneath it, I could tell that she was just a little bit scared of me. Good.</p><p>I snatched the little bottle off the counter and looked her dead in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI know how you die. It\u2019s going to hurt. And you don\u2019t have long,\u201d I said.</p><p>The horror in her eyes made me smile as I grabbed Criminy\u2019s hand and dragged him back across the road.</p><p>As I stepped into the conveyance, I called over my shoulder, \u201cAnd watch out for flying monkeys, you old bitch!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop staring at myself in the mirror Criminy had dug out of his waistcoat. Was that my first wrinkle, or had I just slept on my arm? Were the bags under my eyes from exhaustion or dehydration or something more sinister?</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be thirty-one,\u201d I moaned.</p><p>Criminy glanced at me lovingly and said, \u201cDarling, you don\u2019t look a day over twenty-six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I fell for it. You told me there would be a catch, but I was just so certain that I knew what I was doing. I let her steal five years of my life. Five years, gone in seconds.\u201d I sighed. \u201cAnd as long as the locket\u2019s around, I\u2019m getting older even faster. I didn\u2019t even get to have a big party for turning thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nearly a century older than you are, if it makes you feel any better,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you actually don\u2019t look a day over twenty-five,\u201d I said wistfully. \u201cI guess being a Bludman has its advantages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to think so,\u201d he said with his most dashing grin. \u201cBut there\u2019s still plenty of time for that. The important thing is that you have what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the little bottle. I didn\u2019t really want it. But I didn\u2019t want him to know that. And I wasn\u2019t ready to admit that I had given up five years of my life just to feel independent and strong.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I said.</p><p>I hoped I would never run into Madam Burial again.</p><p>But of course, I knew I would.</p><p>After that, we met no travelers on the road. I fell into an uneasy sleep until a giant bus tank passed us. We had to veer off the road in response to its vicious honking. The driver, just a pair of goggles behind the dirty windshield, would have mowed us down without a thought.</p><p>\u201cFoolish Pinkies fleeing Brighton, no doubt,\u201d Criminy muttered. \u201cRun over their own grandmothers to get to safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDurgoin da Manblaster?\u201d I slurred, still half-asleep.</p><p>\u201cYes, love,\u201d Criminy said with a smile. \u201cThey\u2019re probably going to Manchester. For all we know, Jonah Goodwill is throwing a ball to celebrate, and they want to shake his hand.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my eyes and sat up with a jaw-cracking yawn. \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Criminy pulled out his compass with one hand, and the carriage jiggled all over the road.</p><p>\u201cBugger,\u201d he said, shoving the little brass object back into his pocket. \u201cI can\u2019t tell for certain. I\u2019d guess we\u2019re an hour or so from the caravan. It\u2019ll be good to be home, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said archly, \u201cit would be great to be home. With my grandmother and my cat. Which is why we\u2019re going to Manchester now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart, but our first stop\u2019s the caravan.\u201d With both hands on the wheel, he gave me a quick grin and shrugged. \u201cI have my responsibilities, and they might have news. And we need to get cleaned up before we head into the city. You\u2019ll scandalize the kingdom in that get-up, if the rats don\u2019t get to you first.\u201d</p><p>He had a point. But that didn\u2019t mean I liked it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sulk, precious,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cBut speaking of the dangers ahead, there\u2019s something I need to ask you.\u201d</p><p>I waited. His fingers drummed on the steering wheel. It was as close as I\u2019d ever seen him to nervous and fidgety.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no good way to put it. But do you want to be bludded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you no,\u201d I said patiently. \u201cI appreciate the thought, but I\u2019m not ready to go that route yet. No eternal kiss for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEternal kiss?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a bunch of poppycock. It\u2019s simply practical. It would be so much safer if you were a predator instead of a delicious little morsel. We\u2019re about to go into a city where there\u2019s a price on your head and try to sneak into the well-guarded house of a very powerful man to steal a magical object\u2014which is all in a day\u2019s work for me, of course. But you could be killed. And worrying about you being killed makes me more likely to get us both killed. And there are still plenty of things around here that want to eat you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you put it that way,\u201d I answered, \u201cI guess it is pretty practical. But here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t know what would happen when I got back to my world. If I would be my world\u2019s first Bludwoman or a vampire or a corpse. I\u2019m not going to risk it, even if it would make life a lot easier here.\u201d Aiming for silly, I added, \u201cBesides, blood\u2019s icky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Letitia,\u201d he mused, but I could hear pain lurking underneath. \u201cWill you ever accept that this is serious? Do you think me a schoolboy, mooning after a pretty lass? I wonder if you even care for me. If you\u2019re just toying with my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit acting soft,\u201d I muttered. \u201cQuit playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re the one who\u2019s playing,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is pain. And you\u2019re the only one who sees it,\u201d he said more softly. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can cut me, and you wound me deep.\u201d</p><p>I watched him for a moment, his jaw clenched as he gripped the steering wheel, as if his will and his hands were the only things holding the conveyance together and keeping it on the road. His eyes were focused far ahead, and he let out the saddest sigh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can tell you care for me,\u201d he said. \u201cYour smile, your touch, your trust. The way you rouse to me. But your feelings are incomplete. Like there\u2019s some missing piece I can\u2019t puzzle out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do care for you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIn my own way.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly, let that sink in. But then his jaw tightened. \u201cAnd what way is that?\u201d he shot back. \u201cYou\u2019re not a little girl playing dress-up. You can\u2019t just float along, letting things happen to you. You have to choose, Letitia. Once we find the locket, you have to choose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not thinking that far ahead,\u201d I said. \u201cI need more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cAnd I want to know. Once you have the locket, will you go back to your world and leave me with a frail, insensible body that will wither and die here? Will you break the locket, will you take my blud? Or will you go back and forth, never sleeping, until you grow old or go mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting that I could leave now if I wanted to,\u201d I said. Here he was, trying to force me into making a choice.How could he know me so well and not understand what he was doing? \u201cI have the potion. I could take you back, or him. It\u2019s my choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. And what will you choose?\u201d</p><p>I turned away. My eyes scanned the horizon, watching the never-ending grasses flow into hills and mountains, a world hazy around the edges where the sky always hung too low. There was an entire world here at my fingertips, and I\u2019d only seen one small corner. Somewhere, far across these grasses, a beautiful man from my own world waited for me, filled with hope and playing familiar songs on a harpsichord and aching for the life he\u2019d lost. And somewhere, even farther away, Nana waited, her time being stolen even more surely than mine.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you now,\u201d I said.</p><p>He had given me three choices, and I had added two more. I didn\u2019t like a single one of them.</p><p>But then again, I\u2019d already seen the future, and it grew darker with every glance.</p><p>28</p><p>Something was wrong. Criminy had grown more and more agitated as we rumbled north, but now he was downright twitchy. And he wouldn\u2019t put down the spyglass, even though he could barely control the jittering conveyance with one hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked when I couldn\u2019t stand the tense silence anymore.</p> <p>\u201cThe wagons are still circled. The caravan hasn\u2019t moved,\u201d he said. \u201cMy orders were to follow the schedule, and they should be on the way to Liverpool by now.\u201d</p><p>I could see it then, the far-off shadows against the cloudy sky. I had a feeling of homecoming that surprised me, and I thought of the comforts of my wagon. I actually missed the wallpaper. And the thought of my own little basin of water to wash in and a soft, silk-covered bed ... oh, it was heaven on wheels.</p><p>The conveyance, unfortunately, had only two speeds: stop and go. The traveling speed depended entirely on the tension in the winding key, and we were near the end of a round, so it was taking a painfully long time to climb the last hill.</p><p>Finally, he jerked the conveyance off the road and pulled the brake. It shuddered to a halt, and we jumped out and ran through the thick, stringy grass. Not a single figure lurked outside the caravan. It was eerie.</p><p>Something dark moved toward us across the moor, and I saw Criminy\u2019s arm swing into motion. But he didn\u2019t go for the bolus or the knife in his boot. He just held his arm out, palm open. With a coppery flash, Pemberly swung onto his shoulder by her tail.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just sit there, Pem. Assess!\u201d he said peevishly, and she swung back down and hurtled toward the caravan. It was amazing to me how he always remembered to use her. I guess it was like me and the watch I wore to check a patient\u2019s blood pressure or tell time. I was so accustomed to seeing her on his shoulder that he had seemed a little incomplete without her on the last leg of our journey.</p><p>My little Uro had only come in handy once so far, and that was all Criminy\u2019s doing. I had been too busy peeing myself in the locked lighthouse to think about my robot guardian\u2019s door-unlocking capabilities. The bracelet bumped against my wrist, useless for now.</p><p>The ground around the wagons was trampled. Big crowds had been there. But no one was practicing now, as they should have been. The clockworks were motionless between the wagons, their eyes open and unseeing. All was quiet. And that wasn\u2019t good.</p> <p>Criminy veered left, and I followed him to Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s wagon. He paused in front of the steps, panting, and regained his composure before knocking politely. I was in much worse shape, doubled over, huffing and puffing in my stained, torn men\u2019s clothes.</p><p>We waited by the door. Nothing happened. Not a sound came from within, and the lack of her customary shrill reception was ominous. Criminy tried the handle, and the door squeaked open.</p><p>The room was always a jumble, but it had recently been the site of a struggle. Dress forms were toppled over, pools of fabric and pincushions sprawled in front of the broken mirror.</p><p>Criminy closed his eyes and sniffed. \u201cPinkies,\u201d he said. \u201cCoppers.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Pemberly skittered into the room, her tail high. Criminy swung her up onto his shoulder, and she opened her mouth. A thin white ribbon inched out and curled under her chin. Criminy ripped the paper and read, \u201cLiving: 19. Dead: 0. Blood: 0 ml. Caravan: Safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t seem bloody safe, and we\u2019re missing twelve and a half,\u201d he muttered, tossing the paper to the ground.</p><p>\u201cTwelve and a half?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCatarrh and Quincy are gone. Two heads, one body.\u201d</p><p>We poked around the wagon but couldn\u2019t find any clues amid the destruction. Without speaking, we walked back outside and headed in the same direction, toward the dining car. As we passed Emerlie and Veruca\u2019s wagon, there was a subtle scrape from within, and Criminy had his ear to the lime-green wall in an instant.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s inside,\u201d he said softly, motioning me to the little wedge of space between two wagons next to Cadmus the cassowary. As I hid behind the still form of the giant brass bird, he knocked on the door and called, \u201cLadies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d came the harsh cawing from within. Emerlie, of course.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Criminy Stain,\u201d he said. \u201cOpen the door, Em.\u201d</p><p>The door flew open so quickly it almost smacked him in the face, and Emerlie came very close to throwing herself into his arms. At the last moment, her lifelong prejudice kept her from seeking shelter in the comforting embrace of her boss the bloodsucker.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir, I\u2019m that glad to see you!\u201d she cried. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d he asked, but of course, she ignored that.</p><p>\u201cOh, and that lady of yours, sir? Did the Coppers get her? Or is she dead? That poor lass, I told her, I told her to be careful. But she didn\u2019t listen a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetitia, come out,\u201d he called.</p><p>When I stepped out from my hiding place in my rumpled men\u2019s clothes and waved sheepishly, Emerlie\u2019s jaw dropped, but she ran to hug me just the same. Any port in a storm, I guessed. I patted her awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awful, what they did,\u201d she said, sniffling.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did they do?\u201d Criminy asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Coppers, sir. They showed up and demanded you and the papers, and they went to see Mrs. Cleavers, and they had a dreadful row. Said our papers wasn\u2019t no good. There was an awful fight in her wagon, and she was howling and cursing like mad as they trussed her up and carried her away. And then all the other Bludmen ran off, afeared the Coppers would take them, too. So the show\u2019s been closed down, and we\u2019ve all been hiding in our wagons. Waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting for what?\u201d he asked with that peculiar ability of his to be furious and amused at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d she said, baffled.</p><p>Then she spotted something over Criminy\u2019s shoulder, and her face went from worried to relieved to excited to ashamed. Criminy and I both followed her glance and saw a slight man walking toward us through the grass.</p><p>\u201cCharlie Dregs!\u201d Criminy called. \u201cYou old goat! Where have you been hiding?\u201d</p><p>The young Bludman I had seen below Emerlie\u2019s tightrope on my first day had eyes only for her, but he clasped Criminy\u2019s hand and nodded to me politely.</p><p>\u201cI was keeping watch,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next copse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody else with you, lad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cJust me. Had to make sure Em was safe. Nasty Coppers. Ain\u2019t right, what they done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you, Charlie,\u201d Emerlie said softly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled, and nodded.</p><p>Veruca appeared in the doorway and raised an eyebrow at the four of us in front of her wagon, saying with her odd accent, \u201cWhat is this, springtime for odd couples? Go and make love on someone else\u2019s porch. It is a troubled time.\u201d</p><p>Criminy sent Emerlie and Charlie to gather everyone left in the caravan for a meeting in the dining car. The Pinkies were worried, but the food helped to settle us. Criminy deposited me with Emerlie and her friends and went out to search for any other lurking Bludmen. We needed all the help we could get.</p><p>As Emerlie chattered on about how upset she was that her new suit hadn\u2019t been complete when Mrs. Cleavers disappeared, my wandering gaze fell on Casper, who was sitting alone at the other end of the car. He motioned me over, and, without making apologies, I went. Emerlie didn\u2019t even halt in her prattle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back safe,\u201d he said with a devastating smile. The warm look in his eyes almost made me forget the misstep of our last conversation. \u201cI was so worried about you. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was definitely an adventure,\u201d I said, feeling my shoulders relax, the tension uncoiling. There was just something about him, like being in the presence of a movie star. Like the sun was shining only on me when he smiled. \u201cWe were chased out of Manchester, we saw a ghost, I got bitten by a sea monster, we rode in a submarine. You know, the usual.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSang is what would happen if my bookshelf threw up,\u201d he said.</p><p>I giggled but quickly turned serious. We were short on time, as it always seemed when I was around Casper. These golden moments were all too brief. I had to know his feelings before Criminy came back.</p><p>\u201cWould you go back if you could?\u201d I asked him.</p> <p>He seemed surprised by the question, as if he actually hadn\u2019t considered it. \u201cThat would depend on what I had to go back for,\u201d he said, studying his hands. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be paralyzed or anything. It doesn\u2019t really matter what world I\u2019m in if I can\u2019t play the piano. There\u2019d be no point to life without my music. But sure, I\u2019d go back, if everything could be the way it was before the accident. Or better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if you had to stay here?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how much was riding on the conversation, but I only had a few minutes to solve my existential crisis and make some of the biggest decisions of my life.</p><p>\u201cI like it here, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are different rules. I\u2019m only missing a family, people to care about, and I think I could have that, if everything worked out the way I\u2019d like it to.\u201d Another smoldering smile made me blush. \u201cI may say the wrong thing sometimes, but my heart is in the right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would you rather stay with the caravan or live in the city?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe caravan is fine for me, but the only safe place for women and children is in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes I think about it, about owning a theater or starting the first piano bar.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved to travel. I\u2019ll find a keyboard wherever I go, but there\u2019s no point in being pinned down unless there\u2019s someone really amazing pinning me down. Someone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not the name I go by.\u201d</p><p>The warmth and naked longing in his voice drew me in. I leaned closer. Our eyes met.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d I said as he touched my cheek.</p><p>There was a gentle jolt, soft as waking up in a sunbeam.</p> <p>I saw us holding hands, drinking the potion, waking up. I saw us in his town home enjoying a sunny morning, sharing a pot of coffee and the newspaper, sprawled on the couch with my feet in his lap. I saw him playing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on the piano, singing to my grandmother, all of us wearing ridiculous hats, me holding a cake glimmering with candles over a gently swollen belly. I saw his cousin\u2019s room painted over blue, a nursery, and a tiny, serious boy with brown hair sitting in his father\u2019s lap with a toy keyboard and a stuffed rabbit. I saw myself, an old woman with short hair, standing before a store window, one wrinkled hand pressed to the glass. Inside the store, a gold and ruby locket glinted, and tears of remorse streaked down my withered face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>I realized that my cheeks were wet, and I shook my head. I couldn\u2019t tell him. And that was part of the problem. But I had one more question. \u201cSo what do you think I should do?\u201d I asked finally. \u201cAssuming I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even have to think about it. \u201cStay here with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>He slid his hands across the table, trapping one of my own. It made me feel claustrophobic, and I tugged at the grimy neck of my shirt with my free hand.</p><p>\u201cWe can move to London. It\u2019s the most metropolitan city, and the safest. The closest to our world. I\u2019ll play music, and you can take in washing or be a clerk somewhere. We\u2019ll save up some money and open a dinner theater. It\u2019s the American dream, just in an entirely different world. We can invent show tunes and pizza. They won\u2019t know what hit them.\u201d</p><p>I looked at our hands on the table, his wrapped possessively around mine. It was hard to breathe. Maybe being near him made me giddy because he sucked all of the oxygen away. He\u2019d already made his plans; he was just fitting me into the puzzle. I wasn\u2019t ready to be held captive like that again, even if there was happiness in the bargain.</p><p>My glance had been seductive in many ways, and I had seen things there that I had longed for all my life. Things that, until now, I\u2019d thought I wanted. Warmth, comfort, complacency, normalcy. Although it broke my heart to know that I would never meet that small boy with the stuffed rabbit, the thing that struck me to the bone was the look on my face as an old woman. The naked pain there, the longing, the wondering what I had given up. That version of me understood what was lost, and she was broken.</p> <p>And I knew my answer.</p><p>I slid my hand away and dropped it to my lap. I looked back into his eyes, which were beautiful and hopeful and so full of plans. I hated to disappoint him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he said, shaking his head in confusion and making his beautiful wavy hair swirl around. God, he was so gorgeous. But he was so, so wrong about me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the person you think I am,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be pinned down, and I don\u2019t want to pin anyone else down. I don\u2019t want to wash other people\u2019s clothes or work retail. I don\u2019t want to be afraid of my gift. I don\u2019t want to do the safe thing anymore. I don\u2019t want anyone else telling me what to do. Ever. And I hate show tunes.\u201d</p><p>As he spluttered, beginning to plead, a shadow fell over us.</p><p>\u201cAnything to discuss, my love?\u201d Criminy said to me.</p><p>\u201cI was just asking Casper what he thought I should do,\u201d I said. \u201cStay or go. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Criminy threw back his head in that marvelous, booming laugh of his, as if asking Casper such a question was the most ridiculous thing imaginable. Then he caressed my face gently and said, \u201cI think you should follow your heart. Even if I told you otherwise, you\u2019d still have your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d I said.</p><p>A lone tear coursed down the dust on my face. Something in my heart cracked wide with the sound of the door on a birdcage opening, showing blue sky and freedom beyond.</p><p>Finally, someone understood.</p><p>Casper stood up, turned his back on us, and walked out the door. I watched him go, privately bidding farewell to the possibilities that would never come to be. In my heart, I knew I\u2019d made the right decision, but I worried for him. My first glance had shown me much darkness in his future, and he would fall quite low before he\u2019d find his way back out. We\u2019d see him again, but I wasn\u2019t about to tell Criminy that.</p><p>With a kiss on my forehead, the king of the caravan swaggered to the front of the car. All eyes followed him, taking in his bedraggled appearance and confident manner. When he reached the buffet, he turned and smirked. Reaching into the basket of apples, he took two handfuls and began juggling. Mouths began to quirk up. I couldn\u2019t help smiling, too; after all of our hardship and worry, his colorful tricks were a welcome reminder of the everyday magic of caravan life.</p><p>After leading the seven apples in circles, figure eights, and various other maneuvers, Criminy caught them all in the top of his hat and stuck it on his head. His eyes rolled upward comically, but I was pretty sure that the apples were long gone. When he lifted his hat again, there was an apple pie underneath. He set the pie on the buffet and sliced it open with a finger. Seven parakeets flew out, circled his head, and disappeared out the open door.</p><p>There was a moment of polite applause, and he bowed deeply to his people. When he stood, he met every eye in turn, then began to speak.</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d Criminy said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here to lead you. As you no doubt know by now, the Coppers want our newest employee, Lady Letitia. I must escort her to Manchester to answer to them. Without papers and Bludmen, you are vulnerable. So I leave it for a vote. Will you go to Manchester and take cover among your own kind? Will you stay here and wait for our return? Or will you continue on to Liverpool and sell smiles for coppers?\u201d</p><p>Hushed whispers rustled through the crowd. Criminy gave them a moment to soak it in before saying, \u201cTorno, take a vote. We\u2019re going to gather supplies.\u201d</p><p>Taking my arm, he dragged me from the car. The moment the door closed behind us, voices exploded within. While the Pinkies chose their communal destiny, we went to Criminy\u2019s wagon. I had never been inside it before, and I felt a little like a teenager seeing her boyfriend\u2019s room for the first time. It was tidy but spare and clearly not made for socializing, as evidenced by the conspicuous absence of seating. His wagon was a workspace, with walls of bookshelves and a stained worktable and an old wooden roll-top desk full of small drawers and pigeonholes. I was drawn to it. As I ran my hand over the gorgeous antique, Criminy watched me, pleased.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.</p><p>I hooked a finger through a drawer pull, and he reached out to hold the drawer shut, saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t open that if I were you. Some of my secrets bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReminds me of your coat,\u201d I said, backing away to scan the bookshelves.</p><p>He had loads of books and scrolls. Thick leather volumes, journals spilling ink-spattered papers, small novels, and polished animal skulls watched me from the shelves. As I read the spines, he tossed his old waistcoat onto the ground and started rifling through the pockets, making a pile of things on the floor. I kept my back to him, trying to be polite. I heard him open his chifforobe and shrug on a new coat, which he then filled with all of his talismans and instruments and handkerchiefs.</p><p>Some of the book titles were surprisingly familiar, one-offs as familiar as the proper names of cities and people. Dignity and Discrimination. Sagacity and Susceptibility. Peace and War. There was even a thick volume titled The Collected Works of Willem Sharkspear, including Gomez and Julietta, MacDougal, Harmlen, and A Big Kerfuffle over Nonesuch.</p><p>My eyes wandered from the bookshelf. The door to his bedchamber was ajar, and I could just see a soft wool blanket draping from the bed to the floor. I was about to edge over for a better peek, but Criminy touched my shoulder and startled me. I leaned back against the wall to catch my breath, and he put a hand against the wall over my shoulder and leaned in to kiss me, slow and gentle. I kissed him back enthusiastically, finally free to meet him with an open heart. If I hadn\u2019t been leaning against the wagon, I would have melted into a puddle on the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready, love,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go see what they\u2019ve decided.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to think as Criminy locked the door behind us. Although my heart was set on the locket, I couldn\u2019t help worrying about the caravan and the people who had accepted me as one of their own after knowing me for just a couple of days. Because of the price on my head, their lives and livelihood had been thrown into turmoil. And Criminy could lose everything if they chose to disperse.</p><p>But I found myself smiling even before I had stepped down into the grass. Emerlie was on her tightrope, Torno was doing squat thrusts with kettlebells, and Eblick was unconscious on his log, shiny with oil. They were practicing, same as ever. When they saw us, they all came to gather around Criminy\u2019s wagon. Except for Eblick, who remained asleep.</p> <p>\u201cMaster, we have decided,\u201d Torno said as he curled his kettlebells. His clockwork dog begged at his feet. \u201cWe will stay here and practice, try some new tricks maybe. There is nothing illegal about lifting weights, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of, old friend,\u201d Criminy said with a chuckle. \u201cBut what of safety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think a strong man can protect a bunch of little ladies?\u201d Torno bellowed. \u201cAlso, we are having the clockworks, and crossbows, and Mr. Dregs. And Eblick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth can Eblick do?\u201d I asked, stunned. Unless a Copper tripped over him while he was dozing in the sun, I couldn\u2019t imagine how he could possibly help.</p><p>Sitting up, the lizard boy sleepily blinked his eyes. He seemed a brighter green than before, his limbs less rubbery. The exercise and oil must have helped. He turned to us and, with a placid smile, said, \u201cI\u2019ve good news, m\u2019lord. Just found out I\u2019m venomous.\u201d</p> <p>And he opened his green-lipped mouth, showing a set of gleaming yellow fangs.</p><p>29</p><p>My new dress didn\u2019t fit nearly as well as my old one. It was an inch too long, and the burnt orange didn\u2019t do as much for my complexion, but it still felt good to be decent again. After Charlie Dregs had started staring at my thin gentleman\u2019s shirt and unconsciously licking his chops, Criminy had shooed Emerlie and me into Mrs. Cleavers\u2019s wrecked wagon, hissing, \u201cNothing flashy.\u201d</p><p>Emerlie giggled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the fun in that, eh?\u201d she said, sliding her yellow-and-purple arm through mine and dragging me off.</p><p>My options were limited, without a seamstress around and with most of the costumes trampled or half-finished. And thus, the unfashionable pumpkin dress with puffed shoulders and a ruffled placket that made me feel like Beth from Little Women instead of Mina from Dracula. The droopy bonnet didn\u2019t help my ego, either, but at least it covered my ears with their damning holes.</p><p>Honestly, I didn\u2019t care what I looked like so long as we could get on the road to Manchester. Now that I had made my decision, finding the locket was the next step. But it wasn\u2019t just for my own selfish needs anymore. I had to keep Criminy and his people safe, and that meant stopping Jonah Goodwill, no matter what. With my arm through Criminy\u2019s, we set off toward the hideous city on the hill. We left Pemberly behind to help guard the caravan, but Uro was on my wrist, ready to be of service\u2014if only I could remember to use him.</p> <p>On foot again on the endless moors, it was funny to think of how new and strange it had felt just a few days ago. Now it was like retracing my steps. Except that this time, we knew exactly where we were going. Straight to the enemy\u2019s lair. Either he was waiting for us, or we would be there, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything else?\u201d Criminy asked me again. \u201cWhen you touched Tabitha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing of the future,\u201d I said. \u201cJust them striking a deal, him leaving her alone on the island to wait for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why he wants the locket, but I wish I knew what he wanted with you,\u201d Criminy said, and I could tell that his thoughts were far away. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess if you found one of his underlings, I could glance him,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cToo risky. They\u2019ll be looking for us in the city. There\u2019s another way, though. I hate to ask you again, love, but could I have a drop of blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a drop? No problem. Anything for the locket,\u201d I said, holding out my arm. It was my new mantra.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, patting my hand apologetically. \u201cWe need to find a pool first.\u201d</p> <p>Criminy reached into his coat and pulled out the same brass device he\u2019d used to find Erris. He fiddled with the dials and spun slowly in a circle, fixing his eye on the horizon. Finally, he stopped, and I followed his gaze over the hills toward a thick wood bursting with bright green.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not too bad, then,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNot entirely off course.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what he meant.</p><p>As soon as we were off the road, the bunnies started to plop out of the grass and follow me, but I was so accustomed to their gentle, hungry stares by now that punting them was automatic.</p><p>Just as we reached the wood, something startled in the shadows, making the branches and bushes shudder. Birds burst from the trees like feathered fireworks, screeching in terror. Then the thing inside snorted.</p><p>\u201cShite,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bludstag. This is not part of the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I run?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t move. Try not to show fear. They can smell it. They like it.\u201d</p><p>He picked me up and carried me over to a gnarled plum tree on the outskirts of the forest. He handed me his coat and set me on the lowest branch, hissing, \u201cClimb,\u201d before he disappeared.</p><p>I moved up a few branches until I was out of mauling distance, then settled in a fork to watch. I spotted Criminy creeping through the underbrush, and then I looked at the huge shape in the bushes. The sleekly muscled stag was hunting Criminy in turn, its head low. I was scared for Criminy, but it was fascinating, watching two predators stalk each other.</p><p>Criminy threw a large stick just a little to the side of the stag, and it screamed and dove toward the noise, fangs bared. With the elegance of a lion, Criminy ran and sprang. His arms encircled the beast\u2019s neck, and the talons of his black-scaled hands sank into the bristling brown fur. His face contorted into an inhuman mask of feral rage as his open mouth, sparkling with his own fangs, sought the stag\u2019s throat.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look away. His teeth slashed through the fur and flesh, spraying blood as the beast bellowed. The sound died to a gurgle as Criminy ripped out a chunk and spit it out. As his blood-painted mouth closed over the wound and the stag\u2019s body began to tremble and jerk, Criminy\u2019s cloudy eyes looked up and met mine.</p><p>He was an animal. He was terrifying. And he was beautiful.</p><p>I realized that I was biting my lip, that my hand was wound into the ruffled fabric at my chest. Something in me was drawn to the carnage. Like so many women before me, I was a slave to the caveman brain, that deep old part of my DNA that whispered that ferocity would keep me safe and fed and alive and that I should most definitely find the fiercest creature around and hump it.</p><p>No problem there.</p><p>I\u2019d never seen this kind of violence before.</p><p>And part of me was disgusted at being ... my God, was I aroused by this? But part of me understood and accepted this vitality, this necessary savagery. What Criminy was doing to the stag, it would have readily done to me.</p><p>He took a last gulp and stood. Eyes never leaving mine, he wiped the blood from his mouth with the back of his bare hand. He stepped over the huge carcass and stalked toward me through the low grass of the copse, pulling out a black handkerchief to clean off the blood. As if hypnotized, I perched in the crook of the tree and watched him. My senses were high, and I could smell him on the breeze, smell the blood, hear his footsteps crushing the grass. I wanted to climb down to him, but I couldn\u2019t pull my eyes away.</p><p>In seconds, he was under my tree, looking up to where I stood on my branch, just eight feet off the ground. He held out his arms, the black scales of his hands glistening in the weak sun. Without a thought, I stepped off the branch and fell, my skirts billowing around me.</p><p>He caught me, of course, one arm under my knees and one around my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy hero,\u201d I said, breathless.</p><p>He chuckled once, low in the back of his throat, and then he kissed me, and I could taste the stag\u2019s blood in his mouth, meaty and warm, and I didn\u2019t care. I twined my arms around his neck and kissed him back, just as fiercely.</p><p>Still kissing me, he carried me toward a birch tree and set me on the ground. With a growl, he lunged and pressed me up against the trunk, his hands tracing my face once before hungrily stroking down my neck, my chest, the curve of my corset, the swell of my hip. All the playfulness and teasing from our last encounter was gone. This was pure animal lust.</p><p>And I wanted it.</p><p>He found the hem of my dress and tugged it up, violent and sure. My hands wound around his neck, through his hair, tugging the queue loose. Just like in the locket, daring me to answer his call.</p><p>I strained against him and squirmed as his hands plunged under my skirts and upward, past the foamy black petticoats, caressing my thighs. For the first time in Sang, I was damned glad that they hadn\u2019t invented women\u2019s undergarments. As his finger moved against me, sure as pulling a trigger, I moaned and rocked into him.</p><p>Without thinking, I ripped off my gloves and undid the laces of his breeches, my fingers more nimble than last time. His hand moved more quickly against me under my dress, the texture of the scales strange and delicious as they rubbed back and forth. Some tiny part of me, the old, tame Tish who lurked far off in my brain, was disgusted. The rest of me was triumphant and joyous and fierce and sure. This was what I had chosen, and I would enjoy every second of it.</p><p>I freed him from his breeches, and he moaned against my mouth to feel my hands on him, rubbing up and down, reveling in the soft touch of warm skin on warm skin after days of confinement behind cloth.</p><p>We were still kissing, tongues hungry and violent, like two dogs snapping at each other. He pulled away to kiss my neck and found more cloth there. Growling, he set his teeth against it, and the pressure through the fabric was exhilarating. I laughed and nibbled his ear, our hands moving together in the tangle of clothing below, building in speed. Then he jerked up my skirts, and his fingers were replaced by something better, and in one savage thrust, he was inside me. I was grunting and panting, my back rasping against the rough bark of the tree. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wrapped one leg around him, and he growled in my ear as he plunged even deeper into me. I squealed and pulled him closer, and he lifted my other leg around him. I thought I would split in two in the most wonderful way as I rode him, my back pinned to the tree and my arms wrapped around his neck and my legs wrapped around his waist, ruffled skirt trailing to the ground.</p><p>He struck that secret place inside me again and again, splitting me like a ripe plum, juicy and ready to burst. It was too soon, but I couldn\u2019t stop, couldn\u2019t slow down to enjoy it. As I cried out, he caught my breath in another sloppy, deep kiss, and I pulsed in release as I tasted blood and berries. He shuddered inside me, fighting to the last, and I pulled back before he could bite my tongue as he climaxed.</p><p>We were both shaking as the savagery of the interlude drained away. He lowered me to the ground and caught me up when I stumbled.</p> <p>I blushed and turned away to settle my skirts, which were all tangled up over my petticoats. When I felt his hand on my shoulder, I turned in surprise, and he gave me a shy smile and held a red handkerchief out on his glove-clad hand. I returned the smile and mopped myself off under the dress with my back to him, grateful that my clothes hid the aftermath of our lust from the relatively bright light of day.</p><p>When I turned back around, holding the stained hanky, he had put his own clothing to rights. How the man always managed to look both dapper and careless was beyond me.</p><p>\u201cJust leave it on the ground, love,\u201d he said with a teasing grin. \u201cThat\u2019s going to make some lucky bludbunny very happy. Now, let\u2019s see what our fine Magistrate has in store for you.\u201d</p><p>30</p><p>I knelt on the moss by the spring, fussing with my skirts. After what had just happened, I should have been past modesty with Criminy, but he could make me blush with nothing but a grin. And it definitely wasn\u2019t shame or embarrassment that I was feeling. Now that I had made my choice, it occurred to me that I wanted him not only to want me but also to esteem and respect me. I had gone from actively avoiding his adoration to trying to win his favor, and I felt more than a little awkward.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I said, self-conscious as I tucked the orange ruffles around my ankles. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t drink from blud animals.\u201d</p><p>By my side, Criminy dug through his coat with deft hands, assembling the tools he needed to work his magic. Fidgety and inelegant by comparison, I waited to play my part. Asking him questions helped me forget my physical and emotional discomfort and took my mind off contemplating what had just passed between us, which was really a very muddled experience.</p><p>\u201cI can feed from them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t taste very good. It\u2019s the same reason most Pinkies don\u2019t eat predators. Grass-fed creatures are much more succulent. But when it\u2019s an even fight and a valid kill ... well, it gets the blood pumping, and winning the war matters more than the gourmet taste.\u201d</p><p>On a flat rock by the pool, he laid out a dagger and a murky glass bottle.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind, then?\u201d he asked softly, playing with the dagger, the same one he\u2019d used to kill the bludrat. He scoured it with sand repeatedly and rubbed it clean on the moss.</p><p>\u201cWhat, watching you kill and eat a deer?\u201d I asked. \u201cObviously not. It was ... different. But not bad.\u201d I looked down, too, fiddling with my boot lace. \u201cIt was fascinating. You were very beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at that.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, nothing more beautiful than watching a stag have its throat ripped out,\u201d he said. \u201cScares the living daylights out of most of your kind. Further evidence that Bludmen need to be locked up. Enslaved. Drained. For we have violent tendencies, you know, and aren\u2019t fit for polite society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just because they don\u2019t have to kill their own meat,\u201d I said. \u201cPeople forget what it\u2019s like when it\u2019s life or death. I have patients who are dying and need help but are scared to have a needle put in their arm. They live such a soft life that they would risk death because they\u2019re afraid of a tiny piece of metal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUtter balderdash,\u201d Criminy said, polishing the knife on his breeches. \u201cI suppose people really are ridiculous, no matter where you go.\u201d</p><p>He set down the dagger, clearing his throat and straightening the collar of his coat. I wasn\u2019t the only one acting fidgety. He wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSomething else is bothering you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to ask, but aren\u2019t you worried about the ... consequences of our actions?\u201d he said. He looked up with a wry grin. \u201cHalf-bluds don\u2019t lead a merry life here. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not taking precautions. I can get you the herbs, if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d I said with a small, sad smile. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not worried. I had ... I had a loss, in my world. It was one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I decided that I wasn\u2019t ready to try again. I get a special shot, special medicine, once a year, to keep that from happening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s handy magic,\u201d he said, considering. \u201cNot that I\u2019d be sorry otherwise. Just so you know. And I\u2019m sorry for the things that have pained you in your past.\u201d He held my face, rubbing my cheek with his gloved thumb. \u201cGot a bit of stag blood there,\u201d he said.</p><p>I reached toward the sparkling pool to get some water, but he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cThe water needs to stay pure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll take that drop of blood now.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. He was already holding my hand, so he just removed the glove. It was businesslike this time, nothing sexy about it. With the dagger, he pricked my finger and squeezed a drop of blood into the pool, where it landed with a plop and swirled around, melting into the currents of the small spring below the surface. He placed my hand back in my lap and reached for the bottle.</p><p>Pouring a thin stream of blue liquid into the pool, he said, \u201cWhere is Jonah Goodwill?\u201d</p><p>The water rippled, and a picture formed, just on the surface, like a reflection in window glass. It was Jonah Goodwill. In an airy room with white walls and dark wood beams, the kindly-looking old man with the walrus mustache sat at a table, eating his dinner. He seemed so harmless, just an elderly gentleman running to fat, slurping his soup. A servant stood nearby with a towel over his arm, framed by a picture window showing the church steeple of Manchester.</p><p>On the white wall behind Goodwill, dozens of black eyes glistened on hunting trophies. I could tell that they were all creatures of blud\u2014they looked bigger, meaner, more vicious than their softer counterparts. The moose in the center looked as if it could take the leg off a rhinoceros.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s handy,\u201d murmured Criminy. \u201cNow we know he\u2019s home.\u201d Then he waved a hand over the pool, saying, \u201cWhere is my ruby locket?\u201d</p><p>The water swirled by itself, the vision of Goodwill wavering and shifting to an empty bedroom with the same white walls and ceiling timbers. The locket lay on an elegant dresser. Beside it sat an old black-and-white photograph of a girl with bobbed black hair holding a bouquet of flowers.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Criminy muttered. \u201cAll of our bludbunnies in one burrow. Now, why does Jonah Goodwill want Letitia?\u201d</p><p>The pond rippled, and the vision dissipated. A new scene shimmered into being.</p><p>It was Darkside in Manchester. All around the streets, dead Bludmen and women and children were scattered, their bodies spindly and pale and riddled with sores. Then the vision spun to another city, another Darkside, more bodies. Then another, and another. It showed us a world where all Bludmen were dead. The world Jonah Goodwill hoped to bring into being.</p><p>And at the center of the vision, surrounded by death, was me, the ruby locket hanging around my neck.</p><p>The walk to Manchester was both easier and more difficult after that. Easier because Criminy was bloated with stag blood and full of energy and because I was gnawing on a leg bone of quickly roasted, mostly rare venison. More difficult because Criminy was carrying the stag\u2019s lopped-off head by its enormous rack of antlers, a humble gift to Magistrate Goodwill, collector of blud trophies. We hoped it would be our ticket into his presence.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think it\u2019ll work?\u201d I asked, sidestepping random blood droplets that leaked from the severed neck.</p><p>\u201cNo way to tell,\u201d Criminy said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll take it, maybe not. If not, I\u2019ll throw it at him and knock him down, maybe puncture a lung with a lucky antler. He won\u2019t be expecting that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it just be easier to let ourselves be captured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you\u2019d like to see exactly how much blud\u2019s in my body, love,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cThey\u2019ll drain me without a thought. Always better to sneak in unawares, keep that ace hidden up your sleeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sleeve\u2019s covered in stag blood, Master Stain. And you deserve some sort of prize for carrying something that heavy on foot,\u201d I said, and then it hit me. \u201cWait. Why aren\u2019t we riding in the wind-up carriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s two good reasons, pet,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, if we arrive at their front gate in something that old and unusual, we might as well show up riding a unicorn. And two, it must go back to Master Haggard undamaged. I don\u2019t want a Bludman that old and powerful angry at me.\u201d</p><p>Back on the road, we soon saw Manchester shimmering against the dark, oily clouds. I could smell the storm coming, and just being near the city made me queasy.</p><p>Think of Nana, I said to myself. Think of her chicken \u2019n\u2019 dumplings and how she smiles every morning when you walk through her door. Think of all the Bludmen you can save, all of the children who will have a better life if you can stop Jonah Goodwill. You\u2019re going into Manchester, no matter what.</p><p>Then Criminy grunted and shifted the stag\u2019s head onto his other shoulder, and my thoughts came back to him. I smiled at the broad shoulders, the unstudied and catlike grace, the powerful body writhing with wiry muscles and striding so easily and boldly with a grim smile through a dangerous world. There was a soft place in my heart for him. More than that. He wanted me to be exactly who I was, and he completed a part of me that I hadn\u2019t known existed. I didn\u2019t want to lose that, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had chosen him over Casper, but I hadn\u2019t yet decided what to do about the locket and the potion. The choice he had demanded that I make came closer and closer with every footfall toward the whited sepulcher of Manchester. If we made it that far. If we got through the gate. If we found Jonah Goodwill before he found us. If Tabitha Scowl hadn\u2019t found him first. And if the locket wasn\u2019t broken, and we could get it and me to a safe sleeping place.</p><p>That was an awful lot of ifs.</p><p>Criminy glanced over his shoulder with his mouth quirked up. \u201cYou thinking about changing your mind, love?\u201d he said. \u201cNow\u2019s the time. Run away with the caravan, get bludded, have an easy life with a handsome rogue?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than my future riding on that locket now. And easy things aren\u2019t worth much,\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThen the hard things had better be,\u201d he said.</p><p>When we were almost close enough to Manchester\u2019s wall to attract notice, Criminy ducked behind a screen of wild hedges and boulders. He set down the huge stag\u2019s head, squatted on the grass, and beckoned to me. I joined him, careful to keep my skirts clear of the oozing trophy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll have to be magic, love,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for us. So you\u2019re going to be invisible, and I\u2019m going to be in disguise. I\u2019m throwing a harder spell this time, one that won\u2019t take so much of my energy to sustain. You\u2019ll be invisible until I break the spell, but you\u2019ll still be corporeal. You\u2019ll have to stay right next to me so we don\u2019t get separated, and you\u2019ll have to be absolutely silent. And you\u2019ll have to accept that if you get hurt, you\u2019re on your own. Can you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do anything,\u201d I said.</p> <p>He plucked a fallen hair from my shoulder and said, \u201cThat was easier than usual. Didn\u2019t even get to make you squeal.\u201d</p><p>He removed his glove, laid the hair over his black-scaled hand, and set it on fire with a word. As it burned, he sang things in an odd, musical language until it was ash. Then he kissed me swiftly and sprinkled the ashes over my head.</p><p>Even though it was impossible, I felt them land in my hair and melt like snowflakes. Criminy smiled as I faded from view. It was my third time being invisible, and it was just as disconcerting as ever. But this time, I couldn\u2019t see myself, not even a little bit, not even like glass or water. I was one hundred percent not there, my clothes and Uro with me.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn,\u201d he said. He nipped his finger and drew lines across his face with the blood, murmuring another song. It was his same blood that had brought me here, bursting from the locket and leaving pockmarks on my bathroom counter and permanent stains on my hand. And it was inside me now, too. It had to be very powerful stuff.</p><p>He bent down to put his glove back on, and when he looked up, I gasped.</p><p>He was now an elderly man with light brown skin and small tufts of white hair behind his ears. His chocolate-brown eyes grinned at me with mischief, and his quirked smile still held the same pointy teeth.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you feel about older men, little pet?\u201d he said with a raspy voice.</p><p>\u201cYou look like Antonin\u2019s grandfather,\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed and rose from the ground with an exaggerated stoop. As he shouldered the stag\u2019s head and started limping toward the city, I followed in his wake, the grasses parting for my invisible dress.</p><p>Right before we got within hailing distance of the gates, I whispered, \u201cStop to lace your boot, would you?\u201d</p><p>He obeyed, dropping the stag\u2019s head and kneeling with exaggerated stiffness to fiddle with the high laces of his boot. I knelt next to him, took his face in mine, and kissed him hard. He raised his arms to pull me closer, then remembered where we were and what we were doing. He scratched his head instead, all the while kissing me back fiercely.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens, I think I love you,\u201d I whispered in his ear as I pulled away.</p><p>The features he wore weren\u2019t his own, but the expression of relief and triumph was.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come around, pet. Whatever happens, I love you, too,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cI always have.\u201d</p> <p>Then he rose from the ground a different man in more ways than one. He shuffled to the guard\u2019s post, holding the stag\u2019s head on his shoulder and fumbling in his waistcoat for the documents we\u2019d forged that morning, before we knew Goodwill\u2019s ultimate plan.</p><p>\u201cPapers,\u201d came the flat voice.</p><p>The old man put the papers in the box and waited as the guard examined them.</p><p>\u201cRafael Fester of Nag\u2019s Head,\u201d the guard barked. \u201cState your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, sir,\u201d the old man said, his voice a mixture of sunshine and subservience. \u201cHeard Magistrate Goodwill collected curiosities and thought he might accept a humble token of esteem from the people of Nag\u2019s Head. This monster devoured eight Pinky children at a picnic afore my son kilt it and died in the bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have papers for Viviel Fester,\u201d the guard said. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>I had an invisible Oh, shit! moment. We had both forgotten about our original, two-visible-people plan\u2014the one we\u2019d made up before the spring showed us the truth of things.</p><p>But Criminy was clever and quick as ever. The old man\u2019s face was pained, and he softly said, \u201cMy wife passed last year, sir. I keep her papers with mine out of habit. Lived together two hundred years, we did.\u201d A few red tears rolled down his face.</p><p>The guard crumpled the extra set of papers and tossed them onto the ground in his booth, the bastard. No wonder everyone hated Coppers.</p><p>\u201cToll has gone up,\u201d the guard barked. \u201cEight coppers or two vials.\u201d</p><p>The old man set down the stag head and hunted through his pockets, gathering change. He counted out eight copper pennies and set them in the box. It flicked in, then back out with his papers.</p><p>The guard cleared his throat. \u201cIt is decreed that all Bludmen register for a badge at the House of Holofernes in Darkside upon entering the city. Bludmen without badges will be subject to inquisition and possible draining. Have you seen either of these people before?\u201d He held up inked drawings of Criminy and me. The word WANTED slithered across the top of each image in elegant calligraphy. The drawing of Criminy was spot-on, but the one of me was more than a little imaginative.</p><p>I looked like an evil seductress, some sort of vampy witch-queen.</p><p>I liked it.</p><p>I wanted a copy for my wagon.</p><p>\u201cNever seen the devils, sir, but never been out of Nag\u2019s Head till this week, neither. I\u2019ll be on the lookout, though. And how can I get to see Magistrate Goodwill, sir?\u201d</p><p>In answer, the guard pulled his lever, and the giant door squealed open.</p><p>Scratching his head and looking up at the huge doors, Criminy was having a marvelous time acting like a country rube. He picked up the stag\u2019s head and wandered through the door. I was close on his heels.</p><p>After the door slammed shut behind us, he whispered, \u201cYou there, pet?\u201d</p><p>In answer, I stroked his back softly, right where I had once clawed him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re there,\u201d he muttered. \u201cTry to keep up.\u201d</p><p>Keeping up his country-mouse act, Rafael Fester goggled at the shops and the people and generally got in everyone\u2019s way, accidentally smacking a grand Pinky dame with his bloody trophy at one point. He asked random people for directions to Darkside, then took pains to go the wrong way.</p><p>Still, I knew that he knew exactly where he was going, and I stayed as close to him as possible, trying to remember not to bump into anyone myself. I saw a filthy urchin sidling close to pick his pocket at one point and almost intervened, but Criminy spun around quickly and pegged the kid with an antler, shouting, \u201cWhat, who said that?\u201d like deaf old men everywhere. The urchin slunk back into the shadows, rubbing a lump on his forehead.</p><p>Finally, I could see one of the shadowy entrances to Darkside, although I didn\u2019t recognize anything from our earlier venture to Antonin\u2019s house. We were in a part of the city that I hadn\u2019t seen before. Rafael relaxed a little among his own people and straightened his back before asking a passing chimney sweep for directions to the House of Holofernes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two blocks up, but you don\u2019t want to go there,\u201d the Bludman said in a hushed whisper. \u201cThe Coppers know everything that happens in that inn, friend. What goes in your mouth and what comes out of it as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the guard at the gate said I had to get a badge,\u201d Rafael said, acting confused. \u201cWhat happens if I don\u2019t go there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, old man,\u201d the chimney sweep hissed. \u201cGet a fake badge underground. Go see\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stepped back as a Copper rounded the corner and made a beeline for them. Picking up his bucket and brush, he said, just a little too loudly, \u201cGlad she\u2019s doing well, and give her my best, will you?\u201d</p><p>The chimney sweep turned to go, but the Copper swung his billy club in a significant sort of way and said, \u201cI don\u2019t see your badge, Bluddy. Yorick must have been giving you directions to the House of Holofernes. How kind. I\u2019ll take it over from here.\u201d</p><p>The chimney sweep hurried away as the Copper pointed the billy club to steer Rafael down the darkening street. Of course, he didn\u2019t come anywhere close to touching the dangerous Bludman, however old and frail.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want you to get lost,\u201d the Copper said. \u201cSomething bad might happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for your help, sir,\u201d Rafael said. It was almost believable.</p><p>I drifted in their wake, as silent as a ghost. It was twilight, with indigo clouds boiling overhead. Shadows loomed as orange gaslights hissed into life. I waited for the first fat, wet drops of smoggy rain to fall, but the sky was holding its breath.</p><p>Stores began opening their doors to Bludmen who had spent all day working as the servants of their prey, the warm light making cheerful rectangles across the shining cobblestones. Bludmen of all ages drifted into the streets, the women walking arm in arm, chatting in groups, or going through the open doors to do business. It was shocking, the difference between the relaxed Bludwomen in their showy, open gowns and the cramped, nervous Pinkies so tightly laced and tightly wound. The Copper\u2019s constant sneer made his disgust for Darkside all too obvious, and I couldn\u2019t help tripping him once. \u201cDamn Bluddies need to clean up after themselves,\u201d he muttered to no one in particular as he straightened his coat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally stopping under an awning, the Copper muttered, \u201cHave fun in there,\u201d and stood a little away, watching. Making sure that Rafael didn\u2019t bolt.</p><p>The sign had a stylized flame topped by the calligraphed House of Holofernes Inn. I shivered as Criminy grasped the knob. Something wasn\u2019t right here.</p><p>Before he could open the door, I put my hand on his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cSomething smells funny around here,\u201d Rafael said, sniffing the air. \u201cSmells fishy.\u201d Then he shrugged and went inside. I followed, glad that he had picked up on it, too.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, sir,\u201d said a deep, sonorous voice.</p><p>Behind the counter was a very tall, very thin old Bludman with a nose like an eagle\u2019s beak. I doubted he had ever smiled in his entire life. I disliked him immediately.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Master Holofernes,\u201d said Rafael. \u201cThe guard at the gate told me I had to register, so here I am. I\u2019ve never been in the city before. Do you have a room available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSign here,\u201d intoned the old man, and he slid a new-looking guest register across the counter. Rafael shrugged and picked up the quill, signing Rafael Fester, Nag\u2019s Head in shaky cursive. Then he looked up expectantly.</p> <p>\u201cPapers,\u201d said Mr. Holofernes, and Rafael handed them over. Mr. Holofernes gave the aged, worn paper a thorough investigation and even tasted a corner with the tip of his tongue before silently returning them. Then he handed Rafael a little brass badge with an ornate B on it and pointed to one on his own lapels to indicate proper placement.</p><p>After he rang a crystal bell, Mr. Holofernes glared at Rafael, and the men stood in mutual awkward silence.</p><p>Right before Rafael got bored enough to say something that might have been foolhardy, a dark-haired Bludwoman rushed down the stairs and began chattering at him like a demented parakeet, filling the odd silence. Master Holofernes disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello there, now, sir. How do you do, sir? You\u2019ll be wanting a room, won\u2019t you, sir? And you\u2019ve just missed the rain, isn\u2019t that lucky? And what a loverly stag you\u2019ve got there. Did you kill it yourself? That\u2019ll fetch a pretty penny, that one, such a loverly rack on it. Now, where are your bags, sir?\u201d</p><p>Rafael looked completely flummoxed, and I almost tittered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no bags, miss, other than this little sack,\u201d he finally said. \u201cDidn\u2019t plan on staying the night. Just wanted to bring this token to Master Jonah Goodwill from the good people of Nag\u2019s Head, thank him for keeping our city safe. But the guard sent me here, so here I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, now, a room\u2019ll cost you ten coppers or three vials, sir, and that\u2019s Pinky blood, if you don\u2019t know. And that includes a half vial at dinner, which is quite the affair. Oh, everyone in the inn gathers together in the salon at elevenses for a loverly party, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds awfully fancy,\u201d Rafael said, digging in his waistcoat for coins. \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting it to be so expensive, though. It\u2019s my first night in a big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now, sir, if that\u2019s too dear for you, we\u2019ve got a half room for five coppers, but it\u2019s just got a cot and a ewer. The regular rooms have a nice, spacious bed, city views, and running water, you know. Ever so loverly, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>Rafael\u2019s smile quirked in a familiar way, and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you to mention, but I guess I\u2019ll indulge and give myself room to spread out and enjoy it. You only live once, eh?\u201d</p><p>They laughed together. Must have been an inside joke for Bludmen. She handed him a key and gave him directions to his room, all but ordering him to freshen up before the mandatory party.</p><p>I followed Rafael up two flights of stairs, careful to step at the same time he did, lest anyone wonder why an old man was making twice the normal amount of footsteps. He opened the door to the room and tossed the stag\u2019s head onto the floor, where it landed with a splat. I followed him inside, and he kicked the door closed and caught me in his arms, whispering, \u201cI can\u2019t see you, but I can still smell you, my love.\u201d</p><p>I tried to wriggle away, but he held tight and nuzzled until he found my face.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d he breathed, and his lips found mine. I shifted my angle and startled when my eyes caught motion across the room. I glanced up at a floor-length oval mirror, in which an elderly man was passionately making out with the air. He pulled away as I shook with laughter and pointed at the mirror.</p> <p>Oh, wait. He couldn\u2019t see me.</p><p>\u201cI was just watching you make love to nothing in that mirror,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt was quite a show.\u201d</p><p>Rafael chuckled, then sat on the bed and started unlacing his boots.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to freshen up, like a good little Bludman,\u201d he said. \u201cRight after I do something that requires freshening. I seek to commune with the naughty little ghost of Viviel Fester.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me, the wolfish grin. My insides melted a little.</p><p>Giving myself a moment, I moved to the window and peeped through the curtains. A heavy, greasy rain was splattering across the cobblestones, coating them like slug slime in the orange gaslights. I shut the curtains. Things were much more interesting inside.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even see me,\u201d I said coyly. \u201cAnd we already did something freshening-worthy this afternoon. And you\u2019re an old man. And you still have to go to a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to see you,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cIt\u2019ll be dark soon, and I can still feel you and taste you. This afternoon is the ancient past. And we\u2019re both going to that party, because I need you to get information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if all that\u2019s true, you\u2019re still assuming I want to get unfreshened with a silly old man,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cIn the dark, you won\u2019t know the difference,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll have old-man breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d he said in his regular voice, low and husky.</p><p>He stepped out of his boots and stood, shrugging out of his coat. He was looking right at me, even though he couldn\u2019t see me. He walked to me and brought his arms in until they were right on my shoulders. Then he breathed on me, and I inhaled that wonderful scent of his and sighed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d I echoed.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he said, tracing down my shoulder to my hand and leading me to the bed, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve made your decision about the locket yet. This could be my last night with you. One of us could die tomorrow. Or you might leave me forever. I want every bit of happiness I can get.\u201d He tried to keep his tone playful and light, but I could hear a farewell in his words, and I couldn\u2019t have turned him down if I had wanted to.</p><p>The curtains were already closed. He switched off the lights. We were both invisible in the darkness. It was Criminy\u2019s face I felt, his soft, smooth hair running through my fingers. I traced his eyebrows and cheekbones, sharp features I would have recognized anywhere.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know, either, not tonight,\u201d he answered, and then our lips met and our bodies melded together, neither of us what we seemed.</p><p>Our first time together had been exploratory and playful. Our time in the woods had been fierce and raw. But this time, we were slow and pensive, every touch and kiss filled with longing and a strange, vulnerable finality. We took our time.</p><p>It was fun, being invisible.</p><p>31</p><p>Afterward, we turned on a light, and I watched him stretch, fascinated by his darker, sagging skin.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019ll look like one day?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr will you ever get old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a long time until I\u2019m old by your standards, love. You were right\u2014this is what Antonin\u2019s grandfather looked like. It\u2019s just a simple glamour,\u201d he said, his hand moving right through the curly white hair. \u201cOnly works on the eyes. I\u2019ll have to dab on some cologne before we go down there, in case I see anyone I know. The other Bludmen will think I\u2019m a simple country rube with no taste.\u201d</p><p>I stretched, enjoying the feeling of being completely naked and still utterly without shame, just like in my dreams. No sucking in the belly or worrying about stubble. It was so freeing.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just stay like this for a while?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nice here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you that choice, pet, but you want your locket. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be testy,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know I have to do this. I\u2019ve got a responsibility to my grandmother. She needs me. And it\u2019s for the Bludmen, too. What happened in Brighton can\u2019t happen here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he growled. \u201cBugger the lot of them.\u201d</p><p>He rolled off the bed and ran water into the basin, then began scrubbing himself furiously with a wet towel.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re trying to scrub me off of you,\u201d I said archly.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he said. \u201cDammit, woman! Your scent, your stupid bloody delicious scent lingering in every crevice of my body and my wardrobe, driving me nearly mad. Do you know what it\u2019s like to want something so badly, to have it so close, and still feel that it\u2019s out of your reach? Out of your control?\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Despite my invisibility, I was overcome with the need to cover up. To seek shelter. He was like a storm brewing, and I hadn\u2019t seen him angry like this before. Not at me. Thunder rolled outside, and I felt it in my rib cage.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you angry all of a sudden, Criminy? What did I do?\u201d</p><p>He began to dress, staring off into space with eyebrows drawn sharply down.</p><p>\u201cThe powers I used to bring you here\u2014they weren\u2019t cheaply bought. You met the witch. I made my bargain with the devil; I paid my dues. And here you are, perfect in every way. Except that your heart\u2019s all tied up in another world, another life, these other people. And I can\u2019t even duel them for you, can\u2019t trick them or glamour them. They\u2019re like smoke and mirrors, like fighting a ghost.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tossed his wrinkled cravat to the floor and turned to me, his shirt open over an old man\u2019s honey-colored skin, peppered with little white hairs. Rafael\u2019s face was contorted in anger and sadness, but it was Criminy\u2019s eyes skewering me through the heart.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m angry. I\u2019m about to risk my life\u2014again\u2014to get my own locket back so that you can leave me behind. And you\u2019ve set it up so that if we don\u2019t get the locket back, you\u2019ll leave me anyway.\u201d</p><p>In a tiny voice, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He kicked the stag in his stocking feet, and it rolled over and sagged.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re sorry. It\u2019s a losing bet, love. What did you tell that Pinky girl at the caravan? \u2018Tell your father not to bet on the black horse?\u2019 I won\u2019t be betting anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet,\u201d I said, my voice low and wracked with more guilt than I would have liked.</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll find when you get back there, to your world. You\u2019ve got to go feel it out, taste it, roll it around on your tongue, and compare it with the taste of Sang. See how it holds up.\u201d</p><p>I scooted toward the headboard and picked up a pillow, snuggling it against my face to stanch my silent tears. I was glad he couldn\u2019t see me crying. He sat on the edge of the bed with his back to me and put his head in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cI would burn down the world for you,\u201d he whispered fiercely. \u201cYour world or my own. I would rip down this entire city with my bare hands without a second thought. I don\u2019t need to taste anything else, I don\u2019t need a comparison. I always thought that when you came to me, you\u2019d feel that way, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think that maybe I wasn\u2019t worthy of such love?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot until you brought it up, no,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I sniffled.</p><p>\u201cBut it still doesn\u2019t change my feelings,\u201d he said, standing up and shaking himself back into his flinty, hard mood. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll have to see what happens when your choices are laid bare. Now, wash up and get decent, because we\u2019ve got a party to attend.\u201d</p><p>Lacing a corset was difficult and uncomfortable. Lacing an invisible corset on an invisible body was like taking the SAT blind, in Sanskrit, with a stubby crayon, during a hurricane.</p> <p>By the time we had found all of my clothing and gotten it back on me using only the sense of touch, we were fifteen minutes late for the party, and I was hopelessly mussed. I helped Criminy straighten his shirt and picked the lint off the velvet jacket that stretched over his own shoulders but appeared to droop somewhat over Rafael\u2019s hunched body. The difference between what my eyes saw and what my hands felt was disconcerting.</p><p>Next, he shook some sort of powder all over me.</p><p>\u201cTo dull your scent,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t smell anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why don\u2019t Pinkies use this stuff all the time?\u201d I asked, thinking about Casper and wondering how much blud he\u2019d ingested for just such an effect.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s expensive, involves complex magic, doesn\u2019t last very long, and is made of ... well ... you don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he explained, avoiding my eyes.</p><p>\u201cEw?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLetitia, this is important, love,\u201d he said, feeling around to grasp my hand. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to gather any information possible. However they do it, Coppers are at this party. Without Pemberly, I\u2019m flying a little blind. Your job is to stay out of the way and watch people. Listen to side conversations. Lean in if anyone whispers. Look for holes in the wall or eyes in paintings, where they might be watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d I said through a mouthful of cold wrappy that I had pulled from our sack. I watched in the mirror as the burrito disappeared bite by bite into thin air. I was more than starving and hunted around the bag for tangerines.</p><p>\u201cAbove all, don\u2019t touch anyone. Don\u2019t knock anything over. And don\u2019t make a noise. Just find a quiet corner and stay there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye-aye, captain,\u201d I said, licking my fingers.</p><p>I was actually looking forward to it\u2014being invisible at a party of Bludmen. I didn\u2019t have to worry about introducing myself, or figure out what to do with my hands, or talk about the weather with boring people. I could stare and eavesdrop to my heart\u2019s content, collecting the information that we hoped would tell us more about Goodwill\u2019s game.</p><p>I followed Rafael downstairs. The yappy Bludwoman hostess shooed him into a room that reminded me of the Billiard Room in Clue, from the white-checkered floor to the wood-paneled walls and bookshelves crowded with leather volumes. A pool table with eight pockets dominated the space. Red velvet drapes bracketed the windows and doorways, and sickly potted plants loafed in the corners. Miniature vials of blood warmed in buckets over braziers on every table.</p><p>The people were even more interesting\u2014all Bludmen, of course. Men and women of all ages wore the typical brightly colored clothes and chatted in small clusters. A few of the wealthier lodgers had clockworks, including monkeys, snake baubles both smaller and larger than my own, and a beautiful jeweled peacock. Rafael ventured toward a knot of older men playing poker. I drifted to a corner behind some young dandies playing billiards.</p><p>Time to play spy.</p><p>A hen party of women stood near me in fashionable gowns, chatting about bonnet styles and ribbons. Not helpful. On a couch a little apart from them, a middle-aged couple in outdated clothes sipped blood from their snifters in bemused silence. Snippets of conversations floated past, but I couldn\u2019t pull any meaning from the words.</p><p>Instead, I focused on scanning the room for clues. There were paintings, but they were mostly large landscapes of coursing bludmares and fox hunts. Instead of foxes, there were humans cowering in fear before the riders. Not a single fancy portrait had white eyeballs glinting through holes in the canvas.</p><p>I was just about to tiptoe across the room when I noticed Master Holofernes sitting in a wing-backed chair, his face impassive and dark. He was one of the few people not drinking from a snifter. People avoided him and cast odd glances at him, but for the most part, he was ignored, so I ignored him, too.</p><p>I waited until the nearest young Bludman had made his shot and set down his cue, then darted around the billiard table to the other side of the room. A teenage girl sat down at a harpsichord and began playing a sad, soft waltz. Her music was going to hinder my eavesdropping, so I slid around the wall to a group of older ladies huddled around teacups.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t right, that\u2019s what,\u201d said an old biddy in a gown that was worn and several centuries out of style. \u201cMy cousin was in Brighton, a milliner, not even a factory slave. No one in my family\u2019s drunk from a body in two hundred years. And what\u2019s the thanks we get? Fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Tavia,\u201d said her friend, nudging her in the ribs. \u201cDon\u2019t say such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a paying guest, and I\u2019ll speak free.\u201d Tavia sniffed. \u201cBesides, we\u2019re all among kin here, are we not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark times,\u201d said an old lady with a tall beehive of white curls, \u201cand I plan to live through them. Again.\u201d She got up and sashayed to a bookcase, swinging her padded hips.</p><p>\u201cCowards,\u201d muttered Tavia.</p><p>\u201cWe have to be, dear,\u201d said her friend, patting her hand.</p><p>I looked for Rafael and found him trying to speak to Master Holofernes, who just wagged his head and remained silent. Rafael shrugged good-naturedly and moved toward the harpsichord, but he was waylaid by the talkative desk clerk, who urged him toward the refreshment table.</p><p>I moved closer to hear the interplay.</p><p>\u201cI brought my own blood from home and already drank, miss,\u201d said Rafael. \u201cWaste not, want not, my mother always said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense, then, Mr. Fester. You\u2019ve paid your coppers, same as anyone, and you\u2019re entitled to your blood. Didn\u2019t you say you were going to indulge yourself? Half a vial will sit right nicely. And soon Judith will sing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly\u2014\u201d Rafael began, but he turned to face an opening door and stopped talking for a moment. Then he swallowed and continued in a lower voice, saying, \u201cReally, I couldn\u2019t, miss. You\u2019re too kind. Please excuse a peculiar old man\u2019s small-town ways.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her pleas, he sidled away to the far corner to examine the bookshelf and make polite talk with the old lady with the beehive hair. The girl at the harpsichord finished the waltz and started playing another sad song and warbling along off-key. Casper was right\u2014he could make a killing here, if that was his only competition.</p><p>I was blocked by the men at the billiard table and couldn\u2019t see what had spooked Rafael. I began to edge along the wall, anxious to get around the screen of bodies. Then a voice rang out over the harpsichord player\u2019s softer soprano, and everyone turned to look. The old men parted, and into the room strutted Miss Tabitha Scowl, singing like an angel.</p><p>And around her snow-white neck was my locket.</p><p>32</p><p>I had never hated anyone the way I hated Tabitha Scowl.</p><p>She was tiny and effortlessly beautiful. She had an amazing voice, whereas when I sang, it sounded as if I was gargling with concrete. She had poise and style and confidence and passion.</p><p>And, most important, she had my locket. And she probably didn\u2019t even know how to use it.</p><p>Swishing the long teal bustle of her gown behind her, she put on a coquette\u2019s smile as she finished the song and approached the two youngest and most handsome Bludmen in the room. They abandoned their game, holding their pool cues nonchalantly as they chatted with the belle of the ball. I moved closer to listen, but it was just ridiculous flirting. Nothing helpful.</p><p>But why was she there? Why did Goodwill trust her with my locket? Was she one of the reasons the Coppers always knew what transpired at this party? And if so, why wasn\u2019t she saying anything interesting?</p><p>I edged closer to her and leaned in, but she was just complimenting a young Bludman\u2019s well-muscled arm. Mere feet away, the locket glinted at me, hanging just below her corset-enhanced bosom. She was too small for it to hang over her heart, as it did on me. I was transfixed, watching it sway as she moved, lovingly noting the deep crimson of the ruby and the interesting engravings on the shining gold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mine, I thought.</p><p>Something nudged me from behind, and one of the old ladies cried, \u201cPardon me, sir!\u201d and cast a vicious glare at one of the young men, adding, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go smacking people with your stick, you\u2019d best learn some manners.\u201d</p><p>The young man stared at his pool cue in confusion and apologized. I had to be more careful, before someone really bumped into me and caused a ruckus.</p> <p>I held up my skirts and tiptoed around Tabitha until my back was to the wall behind her. I could see Rafael by the bookcase watching her around the woman\u2019s towering white beehive, his old man\u2019s brow furrowed in worry. Then he looked frantically around the room, searching for me even though I was invisible.</p><p>I flattened myself against the wall as a Bludman pushed past to join Tabitha\u2019s circle of admirers. I couldn\u2019t help but breathe the air in his wake. Yuck. Old-man breath, with an overpowering stench of blood\u2014even worse than Tabitha. No wonder Emerlie thought Bludmen smelled bad.</p><p>Tabitha was laughing now, and I could see the chain around the back of her neck, tangling in the loose hairs of her updo. Every fiber of my being yearned to tackle her and rip the locket off and run with it, but I knew that would be a disaster. I just had to stay close and follow her when she left the party. Still, the necklace drew me, and as much as I hated her, I couldn\u2019t help creeping closer and closer until I was near enough to touch the glinting gold.</p><p>The door behind us opened, and the busy clerk ushered in a new couple. A gust of air rushed in behind them as the door slammed shut, and my skirts whooshed around me. Tabitha stiffened, and before I could react, she spun around and raked the air with her gloves. I tried to leap backward, but it was too late. Her hands clutched the ruffles on my dress, and she shrieked in triumph.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her!\u201d she called. \u201cParty\u2019s over!\u201d</p> <p>Master Holofernes leaped up like a much younger man and wrestled with my invisible form, pinning my arms behind my back. I couldn\u2019t see Criminy, but I hoped he was already safely hidden and planning my rescue.</p><p>I struggled, stomping hard on the boot of Master Holofernes. A young man\u2019s voice screeched from his mouth, \u201cShe kicked me! The Bludhoney kicked me, Tab!\u201d And then he cuffed me so hard I saw stars. I guessed Criminy wasn\u2019t the only magician in town who could craft a disguising spell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the other. It\u2019s our new Mr. Fester!\u201d cried the talkative clerk from somewhere out of my sight.</p><p>The bitch, it seemed, had won.</p><p>Back in our room, we watched two Coppers toss our bed and rummage through Criminy\u2019s sack, which held nothing but spare clothes and a few vials of blood. I wondered if any of them were mine.</p><p>Criminy stood proudly between two more Coppers, still wearing his Rafael disguise, his old man\u2019s arms pinned tightly behind his back. I was held likewise. They apparently hadn\u2019t invented handcuffs in this world. Outside, the storm raged, the heavy clouds finally unleashing their tempest.</p> <p>Looking in my general direction, Rafael flicked his tongue out at me. It seemed a strange time to be rude, and I returned the gesture before remembering that he couldn\u2019t see me. Then he did it again, more slowly. Like a snake.</p><p>Aha! I had forgotten Uro around my wrist. The Coppers holding my arms probably didn\u2019t know that I had my own invisible clockwork protector. I felt along the bracelet and pressed the head scale. At that moment, another Copper joined us, carrying a thin, coiled rope over one arm.</p><p>Drat.</p><p>Tabitha looked up from her rifling to hiss, \u201cWell? Tie them, idiot.\u201d</p><p>Rafael\u2019s eyes narrowed as he looked at the rope, but Tabitha laughed and said, \u201cYou escape, she dies. I\u2019ll drain her myself.\u201d</p><p>That was enough to keep him still with fury as they bound his arms. In addition to being a magician, I hoped he was an escape artist, because I was starting to form a plan. But I didn\u2019t know if I could save us both.</p><p>The Copper with the rope moved toward me next, looking confused. How, exactly, does one tie up an invisible woman? But he could see where his comrade held my arms, so he aimed for those. I held the uncoiled snake, waiting. The timing had to be just right; he couldn\u2019t know what I was doing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to feel my bite,\u201d I said calmly, but I put a particular emphasis on certain words.</p> <p>What I\u2019d actually said was \u201cURO bout to feel my BITE.\u201d</p><p>It sounded ridiculous, but it worked. The little snake struck, cold and hard and quick. I caught him as the bitten Copper screamed and started dancing around and swatting the air.</p><p>The other two Coppers turned their attention to his bizarre behavior. I jerked my arms loose and lunged at Tabitha, who was just turning around in irritation. After snatching the locket off over her head, I ran for the door, flinging it open and running for the stairs. I heard tumult behind me, and I imagined that Criminy was doing everything in his power to hinder pursuit.</p><p>\u201cAfter her, bloodbags!\u201d Tabitha shouted.</p><p>I heard violent retching in the hall as I slipped on the landing and pounded down the stairs. Looks like I owe Vil further thanks.</p><p>I shot out through the front door into the driving storm. The street was empty, and I turned left and ran as fast as I could without looking back, the visible locket floating in midair as my boots slipped on the rain-wet cobblestones. Criminy had warned me that only things touching me when the spell was cast would be invisible, and the locket was no exception.</p><p>I was soon panting but didn\u2019t slow down. I didn\u2019t know where I was going, but I knew that I had to get out of Darkside and into a relatively safer area for humans. And then, of course, I had to avoid the bludrats. Judging by my glances at the caravan, that would be no mean feat.</p><p>Whenever I came to a bigger crossroad, I turned, angling ever upward with my eyes on Goodwill\u2019s church. I soon found myself in a wealthy residential area of the Pinky part of the city, the fine homes locked up tight for the night. I read the store signs as I passed, hoping for inspiration but thinking on a very animal level. Escape. Run. Live.</p><p>Then a sign caught my eye: For Sale. The narrow town house from which it hung was dark and quiet. I stopped. The street was empty, the sky perilous, the lightning crashing. The rain bounced off me like vindictive gumdrops. I was soaked to the bone.</p><p>I looked up and down the street. Every single home had at least one light in a window and a lit gas lamp outside the front door. The For Sale house was utterly dark. I put my ear to the door and heard nothing within.</p><p>I held my wrist up to the keyhole and said, \u201cUro, unlock,\u201d hoping it would work for me just as it had for Criminy in the lighthouse. I couldn\u2019t see what the invisible snake was doing, but I heard a metallic clunk. When I tried the doorknob, it opened. I stole inside and locked the door behind me.</p><p>The garish colors were shrouded in darkness, the mosaic fountain empty. Furniture wrapped in white sheets lurked throughout. But it was dry and quiet, and I was alone. I took the grand staircase up to the second level and dripped into the master bedroom, where a heavy four-poster bed waited under a canopy of spiderwebs. I thought about unlacing my boots and getting undressed, but I was too exhausted. Plus, if someone showed up, I\u2019d have to run again, and I didn\u2019t want to run barefoot or naked in Sang.</p><p>I dragged myself onto the bed and lay down on the white sheet, feeling aches that I had never felt before. I had walked more in the last few days than in my entire previous life, and I had magically aged five years. Or maybe more. But it wasn\u2019t only sleep I was after. Now that I had my locket around my neck, I wanted to go home.</p><p>I slipped Uro off my wrist and set him on a sheet-covered side table. I said, \u201cUro, guard,\u201d and listened to the sound of my invisible bracelet contorting into a tripod. I was almost too excited to close my eyes as I curled on my side, holding the locket against my heart.</p><p>I stroked my thumb over the ruby and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll come back, Criminy,\u201d I said.</p><p>As I drifted off to sleep, I had a vision of Nana and me sitting at her table in the bright morning sunlight, eating waffles and laughing.</p><p>33</p><p>Like a kid at Christmas, I wasn\u2019t ready to open my eyes yet. I could sense the darkness, but I wanted to savor it, enjoy the delicious comfort and joy of my own bed, or at least a hospital bed. But no\u2014I had to be home. The bed was soft, and there was a weight on the mattress next to me. I stretched and reached a hand out to pat Mr. Surly.</p><p>But the thing under my hand wasn\u2019t my silky-furred house cat.</p><p>It was hairy and prickly, and it hissed at me.</p><p>I screeched and smacked the bludrat off the bed, then heard the satisfying pop as it hit the wall.</p><p>I groped for Uro on the nightstand. When I finally found him, he was toppled over, broken, a tangle of jagged metal and wires. They\u2019d killed my clockwork, the bastards.</p><p>Those bludrats were smarter than they looked.</p><p>A crack of lightning lit up a roomful of small eyes focused on me, red and hungry. Perched on the sheet-covered furniture, crouching on the dusty floor, writhing up the posts and canopy of the bed. They couldn\u2019t see me, but they could smell me. They knew I was there, and they knew what they wanted to do with me. I guessed Criminy\u2019s icky powder had finally worn off.</p><p>Another one scrambled onto the bed and chittered, and I kicked it with the heel of my boot. The others grew bolder and started to creep forward. I had to get out before they started swarming. I stood up and ran out the door and down the stairs. Behind me, dozens of sharp claws scrabbled on the mosaic floors as red, furry bodies thumped down the stairs.</p><p>I burst through the front door into the cool, damp world of early morning. Slamming the door behind me, I heard their bodies strike the wood. Their claws scritched against it, and then I heard one start to gnaw. I shuddered and kicked the door.</p><p>I jogged uphill toward the church, my wet skirts dragging through the puddles. I needed to get off the streets before the early risers noticed a floating locket. A useless floating locket that was either damaged or a clever forgery. As I walked, I pressed the stone to pop the locket open. Inside, where Criminy\u2019s face should have been, there was a carefully folded piece of parchment.</p><p>Magistrate Jonah Goodwill of Eden House looks forward to seeing you again, said the elegant script. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, fabulous. So much for sneaking in.</p><p>He probably had Criminy, and now I knew that he had the real locket.</p><p>Soon he would have me, too.</p> <p>The church towered over me in the queasy green light of the storm\u2019s aftermath. It was both beautiful and hideous, which seemed to suit whatever gods claimed to rule Sang. And maybe they were watching over me, as I hadn\u2019t encountered a Copper or another bludrat since hitting the streets. At least I\u2019d gotten some sleep before the monsters had shown up to claim my dreaming body.</p><p>I stood in the same niche where Gerren the Copper had once urinated on me. I was on my own and unsure of the next step, but at least I had found something familiar. Should I attempt some sort of clever subterfuge or just walk right up and ring the old bastard\u2019s doorbell? Either way, he knew I was coming.</p><p>The choice was made for me when a huge dog barreled around the corner and knocked me over. Joff the Copper waddled after him, shouting, \u201cOi, Rudy! There\u2019s nothing there, you mangy cur!\u201d</p><p>Rudy growled and lunged for my legs, grasping a mouthful of taffeta in his slavering jaws. I tugged backward, but the teeth didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>I was caught.</p> <p>The animals of Sang had it in for me.</p><p>Joff screeched, \u201cGerren! Gerren! I see the locket. I\u2019ve got her! Rudy got her!\u201d</p><p>I did my best to break free from Rudy\u2019s vicious hold, trying to rip my skirt and run. Joff\u2019s eyes followed the movement of Rudy\u2019s head, and he saw what I was trying to do. He whipped out his billy club and swung it, and I ducked my face and threw up an arm.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough. The solid wood club thwacked off the side of my head, and I crumpled to the ground in an invisible heap. The last thing I saw as I went unconscious was Rudy\u2019s drool-covered teeth.</p><p>He seemed to be laughing.</p><p>It was a bad wake-up. My head was pounding, pain radiating from a tender spot just above my left ear. I blinked, and dull light stabbed my brain. I tried to lift a hand to my head, but my arm was pinned to my side. I looked down, and there was my body again, lumpy and stained in wet orange taffeta. It was a relief, being visible again, even if I looked awful. I was on a narrow bed, and leather straps held me at armpit, waist, thigh, and calf. My soggy gray stockings showed through a rip in my skirt, which was extra-wet with Rudy\u2019s tooth marks.</p> <p>I looked around the room, but I was alone. It was a guest room, a place where a maiden aunt would expect to stay for a long visit. Rocking chair, dresser, mirror, a ewer and basin like the one in my wagon, embroidered throw pillows, doilies sprouting everywhere like unwanted mushrooms. Several horrible oil paintings of flowers hung on the wall, along with a portrait of a much younger Jonah Goodwill. In it, he was about forty and looked hopeful and bright, with just the beginnings of his trademark mustache. He almost looked likable. A gold chain hung around his neck, an engagement ring resting over his heart.</p><p>I heard voices in the hallway and closed my eyes as the door swung open.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be asleep, dullard,\u201d Tabitha said. \u201cYou\u2019re not a good actress.\u201d</p><p>She flounced into the room wearing my locket\u2014probably the real one this time. Behind her was Jonah Goodwill himself.</p><p>He walked over to me with the same kindly smile and stroked my head, saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve given us quite the chase, Miss Paisley. And then you got yourself a head wound and stubbornly refused to wake up for quite some time. I do hope you won\u2019t cause me further problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Criminy?\u201d I growled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right here, of course,\u201d Mr. Goodwill said. Something about his friendly, understanding manner repulsed me, like that of a preacher with very bad intentions. Which was kind of what he was.</p><p>Two Coppers dragged Criminy into the room, his arms bound behind him. The Rafael Fester illusion was gone, and Criminy\u2019s own face was pale and drawn. His eyes met mine, and they were frantic and scared and defiant and loving, all at once. He wasn\u2019t wearing his coat of magical pockets, and there were patches of blood on his rumpled shirt. I ached for the comfort of touching him and strained against my bonds.</p> <p>\u201cLetitia,\u201d he rasped. \u201cWhatever he wants, don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough out of you,\u201d Goodwill said lightly. He pulled a white handkerchief out of his waistcoat and stuffed it into Criminy\u2019s mouth. Criminy gagged.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s have a little talk, shall we?\u201d the old man said. \u201cMr. Stain, won\u2019t you join us?\u201d</p><p>He gestured to the rocking chair, and the Coppers tossed Criminy into it and tied a rope around his chest. He struggled weakly, as if there was something wrong with him that I couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cMiss Scowl, I\u2019ll need that locket now,\u201d Mr. Goodwill said, and she reluctantly pulled the chain over her head and dropped it into the old man\u2019s glove. He reached to the table beside me and tossed the fake locket to her. She caught it with a smirk and wiped it off on her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cA ruby\u2019s a ruby, and fair is fair,\u201d she said with a curtsy. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget that her body\u2019s mine, after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never forget our arrangement, Miss Scowl.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cNow, go outside and play. You, too, boys. We have business.\u201d</p><p>Tabitha swished out of the room with a jolly \u201cTata, lover!\u201d and a blown kiss to Criminy. The Coppers followed her, one looking disgusted and the other intrigued by her back view. The door closed, and any evidence of goodwill left the face of Mr. Goodwill. \u201cNow that we\u2019re all cozy, I\u2019m gonna drop that Sangish tone and speak in a language you understand,\u201d he said with a deep Southern drawl. \u201cI know your secret, missy. And now you know mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything,\u201d I said, keeping my voice level and snotty.</p><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019re from America, and I know that you love that bloodsucking bastard over there,\u201d he said. \u201cTabitha told me what she smelled in the submarine. If you want him alive, you\u2019re going to do exactly what I say.\u201d</p><p>Criminy tried to talk around the cloth. All I heard was whimpering.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen,\u201d he growled. \u201cThat locket won\u2019t work for me. I can\u2019t get back home. Your pet vamp\u2019s magic must be tuned just to you. So here\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do. You\u2019re gonna put on that locket and go to sleep. And you\u2019re gonna go back to wherever you came from. And you\u2019re gonna bring me back something I\u2019ve been looking for for a long time.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close to my face, and his old-man breath washed over me as spit flicked past his gray mustache and onto my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna bring me back a disease.\u201d</p><p>34</p><p>I snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s crazy, right?\u201d I said. \u201cYou seriously think I\u2019m just going to go infect myself with a disease and slap on the locket and come back here? Do you think I\u2019m an idiot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you love this monster,\u201d he said with disgust. \u201cAnd I think you think you\u2019re a good person. I got no such illusions about who I am, little lady. That locket was my last chance. I can\u2019t get out of here, and I\u2019ve tried every kind of religion, white magic, and dark magic. You don\u2019t do as I say, and I\u2019ll torture and drain him. Then I\u2019ll go back to that filthy caravan and torture and kill all those people, too.\u201d</p><p>I could see the lunatic lurking behind his eyes, the one he hid from most of the world, along with that country drawl. Criminy looked horrified. And murderous.</p><p>I just stared at the old man, my jaw dropping. \u201cWhy?\u201d was all I could muster.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want more than a handful of dead folks. Because if I\u2019m stuck here, I want the Bludmen gone. I\u2019m on a mission, girly. I can\u2019t build Manchester into a wealthy, God-fearing city with these blasphemous monsters running around, infecting everyone. If I can rid Sang of the vampires, I\u2019ll be king of everything, forever. A hundred years from now, little kids will sit in church and look at stained-glass pictures of Jonah Goodwill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sick,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the sick one,\u201d he said. \u201cCavorting with bloodsuckers and freaks. My daddy was a preacher, and he would have had some choice words for a harlot like you. God sent me to this godforsaken place for a reason, and you\u2019re going to help me, or I\u2019ll destroy everything you care about.\u201d</p><p>There were some definite flaws in his reasoning, which was one of the benefits of dealing with a crazy person. I mean, if he was going to kill all of the Bludmen, that included Criminy, too, right? So where was my motivation? And how did he even know if a disease could exist here or affect Bludmen at all? But I wasn\u2019t about to argue with him about his diabolical plan. I wanted the locket, and I wanted Criminy alive.</p><p>\u201cIf I do what you want, what do I get in return?\u201d I asked. My eyes flicked to Criminy, hoping that he could trust me. After our run-in with the witch, he probably didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYour Bludman lives, and you can run off with your heathen caravan and do whatever the hell you want. And you can keep your locket, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to do me a lot of good if I\u2019ve got a disease,\u201d I said carefully.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you get it yourself. Bring me a Styrofoam cup of blood or a chopped-off drug addict\u2019s finger. Just bring me something that\u2019ll spread through blood and kill \u2019em all. This world\u2019s got no diseases. The flu would probably destroy half the population. But it\u2019s worth the risk.\u201d</p><p>There were at least three illogical statements in there, but I let it go and played along.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt him,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Across the room, Criminy closed his eyes and shook his head.</p><p>Jonah Goodwill smiled, his bright white teeth showing his good American brushing habits.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s shake on it and get you all fixed up before bedtime, sugar.\u201d</p><p>He reached down to grasp my hand where it lay, bloodless and still at my side. I did my best to smile and wiggle my fingers enthusiastically.</p><p>We had a deal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>True to his word, the old man had me fixed up. My bonds were released, and a bevy of scared Pinky servant girls helped me undress and wash in a copper tub of hot, perfumed water. Despite my reeling mind, it felt wonderful to be warm and dry and clean again. They fixed my hair and dressed me in an overly modest, blousy gray gown that resembled a sailor suit. It was hideous and bland compared with the shimmering things I\u2019d grown accustomed to, and I wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead in it, given the choice. The floppy boater hat with long ribbons added insult to injury.</p><p>Next, they ushered me into the dining room, where I was forced to sit at the foot of the table and sip soup across from Magistrate Goodwill. I didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, although I\u2019d barely eaten in days. The dead, bloodthirsty stares of the stags and antelopes and moose on the wall seemed to accuse me of treachery with every spoonful.</p><p>I was thankful that the old man chose not to converse. From time to time, he spoke kindly to the servants or complimented the food with his cultured Sangish accent. I minded my manners and kept my mouth shut, hoping to appear stupid, or at least dull and uncreative. I had to wonder if Criminy and I were the only people to hear his real accent since his early days in Sang, before he learned to conceal it.</p> <p>As the servants bustled around and removed my dainty dish of uneaten cherry pie, I fidgeted and looked down, saying, \u201cMaster Goodwill, may I please see Criminy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, my dear,\u201d he intoned. \u201cI do believe that\u2019s a terrible idea. That vicious killer is a very bad influence on you. And he might even try to hurt you. I could never allow that to happen.\u201d</p><p>The maid clearing Mr. Goodwill\u2019s dishes wiped a tear from her eye and gazed at him with adoration. I tried not to barf.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I will allow you to sit quietly in the garden for an hour or so before bedtime. The fresh air will be quite invigorating. I do believe a good night\u2019s sleep can cure any ill, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I mumbled, feeling the eyes of the servants judging me. No allies there.</p> <p>After dinner, a silent and surly Copper escorted me out the French doors into a beautiful garden. Everything but his sharp nose and scowling mouth was hidden by goggles and leather, but I could tell that my guard disapproved of such vibrant frivolity. Or maybe he just disapproved of a bludhoney like me.</p><p>Irises and lilies and roses danced against the dull gray sky, and I leaned down to inhale their perfume. I walked the brick paths toward the orchard trees, apples and tangerines and plums planted in neat rows within the high stone walls of the old monastery. Very few people in Manchester knew what wealth lurked in Mr. Goodwill\u2019s little Eden, I was willing to bet. He didn\u2019t seem like the sort who enjoyed sharing with his inferiors.</p><p>A swaybacked cow dozed placidly across the yard, and she lowed at me as I approached. I expected her to hiss and bare teeth, but then I saw her messy pile of hay and remembered what Joff and Gerren had said about a bludless cow. I patted her bony brown flank and said, \u201cGood luck, Bossy.\u201d</p><p>Under my Copper\u2019s watchful goggles, I settled on a wooden bench among the roses and pulled up my knees to watch the spectacular sunset. Clouds so low and thick that I could almost touch them were painted inch by inch with the bright red and orange of the heavy sun. I imagined the sullen city below us, the labyrinthine streets unfolding in their dirty glory beyond the high walls of the garden.</p><p>It was an ugly place but not without small beauties, not without things I would miss.</p><p>I swiveled my gaze back to the house, the bricks painted stark white like that of a plantation house from my own country. He\u2019d turned the refectory into his own little Tara. The sunset writhed over the bricks, casting orange shadows like fire on the peaceful scene. Cheerful lamps shone from every window, and I tried to imagine Criminy behind one of them, tied to the rocking chair. Hungry, hurt, confused. Not knowing what choice I would make once the locket was in my hands. Stay with him? Kill his people? Disappear forever? And I had to wonder\u2014did he have any faith in me at all?</p> <p>Had I given him any reason to?</p><p>The wind sighed through the trees, and I thought I caught a whisper of berries on the breeze, a breath released in resignation.</p><p>I was glad that I had told him I loved him before we went through the gate.</p><p>I hoped he believed it.</p><p>After the sun had set, we all returned to our places in the guest room, except that I wasn\u2019t bound to the bed this time. Criminy was still tied to the chair, and he seemed even more miserable and sick than before. Mr. Goodwill smiled, smug and righteous, like a cat that had eaten the canary and spit out the wings. The Coppers stood, masked by their uniforms, inhuman as blank walls. At least Tabitha wasn\u2019t there to gloat.</p><p>I lay back, and Mr. Goodwill draped the locket over my neck. I sighed as it fell over my heart and cupped it with my hands. Relief coursed through me, and it was all I could do to prevent a smile of joy from transforming my face. I was supposed to appear worried and trapped.</p><p>Criminy leaned forward in his chair, straining against the rope, his muffled voice choking behind the gag.</p><p>\u201cShall I swat him, sir?\u201d one of the Coppers offered, holding up his billy club.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Goodwill said. \u201cLet him watch. Let him suffer.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled down in the bed, and the old man pushed a button to turn off the lamp. We were bathed in near darkness, and the room felt small and pressing and airless. Only the candle at Goodwill\u2019s side remained lit, casting a ghostly glow over his hungry eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Criminy,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>And I turned my head away.</p><p>35</p><p>My eyes flew open as I hit the floor. Something loud clattered beside me and splashed warm liquid over my face.</p><p>I saw the side of a bed and a great deal of shag carpet. There was my hand in a latex glove and, a few feet away, a metal bedpan. A yellow puddle spread out around me, soaking into the carpet, and I coughed.</p><p>\u201cTish!\u201d an old man called. \u201cMiss Everett! Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>I pushed myself up to sitting and smiled at Mr. Rathbin. \u201cI must have tripped. How silly of me. Let me clean this up.\u201d</p><p>As quickly as I could, I soaked up the urine with paper towels and sprayed the carpet as if nothing unusual had happened. Inside, though, I was ecstatic.</p><p>Of course, I knew exactly where I was and exactly what had happened. I stroked the tarnished locket, putting the puzzle together finally. The whole time I\u2019d been in Sang since Goodwill had stolen the locket, not a single second had passed in my world. It had to be the locket\u2019s spell that made time there run differently for me. Time passed for Casper and Jonah Goodwill and everyone else who was brain-dead or under anesthesia or dreaming. But not me. When the locket was off, I didn\u2019t lose a single second of my life on Earth. If not for Madam Burial stealing my years in Sang, if not for the locket aging me faster there, it would have been a perfect arrangement.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t brain-dead. Nana wasn\u2019t killing herself with worry. And now I knew exactly how the locket worked. If I fell asleep wearing it, I would magically wake up in the other world, whichever one I wasn\u2019t currently in. If I took it off in either world, no time passed in the other world. But every second I spent in Sang as a human with the locket intact meant that I aged faster and faster in both worlds, my time stolen by the witch.</p><p>I could almost have it all, just by taking off the necklace at the right time. I could have Nana and Mr. Surly and hamburgers and pet harmless little bunnies on Earth. And then I could be a part-time fortune-telling gypsy queen in a traveling show with Criminy. I could still be human, be myself. At least for a little while. It all depended on how fast Madam Burial stole my years, how much faster I aged thanks to the locket.</p><p>Criminy had said I would always be beautiful to him, but I was guessing neither one of us wanted me to get too old and wrinkly. Still, there was time.</p><p>Now all I had to do was save him and his entire race before bedtime.</p><p>I could do that.</p><p>But first I had to take care of my next patient, Mrs. Henderson. With distinct thoughts of Criminy, I slyly pocketed a bottle from her medicine cabinet. She was sleeping, she was forgetful, and her son would happily run to the pharmacy for her tomorrow when her meds turned up missing for the umpteenth time. No problem.</p><p>Then I called in sick, claiming to have a fever. Another nurse would cover my next three patients, including Mr. Sterling. I would have to be transferred off his case. Seeing him like that, knowing that it was within my power to bring him back and that I had chosen my own happiness instead ... it was just too depressing.</p><p>He would have to find his own future without me. My first glance of him had shown me that loss would be his salvation, and I hoped it came to pass. I had seen pain, but I had also seen adventure and joy and a destiny not unlike my own, far away in Sang. He would be changed, but for the better. The second glance had been a new possibility, a fork in the road, and part of me would always regret not taking it. But I was committed to my path, and there was no time to lose.</p><p>When I got to Nana\u2019s house, I was in a hurry. It was almost six, and I still had a long way to go.</p><p>She caught me glancing at the clock and said, \u201cSugar, did someone light a fire under your tail?\u201d Her mouth turned down at the corners, but I grinned. Part of me just loved it when she got her dander up\u2014it meant that she was still fighting.</p><p>\u201cNo, Nana,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a date tonight, and I don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, honey,\u201d she said, clapping her hands. \u201cTell me all about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really handsome,\u201d I said with a coy smile. \u201cHe\u2019s an entrepreneur and a magician. And he\u2019s pretty much the complete opposite of Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do I get to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s really busy. And I need to make sure he\u2019s \u2018The One\u2019 before I go introducing him to your cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust make sure he takes care of you,\u201d she said. \u201cA true gentleman is so rare these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d I said, but it weighed heavily on my mind that right now, I needed to be taking care of him, back in his world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tucked her into bed and wrapped my arms around her. My heart tugged, as it always did, when I felt how frail she was getting, how narrow her shoulders seemed. She had always been solid, a rock of comfort and warmth who had eclipsed my distant mother and overly busy father in my heart. But I couldn\u2019t escape the fact that she was losing her battle, and nothing in the world could help her.</p><p>After I walked out her door, I was all business. I drove to the library and waited my turn for a free computer. I typed \u201chelping hands homecare\u201d into the search engine, and on the second page, I found it. The same logo from the van in my glance of Jonah Goodwill, two hands forming a heart. Luckily, they weren\u2019t far enough away to get me on a plane, but the two-hundred-mile drive to Greenville was going to take much longer than I would have liked. I scribbled down the number.</p><p>Alone in my car, I made the call. The night nurse said, \u201cHelping Hands Homecare, we bring the care to you. This is Terry Ann.\u201d She sounded bored. I could almost hear her doing a crossword with her TV on low volume in the background.</p> <p>\u201cHi there, Terry Ann,\u201d I said with the kind of smile that travels through phone lines. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to bother you tonight, but I\u2019m a nurse at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, and I\u2019ve got a patient named Louise Shepherd who\u2019s on her last legs, and she\u2019s trying to find a Mr. Grove somewhere near Greenville. She said that he\u2019s on home care after a head injury, and he\u2019s one of your clients. Is there any way you could help me find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, we don\u2019t release the personal information of our patients,\u201d she droned.</p><p>\u201cI understand that, and I\u2019m so sorry to ask, but I promised her I\u2019d try. I\u2019ve been taking care of her for a few weeks, and her mind comes and goes, and Mr. Grove is all she ever talks about. She can\u2019t even remember his first name, and she doesn\u2019t seem to understand that he\u2019s unresponsive. But she wanted to give him a keepsake, her husband\u2019s Purple Heart from the war. Maybe I could mail it to you, and you could give it to him?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, and I could hear her reserve crumbling. That sounded like a lot of work, and she\u2019d like to get rid of me, but as a nurse, I understood how these things worked. Nurses work in nursing because they like helping people, after all.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I ain\u2019t supposed to do this,\u201d she said, her voice low. \u201cBut my grandfather had a Purple Heart, too, and I know what a big deal that is to old folks. I believe you\u2019re talking about Mr. Jonathan Grove of 1655 Sycamore Lane in Anderson. But you didn\u2019t hear that from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you so much!\u201d I gushed. \u201cYou have just made my night and her year. She\u2019ll be able to go to her eternal rest now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck, ma\u2019am, and God bless,\u201d she said before hanging up.</p><p>I felt a little bad for heartlessly killing the fictitious Louise Shepherd, but it was for a good cause. And I was pretty sure she didn\u2019t feel a thing.</p><p>I programmed the address into my GPS and started driving. I listened to my favorite CDs and enjoyed the safety and silence of my world, my car a little fortress of solitude. I thought through the plan over and over again in my head, trying to work out every detail. For all of his own planning, Jonah Goodwill had missed a lot of details himself, and I wondered if his mind was slipping. He was a man of power and influence, but doctors didn\u2019t seem to exist in Sang. Maybe he was suffering from dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, something they would have caught in my world. Or maybe he\u2019d just started out plumb crazy.</p><p>It was pitch dark as I zoomed over the state line. I navigated past fields and strip malls and trailer parks until I turned onto Sycamore Lane. The country road was long and barely lit and lonely, but I eventually saw the brick wall from my glance, lit up by fancy yard lights. The matching brick house was needlessly huge, and I imagined that the lawn-care staff was even more extensive than the one at Eden House in Sang.</p><p>All that trouble for a vegetable who\u2019d never wake up. What a waste.</p> <p>I stopped in a dark spot a hundred yards away and straightened my scrubs. I put my ID badge into the glove compartment and tucked the locket under my shirt. I didn\u2019t know who would be in the house, whether a nurse stayed around the clock or Mr. Goodwill had a housekeeper or a housesitter or an entire extended family. I just had to hope that whoever it was wasn\u2019t very bright. Or nosy.</p><p>For the tenth time, I checked to make sure that I had all the supplies I needed in my tote bag before I rolled the car into the driveway. No Helping Hands van, which was good. A layperson would be much easier to deal with. Before knocking on the door, I put on my brightest smile.</p><p>Time to channel the talented and charismatic Lady Letitia Paisley.</p><p>The first knock didn\u2019t raise anybody, so I rang the doorbell. There was movement within, and the porch lights came on, nearly blinding me. And then I heard a click I\u2019d heard only in movies, and the door opened, and I was staring into the barrel of a shotgun. After all, it was the middle of the night on a lonely road in the country.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d said a teenage boy in an open bathrobe and boxer shorts. His glasses were smudged, and there were Cheetos crumbs clinging sadly to a couple of hairs above his lip.</p><p>I looked over the gun and smiled nervously.</p><p>\u201cHi. Did Terry Ann at Helping Hands tell you I would be coming? I\u2019m Carrie, and I have Mr. Grove\u2019s medicine.\u201d</p><p>The shotgun dropped, and the boy sniffed. \u201cNobody called. Sorry \u2019bout the gun. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it is,\u201d I said apologetically. I held my tote bag open and said, \u201cI\u2019m just filling in. His usual nurse forgot to switch out the IV bag, and they also wanted to start him on IV Zosyn. It\u2019s an antibiotic. It\u2019ll just take me a minute.\u201d</p><p>The sullen boy opened the door, and I stepped into a beautiful marble foyer with the sort of curving staircase that must come equipped with at least one debutante in a white dress.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you Mr. Grove\u2019s grandson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Toby. We all take turns staying over here, because Grampa\u2019s lawyer\u2019s too cheap to hire somebody. At least he\u2019s got good cable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good boy to take care of your grandfather,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI never even met him,\u201d the boy said. He shuffled over to loaf on a long corner sofa in the next room and turned on the TV. \u201cHe\u2019s been out for, like, twenty years.\u201d</p><p>He sat down with his back to me and started switching channels, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s upstairs in the big room.\u201d</p><p>I walked up the curving staircase and padded down the deep carpet to the only door with a light shining inside. On the way, I didn\u2019t pass a single family photograph or heirloom. The house reminded me of something set up for a magazine. Some obsessively neat aunt probably hired a decorator every five years or so to redo the whole place around the softly breathing man in the bedroom, who never even knew what the walls looked like.</p><p>The door was ajar, and I slipped in. There he was, lying in the bed I\u2019d seen in my glance. He was propped up with pillows, and his mustache and hair were carefully trimmed. Even his pajamas were crisp, although I thought it ironic that the top button was unbuttoned, which could never happen in Sang. The room was warm and stuffy, and there was nothing personal, not a single memento. In the background, the radio hummed old-fashioned hymns.</p><p>No wonder the old man in Sang was crazy.</p><p>I walked to the window, which was covered by thick, light-blocking draperies. Peeking out, I had d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, even though it was nighttime. That glorious magnolia reigned over the walled-in garden, sister to the greenspace behind Eden House. The man simply could not let go of his old life. I opened the drapes all the way. The waxy white blooms glowed in the moonlight, and I wondered if Mr. Goodwill shivered in Sang, thinking that a goose had walked over his grave as he kept vigil over my body and Criminy\u2019s fury.</p><p>Back to my patient. He had a port in his chest for the IV, and I had to unbutton his pajama top to get to it. Luckily, the IV bag was nice and full, so I had plenty of time; his real nurse must have left recently. I leaned out through the doorway and heard Toby open a soft-drink can and collapse on the couch. Then I heard soft moans. Excellent\u2014careless, hormonal grandson plugged into Cinemax. I closed the door gently and locked it, then turned on the overhead light.</p><p>With loving precision, I laid out my supplies on the bed.</p><p>36</p><p>The timing had to be just right.</p><p>Step One: Prepare the syringe, draw up 250 units of Mrs. Henderson\u2019s pilfered insulin, and inject it into Mr. Grove\u2019s IV line.</p><p>Step Two: Use the baby butterfly needle to draw a tube of my own blood.</p><p>Mr. Goodwill didn\u2019t know that nothing translated from world to world except my body and the locket. I couldn\u2019t bring over a syringe or a cup or a finger in a baggie, per his instructions.</p><p>Step Three: Stuff everything back into the bag, lie down on my back on the floor, and pour the syringe of my own blood into my mouth.</p><p>I really didn\u2019t like Step Three.</p><p>Step Four: Let my complete exhaustion overtake me in sleep.</p><p>I\u2019d considered taking meds to induce my rest, but I didn\u2019t want to lie around on the floor, drugged up at his bedside, when I came back. Getting out of that house without real-world consequences was going to take my best acting performance yet.</p><p>Excited as I was, I knew that sleep would claim me as quickly as ever.</p><p>Step Five: Hope that my mouth stayed shut when I went unconscious.</p><p>Step Six: Pray that my cockamamie plan worked.</p><p>37</p><p>My eyes flickered open, and I fought the urge to spew blood all over the place. Somehow I managed to keep my lips together and my cheeks puffed. I sat up and found Criminy across the dark room. The curtains were drawn closed, and brilliant sunlight burned around the edges. Jonah Goodwill slumped at my bedside, snoring through his mustache.</p><p>Criminy\u2019s eyes were wide and panicky, his mouth still stuffed with a handkerchief. When he saw that I was conscious, I gave him an exaggerated wink and tried to ease myself silently off the bed. It creaked, and Goodwill startled awake. I sank back down and tried to look pained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you got it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head and pointed to my bulging cheeks. Then I pointed to the door and held my hand up at chest height with a questioning \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get it, so I tried a pantomime of a slutty lady with fangs. Mr. Goodwill caught on and chuckled. He rang a bell, and when a servant appeared, he said, \u201cPlease ask Miss Scowl and Rodvey to join us.\u201d</p> <p>My cheeks burned, and the blood began to seep down my throat a little. I tried not to gag.</p><p>A few moments later, Tabitha Scowl swooped into the room, followed by my old, venomous friend Rodvey, who was obviously disgusted with the lot of us.</p><p>\u201cRodvey, please hold Miss Scowl\u2019s arms behind her back,\u201d Goodwill said conversationally, and quick as a snake, Tabitha was caught painfully and fighting Rodvey\u2019s grasp. The fake locket bounced off her chest as she struggled.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t part of the bargain, Jonah!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a test of your loyalty, my dear,\u201d he said kindly. Then he took my gloved hand to help me up from the bed and ushered me over to the tiny, squirming Bludwoman.</p> <p>Just as I was about to spit the blood at her, Goodwill said, \u201cAnd now, Tabitha, if you will, please remove the handkerchief from Mr. Stain\u2019s mouth.\u201d</p><p>Rodvey let go of Tabitha, and she chuckled darkly as she sashayed to Criminy and slowly removed the gag. Then she stood back, arms crossed over her chest, to watch the show.</p><p>Criminy took in a big breath and said, \u201cNot to be too repetitive, but this wasn\u2019t part of the bargain, Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019d ever be peaceable after this,\u201d Goodwill snapped. \u201cYou\u2019d be at my throat tomorrow, or starting a riot, or telling the newspapers. You\u2019re far too dangerous to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my costumer?\u201d Criminy asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s drained,\u201d Goodwill said curtly. Criminy bared his teeth and strained at his bonds, and Goodwill held his hand out to me and said, \u201cNow, Miss Paisley, if you will.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head no.</p><p>\u201cGive him the blood, or you both die.\u201d</p><p>I gave him my most eloquent look of tortured pain over comically puffed cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d the old man said.</p><p>I walked heavily to the chair and leaned over to put my hands on the sides of Criminy\u2019s face. Then I kissed him, parting my lips to let the blood rush from my mouth into his. There was a sort of primal sexuality to it, feeling the hot, red liquid mingle between us, and his tongue lapped it up hungrily. I almost swooned as I pulled away, and he couldn\u2019t help licking the drips off his chin afterward, still watching me.</p><p>With hands over my face, I jogged to the basin and pushed the button for water, then rinsed my mouth out as well as I could.</p><p>\u201cAlcohol?\u201d I spluttered.</p><p>\u201cRodvey?\u201d Mr. Goodwill asked.</p> <p>\u201cLeft coat pocket,\u201d Rodvey grunted, still holding Tabitha tightly.</p><p>Mr. Goodwill handed me the flask, and whatever was inside burned my mouth with fumes redolent of paint thinner. I spit it out and rinsed again, then rinsed with water. At least it wasn\u2019t actually diseased. The rinsing was mainly for show. I was banking on Jonah Goodwill\u2019s ignorance of modern infectious disease. Twenty years out of my world, and he\u2019d probably believe we had colonized Mars.</p><p>Leaning over the basin, I willed myself to cry and splashed water over my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Goodwill asked me.</p><p>\u201cEbola,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s only communicable through bodily fluids, and I\u2019ve been vaccinated. I\u2019m a nurse, so I got the blood from a patient who had just succumbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember hearing about that one before I came here. That was clever,\u201d he said, nodding appreciatively. \u201cWhat are the symptoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom fresh blood, and without medication, it\u2019ll be spasms, hemorrhage, and death,\u201d I sniffled between sobs. \u201cWithin minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about your man,\u201d Goodwill said, in a voice that made it clear that he wasn\u2019t sorry at all. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Tabitha and Rodvey turned to go, but Goodwill stopped in the doorway, blocking them.</p><p>\u201cThat is,\u201d he said with a cruel grin, \u201cafter he bites Miss Scowl. It\u2019s no good if we don\u2019t spread it around, eh? We\u2019ll drain him afterward and disperse the vials, of course. But it\u2019ll be good to have two fresh bodies of tainted blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonah\u2014\u201d Tabitha said, backing away.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Magistrate Goodwill,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cNow, bite her quick, boy. I\u2019ve got a genocide to plan.\u201d</p><p>Rodvey cut Criminy\u2019s rope, and the Bludman stood slowly, focused on Tabitha. He stalked toward her, and she cringed away from him.</p><p>\u201cCrim, no,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember our good times? Remember the caravan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mostly remember the island and the inn,\u201d he growled, and then he leaped at her. They fell to the ground as he ripped the flesh of her neck, drinking deeply.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drain her completely,\u201d Goodwill said, unholstering a miniature crossbow and holding it up to Criminy\u2019s temple. \u201cI need her blud.\u201d</p><p>Criminy pulled away from the blood frenzy, his pupils engulfing his eyes in black. Tabitha lay there, her skirts in disarray and her chest barely moving. Criminy was panting, and he wiped his face carelessly as he stood. He gave Goodwill an evil, blood-tinged smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the last meal,\u201d he said, and then he twitched.</p><p>\u201cGlad you enjoyed your own taste of death,\u201d Goodwill said. \u201cRodvey, stay until he\u2019s gone, then bring Miss Paisley to the dining room.\u201d And he shut the door, leaving Rodvey behind with us.</p><p>\u201cDie already,\u201d the Copper said, with a lazy hand on his own holstered crossbow. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly time for tea.\u201d</p><p>Criminy twitched again, then spasmed, then went into a sort of seizure. Frothing at the mouth, he bumped into me, then caromed off the mirror and bumped into Rodvey, who shouted, \u201cGet off me, Bluddy!\u201d and pushed him away. I was trying my best to act distraught and betrayed and confused, but I wasn\u2019t sure where to look. Criminy\u2019s mad dance was both terrifying and hilarious, and he was spitting blood all over the place. An especially big glob hit the portrait of Goodwill, and I had to turn my laugh into a choked sob.</p><p>Then I heard a small thwack. When I next looked at Rodvey, there was a short, thick arrow sprouting from his chest. Criminy had stopped jerking around, and Rodvey\u2019s miniature crossbow was in his hands, with one bolt missing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good shot,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is this stuff actually going to kill me? Because that blood tasted delightful. Like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s clean,\u201d I said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to run. In about five minutes, Goodwill\u2019s going to notice something is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just pretend to be dead for a while so you can escape out the window?\u201d Criminy asked. \u201cPretending to be dead is rather enjoyable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time to pretend,\u201d I said, throwing open the curtains. \u201cBack in my world, I injected his body with insulin. If it works the way I think it does, he\u2019ll be dead here in ten minutes. It\u2019s got some lag time, but he\u2019s going to know there\u2019s something wrong. We\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>The window was all panes and couldn\u2019t be opened, exactly what you\u2019d expect from an antiquated, paranoid lunatic. I turned to search the room, but Criminy\u2019s boot shot through the window, kicking out wooden slats and panes of glass into the bed of orange lilies outside. Taking my hand, he led me out into the bright morning sun. The day was gorgeous, glinting with raindrops and prisms and happy plants.</p><p>But there was no time to enjoy the rare sight of a nice day in Manchester. We took off running toward the far wall of the priory, and I could only assume that Criminy was going to find a way to boost me over the smooth white stones that rose at least eight feet tall.</p><p>\u201cThis would be a lot easier if I had enough time for a glamour. Can\u2019t you run any faster, love?\u201d he inquired, not even panting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long couple of days,\u201d I said, most definitely panting. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I haven\u2019t fallen and dragged you down with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like my kind of fun,\u201d he said. He laughed as he ran, and my heart swelled with unexpected love.</p><p>We were in the orchard then, running in a straight line between two rows of trees. The dappled shade flickered as we flew over the earth, and the cow stopped grazing to watch our progress with interest. It was probably the most exciting thing she\u2019d seen in her entire life.</p><p>It felt as if we had been running forever and would run forever, as if the trees would just go on and on, one after the other. But the wall was closer, and my chest was going to burst soon, and Criminy slowed down as he angled toward a giant old oak tree with branches that swung conveniently near the high wall.</p><p>\u201cLet me boost you up,\u201d he said.</p><p>I lifted my boot, and he practically tossed me onto the lowest branch. I landed on my belly, my wind knocked out, and reached for the next branch. The slippery glove was almost my downfall, and I removed both of the stupid satin things and tossed them to the ground. The billowy sailor dress caught on twigs and under my toes and made upward movement almost impossible, but I tugged myself over two more branches and edged out, holding on to smaller branches to steady myself.</p><p>I could see the gritty streets of Manchester over the wall. It was amazing how filthy and bustling the world was outside Jonah Goodwill\u2019s private Eden. A little girl in a full-body pinafore tugging a wooden duck on a string stopped to point at me, and her nanny scolded her for woolgathering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to hurry, love,\u201d Criminy urged.</p><p>I turned to snap at him, and my hand slipped. I nearly fell, swinging around and ending up with my back to the trunk, scrabbling for purchase on a crooked branch with arms flung outward.</p><p>It was no good. I was slipping, and Criminy was too far below me to help. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt a sharp tug on my neck as I slipped. My locket. It was caught on the sharp end of a broken branch.</p><p>Even before I had registered what was happening, I fell.</p><p>A heartbeat later, my boots landed on a lower branch, and Criminy\u2019s arms steadied me, pinning me to the trunk. I hugged the tree, with tears squirting out of my closed eyes, trying to make my throat work again. With one hand clinging to a branch, I felt my neck.</p> <p>The locket was gone.</p><p>38</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked down.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>Criminy stood one branch below me, frowning at the ground. The locket lay in a patch of grass, ruby side up and glinting in the morning sun. When he gazed up at me, Criminy\u2019s eyes were more fierce and wild than they had been even when he faced the bludstag. Everything in him that wasn\u2019t human was written in that glance.</p> <p>\u201cCriminy, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised,\u201d he said.</p><p>And then he jumped.</p><p>39</p><p>My attention was pulled from Criminy\u2019s leap by an odd noise, like a lawn mower. Whatever it was, it was getting louder, and fast. I pushed a leafy branch aside but couldn\u2019t see what was coming.</p><p>Criminy landed on the ground in a crouch, scooping up the locket and tucking it into his waistcoat in one smooth motion. Then he leaped, his lean body arching like a cat\u2019s as his gloveless claws sought purchase in the bark. As his feet touched the first branch and propelled him upward, a crossbow bolt lodged in the tree trunk and quivered.</p> <p>A three-wheeled vehicle skidded to a halt below us, a strange contraption that looked like a golf cart crossed with a sketch by Leonardo da Vinci. A Copper in full uniform was driving, and Jonah Goodwill was slumped in the passenger seat, a large crossbow in his arms. Another bolt whistled through the air by Criminy\u2019s hand as the Copper joined the bow fight. Criminy pulled himself up, climbing like a squirrel. As he stood, Goodwill\u2019s next bolt rustled the leaves over Criminy\u2019s head. I was amazed that the old man was still conscious, and for a terrified moment, I wondered if I had been wrong. Maybe killing his body in my world wouldn\u2019t kill him here. Then we\u2019d be in serious trouble.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done,\u201d the old man shouted in his deep Southern drawl, all Sangish affectation forgotten. \u201cBut I\u2019ll kill you for it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to get over the wall,\u201d Criminy grunted as his belly hit the branch by my boots. He held out a hand to me, and I took the locket from his black-scaled fingers and shoved it down the tight neck of my gown.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I begged, grasping his hand to pull him up. \u201cYou\u2019re almost here. We can do it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled sadly and looked down.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I saw the crossbow bolt through his calf, pinning him to the heavy branch below.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it, Letitia,\u201d he said. \u201cJust get over the wall and go to Antonin. I\u2019ll find a way. I\u2019ll find you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only have to last another minute,\u201d I said, frantic and unwilling to abandon him. \u201cThe old man\u2014\u201d</p> <p>And then I heard a thwack, and a crossbow bolt bloomed from his throat.</p><p>Blood spattered over my face and my dress, but I was already in shock. His eyes went wide with surprise. He looked down at the metal point dripping with his blud, then fell slowly backward. It was almost graceful, until the bolt in his leg stopped his downward motion. His body jerked around it and spun, leaving him hanging upside down by the arrow\u2019s shaft.</p><p>For only a moment, he floated in space, his hair blowing in the breeze. Then the arrow broke, and he fell to the ground with a nasty thud.</p><p>Goodwill cackled in triumph.</p><p>I took one last look at freedom over the wall. Just a few more feet, and I would have been out of the orchard and on my way to the tailor\u2019s shop. But I couldn\u2019t leave Criminy. I began to climb down. I skidded and slipped, just as I had going up, and the bark tore at my hands and wrists, where I\u2019d pulled off my gloves to climb. A broken branch ripped open my left palm, but I didn\u2019t register the pain. I swung down from the lowest branch and landed in the dirt beside Criminy\u2019s still form.</p><p>Ignoring Goodwill, I rolled Criminy over so that he was on his back and cradled his head in my lap. It wasn\u2019t easy, with the arrow shaft poking out through both sides of his neck. When I saw that he was breathing, I started breathing again, too. Maybe there was still time to save him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do to me, girly?\u201d Goodwill asked, and I could hear the slurring in his voice. I couldn\u2019t believe he wasn\u2019t dead yet.</p><p>\u201cI told you to watch out for dark-haired strangers, Mr. Grove,\u201d I said, my voice breaking.</p><p>As he struggled to aim his crossbow at me, I bent my head over Criminy and stroked his face with my bare hands. I felt his lips twitch as he smelled the fresh blood on the scratches. When his tongue shot out and started licking the wound on my palm, I cradled his head and shook with sobs, my now loose hair flopping over us both. Whatever pleasure he could get from the blood, I hoped it would help make his last moments better.</p><p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d the old man said, accusing. \u201cAll along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew enough to find you,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I knew enough to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Goodwill flopped over, the crossbow in his hands shaking. He was breathing heavily, sweating and shaking.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>\u201cKeep your crossbow ready. I want answers before she dies,\u201d Goodwill said to the Copper, but he was struggling to stay conscious. His head flipped back, his eyes open to the sky.</p><p>\u201cTwenty years you\u2019ve been here,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd your grandson let me in your door with a bottle of insulin. Too bad you weren\u2019t around to teach that boy not to open the door to strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat blood,\u201d Goodwill said. \u201cWasn\u2019t even tainted, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I said. \u201cBut yours is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ... shoot her now ... Ferling,\u201d Goodwill said, panting and fighting for consciousness.</p><p>But Ferling put down his crossbow and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I will, begging your pardon, sir. She done me a favor once. Saved my life.\u201d</p><p>The old man was panting, and his hand shook as he lifted the crossbow and pointed it at me, point-blank range. Before he could shoot, it clattered to the ground. He fell back, clutching something under his shirt, his hand trembling.</p><p>\u201cYou know why Evangel never loved you?\u201d I said, my voice raw. \u201cNot because you were human. Not because Bludmen have magic.\u201d I watched him gasp.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a bad person.\u201d</p><p>I looked up then to watch the moment when Jonah Goodwill left this world. His old body shuddered and went limp, his face to the clouds. I briefly wondered whether he would wake up in Anderson for just a second, just long enough to see the magnolia\u2019s shadow dancing on the wall and my body splayed out on the floor.</p><p>40</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, madam,\u201d Ferling said. \u201cBut I believe I hear someone calling me from the house.\u201d</p><p>He got up and walked away, as simple as that. I guess the Copper had taken my advice and found peace with his wife. And Criminy had taken care of Rodvey. My glancing had been helpful all around, and Ferling had indeed remembered my final words. Maybe all Coppers weren\u2019t that bad.</p><p>But glancing couldn\u2019t help me now. The future I\u2019d seen was shattered. I looked down at the pale face in my lap, the arrow quivering obscenely. Just a tiny trickle of blud eased down his neck into his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cPull it out,\u201d he wheezed.</p><p>So I gritted my teeth and grabbed the red-stained shaft behind the cruel, metal point and gently tugged.</p><p>He groaned and hissed. \u201cPull harder.\u201d</p><p>I was panicking, and I could feel my heartbeat in my temples. I was a nurse, dammit, but I wasn\u2019t trained for a world this hard. I grasped the arrow again, put a hand on Criminy\u2019s neck for leverage, and yanked straight up as smoothly as I could.</p><p>The arrow caught for a second, then slithered out of his throat with a wet, sucking sound. He drew a deep breath, but it whistled. I was watching him, evaluating him for signs of anoxia, biting my lip. Waiting for him to die and leave me alone in a strange country, among enemies.</p><p>For just a second there, I wished I had had the witch\u2019s potion with me. In my world, I could save him. But the little bottle was far away, sitting on the bedside table in my wagon. He would have wanted to die under the heavy sky of Sang, anyway, not trapped in a hospital in my world, far from the touch of magic.</p><p>He coughed and spasmed, and blood sprayed from his mouth.</p><p>It was the end.</p><p>I bowed my head and sobbed, thinking of everything I wished I had told him. I couldn\u2019t find the words, couldn\u2019t articulate what he meant to me, what he had taught me about myself in such a short time. I hadn\u2019t understood, not until just then, how one could be both captured and tamed at the same time. I cried for all of the adventures with him that I was going to miss now and how there was nothing more for me in Sang. I cried for how colorless and bland my own world would seem, endless days of helping people die and eating tomato soup with my cat and knowing that I had held something fine and not understood its value until I lost it.</p><p>His chest stopped moving, his eyes open to the sky.</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>41</p><p>Then he lurched up, sitting\u2014and laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was fun, eh?\u201d he said.</p><p>I choked on nothing, and he smacked my back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I shrieked. \u201cI\u2019m watching you die. You\u2019re dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any more than usual,\u201d he said with a shrug and a grin.</p><p>I hiccuped. I sniffled. And then I went back to crying my eyes out, but in relief this time. He whipped out the remaining bit of arrow still in his calf and rubbed the blud off his boot. Tossing the arrow aside, he pulled me against his chest, shushing me and patting me. I felt very much like a lost kitten.</p><p>\u201cYou nearly died.\u201d I snuffled. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be comforting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiffle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hardier than that. I told you Bludmen are hard to kill. But you, lass! Oh, you were magnificent. You tricked that old bastard right into his grave. You saved thousands of people. And your dress is truly hideous. I demand you take it off at the earliest possible convenience.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I giggled a little and pulled away. He smiled at me, and I put a finger to the ragged hole in his throat.</p><p>\u201cJust a flesh wound,\u201d he said. It was already starting to close up. He puffed out his cheeks, and a little fizzle of air hissed under my finger and made me laugh.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t try that trick at the caravan,\u201d I sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t like it a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSame to you,\u201d he said, hopping to his feet and pulling me up after him. \u201cExcept that bit with the tongue kissing and the mouthful of blood. I rather enjoyed that.\u201d</p><p>We limped to the tree, but he pulled my hand back and kissed the ragged palm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to ask you for a favor, love,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cName it,\u201d I said. But I already knew what he was going to ask.</p><p>\u201cI need some blood,\u201d he said. \u201cTo help me heal, so I can get you over that wall and to safety before the Coppers realize what\u2019s happened. I\u2019m half-drained. But I know where his secret cellar is now, so the whole torture thing wasn\u2019t a total loss.\u201d</p> <p>I reached up to the high neck of my gown and pulled at the laces as seductively as possible, but the damned things caught, and I felt like an idiot. He chuckled and leaned over me, and I felt like Little Red Riding Hood, caught in the shadow of a wolf.</p><p>He unlaced the neck gently and brushed my lips with his before nuzzling my throat.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know,\u201d he whispered in my ear, and then I felt the small gash of his sharp teeth in my skin. Not puncture wounds\u2014more like a little rip, like when you rub past a nail. I whimpered and couldn\u2019t decide if it hurt or not. He pressed against me, and I pressed into the tree, and I had a little flashback of our time in the copse. Had it really been only two days ago? Once I started thinking about that, it started feeling better. He gulped twice more, then pulled away with a dreamy look on his face, eyes rolled back in his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever tasted in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cLift your skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time for love, Criminy Stain,\u201d I said, rolling the neck of my ugly dress back up. \u201cLet\u2019s get over that wall and out of Eden.\u201d</p><p>42</p> <p>It was getting awfully handy, knowing a magician. We wouldn\u2019t have gotten across the street without a glamour, not covered with all that blood. Criminy was still limping as we jogged toward Darkside, but the wound in his neck was nearly closed.</p><p>\u201cOne day, you\u2019ll forget it was ever there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget that, actually,\u201d was my response.</p><p>We were darting through the crowd when we heard the church bell tolling, a dark and dismal sound, ringing again and again. The people all stopped where they were and looked up to the top of the city, where the church\u2019s spire rose into the white-blue sky. It was helpful\u2014they were a lot easier to dodge when they all held still.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d an old man said, looking around frantically.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s died,\u201d a young man answered.</p><p>\u201cLucky him,\u201d remarked the old man.</p><p>We didn\u2019t stop, though\u2014we used the weird calm to get farther toward safety. When the bell was done ringing, we could hear shouts, and then all of the Coppers abandoned their posts and rushed uphill toward the church on their bludmares, knocking people aside in their haste.</p> <p>By the time we reached Antonin\u2019s shop, everyone knew.</p><p>Jonah Goodwill, Magistrate of Manchester, was dead.</p><p>\u201cAn apoplexy,\u201d whispered a fashionable young matron having her sash fixed. \u201cHe passed on in his garden, smiling among the apple trees that fed the poor and brought him so much joy. Such a dear man.\u201d</p><p>Every customer brought the tailor another juicy tidbit, most of them patently false. But the true ones were even better.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll name the city Goodwill in his honor,\u201d said an old biddy.</p><p>\u201cHe left a will, but his successor was found dead with an arrow in his chest next to a Bluddy doxy in Mr. Goodwill\u2019s own guest room,\u201d whispered a barrister\u2019s overfed housewife. \u201cOoh, the scandal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear it from me, but the Coppers had been planning to kill off all the Bludmen,\u201d said a bald, bookish man with glasses. \u201cThey even had a secret cabal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was really an alien from another world,\u201d said a little boy getting his first breeches, and his mother flicked his ear for lying.</p><p>As Antonin knelt at my feet, hemming my new emerald-green dress and grinning through a mouthful of pins, I shook with repressed giggles.</p><p>We had a good laugh in the lemon-yellow room that night as my hideous, blood-spattered sailor dress crackled merrily in the stove. The Bludmen clinked their teacups together, and I inhaled a steaming, curry-flavored wrappy fresh from a street vendor. As far as I was concerned, it was a lovely celebration.</p><p>Later, curled together in the spare bed in Antonin\u2019s attic garret, Criminy rose on his elbow to look at me in the glow of our candle. His smile was warm and gentle, softening the hard lines of his face.</p><p>\u201cOf all the ways it could have gone,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d say it went pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were lucky,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThere was some luck. But also a good bit of cleverness and lying and placing the right bets,\u201d he said, and he kissed the tip of my nose. \u201cYou did well, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to,\u201d I said modestly.</p><p>\u201cThe way I felt, when they had me tied to that chair and gagged,\u201d he muttered, looking into the dark corners of the attic and scowling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it was you who had to save me,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI think we saved each other,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you so much, my love.\u201d He sighed, lying back down with his hands behind his head. \u201cBut I\u2019ll guard your body with my life, I promise. I wonder\u2014if you take off the necklace over there, do you disappear here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think to check,\u201d I said. \u201cI was too worried about you. But I don\u2019t think so. I mean, my body stayed there while I was over here, but time didn\u2019t move, and I woke up covered in urine, and ... it\u2019s all really confusing.\u201d</p><p>He traced the chain down my neck and rubbed his thumb over the jewel of the locket.</p><p>\u201cIt was all worth it,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cAll the trouble. It was worth it.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the locket and studied it, then turned it over. There on the back were the words, just as I\u2019d seen them that first night in my bathroom at home.</p><p>\u201cViernes toa meo,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cCome to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Sanguine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dead language.\u201d</p><p>I giggled.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s very magical and romantic,\u201d he admonished. \u201cYou had to say the words, and touch my blood, and see my picture for it to work. You had to want to come. It was all part of the spell.\u201d</p><p>I thought about it for a second. Any one of those random choices made differently, and I would be waking up next to Mr. Surly right now, getting ready to go to Nana\u2019s house and make scrambled eggs. Changing IVs, driving my car, drinking my coffee, wondering if there was something more out there.</p><p>Now I knew.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cFor calling me here. For finding the locket. For everything you\u2019ve done. I know I haven\u2019t been easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy\u2019s not worth anything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you knew I\u2019d find the locket or die trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cTo save your people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be true. But jumping out of the tree, that was just for you. What do I care for freedom if I can\u2019t have the only thing I want?\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cLiar. You want lots of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can lie to anyone but you, love,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cAnd I do want lots of things, most of which are under your dress. But I would never break my promise. Especially not with the chance that you\u2019d change your mind.\u201d</p><p>I fidgeted with the locket, pressing the ruby to open the catch. Holding the limning up to the light, I squinted from him to his painted image.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you exactly,\u201d I said, and my voice broke. \u201cThe first time I saw it, all I could think was that whoever he was, he was handsome, and he was daring me to do something wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I was,\u201d he agreed. \u201cLoving a caravan man is adventure enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is,\u201d I said, and he put his forehead to mine as I sniffled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got your locket on, then. It\u2019s bedtime. You\u2019re all ready. Let me kiss you before you go,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSo you\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p><p>Before I could protest that remembering him would not be a problem or even explain how the locket worked, he was kissing me with longing and fire and passion, his hands cradling my face, his gloved thumbs tracing my cheekbones. I kissed him back, trying to capture the moment in my memory forever. But I couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t capture anything.</p><p>He was too immediate. Too real. Too primal.</p><p>Criminy Stain wasn\u2019t something I could own or tame. And I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>He had awakened things in me that I didn\u2019t even know were sleeping. He made me feel alive and vital, and his world, strange as it was, called to my heart. He\u2019d never meant to trap me, and I\u2019d never meant to be caught, yet here we were.</p><p>But he\u2019d gotten something wrong, and I had my own surprise for him.</p><p>I broke from the kiss and pulled away with a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going to do magic.\u201d</p><p>With his mouth quirked up, he indulged me by rolling over onto his back and shutting his eyes.</p><p>I silently pulled the locket over my head and hid it under the pillow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the trick, love?\u201d he said.</p><p>I hitched up my new dress and straddled him, then dove back into kissing him. I slowly nibbled my way up to his ear.</p><p>\u201cI can make a locket disappear,\u201d I whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>43</p><p>There\u2019s always an epilogue, isn\u2019t there?</p><p>The chapter that tells you what happened afterward, tying up the story in a nice big bow?</p> <p>I can\u2019t exactly do that. My story doesn\u2019t work that way, all nice and tidy. I could maybe have some sort of messy raffia bow that looks as if a haystack exploded, like what my Nana uses when wrapping presents in newspaper. Or twine, the kind they use to tie up mysterious packages in brown paper.</p><p>But I\u2019ll try to make it neat.</p><p>I slept that night. Really, really well. After a week of sleeplessness and traveling and starvation and enough squirts of adrenaline to kill a polanda bear, it was good to sink finally into real, deep sleep. If I had dreams, I don\u2019t remember them. But I woke up smiling.</p><p>And next to me was a Bludman, a blood-drinking creature from another world, where everyone dressed like Victorian prudes and rode around in genuine horseless carriages and submarines. A world where the sky was too low and the names were off just enough to make it interesting.</p><p>I\u2019ve always had colorful dreams, but even I couldn\u2019t have conjured Criminy Stain, magician and gypsy king. Whatever forces drew us together seemed haphazard and random. But in each other, we both found that elusive something, the drive that keeps an animal hunting and hoping.</p> <p>There was still work to do, of course. He had the caravan to tend to, and I had to return to my world to swallow a mouthful of my own blood and report that Jonathan Grove, philanthropist and preacher, had finally succumbed to his condition. My fears about a murder or police questioning were, of course, unfounded. Nurse Carrie just melted away into the night. After twenty-five years of his bleeding the family\u2019s inheritance dry, everyone was more than happy to assume that he had died of old age or complications. It was actually a miracle that he had lasted so long.</p><p>The political situation of Manchester is still tense. Without Goodwill at the helm of the second-largest city in Sangland, there\u2019s hope. With Rodvey gone, Ferling was next in line, and his stance toward Bludmen has been noticeably kinder. Antonin\u2019s shop was allowed to move back to High Street, and the latest newspapers say that Bludmen might begin getting votes in London\u2019s Parliament. For once, the gossip was true\u2014there was talk of renaming Manchester as Goodwill, but the Bludmen put up a revolt, and it was abandoned.</p><p>As we travel the island, I learn more and more about the wonders of this strange world that distorts history as I know it like a carnival mirror. In Freesia, which corresponds to Russia, the Bludmen rule over terrified Pinkies from an icy palace deep in an enchanted forest. In Franchia, colorful daimons dance in the cabarets under the giddy thumb of the Sun King. In Almanica, Sanglish pioneers press ever farther into the frontier of a world ruled by natives described as half-animal warriors. The stories grow only more fabulous, and I want to see it all. The caravan remains a haven from politics and dogma. But in stopping Goodwill, we helped to make Sang a better place, and I think both worlds are better for his absence.</p><p>And I know, because I live in both worlds. While I can.</p><p>During the day, I take care of my grandmother, doing my best to make her last time on earth warm and loving and comfortable. We play rummy, and I try to talk her into giving me the recipe for her special chocolate pie. I see my other patients, except for Mr. Sterling. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to return to the pretty town home and touch the beautiful, wasted body. I couldn\u2019t handle the guilt of knowing that I could have given him everything he thought he wanted. I\u2019d seen it in the glance, and even if I\u2019d toyed with the idea of choosing him, I\u2019d always known it wouldn\u2019t happen. He left the caravan for London, and the newspapers say he\u2019s the most eligible bachelor in town. My own glance tells me that he still has a journey ahead of him, but if he plays the right notes, he\u2019ll find love himself before long.</p><p>As for me, my days as a nurse are normal and contented, but I\u2019m biding my time.</p> <p>At night, when I dream, I\u2019m dressed in burgundy taffeta laced up to my chin. I tell fortunes and collect copper pennies and vials of blood. I laugh with the sword swallower and encourage the lizard boy to get more exercise. I sleep in a scarlet wagon, in a bed draped in silk, with a beautiful ruby locket under my pillow. And beside me sleeps my own personal vampire, or the closest thing around.</p><p>Sometimes, that\u2019s what I do. Who I am. And I know that no time passes in the other world, that I could stay in Sang and in Criminy\u2019s arms forever. But then I\u2019ll see an old woman in the crowd and touch my own face, feeling the new lines there. Or I\u2019ll gently hold a shriveled hand to read a dark future and remember that my grandmother needs me.</p><p>And later that night, Criminy will tuck me into a specially made, well-ventilated box in his trailer. He\u2019ll kiss me softly and give me his love and call me his gypsy queen.</p><p>And then he\u2019ll close the door and lock the box with a key he wears on a chain under his undone cravat. He\u2019ll set a small copper snake named Boros on the lid, and the creature\u2019s ruby-red eyes will cast eerie lights on the walls as it spins around and around, guarding me. I\u2019ll lock the inside lock. I\u2019ll fall asleep almost immediately.</p><p>And then I\u2019ll open my eyes to my other life and take off the locket for a while.</p><p>I\u2019ve made my choice, and for now, my choice is both. And I\u2019m happy.</p><p>Except for one thing, hovering on the edge of my thoughts like a bludrat waiting to pounce on an innocent sleeper. There\u2019s only one dream I have in Sang, when the locket is under my pillow and I\u2019m curled against my beloved Bludman. Again and again, unbidden, his glance appears in my head, torturing me, a secret he\u2019s forgotten to unearth.</p><p>My glances have always been true.</p> <p>All except that one.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>So each morning when I wake beside Criminy, the first thing I do is check my hands, knowing in my heart that one day, they\u2019ll be covered in black scales and blood.</p><p>Just like his. </p> </body></html>"]
