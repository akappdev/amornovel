R. R. TOLKIEN</p><p>C hristmas parties are the star on the top of my \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d list this year. Other things to avoid this season: Ornaments. Trees. Mistletoe (definitely). Holiday movies about families. And memories.</p><p>Memories most of all. Last year, I celebrated Christmas morning in my own living room, with the two people I loved most in the world. My husband, Thomas, and my sister, Stacey.</p><p>A lot can change in twelve months.</p><p>Now, I am in my kitchen, carefully packing frosted Santa cookies into Tupperware containers, layering wax paper between each row. On a strip of masking tape, I write my name in bold black letters: Joy Candellaro. When I\u2019m done, I dress for work in a pair of black jeans and a bright green sweater set. At the last moment, I add little wreath earrings. Perhaps if I look festive, people will stop asking me how I am doing. Balancing the pale pink containers in my arms, I lock up my house and make my way to the garage. As I round the hood of the car, I sidle past the row of file cabinets that line the back wall. My dreams are in those metal drawers, organized with the kind of care only a librarian can manage.</p> <p>I have saved every scrap I\u2019ve ever read about exotic locales and faraway places. When I read the words and see the pictures, I dream of having an adventure.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019ve been dreaming of that for ten years now, and since I\u2019ve been single again for almost three months, and separated from Thom for eight months before that, it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m a dreamer not a doer. In fact, I haven\u2019t added to my files or opened one of the cabinets since my divorce.</p><p>I ease past them now and get into my sensible maroon Volvo. Behind me, the garage door opens, and I back down the driveway.</p><p>It is still early in the morning on this last Friday before Christmas. The street lamps are on; light falls from them in cones of shimmering yellow through the predawn shadows. As my car rolls to a stop at the bottom of the driveway, the headlights illuminate my house. It looks . . . faded in this unnatural light, untended. The roses I love so much are leggy and bare. The planters are full of dead geraniums.</p><p>A memory flashes through me like summer thunder: there and gone.</p><p>I come home from work early . . . see my husband\u2019s car is in the driveway. The roses are in full, riotous bloom.</p> <p>I remember thinking I should cut some for an arrangement.</p><p>In the house, I toss my coat on the maple bench and go upstairs, calling out his name.</p><p>I am halfway up the stairs when I recognize the sounds.</p><p>In my mind and my memories, I kicked the door open. That\u2019s what I told people later. The truth was, I barely had the strength to push it open.</p><p>There they are, naked and sweating and rolling, in my bed.</p><p>Like an idiot, I stand there, staring at them. I thought he\u2019d feel my presence as keenly as I\u2019d always felt his, that he\u2019d look up, see me and\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know, have a heart attack or burst into tears and beg for my forgiveness or beg for forgiveness while having a heart attack.</p><p>Then I see her face, and a bad moment rounds the bend into horrific. It is my sister.</p><p>Now there\u2019s a \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign in front of my house. It\u2019s been there for months, but who am I kidding? A wrecked marriage scares everyone. It\u2019s like a rock tossed into a still blue pond; the ripples go on and on. No one wants to buy this house of bad luck.</p> <p>I hit the gas too hard and back out into the street, putting the memories in my rearview mirror.</p><p>If only they would stay there. Instead, they\u2019re like passengers, crowding in on me, taking up too much air.</p><p>No one knows what to say to me anymore, and I can hardly blame them. I don\u2019t know what I want to hear, either. In the school library, where I work, I hear the whispers that grind to a halt at my entrance and notice how uncomfortable the ensuing silences can be.</p><p>I make it easy on my friends\u2014or try to\u2014by pretending that everything is okay. I\u2019ve been doing that a lot this year. Smiling and pretending. What else can I do? People have grown tired of waiting for me to get over my divorce. I know I need to glide onto the track of my old life, but I can\u2019t seem to manage it; neither do I have the courage to form a new one, though, in truth, it\u2019s what I want. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted for a long time.</p><p>At the corner, I turn left. The streets of Bakersfield are quiet on this early morning. By the time I reach the high school, it is just past seven o\u2019clock. I pull into my parking space, gather my cookies, and go inside.</p><p>At the main desk, the school secretary, Bertha Collins, smiles up at me. \u201cHey, Joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Bertie. I brought some cookies for tonight\u2019s faculty party.\u201d</p><p>Her look turns worried. \u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this year, Bertie. I don\u2019t feel too festive.\u201d</p><p>She eyes me knowingly. As a twice-divorced woman, she thinks she understands, but she can\u2019t, not really. Bertie has three kids and two parents and four sisters. My own math doesn\u2019t add up that way. \u201cTake care of yourself, Joy. The first Christmas after a divorce can be . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d Forcing a smile, I start moving. In the past year, this technique has worked well for me. Keep moving. I walk down the hallway, turn left at the empty cafeteria and head for my space. The library.</p><p>My assistant, Rayla Goudge, is already at work. She is a robust, gray-haired woman who dresses like a gypsy and tries to write all her notes in haiku. Like me, she is a graduate of U.C. Davis with a teaching certificate. We have worked side by side for almost five years and both enjoyed every minute. I know that in May, when she finishes her master\u2019s degree in library science, I will lose her to another school. It\u2019s one more change I try not to think about.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Joy,\u201d she says, looking up from the pile of paperwork in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ray. How\u2019s Paul\u2019s cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter, thanks.\u201d</p><p>I store my purse behind the counter and begin my day. First up are the computers. I go from one to the next, turning them on for the students, then I replace yesterday\u2019s newspapers with todays. For the next six hours, Rayla and I work side by side\u2014checking the catalog system, generating overdue notices, processing new books, and re-shelving. When we\u2019re lucky, a student comes in for help, but in this Internet age, they are more and more able to do their school research at home. Today, of course, on this last school day before the winter break, the library is as quiet as a tomb.</p><p>That is another thing I try not to think about: the break. What will I do in the two and one-half weeks I have off?</p><p>In past years, I have looked forward to this vacation. It\u2019s part of the reason I became a school librarian. Fifteen years ago, when I was in college, I imagined traveling to exotic locales in my weeks off.</p><p>\u201cJoy, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I am so lost in memories of Before that it takes me a second to realize that Rayla is speaking to me. I\u2019m standing in the middle of the library, holding a worn, damaged copy of Madame Bovary.</p><p>The bell rings: The walls seem to vibrate with the sound of doors opening, kids laughing, feet moving down the hall.</p><p>The winter break has begun.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride to the party?\u201d Rayla asks, coming up to me.</p><p>\u201cThe party?\u201d I say, as if I\u2019m actually thinking about it. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming, are you?\u201d</p><p>Rayla has always been able to do that: pierce my defenses with a look. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this year, Ray.\u201d</p><p>Rayla sighs. \u201cSo, what will you do tonight?\u201d</p><p>We both know that the first night of our vacation is special. Last year, on this Friday evening, Stacey and I met up for dinner and went to the mall, where I agonized over the perfect gift for Thom.</p><p>It turned out to be my sister.</p><p>Those are exactly the kind of memories I try to avoid, but they\u2019re like asbestos: invisible and deadly. You need special gear to get rid of them.</p><p>Rayla touches my arm. \u201cHave you put up a tree yet?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI could help you decorate one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I need to do it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will you?\u201d</p><p>I look down into her kind gray eyes and find it surprisingly easy to smile. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>She loops an arm through mine. Together, we walk through the quiet library and emerge into the crowded, busy hallways of the high school. All around us kids are laughing and talking and high-fiving one another.</p><p>In the parking lot, Rayla walks me to my car. There, she stops and looks up at me. \u201cI hate to leave you alone for the holidays. Maybe Paul and I should cancel our trip to Minnesota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare. Enjoy your family. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Stacey . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say sharply, and then whisper: \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Thom will break up, you\u2019ll see. She\u2019ll come to her senses.\u201d</p><p>I have lost count of the times Rayla has said this to me, and of the times I\u2019ve said it to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to one of those dream places of yours\u2014like Machu Picchu or London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will,\u201d I say. It\u2019s what I always say. We both know the truth: I\u2019m scared to go alone.</p><p>Rayla pats my hand and kisses my cheek. \u201cWell. I\u2019ll see you in January, Joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Rayla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to you.\u201d</p><p>I watch her walk to her car and drive away. Finally, I get into my own front seat and sit there, staring through the windshield. When I start the engine, the radio comes on. It\u2019s an instrumental rendition of \u201cUpon a Midnight Clear\u201d that immediately reminds me of better times in previous years. My mom loved this song.</p><p>Rayla is right. It\u2019s time for me to get started on Christmas. There\u2019s no more putting it off. Smiling and pretending will not get me through the holidays. It\u2019s time for me to embark on this new single life of mine.</p><p>The traffic out of the high school is bumper to bumper with kids yelling out the window to one another, but by the time I reach Almond Street, the road is empty.</p><p>On Fifth Street, I turn left and pull into the lot beside a Chevron station, where Scout Troop #104 has set up their yearly tree sale. On this late Friday afternoon, I can see right away that the stock is pretty depleted, and frankly, there\u2019s more brown on these branches than green. In this part of California, the trees go bad fast and I\u2019ve waited too long to get a prime choice.</p><p>I wander through the fake forest on the corner of Fifth and Almond, nodding now and then to friends and strangers, trying to pretend I\u2019m picking out the perfect tree. In truth, I\u2019m trying not to look at them too closely. Finally, I can\u2019t stand it anymore. I choose the tree to my left, find a kid to help me, and reach for my wallet.</p><p>The nice young boy scout who takes my money hands me a receipt and a Kleenex.</p><p>I\u2019m crying. Perfect.</p><p>By the time the tree is strapped onto my car, I\u2019m a basket case. Sniffling and crying and shaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I am still in bad shape when I pull up to the ATM machine, though, thankfully, there are no witnesses to my meltdown. On a whim, I withdraw two hundred and fifty dollars. If I\u2019m going to put up this tree, I\u2019ll need all new ornaments. I can hardly use the ones I collected during my marriage. And I intend to buy myself a killer gift to open on Christmas morning.</p><p>The thought of spending money on myself should make me happy; it\u2019s not something we high school librarians do a lot.</p><p>At least that\u2019s what I tell myself as I turn into my neighborhood.</p><p>Madrona Lane is a pretty name for a pretty street in a not-so-pretty suburb of Bakersfield. I\u2019ve always appreciated the irony of living on a street named for a tree that doesn\u2019t grow here; especially in view of the fact that the developers cut down every green thing that dared to grow on the block. When my husband and I first saw the house it was run down and neglected, the only home on the cul-de-sac with grass that needed cutting and a fence in need of paint. The realtor had seen all these as possibilities for a young couple such as us. \u201cThe previous owners,\u201d she\u2019d whispered to me as I stepped through a patch of dry-rotted floor in the bathroom, \u201cwent through a terrible divorce. A real War of the Roses thing.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019d all laughed at that. Of course, it turned out not to be so funny.</p><p>I am almost to my house when I see Stacey standing in my driveway, all by herself.</p><p>I slam on the brakes.</p><p>We stare at each other through the windshield. The minute she sees me, she starts to cry. It is all I can do not to follow suit.</p><p>She\u2019s come to tell you it\u2019s over with Thom. It\u2019s the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, but now that it\u2019s here, I don\u2019t know what to do. Without forgiveness, there\u2019s no future between Stacey and me, but how can I forgive a sister who slept with my husband?</p> <p>I ease my foot back onto the accelerator and pull into the driveway. Then I get out of the car.</p><p>Stacey stands there, looking at me, clutching her ski coat around her. Tears glisten on her cheeks.</p><p>It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve really looked at each other since this nightmare began, and instead of anger, I feel an unexpected longing. I remember a dozen things about her, about us, just then, like our famous family road trip through the desert states. Hell in a Volkswagen bus with my mom singing Helen Reddy songs at the top of her lungs and smoking Eve cigarettes one after another.</p><p>I approach her slowly. As always, looking at my younger sister is like looking in a mirror. Irish twins; that\u2019s what our mom called us. We\u2019re less than twelve months apart in age and have the same curly copper-red hair, pale, freckled skin, and blue eyes. No wonder Thom fell for her; she\u2019s the younger, smiling version of me.</p><p>She takes one step toward me and starts to talk.</p><p>I\u2019m leaving him.</p> <p>It\u2019s a moment before I realize that that\u2019s not what she said. \u201cWhat?\u201d I say, stepping back, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this,\u201d she says. \u201cNot now. It\u2019s Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I feel upended somehow, confused. \u201cI should forgive you because it\u2019s Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t forgive me, but it was over between you and Thom . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were having problems . . .\u201d I don\u2019t even know how to finish, what to say. None of this feels right.</p><p>Stacey bites her lower lip\u2014a sign of nervousness from way back\u2014then hands me a piece of thick white paper. I can tell instantly what it is.</p><p>A wedding invitation. The blessed event is set to take place on June sixth.</p><p>It hits me like a right hook to the jaw. \u201cY-you\u2019re kidding me, right? You should be breaking up with him . . . not marrying him.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, she opens her coat. She is dressed for the holidays in red velvet pants and a white knit top with Rudolph stitched in sequins on the front. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she says, touching a belly that\u2019s flatter than mine.</p><p>And there it is, finally, after months of pretending to be okay, the thing I can\u2019t handle. For five years, I have dreamed of having a baby; I used to beg Thom to start our family. He was never \u201cready.\u201d Now I know why. It was me. He didn\u2019t want to have a child with me.</p><p>She\u2019s crying harder now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joy. I know how much you want a baby.\u201d</p><p>I want to scream at her, to shriek my pain, maybe even smack her, but I can\u2019t seem to breathe. Tears are blurring my vision; they\u2019re not ordinary tears, either. They actually hurt. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d do this to me. To us. How can two girls who used to be peas in a pod have come to this?</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to hurt you . . .\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t listen anymore. One more blow and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll go to my knees, right here in my driveway, and I\u2019ve spent every day of the last year just trying to stand. I turn away from my sister and run to my car. A part of me can hear her yelling my name, calling out to me, but I don\u2019t care. The words are elongated somehow, stretched into meaningless sounds and syllables. Nothing makes sense.</p><p>I get into my car, start the engine and barrel backward, into the empty street.</p><p>I have no idea where I\u2019m going and I don\u2019t care. All that matters is putting miles between me and that wedding invitation in my driveway and the baby growing in my sister\u2019s womb.</p><p>When I see the exit for the airport, it seems natural to turn off. Maybe even a destiny-at-work kind of thing. I park and go into the terminal.</p><p>It\u2019s small, but busy on this Friday. Lots of people obviously want to put miles between the heres and theres of their lives in the holiday season.</p><p>I look up at the departures board.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>A shiver goes through me; the word looks so out of place on the list, tucked as it is between ordinary cities like Spokane and Portland. I blink and look again, just in case I\u2019ve gone slightly mad and imagined it.</p><p>Hope remains. It\u2019s in British Columbia, apparently. Canada.</p><p>There\u2019s no line at the counter. I walk there slowly, still somehow waiting to wake up, but when I get there, a woman looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe flight to Hope . . . is there a seat?\u201d</p><p>She frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s a charter. Just a second.\u201d She looks down at her computer screen. Fingernails click on the keys. \u201cThere are seats, but they were purchased in bulk.\u201d She glances around, catches sight of a heavy-set man dressed in camouflage fatigues. \u201cGo talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Now, I\u2019m not the kind of woman who strolls easily up to strange men, especially when they look like Burl Ives on a big game hunt, but this is no time for caution. I\u2019m desperate. One more second in this town and I might start screaming. For all I know, Stacey is still in my driveway, waiting for me to return so we can \u201ctalk\u201d more. I clutch my purse under my arm and go to him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say, trying\u2014without much success\u2014to smile. \u201cI need Hope.\u201d</p><p>He grins at this. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a whole lot up there. For a city girl, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes just getting away is enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that twice. Well, we\u2019ve got an extra seat, if you want it. Say one hundred dollars? But I can\u2019t promise you a way to get back. We\u2019re a play-it-by-ear bunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Normally, I\u2019d laugh at that, it\u2019s so far from the truth, but just now it feels right. Besides, I\u2019m not even sure I need a way to get back. Who knows? This is a tear in the fabric of my ordinary life. All I have to do is step through. And I have my Christmas money with me. \u201cDo I need a passport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Just your driver\u2019s license.\u201d</p><p>I can leave here, make a quick stop and plane change in Seattle, show my identification, go through customs, and be in Hope by midnight. I make a decision to leave my own country in less time than it usually takes me to decide between packages of meat at my local Von\u2019s.</p><p>I whip out my wallet and find the cash. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>A n hour later, I am at the gate, holding a ticket to Hope. All around me, men are talking, laughing. There is an inordinate amount of high-fiving going on. They are trophy hunters I discover, the kind of guys who decorate with hooves. This is their big hunt, away from kids and wives, and it\u2019s clear that the party starts before the plane takes off. They\u2019re completely uninterested in the quiet, tired-looking woman in their midst. I sit down in one of the empty seats. Beside me is a magazine. Hunting and Fishing News. A librarian will read anything, so I pick it up and flip through the pages. An article on duck blinds leaves me cold, as does a series of how-to taxidermy photographs. Finally, I turn the page and find a pretty picture of an old-fashioned resort. It\u2019s called the Comfort Fishing Lodge and it welcomes me to come and stay awhile.</p><p>Stay awhile.</p><p>It\u2019s a lovely thought. I fold the flimsy magazine in half and shove it into my bag. When I get home, I\u2019ll file the article alongside my other dreams, alphabetically. Someday, I\u2019d like to visit the Comfort Lodge. As I\u2019m fitting the magazine in the cluttered bag, I feel the pebbled leather of my camera case. My fingers close around it, pulling it out of my purse.</p><p>No newfangled digital camera for me. This is the real thing. A heavy black and silver Canon SLR. I take it out of the case, slip the strap around my neck, and remove the lens cap.</p><p>If I\u2019m finally taking a trip into the unknown; there ought to be photographs to document the momentous event.</p><p>I focus and snap on the gate, on the other passengers, on the view of the runway through the dirty windows. I even try to take a picture of myself. All of it occupies my mind for a while, but then the real world creeps back into my thoughts.</p><p>Stacey is going to marry Thom and have his child.</p><p>It hurts almost more than I can bear. Tears sting my eyes again; I wipe them away impatiently. I am so tired of crying, so tired of feeling like half a person, but I don\u2019t know how to change things. All I know is that for more than three decades, my sister has been the bedrock of my life, and now I\u2019m standing on sand. I have never felt so lost and alone. If I could simply blink my eyes and say a prayer to disappear, I would.</p><p>They call my flight over the loudspeaker; men surge forward like a flannel-clad centipede, legs all moving at once. I follow quietly behind them.</p><p>On the plane, I find an empty seat in the last row. My armrest practically touches the restroom door, it\u2019s so close. I try not to see a metaphor in this placement. Instead, I sit down, strap myself in, and peer out the tiny oval window at the falling night. The men are all in the front of the plane, laughing and talking. In no time, we\u2019re cleared for flight and up we go, into the now black sky.</p><p>I flip through the hunting and fishing magazine again. An article on the Olympic rainforest grabs my attention. It\u2019s in Washington State, apparently tucked in between hundreds of miles of coastline and a jagged mountain range. The trees are gigantic, primeval, the greens absolute and somehow soothing. A woman could get lost in a place like that. I could take hundreds of glorious photographs, maybe even\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou okay back here all by yourself?\u201d</p><p>I look up.</p><p>It\u2019s Burl Ives again. He smiles at me: the movement bunches up his cattle-sweeper moustache and shows off a row of oversized dentures. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s the last half of his question, the \u201call by yourself,\u201d that gets me. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say, though it\u2019s miles from true.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Riegert, by the way. Riegert Milosovich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. You have a great vacation, Joy. And wish us luck on the hunt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay safe,\u201d I say, unable to really hope the hunt goes well. I\u2019m a card-carrying member of the don\u2019t-shoot-living-things club. And the idea of men drinking and loading weapons seems remarkably stupid, but it\u2019s not my business. \u201cAnd thanks again for the seat. I think a little Hope is exactly what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d</p><p>He ducks into the bathroom and slams the door shut. A few moments later, he\u2019s out again and heading up the aisle toward his seat. He is almost to the first row when I hear a noise and feel a shudder in the airplane. Riegert stumbles forward, falls to his knees.</p><p>The nose of the plane dips down.</p><p>Down.</p> <p>That\u2019s not good. Planes should be headed up.</p><p>I grip the armrests to steady myself. I know it\u2019s ridiculous\u2014I mean, I can\u2019t hold myself in place. But it makes me feel better, in control.</p><p>The plane levels off. I have time to murmur \u201cthank God\u201d and to smile before the explosion.</p><p>The plane drops hard and fast. My body flies forward; the seat belt yanks me back. I hit the cusions like a rag doll, with a terrible snap to the neck. My camera hits me in the ribs, hard. Bright yellow oxygen masks drop from the ceiling.</p><p>Somewhere in front of me, a man screams. It is a terrible sound, guttural and unnatural. I shake my head, thinking NO! Just that word. My heart is beating so fast I can\u2019t draw a breath.</p><p>In the front of the cabin, the flight attendant is telling us to bend forward and press our heads into the seat in front of us. She\u2019s pointing out the exit rows.</p> <p>The captain interrupts her speech to say, \u201cBrace yourselves. Flight attendant: Take your seat.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t turbulence.</p><p>We\u2019re going to crash. You\u2019d think it would happen in the blink of an eye, a thing like this, an airplane falling out of the sky, but the truth is that every second feels like an hour. It\u2019s true that your life spirals before your eyes.</p><p>I call out my sister\u2019s name and double over, gasping in pain. I should have talked to her, let her talk to me. My fingers claw into the armrests. Every breath is ragged and sharp.</p><p>The captain says again, \u201cBrace for landing.\u201d</p><p>Landing. They make it sound scheduled, as if . . .</p><p>The plane slams into the ground nose first.</p><p>This time my scream is lost in the screeching, shrieking whine of tearing metal.</p> <p>Things fly past me\u2014a row of seats, a suitcase, a tray. It\u2019s like being in a wind tunnel. The flight attendant tumbles past me. She is still strapped in her chair. All I can do is watch in horror as she goes past me, screaming. For a heartbeat, our gazes lock, then the cabin lights go out.</p><p>I scream again, unable this time to stop. The sounds I make are nothing, breezes in the monsoon.</p><p>Although I am seeing everything in slow motion, I know that the plane is rocketing forward, crashing through trees and rocks and dirt.</p><p>We hit something and flip over. My camera cracks me in the eye.</p><p>The whole plane shudders and groans and comes to a creaking stop.</p><p>A pain explodes in my head.</p><p>It takes me a second to realize we\u2019re upside down. I\u2019m hanging from my seat belt and everything hurts. The pain in my head\u2014right behind me left eye\u2014is like a hot iron wedge being hammered in place. I can taste blood.</p><p>But we are stopped. The horrible wrenching sound of metal tearing has stopped. Now it is quiet. Eerie.</p><p>Smoke rolls through the cabin, swallowing the seats and aisle. I can\u2019t see anything. The coughing starts, then the sobbing.</p><p>I unlatch my seat belt and fall to the floor, hitting my head so hard I lose consciousness for a moment. When I wake, I am disoriented. Then I taste my own blood and I remember: I need to get out of the plane.</p><p>But smoke is everywhere. I can see flames licking along the walls, zipping up fabric-covered seats. Hungry orange tongues . . . everywhere.</p><p>Coughing, I look around for something to hold over my nose and mouth.</p><p>There is nothing. The cabin is all darkness and smoke and flames. People are dropping from their seats, landing on what is now the floor. I take off my coat and hold it over my face as I crawl toward the exit\u2014at least I hope it\u2019s an exit. All I know is I hear movement in front of me, coughing and footsteps and whispering. The ceiling is full of seams and bumps that scrape my knees. I bang my head on the overhead bins that have fallen open.</p><p>I feel my way through the thick smoke, pushing aside debris, past gaping holes where the side of the plane should be. At each new row, I look for people still in their seats, hanging unconscious, but I find no one.</p><p>Finally, after what seems to take hours, I see the opening. A man is there, holding out his hand, helping me out. He doesn\u2019t seem to know that his hair and shirt are matted with blood, that a spike of some kind is lodged in his upper arm. \u201cThis way,\u201d he says in a tired, shaking voice.</p><p>\u201cYou need a doctor,\u201d I say, surprised that I\u2019m crying. The words release something in me, something so big I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll drown in it and be swept away. I finally stagger to a stand.</p><p>He touches my head. The fingers he draws back are stained red. \u201cSo do you. Are you the last one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. I was in the last row.\u201d I turn to look back at my seat and see the gaping black and orange mouth that is what\u2019s left of the tail section.</p><p>How did I not notice that?</p><p>Shaking, my head aching now that I feel the blood leaking down my cheek, I take his hand. It\u2019s calloused and sweaty and makes me feel almost safe.</p><p>The darkness outside is absolute, velvet, nothing like the gray haze of the burning cabin.</p><p>The ground squishes beneath my feet, giving way beneath my steps. It\u2019s like quicksand, hard to walk in. I look down at my feet. Something feels wrong. As if gravity has been lost or changed somehow. I look for someone to ask, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d This isn\u2019t the world we know. The air is harsh, different. The ground is soft. I wonder suddenly if it is blood that has softened the ground\u2014our blood\u2014or maybe it\u2019s gasoline.</p><p>Everyone is as dazed as I am. Over by the nearest tree, a group is beginning to form. How can I walk that far and why am I alone?</p><p>In the distance, I hear sirens.</p><p>I trip on something and fall to my knees. The pain in my head is back, throbbing.</p><p>I hear something and look up.</p><p>At first, I think it\u2019s the ambulances and police cars driving up, and then I think it\u2019s screaming . . . but that\u2019s past us. We survived.</p><p>It seems to take ages, but I climb to my feet once again. I\u2019m upright; I try to hear. My head is pounding.</p><p>\u201cExplode . . . Run.\u201d</p><p>Words. Someone is yelling. Smoke engulfs me, billowing from the tail.</p><p>\u201cRun! It\u2019s going to explode.\u201d I see Riegert running toward me, waving his arms.</p><p>A second later his words register. I try to run through the spongy black ground, toward the forest.</p><p>But I\u2019m too late, and I know it.</p><p>The blast, when it comes, is like nothing I\u2019ve ever known.</p><p>One second I\u2019m running for cover; the next I\u2019m airborne, weightless. When I hit the ground it is in a thud of pain. Then everything is dark.</p><p>When I open my eyes, I find myself staring up at a Halloween sky, all black and gray with the hint of eerie flickering orange light. Tree tips fringe it all, form a strange circle overhead. They are not ordinary trees; they\u2019re giants. They ring the crash site like gargantuan visitors, whispering among themselves. A lackluster rain is falling; it\u2019s really more of a mist.</p><p>At first I can\u2019t hear anything except the beating of my own heart. It\u2019s as if my ears are stuffed with cotton. My heartbeat is a slow, thudding echo of distant sound.</p><p>Gradually, though, I hear more.</p><p>Sirens, muffled and seemingly far away, but recognizable. Engines purring. Tires crunching through gravel or rock.</p><p>Where am I?</p><p>The answer comes to me in a rush of images and a surge of adrenaline.</p><p>The plane.</p><p>Crashed.</p><p>My camera strap is strangling me. I wrench it free, gasping for breath.</p><p>The gray in the sky is smoke from the plane\u2019s explosion. All around me trees are on fire. That\u2019s the orange in the sky: flames. I can hear the crackling now, feel the heat. My cheeks are coated in blood and sweat.</p><p>I try to get up but I can\u2019t move.</p><p>I\u2019m paralyzed.</p><p>I stare at my feet, trying not to panic. One foot is bare. No sock, no shoe; just dark, muddy toes pointed skyward.</p><p>\u201cWiggle,\u201d I manage to whisper.</p><p>My right foot does a spastic little dance.</p><p>I\u2019m not paralyzed. Thank you, God.</p><p>It takes forever, but finally I move my arms, wedge them underneath me and sit up. From my hiding place in the trees, I can see the crash site.</p><p>The plane is an oblong bullet of fire, wingless. The grass around it is a lake of mud and ash and debris. Trees lay on their sides like giant, broken toothpicks. For the first time, I understand the concept of devastation. Ruin. This land is broken now, as bleeding as we are.</p><p>Far away, through the ashy smoke, I can see ambulances and police cars and fire trucks. The survivors are there, clustered in the bright glow of headlights and temporary lighting. I need to take a picture of this, document it, but my hands are shaking uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over here,\u201d I cry weakly, trying to raise my hand.</p><p>But no one is looking over here. No one is looking for me.</p><p>Why? I wonder. Then I remember Riegert calling out for me, reaching out, then covering his face at the blast and falling to the ground.</p><p>They think I died in the explosion.</p><p>But I\u2019m here.</p><p>It is my last conscious thought.</p><p>I see her standing in the trees, not far away from me. She looks exactly as I remember: tall and thin, with silvery blond hair and eyes the exact color of a robin\u2019s egg. Her skin is pale and unlined still; she is wearing a pink Rocky Mountain Mama T-shirt and her favorite Max Factor lipstick. Strawberries and cream. I wait for her to smile, but she crosses her arms instead and glances away, as if she has another place to be. She is smoking a long, brown cigarette.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I say quietly, wondering if she can hear me. There is a strange cacophony of noise around us\u2014motors running, high pitched wails that sound like sirens, a crackling that sounds like wax paper being balled up. Most of all I can hear my heart, though. It\u2019s running fast, skipping so many beats I feel light-headed.</p><p>She moves toward me, almost gliding. As she gets closer, I see her smile\u2014finally\u2014and it releases something in me.</p><p>She kneels beside me. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>I know she is touching my forehead. I can see her movement, but I can\u2019t feel her touch. I stare into the eyes I love so much. Until now, this moment, I had begun to forget how she looked, the gentleness of her touch, the sound of her voice.</p><p>Her hands on my face are so cool, so comforting. \u201cWake up, Joy. It\u2019s not your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead, aren\u2019t I? That\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>My mother smiles, and in that one expression is my whole childhood, years and years of feeling safe and loved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m crying. I know it even before she wipes my tears away. \u201cStacey is marrying my husband . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d She kisses my forehead and whispers, \u201cWake up, Joy. It\u2019s not your time.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to wake up. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up, Joy. Now.\u201d It is her mother\u2019s voice, the one I only heard when I was in trouble, and I\u2019m helpless to ignore it, even though I know that when I open my eyes, she\u2019ll be gone. She won\u2019t be beside me, holding my hand and kissing me. The Suave shampoo and menthol cigarette scent of her will be gone again. \u201cI miss you, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>With a gasp, I\u2019m breathing again. The pain is back, sharp as a piece of glass, throbbing in my skull. The air around me is thick with smoke.</p><p>Slowly, I open my eyes. It\u2019s hard to see anything, hard to focus in the falling rain. The sky is gunmetal gray, swollen with clouds and smoke. Raindrops clatter on the fuselage of the demolished plane. In the distance, I can hear sirens and motors and voices and footsteps, but it is all far, far away.</p><p>I am deep in the woods, hidden. Huge ferns grow all around me. My shoe is hanging from a branch over my head. It bobs in the breeze.</p><p>It is amazing I didn\u2019t hit a tree.</p><p>I crawl to my knees, grabbing a nearby nurse log for support. When I finally stand, I am struck by a wave of nausea. The world careens sickenly, then rights itself. I focus on getting my shoe, putting it on, as if I can\u2019t be saved in bare feet.</p> <p>When I finish, I look up. Across the smoky, debris- and plane-cluttered clearing, I can see the outline of emergency vehicles. A string of people is moving through another part of the dark forest. Their flashlight beams fan out like some giant, glowing cowcatcher in the smoke.</p><p>I can get there.</p><p>I take one painful, wobbling step, and then another and another. As I approach the edge of the clearing, I wait for them to see me. Any minute they\u2019ll rush to my aid and take me back to my real life.</p><p>To the empty house on Madrona Lane where I\u2019ll spend the holidays alone, to the Volvo with the tree strapped on top. To the calendar that will tick off days to my sister\u2019s wedding and the birth of her child.</p><p>Don\u2019t go back.</p><p>Is that my mother\u2019s voice or the wind?</p> <p>\u201cNo one knows I was on the plane.\u201d I say the words out loud for the first time, and at that, the voicing of it, I glimpse an opportunity.</p><p>No one will notice my absence until school starts.</p><p>I glance around the forest.</p><p>Behind me, the trees are thicker, closer together, but moonlight shows me a path between them. It is almost like a sign, that beam of light. Although I feel shaky, and more than a little light headed, I begin walking away from the crash site.</p><p>It isn\u2019t long before I see a break in the trees, and hear the distant roar of cars.</p><p>Somewhere up ahead is a road.</p><p>I walk slowly through this dark and ancient forest. My head still hurts, my vision is blurring, and this place is like nowhere I\u2019ve ever seen. It is as if I\u2019m journeying in another dimension. Before me, everything is a labyrinth of shadow and moonlit smoke. Spiderwebs connect it all together; in the uncertain light, the strands seem to be made of colored glass. Mist coats the ground, swallows my feet and the spongy earth.</p><p>At last, I come to the end of the woods and the start of civilization. It is a road, old and untended, and I turn to follow it. The dotted yellow line painted down its center is inconsistent, an afterthought, apparently, a suggestion rather than a law. Every few feet a yellow sign warns drivers to watch out for elk.</p> <p>Every time I hear an approaching engine, I hide in the trees. I don\u2019t want some Good Samaritan to \u201crescue\u201d me. It\u2019s mostly emergency vehicles, anyway, going too fast to see a lone woman who doesn\u2019t want to be seen.</p><p>At last I come to the edge of a town. A brightly painted sign welcomes me to the heart of the rainforest. The sign is splattered with mud and half hidden by a gargantuan fern, so I can\u2019t read the name of the town, but I see the word Washington.</p><p>I\u2019m not in Canada.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m supposed to be in Hope,\u201d I say to the emptiness around me. Trees commiserate, whisper in understanding. They know how it feels to be uprooted, disappointed. It\u2019s bad enough that my one spontaneous decision in life leads to a plane crash; I could at least crash near my destination.</p><p>Then again, what difference does it make where I am?</p><p>I step out from the veil of trees and follow the ribbon of asphalt into town, smoothing my hair as I go. I have no idea how long I\u2019ve been walking; this place seems too unreal to be tethered by something as scientific as time.</p><p>I should be wondering where I\u2019m going, but I don\u2019t care. My mind is floating.</p><p>The town that isn\u2019t Hope looks like a movie set. Night tucks in around it; what\u2019s left glows in the light of streetlamps and holiday lighting. Santas and snowmen hang from lampposts; strands of white lights frame the windows.</p><p>The stores are closed for the day, and I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t want to see anyone yet.</p><p>What I want is a bed. My head is hurting again and I\u2019m beginning to feel the cold. In a small, warm diner I find a wall of pamphlets and one old man drinking coffee at a bar. I see an advertisement for the Comfort Fishing Lodge, and a feeling of destiny settles around me, makes me shiver. It is the pretty little place I read about in Hunting and Fishing News. The place that welcomed me to come and stay awhile.</p><p>I could use some comfort. And I certainly need a place to stay.</p><p>I leave the light and heat of the restaurant and try to follow the map on the brochure.</p><p>I am alone again, and cold, and my head is really starting to hurt, but at least I have a destination.</p><p>I find Lakeshore Drive and follow it, walking along its crumbling edge, stepping over tire-sized potholes, for so long my feet start to ache. It begins to really bug me that I\u2019m missing a sock. It\u2019s odd; my head hurts, my skin feels raw, my stomach is on fire where the seat belt bit me, I\u2019ve walked away from an accident scene (that has to be illegal), and I\u2019m worried about blisters on my feet.</p><p>It is quiet out here in a way I\u2019ve never experienced; it\u2019s not the city way of silence, when folks are asleep and their cars are parked. This is a preternatural kind of quiet, where birdsong can startle you with its volume and a squirrel can be heard scampering up a tree as you approach.</p><p>I\u2019m enough of a city girl to wonder what I\u2019m doing in this no-man\u2019s-land.</p><p>I find myself glancing back down the road, toward town, wishing I could hear a car. I\u2019m just about to head back, in fact, when I turn the last corner and find myself in a large clearing, with a still, flat lake on my left and the immense forest on my right. The road becomes a driveway, lined on either side by bare-limbed fruit trees. At its end is a rustic\u2014no, run down\u2014log building. The roof is a carpet of moss. The wraparound porch sags tiredly to one side. To the left of the front door is a large chainsaw carving of a trumpeter swan. Beneath it is a hand-painted sign welcoming me to the Comfort Fishing Lodge. Beside this sign is another\u2014one that reminds me of my own life.</p><p>\u201cFor Sale.\u201d</p><p>Great. What do I do now?</p><p>I\u2019m too tired to walk back to town. Some guy is playing drums in my head.</p><p>I will throw myself on the owner\u2019s mercy. Surely he\u2019ll have one room to rent. What choice do I have?</p><p>\u201cNo wonder I only dreamed about adventures,\u201d I mutter, following an untended stone path from the parking area to the lodge, where I find the front door ajar.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I call out, stepping inside. My greeting fades into the quiet, unanswered.</p><p>The lobby is a big room with a huge stone and timber fireplace and twin floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the lake. Shadows cling to every surface, but in the moonlight I can make out a green-and-red plaid sofa that faces the fireplace, two worn red leather chairs, and an antique trunk serving as a coffee table. Black-and-white photographs, matted in white and framed in dark wood line the walls. Even from a distance, I can tell that the prints are antique.</p><p>To my right is a brass and wood registration desk, complete with an antique cash register. A display case in front of it is filled with brochures and flyers.</p><p>I stand there in the shadows, trying to figure out what to do, but it\u2019s difficult to think. My head hurts.</p><p>Maybe I should just lie down on the sofa and go to sleep.</p><p>But I\u2019m desperate for a bath.</p><p>I\u2019ve already committed a crime\u2014breaking and entering\u2014so I may as well find a bathroom and a bed.</p><p>I move forward cautiously.</p><p>One by one, I try to open the doors. None of the knobs turn for me, so I go upstairs. A single door is open to my left. I creep cautiously forward, and step into the room. Everything is in shadows; it takes me a minute to focus.</p><p>When I do, I see a boy, sitting up in bed, rubbing his eyes and blinking at me. \u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m Joy. I\u2019m sorry to just walk in on . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you real?\u201d</p><p>I smile at that. \u201cYes. I\u2019m trying to check in to the lodge, but there\u2019s no one at the desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Is there another motel nearby?\u201d</p><p>Now my head is pounding</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>This has certainly been my day. \u201cGreat.\u201d This half-baked adventure of mine is going from bad to worse.</p><p>\u201cWe got rooms, though,\u201d he says tiredly. \u201cAnd I know how to check guests in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I need . . .\u201d my voice cracks on that. There are too many things I need. It\u2019s best to focus on just the one. \u201cA room for the night would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad won\u2019t like it, but this is my house, too.\u201d He throws back the covers and gets out of bed. Walking past me, he heads out into the hallway, and then looks back at me. \u201cYou coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sure.\u201d</p><p>He leads me downstairs and shows me to the last door on the left side of the hallway. \u201cHere.\u201d He twists the knob and opens the door.</p><p>Inside the room, I find a narrow dresser, a queen-sized bed, and a desk in the corner. In the shadowy darkness, everything looks shabby but clean. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say. \u201cAbout paying . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople pay when they leave.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a relief. I can get my bank to wire funds at the end of my stay if I don\u2019t have enough cash.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d he says, and then he\u2019s off, running for the stairs.</p><p>I close the door behind me, and there I am, caught by moonlight in the rectangular mirror above the dresser.</p><p>I look like hell. Leaves and twigs inhabit my red hair, which has somehow puffed up to three times its usual size. My blue eyes\u2014usually my best feature\u2014are bloodshot, and my pale, freckled skin is blotchy with dirt.</p><p>Something\u2019s wrong.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Where is it?</p><p>I see scratches and scrapes but no deep wounds.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>It must have been rain I tasted as I lay there. Maybe I bit my tongue . . . or maybe that metallic taste was tears.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>What matters are a bath and a bed. In that order. I open the small connecting door to my bathroom.</p><p>Shower. Not a bath. A shower. I\u2019m disappointed but hardly surprised. This has not been a day when things went my way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I step into a steaming hot shower with my clothes on.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>Everything needs to be washed.</p><p>The first part of my slumber is bad, I\u2019ll admit it\u2014a kaleidoscope of ugly memories. The crash. My sister. Thom. The crash. But what I learn is this: when you\u2019re tired enough, you fall asleep, and nothing heals your mind like a peaceful night. When I waken, I feel remarkably good for a woman who survived a small plane crash and is currently running away from her real life.</p> <p>No.</p><p>I\u2019m not running away. I\u2019m on my first adventure.</p><p>Still, I can\u2019t help hoping\u2014just for a second\u2014that Stacey is still at my house, waiting for me. Worrying. Maybe she\u2019ll think I\u2019ve been kidnapped and call the police. Then she\u2019d be sorry for sleeping with my husband and breaking my heart. But even as I dive into the warm fantasy, I feel it grow cold. She won\u2019t call the cops, won\u2019t mount a search. A year ago, she would have. Not now. She no longer knows my life well enough to wonder at my absence. For all she knows, I\u2019m on the beach in Jamaica with some young hottie.</p><p>Or in a wild and primitive rainforest . . .</p><p>I listen to the birds outside my window. I can hear the lake, too, lapping lazily against the shore. Somewhere a radio is playing.</p> <p>In the bathroom, I find a small travel set in the top drawer. Toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, and body lotion. It\u2019s everything I need. So I take another long, luxurious shower and dress in yesterday\u2019s clothes. My black pants are dry, but stiff, likewise my now clean sweater set.</p><p>Showered and dressed, I feel ready to begin this adventure of mine.</p><p>I grab my camera and leave the safety of my room\u20141A, according to the plaque on the door\u2014and go in search of someone to check me in. If I\u2019m lucky, the boy is right and I can pay at the end of my stay.</p><p>The lobby is filled with pale sunlight and warmed by a crackling fire. In the light coming through the window, everything looks incredibly sharp and bright. Even the worn red-leather chairs and plaid sofa. I can see tiny diamond flecks in the fireplace\u2019s stonework. In contrast, without the sunlight, the registration area seems dull and vaguely gray. This is a part of the world where light changes everything, obviously. I take a few photographs of the lobby for my scrapbook, then turn toward the door.</p><p>In the distance, I hear the high pitched whine of a tool\u2014chainsaw, maybe, or a weed eater. A few moments later, there are footsteps outside, coming up the walk, crossing the deck.</p><p>The door opens.</p> <p>It\u2019s the boy I met last night. He\u2019s younger than I thought\u2014maybe eight or nine years old\u2014with shaggy black hair and freckled cheeks. His lashes are long enough to make him beautiful. But it is his eyes that I notice most. They\u2019re ice blue and sad.</p><p>When he sees me, he drops the hammer he is carrying.</p><p>I smile. \u201cHello again. It\u2019s nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy.\u201d He crosses his arms. I recognize the body language. It\u2019s what I do now when I look at my ex-sister, cross my arms, as if a few more layers of muscle and bone can protect my heart. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be gone.\u201d</p><p>I hear the way his voice trembles; it\u2019s loneliness, that sound. The sense that your boat has come untied and you\u2019re drifting away. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve felt everyday for almost a year. It\u2019s why I\u2019m here, pretending I don\u2019t have a sister. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay awhile. If that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Before I can say more, the front door bangs open, and a man walks in. He is whipcord lean, with close-cropped black hair and a face that is all sharp lines and deep hollows. A dark stubble shadows his sunken cheeks; the harsh color accentuates the paleness of his skin. His eyes are strangely green, a color too bright for the rest of his hard, weather-beaten face. I can see how handsome he once was, before life wore him down. I know how he feels. Sometimes in the last year, I\u2019ve thought that my color was washing away in the shower or fading in the sun. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to wake up one morning and find myself a black-and-white woman moving through a colored world. He doesn\u2019t even notice me. He is looking directly at the boy. \u201cWhat are you doing in here, boyo? I thought we were cutting trees together?\u201d His voice is deep and rich, softened by an Irish brogue.</p><p>\u201cI came in for a Coke and found her.\u201d He points at me. \u201cLast night I checked her in to room 1A . . . just like mom and me used to do when this place was open. Before you showed up.\u201d</p><p>The man looks at me for a second, maybe less. I am of no interest to him, obviously. \u201cA guest, huh? Well, that\u2019s grand.\u201d The way he says the last word leaves no doubt about his reaction. He does not find it grand at all. And though his voice is full of sarcasm, a lilting Irish brogue softens it. He barely looks at me.</p> <p>\u201cI guess my presence is a bit surprising,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I got here late last night. I\u2019d really like to stay a few days.\u201d</p><p>The man bends down for the hammer. Even with the distance between us, I can hear his sigh. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want me to sell this place, Bobby, but one guest isn\u2019t gonna change things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were selling cause no one stayed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it here,\u201d the boy\u2014Bobby\u2014cries out. \u201cAnd I know how to check in guests. Mommy taught me.\u201d</p><p>The man seems to deflate at that. \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be any trouble,\u201d I say. Suddenly I\u2019m scared. If I leave here, I\u2019ll go home. I know me. I\u2019ve never handled obstacles particularly well, and I don\u2019t want to go home yet. Stacey will be waiting for me; I\u2019ll have to deal with the wedding and the baby and my broken heart. \u201cJust a few days. Please? I need a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stayin\u2019,\u201d Bobby says defiantly, looking at his father.</p><p>The man looks at his son, and in the glance that goes between them, I see a pair of people who\u2019ve lost their way together. \u201cTell her not to expect anything from me. I\u2019m too busy to play host.\u201d</p><p>I feel a surge of gratitude. Every runaway needs a break, and this stranger has given it to me. I can stay here\u2014hide out\u2014for a while, just long enough to catch my breath and gather my courage for the next round of real life.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate this. You . . . can\u2019t know . . .\u201d I don\u2019t know how to express it, how much this means to me. If I say all that I\u2019m feeling he\u2019ll write me off as a wacko. \u201cI\u2019m Joy,\u201d I say by way of introduction.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Daniel. I\u2019m Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Daniel looks irritated. \u201cCome on, Bobby, I need your help clearing trees down by the lake. Your mum let this place go.\u201d</p><p>Bobby moves reluctantly toward his father. When they are at the door, Bobby looks back at me. Then, wordlessly, he follows his father outside.</p><p>I n the quiet that follows their departure, it strikes me: I\u2019m staying. I am on my first vacation in years, and I am in an exotic location. Although it started off rocky (okay, so that\u2019s a mammoth understatement), as the kids at school say: it\u2019s all good now.</p><p>I have been given a great gift in this holiday season.</p><p>Time.</p><p>Time to let go of some of this baggage that has weighed me down in the past year. There\u2019s no way for me to gauge how long this interlude will last, so I better take full advantage of the time I have.</p><p>No whining or moping or crying. That\u2019s the resolution I make.</p><p>Here, for as long as my time lasts, I intend to be the old\u2014or, perhaps the young\u2014Joy Faith Candellaro, the woman who believes in love and marriage and fairy tales. The woman I used to be.</p><p>But first I need to find something to eat\u2014I\u2019m starving.</p><p>It takes me hardly any time to find the kitchen. The small, old-fashioned space reminds me vaguely of my mom\u2019s kitchen in the house in which I grew up\u2014same yellow beadboard cabinets, silver appliances, and oak plank floors. It has a lovely, homey feel, and the scent of freshly made coffee makes my mouth water.</p><p>The coffee tastes better on my vacation than it ever did at home. Same goes for the bagel and cream cheese I find in the fridge. Opening the drawer by the stove, I look for a paper and pen. Like all junk drawers everywhere, it\u2019s full: playing cards, paper clips, store receipts, recipes ripped out of magazines, red marking pens, and travel brochures. Tucked in the back is a brand new DVD movie, unopened. The Lost Boys. The receipt taped to its face is dated three days ago.</p><p>It\u2019s the same movie I bought a week ago, on sale at Target.</p><p>So, we have the same weird taste in movies. Smiling at the unexpected connection, I find what I\u2019m looking for: a notepad and pen. On the blue-lined page, I write: bagel, one tablespoon cream cheese, coffee. At the end of my stay, I\u2019ll figure out a way to pay for all of it. Thank God for the computerized world. It won\u2019t take five minutes at an ATM for me to get cash, even here, in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Later, perhaps I\u2019ll take a cab to town, but for now, I want to explore this place where I have so unexpectedly landed. I stop by my room, get my camera, and go outside.</p><p>In full daylight, I am amazed by this wild, isolated corner of the world.</p><p>Everything is washed out, softened somehow by air that is threaded with fog. There is water everywhere: in the grass that springs beneath my feet, in the steady dripping of drops from branches and eaves, in the slap of waves against the dock. I feel rejuvenated by the moisture, like a desert traveler who has stumbled onto an impossible oasis. I can\u2019t see anything with perfect clarity; it is a world veiled by mist and water, and yet made all the more beautiful by obscurity. Lord knows I\u2019ve seen my life too clearly in the past year. I choose my photographs carefully; I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get more film.</p><p>Looking for the perfect shot, I walk out toward the lake. The water is a soft gray, striated by reflections of the clouds above.</p><p>The shore is made up of tiny bits of pea gravel and stones that seem polished to a mirrored black sheen. A silvery wooded dock juts out above the water. Waves slap playfully at the pilings. Not far away, a gorgeous hand-built swing set stands empty; every now and then the wind rattles the chains.</p><p>There are no other houses on the lake that I can see. It is almost primeval, this forest. I have never seen anything like it.</p><p>I turn and look back at the lodge. From a distance, it looks more quaint than run down. According to the article I read, the place is more than sixty years old. In the photographs in the magazine, there were kids on the lawn, tossing Frisbees to one another and trying to use hula hoops, others playing badminton and croquet. No doubt the canoes and paddleboats and kayaks stacked by the dock would have been in constant use.</p><p>For the rest of the day, I poke through the cabins behind the lodge. They are shabby but quaint. With a new coat of paint, refinished floors, and a lot of scrubbing with bleach, they could be ready for guests. The old windows, with their wavy glass and clear maple trim, are in great shape, as are the skinned log interior walls.</p><p>I take pictures of all of it\u2014of spiderwebs beaded with dew, of swans on the lake, of listing cabins furred by moss and inhabited by mice. All the while, I find myself imagining what this place could be. There was a time, ten or twelve years ago, when I dreamed of owning a bed and breakfast. During those years, I collected dozens of books and hundreds of articles on inn management. I can picture each cottage with old-fashioned brass beds, big fluffy down comforters, and hand-painted dressers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, as I stand on the dock staring out at the lake, holding my camera, I think of the file cabinets in my garage, and the adventures-to-be within their slick gray metal sides.</p><p>I should never have let Thom relegate my dreams to the garage. That, I see now, was the beginning of the end. Even yesterday that realization would have made me cry; now I find myself smiling.</p><p>I\u2019m dreaming again, for the first time in years, and it feels good.</p><p>A sound breaks my thoughts. I turn slowly, scan the place.</p> <p>Daniel is on the roof, hammering shingles. There\u2019s a lonely sound in the way the nails ring out. I watch him for a long time, almost willing him to look up and see me, but he works like a machine or a man on a mission, without pause.</p><p>Finally, I turn away and walk along the shore, kicking rocks, noticing the moss that grows on everything. It\u2019s like being in the land that time forgot. Every leaf is huge, every tree towering, every stone coated with moss. I am about to reach down for an agate when I hear a child\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the voice says, trembling. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>I follow the sound into the woods and find Bobby, kneeling in a clearing. Evergreens ring him, rising high into the swollen sky, blocking out all but a single, golden shaft of light. The ground is a bed of lime-green moss and tiny fiddleback ferns. In front of him is a rustic wooden bench made of twisted and shiny tree limbs.</p><p>Bobby looks incredibly small in this spot, surrounded as he is by giant trees. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he says to no one. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p> <p>I can hear the tremor in his voice and it moves me, compels me to take a step closer. \u201cBobby?\u201d</p><p>He stiffens at the sound of my voice, but doesn\u2019t turn to me or answer.</p><p>I move closer. Edging past him, I start to sit down on the bench.</p><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d he screams, pushing me aside. \u201cYou\u2019ll sit on her.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice makes my blood run cold. I stop suddenly. \u201cBobby?\u201d</p><p>He kneels in the dirt and slumps forward. \u201cIt\u2019s okay now. She\u2019s gone. You can sit.\u201d</p> <p>He looks utterly broken, this boy who only yesterday defied his father to let me stay here. He picks up two action figures from the ground beside his knees and makes them battle. It\u2019s Darth Vader and Count Dooku, I think. A woman doesn\u2019t work in a high school without learning about popular culture. I finally sit down on the bench in front of him. \u201cAre you okay, Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound fine. Do you want to tell me why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think I\u2019m crazy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I think that?\u201d</p><p>He uses Darth to smack Dooku. \u201cThey all think I\u2019m wacko.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>He finally looks at me. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe I see her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee who?\u201d</p><p>It takes him a moment to say, \u201cMy mom. She\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>I feel as if we\u2019ve just swum out too far in cold water. \u201cIs that who you were talking to when I got here?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy, though. I know she\u2019s in Heaven. But I see her sometimes. Dad thinks she\u2019s imaginary, like Mr. Patches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Patches was an imaginary friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>Bobby makes a sound of disgust. \u201cUh. Yeah. When I was like . . . four.\u201d He goes back to his action figures, makes them fight. \u201cI\u2019m not imagining my mom.\u201d</p><p>I find myself thinking of the plane crash, when I \u201csaw\u201d my mom. The vision was so complete and full, I believed it and I\u2019m an adult. A boy this age could hardly be expected to fully comprehend tricks of the mind.</p><p>Of the heart.</p><p>\u201cI saw my mom just the other day, and she\u2019s been dead for ten years.\u201d</p><p>Bobby looks up again. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI talk to her all the time.\u201d</p><p>Bobby seems to consider that, and me. \u201cDoes she talk back?\u201d</p><p>I think about that. On a few memorable, rare occasions, I\u2019ve felt her presence. \u201cIn a way, maybe. Mostly I think I know what she would say.\u201d</p><p>Bobby starts cracking the action figures together again. \u201cHe\u2019s glad she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad.\u201d</p><p>I glance out toward the lake and, though I can\u2019t see the lodge, I can hear Daniel hammering.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m s\u2019posed to pretend to like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cHim and Mommy got divorced when I was four. I don\u2019t even know him. He\u2019s only here \u2019cuz she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Four. The same year Mr. Patches arrived. I\u2019ve had enough child development classes to make the obvious connection.</p><p>I consider carefully how to respond. We are speaking of serious matters of the heart here, and it\u2019s hardly my place, but we teachers know that timing isn\u2019t always perfect with kids. If they bring up a sensitive subject, you\u2019d best run with it. There is often no second chance. \u201cHe\u2019s here, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d Bobby wipes his eyes and turns away from me, obviously embarrassed by the display of emotion.</p><p>I remember how he feels. When I was eight, my own dad walked out on us. I waited years for him to return. I slide off the bench and kneel in front of Bobby. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to cry,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what grown-ups say, but it\u2019s not true. Arnie Holtzner says only babies cry. And now everyone calls me crybaby at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArnie Holtzner is a butthead who won\u2019t have friends for long.\u201d</p><p>Bobby looks shocked by that. A tiny, hesitant smile plucks at his mouth. \u201cYou called Arnie a bad word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can think of worse than butthead, believe me.\u201d</p><p>Bobby stares at me for a moment, obviously trying not to smile. \u201cYou want to watch me play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, finding it easy to smile. I almost laugh, in fact. Here, in this strange clearing, hundreds of miles from home, I feel both lost and somehow found. I lower my voice. I hunker down, get eye level with the action figures. \u201cCome on, Vader, fight back.\u201d</p><p>That night, though I fall asleep easily, I wake up in a cold sweat, unable to draw an even breath. Memories of the crash won\u2019t let go of me. I would swear that the grit in my eyes is ash.</p><p>I try to fall back asleep, but it is impossible. My headache has returned, as has the pain in my chest. It\u2019s not real, I know, just the phantom ache of a broken heart. It\u2019s a pain I\u2019ve lived with since the day I came home unexpectedly and found Stacey and Thom together. Throwing back the covers, I get out of bed and go to the window.</p><p>The first pink brush stroke of dawn sweeps across the black sky. I grab my camera, get dressed, and leave my room. Halfway to the lobby, I hear a voice: It\u2019s Daniel\u2019s soft, lilting brogue.</p><p>I peer around the corner.</p><p>He is at the window, staring out at the lake. His black hair is a tangled, untended mess.</p><p>Moving quietly, I edge around the corner and I see what he\u2019s looking at.</p><p>Bobby is out at the lake, alone, and gesturing wildly. Even from this distance, and through the murky, unreliable dawn light, I can see that no one is near him.</p><p>I see her sometimes.</p><p>\u201cGod help us,\u201d Daniel says in a broken voice.</p><p>I know he is praying, asking God for help. Still, the words are given to me. I feel a strange binding to them.</p><p>With a curse, he goes outside and walks down the path to the lake.</p><p>I move cautiously toward the window, but from here, I won\u2019t be able to hear them. If I\u2019m going to eavesdrop, I should do it correctly. On this specious bit of logic, which I know is really only curiosity, I slip outside and step into the dark shadows cast by a Volkswagen-sized rhododendron.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Bobby? I thought we agreed about this,\u201d Daniel says.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me from talking to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe tomorrow we\u2019ll go see Father James. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back to being a stork broker. I don\u2019t want you here,\u201d Bobby says. Pushing past his dad, he runs back into the lodge. He is crying too hard to see me.</p><p>Daniel stands there a long time, looking out at the lake. There\u2019s a strange intimacy between us; I\u2019m trapped by his presence. I can\u2019t move from my hiding place without risk.</p><p>At last, he turns away from the water and returns to the house, muttering under his breath as he passes me. Once inside, he slams the door shut so hard it bangs back open.</p><p>I stand there a long moment, in the darkness, then step out into the dawning light. Behind the black trees and gunmetal gray lake, the sky is awash in layers of color\u2014fuschia, lavender, neon orange.</p><p>I bring the camera up and find the perfect shot, but by the time I take it, I\u2019ve lost interest. What I care about right now can\u2019t be put in focus or framed in a neat little viewfinder.</p><p>Bobby and Daniel are in trouble. They are obviously drowning in a sea of what they\u2019ve lost.</p><p>I know about those dark waters.</p><p>Someone needs to throw them a life ring.</p><p>B ack in the kitchen, I find a pot of coffee and a plate of muffins. Blueberry, my favorite. I add one cup of coffee and a single muffin to my tab, then go in search of mementos for my trip.</p><p>The perfect photograph. I\u2019ll accept nothing less.</p><p>Outside, the pink dawn has given way to a gray and yellow day of inconsistent weather: There, by the road, it\u2019s cloudy and rainy; here at the front door, it\u2019s shadowy and moist; down by the lake, it\u2019s sunny.</p><p>As I walk down the path, the air is thick with mist. Birdsong bursts forth in Gatling gun spasms with every step I take. I snap several photographs before the swing set catches my eye. This is a magnificent specimen\u2014obviously hand-built and carefully designed. It has a slide, two swings, and a fort.</p><p>I used to love swinging; at the house in Calabasas, Stacey and I spent hours in the air, side by side, and pushing each other. I go to the swing set, set my camera gently on a step, and wipe dew from one of the black leather seats. Sitting, I lean back and pump my legs until I\u2019m practically flying. The lemon and charcoal sky fills my vision.</p><p>\u201cGrown-ups don\u2019t play on the swings.\u201d</p><p>At Bobby\u2019s voice, I stab my feet into the loose dirt and skid to a stop.</p><p>He\u2019s standing near the skinned log stanchion. His eyes are bloodshot from crying. Tiny pink sleep lines crisscross his face. His curly hair is stick straight in places.</p><p>I feel an almost overwhelming urge to take him in my arms and hold him. Instead, I say: \u201cThey don\u2019t, huh? Who says?\u201d</p><p>He frowns at me. \u201cI dunno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to join me?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a long time, then eases toward the other swing. There, he takes a seat and leans back.</p><p>\u201cThis is a great swing set. Someone worked hard on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad made it. A long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Together we swing, side by side, up and down. The clouds overhead coalesce and disperse and float away.</p><p>\u201cYou see that cloud there?\u201d I say, on the upswing. \u201cThe pointy one. What does it look like to you?\u201d</p><p>Bobby is quiet for a while, then he says, \u201cMy mommy. She had puffy hair like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it looks like . . . hmmmm. A Zipperumpa-zoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of Professor Wormbog and his search for the Zipperumpa-zoo?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head solemnly.</p><p>\u201cOh, my. I guess I\u2019ll have to tell you the story sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCross my heart.\u201d</p><p>He finally smiles and leans back, pumping his legs. \u201cHow about that cloud? It looks like a pointy stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a piece of coconut cream pie.\u201d</p><p>He giggles. \u201cOr Gandalf\u2019s hat.\u201d</p><p>We swing so long I go from feeling airy and light to light-headed. I slow down, stare out at the lake. Quiet settles in between us, turns awkward. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for me to tell you that story now. We could sit on the grass.\u201d</p> <p>Bobby sighs. \u201cI gotta go to youth group today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArnie Holtzner is there. And Father James always tries to talk to me about Mom. He thinks I\u2019d feel better if I prayed. As if.\u201d</p><p>I turn to look at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it would help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod let her die, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I say, recognizing the emotion. \u201cSo you\u2019re mad at Him.\u201d</p> <p>Bobby shrugs. \u201cI just don\u2019t wanna pray.\u201d</p><p>The clouds bunch up above us, take on a steely tinge. Before Bobby finishes saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna rain,\u201d it\u2019s pouring.</p><p>Laughing, we run for the house. Inside, I shake off, but no amount of movement will dry my clothes. I peel off my clammy sweater and wipe the rain from my eyes. \u201cI have got to go to town for clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lost and found box in your closet. My mommy kept everything in case people came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless Dad threw it away. He can\u2019t wait to get rid of our stuff.\u201d</p><p>I hurry to my room, open the closet, and there it is: a cardboard box marked Lost and Found. The box is heaped with clothing of all kinds and sizes. After a thorough search, I choose a black broomstick skirt with an elastic waistband that falls almost to my ankles, an ivory boatneck sweater, and black knee socks.</p><p>When I return to the lobby, dressed in my new wardrobe, Bobby is waiting for me. \u201cCan we play more?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you had to go to youth group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot till after lunch. Dad wants to finish painting the hall upstairs. So he can sell the place and move us to Bawston.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling at his perfect accent. I sit down on the floor beside him. \u201cYou don\u2019t like Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told your dad that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike he listens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should try talking to him.\u201d</p><p>Mondo hypocrisy. Suddenly I\u2019m Dear Abby. Me, who ran away from a sister who wanted to talk. \u201cMy parents got divorced when I was about your age. My mom took my sister and me across the country for a new start. My dad just . . . let us go. I never saw him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d</p><p>A frown darts across his forehead. For a second, I think he\u2019s going to say something. Instead, he gets up and walks over to the fireplace. On the hearth is an old wooden box; from which he produces two action figures. Gandalf in white with his staff and Samwise in full Orc regalia. \u201cYou wanna play?\u201d</p><p>I can see how afraid he is to talk about his feelings for his father. How could I not understand that\u2014me, who is on the run from real life?</p><p>I crane my neck, try to see into the box. \u201cYou have a Frodo in there?\u201d</p><p>Bobby giggles. \u201cYeah. We\u2019ll pretend he\u2019s wearing the ring.\u201d</p><p>Bobby and I spend the morning on the living room floor, battling our way through Mordor and up the steep brick sides of Mount Doom. Honestly, I can\u2019t remember when I\u2019ve had so much fun. We talk about things that don\u2019t matter and laugh about them. Sometime around noon, Daniel comes downstairs. Splattered with paint, carrying two brushes and a bucket, he walks past us. \u201cCome on, Bobby. It\u2019s time for youth group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Move it.\u201d Daniel opens the front door and sets his supplies on the deck. \u201cLet\u2019s go, boyo. We\u2019ll have lunch at the diner first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019n Joy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Bobby throws me a \u201csee?\u201d look and climbs to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m coming, Emperor.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s all I can do not to smile at the tender defiance.</p><p>I would have called my dad a hell of a lot worse than emperor at his age. \u201cBye, you guys,\u201d I say from my place on the floor.</p><p>Bobby looks back at me longingly. \u201cYou can keep playing if you want. You can even be Frodo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><p>Daniel herds his son out the door. A few minutes later, I hear a car start up and drive away.</p><p>Then it\u2019s quiet again.</p><p>I try to figure out what to do next. I could walk to town for clothes and film and food, or take a walk in the woods, or borrow a canoe and go out on the lake, or sleep. Last night was hard: nightmares plagued me.</p><p>I close my eyes. It feels so great here, lying on the soft woolen carpet, feeling the heat from a fading fire, listening to the quiet.</p><p>In my dreams, I\u2019m lying on an air mattress, floating on Lake Curran. The sun overhead is hot and bright; when I try to open my eyes, it hurts. I can feel people around me, splashing in the water. My sister\u2019s voice is the most constant: I\u2019m sorry. The apology is repeated over and over. I know she wants me to open my eyes, take her hand, and tell her it\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s not okay. She\u2019s broken my heart. I hear my mother in my dreams, too, telling me to wake up. I\u2019m sure that she wants me to forgive Stacey also. I want to tell them I can\u2019t do it, but then I\u2019m floating away on the tide. I\u2019m on the ocean now, alone . . . then I\u2019m in a child\u2019s bed, then in a white room.</p><p>\u201cAre you KIDDING me?\u201d</p><p>The sentence shakes me, jars me. With great effort, I open my eyes. At first, I expect to see water, blue and lit by the sun.</p><p>I see green carpet and wooden planks and the lower half of a plaid sofa.</p><p>I\u2019m in the lodge, asleep on the living room floor. I blink, trying to focus, and push up to my knees.</p><p>Daniel is in the registration area, pacing, talking on the phone. \u201cWhat do you mean, a fight?\u201d</p><p>I frown, sit back on my heels.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s eight years old,\u201d Daniel says, then curses under his breath. \u201cSorry, Father. And do you think I\u2019ve not tried? God\u2019s the enemy now. And me.\u201d</p><p>I get slowly to my feet and stand there by the fireplace. He hasn\u2019t seen me yet, but when he does, I know he won\u2019t be happy. He doesn\u2019t want me in the lodge, let alone eavesdropping on personal conversations. But I can\u2019t seem to move. He looks so . . . the right word escapes me. Not angry, not upset.</p><p>Wounded.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he says after a pause. Then, \u201cI\u2019ll be right down.\u201d He slams the phone down on the table, then curses loudly and runs a hand through his hair. Slowly, he turns toward the living room.</p><p>I\u2019m standing there, frozen, staring at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, lifting my hands.</p><p>\u201cWell if this isn\u2019t just what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on the floor. I didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slides past me\u2014a pointed reminder that I don\u2019t belong here\u2014and catches on the photographs on the mantel to my left.</p><p>Family photos.</p><p>With another curse, he storms out of the lodge and slams the door shut behind him.</p><p>Outside, I hear the car engine start, and wheels sputtering on wet gravel. Only then do I move.</p><p>I turn to the mantel, pick up one of the photographs. In it, Bobby is a pudgy-faced baby in a blue snowsuit. Daniel is smiling brightly and holding a beautiful, dark-haired woman close. There\u2019s no mistaking the love in their eyes.</p><p>No wonder Daniel is rude to me. This time is tough enough on him and Bobby without an uninvited spectator.</p><p>For the next half hour, I busy myself in the kitchen, making lunch and then cleaning up my mess. When I\u2019m done, I return to my room, where I wash out my other clothes and hang them over the shower rod to dry, then I wander back to the lobby.</p><p>The fire is fading now, falling apart in a shower of sparks.</p><p>I am standing in front of it, warming my hands when they return.</p><p>Bobby comes in first, looking utterly dejected. \u201cHey, Joy. Dad says I can\u2019t play my GameBoy for two days. And I didn\u2019t start nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I turn to face them.</p><p>Daniel sits in the chair opposite me. I can tell by the way he looks at Bobby that he\u2019s been as bruised by this fight as his son. He doesn\u2019t look angry; rather, I see sadness in him. \u201cThis is a family matter,\u201d he says pointedly. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to her. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Shut up, Joy.</p><p>Shut up.</p><p>I can\u2019t do it. Daniel\u2019s been out of his son\u2019s life for a few years; maybe he hasn\u2019t been around children in that time. \u201cKids get in fights,\u201d I say as gently as I can. \u201cI\u2019m a high school librarian. Believe me, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my dad,\u201d Bobby says, sidling up beside me.</p><p>\u201cNot me what?\u201d Daniel says, irritated. When he looks at us\u2014Bobby and me\u2014he\u2019s not smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never get punched at school.\u201d Bobby\u2019s voice quivers. In the tremor, I hear how much he wants not to have disappointed his father.</p><p>To my surprise, Daniel smiles. \u201cWhen I was a lad in Dublin, I got into plenty of scraps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. And I got my arse kicked, I\u2019ll tell you. My own Da used to go after me. He said he didn\u2019t wanna raise no Mama\u2019s boy.\u201d His smile fades. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with bein\u2019 a mama\u2019s boy. She loved you something fierce, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she wouldn\u2019t want you fighting at church group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>I want to jump in with some stellar bit of advice that changes their lives and draws them together, but I know it\u2019s not my place.</p><p>For too long, we\u2019re all quiet.</p><p>Finally Daniel stands. \u201cI\u2019d best get to work on the bedrooms upstairs. No one is going to buy this place in the shape it\u2019s in. You coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna show Joy my arrowheads.\u201d</p><p>Irritation flashes in Daniel\u2019s eyes and then is gone. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll work alone then.\u201d Without another glance, he goes up the stairs and disappears.</p><p>As soon as Daniel is gone, I look down at Bobby. \u201cYou aren\u2019t too nice to your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t too nice to me.\u201d He pushes the hair from his eyes, revealing an angry purple bruise above his eye. \u201cHe yelled at me about fighting, and it wasn\u2019t even my fault.\u201d</p><p>I wish I could reach out for him, but he doesn\u2019t seem ready for comfort. So, instead, I say, \u201cHow does the other guy look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed,\u201d Bobby says miserably. \u201cAnd I wanted to hit him. I was so mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders lump in defeat. \u201cArnie Holtzner punched me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe butthead? How come?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c \u2019Cuz I\u2019m a crybaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are no crybaby, Bobby. You\u2019re a very brave boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were makin\u2019 Christmas ornaments out of cotton balls and Life Savers. I said I din\u2019t want to make one, and Arnie asked why, and I said \u2019cuz the ornaments were stupid and he said I was stupid and I said I wasn\u2019t. Then he socked me.\u201d</p><p>I want to say, Arnie\u2019s an ass, but I hold back. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want to make an ornament?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Cuz we aren\u2019t gonna have a tree.\u201d His voice catches. He glances at the door his father just slammed. \u201cMy mom would never forget Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I know I should keep my mouth shut, but when I look down at this bruised little boy, I am drawn by some force that can\u2019t be denied. \u201cYou never know, Bobby. Christmas is full of magic.\u201d</p><p>For the remainder of the afternoon, Bobby and I play board games and watch Winnie-the-Pooh movies. All the while I can hear Daniel working upstairs\u2014hammering, sanding, walking from room to room.</p> <p>I tell myself to stay out of their business, but the admonition has a hollow, empty sound.</p><p>These two need help, and it\u2019s Christmas. I may have lost my own holiday spirit, but I can\u2019t watch a little boy lose his. Besides, this is my first real adventure. What kind of adventurer ignores the needs of others?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play again,\u201d Bobby says, reaching for his game piece.</p><p>I laugh. Three rounds of Candy Land are all any adult can reasonably be expected to survive, though, with Bobby drawing my cards and moving my game pieces, I must admit that I\u2019ve hardly been paying attention. \u201cNo way. How about we do something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d He pops to his feet and runs upstairs; moments later he\u2019s back, holding a mason jar full of rocks. \u201cIt\u2019s my collection.\u201d He flops down on the floor and dumps out the jar. Dozens of stones splatter out. Several arrowheads are mixed in with the pretty stones. Bits of beach glass add color to the pile.</p><p>I kneel beside him. \u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>He picks them up one by one; each piece has a story. There are agates, beach rocks, and arrowheads. His voice runs fast, like a weed eater in summer as he talks. Mommy found this one by the river. This one was at the beach, hidden underneath a log. I found this one all by myself. When he\u2019s finished, he sits back on his heels. \u201cShe always said she\u2019d find me a white arrowhead.\u201d</p><p>I hear the drop in his voice, the way grief sidles in beside him. \u201cYour mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She said we\u2019d find it together.\u201d</p><p>To change the subject, I say, \u201cWhat\u2019s that nickel doing in the jar?\u201d</p><p>He barely looks at it. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s definitely something in his nothing. \u201cReally? No reason at all? Because those are your special things.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for a perfectly ordinary nickel. \u201cDaddy gave me this when we were at the county fair. He bought me a snowcone and let me keep the change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that blue button?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a moment before Bobby answers, and when he does speak, his voice is soft. \u201cThat\u2019s from Daddy\u2019s work shirt. It came off when we were playin\u2019 helicopter. I . . .\u201d He throws the nickel in the jar, then scoops everything back in. The arrowheads and rocks rattle and clang against the glass.</p><p>I smooth the hair from his forehead, but he is so intent on the nickel that he seems not to have noticed my touch. He looks as bruised on the inside right now as he is on the outside, and the sight of this poor kid, looking so lost, tears at my heart.</p><p>\u201cHow about if I read you a story?\u201d</p><p>A smile breaks across his face. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. I don\u2019t suppose you have Professor Wormbog and the Search for the Zipperumpa-Zoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I got one my mom always read to me.\u201d</p><p>I hear the tiny upward lilt in his voice, the single note of hope, and it makes me smile. \u201cGo get it. And if you have a Dr. Seuss, get that, too.\u201d</p><p>Bobby runs upstairs. I hear his hurried footsteps overhead, the banging of doors.</p><p>In moments he is back, clattering down the stairs, clutching a pair of books. \u201cI found \u2019em,\u201d he yells triumphantly, as if they were big game animals he\u2019d bagged.</p><p>I sit down on the sofa and he curls up next to me, handing me a lovely blue book that is the Disney movie version of Beauty and the Beast.</p><p>I take it gently, open it between us, and begin to read aloud. \u201cOnce upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a magical kingdom where just about everything was perfect . . .\u201d</p><p>The words take us to a place where plates and candelabras can be a boy\u2019s best friend and a beast can become a prince. I lose myself in the words, and find myself. In the past years, as my job became more and more about computers and technology and Internet searches, I\u2019d forgotten why I started. The love of books, of reading. There\u2019s nothing a librarian likes better than sharing her love of words with a child. When I close the book, Bobby is beaming up at me. \u201cAgain!\u201d he says, bouncing in his seat.</p><p>I put down Beauty and the Beast and pick up the bright orange Dr. Seuss. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>His face closes tighter than a submarine hatch. \u201cI don\u2019t read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I open the book, point to the first sentence, and read: \u201cI am Sam.\u201d Then I wait.</p><p>When the quiet stretches out too long, Bobby looks up at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting. It\u2019s your turn to read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you deaf? I can\u2019t read.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cHow about just the first word?\u201d</p><p>He glares at me, his chin jutted out. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry. Just the first word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>I can feel his surrender. He goes limp beside me and sighs.</p><p>He stares down at the book, frowning, then says, \u201cI. But that\u2019s just a letter. Big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also a word.\u201d</p><p>This time when he turns to me he looks scared. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d His voice is a whisper. \u201cArnie says I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. Don\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019ll help.\u201d I smile gently. \u201cAnd you know what I think of Arnie.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he tries to sound out the next word. When he stumbles, I offer a tiny bit of help and a heap of encouragement.</p><p>\u201cS . . . A . . . M.\u201d Bobby frowns up at me. \u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read the whole page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a baby book,\u201d he says, but a smile plucks at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBabies can\u2019t read I Am Sam. Only big boys can do that.\u201d I turn the page.</p><p>By the time we get to Green Eggs and Ham? Bobby has stopped frowning. It takes a long time, but he finally sounds out the entire story, and when he finishes, he is laughing. \u201cI read the whole book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did really well,\u201d I say. Gently, I add, \u201cMaybe you could read with your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I heard him tell my teacher that I needed a too-tor. That\u2019s something for dumb kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tutor is not something for dumb kids. I tutor kids in the library all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Before I can answer, I hear footsteps coming down the stairs. Bobby and I both look up.</p><p>\u201cCome on, boyo,\u201d Daniel says tiredly. \u201cLet\u2019s go get some dinner in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019n Joy come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The curtness of Daniel\u2019s answer hurts my feelings\u2014as ridiculous as that is\u2014until I see his face. The question has wounded him. He is jealous of me\u2014of Bobby choosing to be with me. I know a thing or two about jealousy, how it can cut you to the bone and bring out the worst in you. I also know that it is grounded in love.</p><p>\u201cTalk to him,\u201d I whisper; the irony of my advice doesn\u2019t escape me. Apparently a woman running away from a conversation with her sister has no problem telling others to talk.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Bobby. They run out of meatloaf early on weekends. And it\u2019s your favorite.\u201d</p><p>Bobby gets up. His shoulders droop sadly as he walks away from me. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. I like pizza.\u201d</p><p>Daniel winces. His voice tightens. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019re gone, I sit on the sofa, listening to the dying fire. Rain hammers the roof and falls in silver beads down the windows, blurring the outside world. It is fitting, that obscurity, for right now, what I care about is in this lodge.</p><p>I have to do something to help Bobby and Daniel.</p><p>But what?</p><p>That night, I have trouble sleeping again. There are too many things on my mind. Sleep comes and goes; too often I am plagued by nightmare images of my sister and Thom, of the wedding invitation she handed me, of the plane crash.</p><p>But when dawn finally comes to my small, small room and taps on the window, I have only one worry left. The others I have let go.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s Christmas.</p><p>This is a problem I can solve, unlike the issues in my own life. Here and now, I can do something that will make a difference in someone\u2019s life, and perhaps that\u2014the simple act of helping someone else\u2014will help me in my own.</p><p>After a quick shower, I redress in my \u201cnew\u201d clothes and head for the lobby.</p><p>As I suspected, Daniel is outside already. I can see him on his tractor, clearing the area down by the lake. Already, I know him well enough to know that he will work most of the day. Now is the time.</p><p>Running upstairs, I go straight to Bobby\u2019s room and find him still in bed. \u201cBobby? Wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a plan.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his eyes. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA secret mission.\u201d</p><p>He sits up. \u201cLike we\u2019re spies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly like that.\u201d</p><p>He throws back the covers and climbs out of bed. In his Spiderman jammies and clotted hair, he looks incredibly young.</p><p>\u201cDownstairs,\u201d I say, checking my watch. \u201cIt\u2019s 9:07. You have five minutes or you\u2019ll miss the mission. Don\u2019t forget to brush your teeth.\u201d</p><p>He giggles.</p><p>I\u2019m smiling, too, as I head for the door. Four minutes later, he comes barreling downstairs like a Saint Bernard puppy, all feet and exuberance.</p><p>\u201cDid I make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight on time. Now, Agent 001, we need to be quiet and careful.\u201d</p><p>He nods solemnly.</p><p>I lead him outside. We move cautiously, not wanting to be seen. Not that it matters. Daniel is deep in the trees now, out of our view.</p><p>We go to the spot where Daniel was working yesterday. There, at least a dozen young fir trees lay on their sides, waiting to be chopped into firewood. \u201cHmmm,\u201d I say, tapping my chin with my forefinger. \u201cWhich of these trees wants to come to your house for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Bobby gasps. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put up a Christmas tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let me worry about your father,\u201d I say with more bravado than I feel.</p><p>Bobby giggles again. \u201cOkay, Secret Agent Joy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. You can\u2019t say my name out loud.\u201d</p><p>He clamps a hand over his mouth and points to a rather sad and scrawny tree, which he drags back to the lodge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once there, we move quickly and quietly. Bobby runs upstairs, then returns with a poinsettia-decorated red box full of lights. He makes this trip several times, until there are four boxes and a tree stand on the stone hearth.</p><p>It takes us almost twenty minutes to get the tree in the stand and positioned correctly. I am no help at all, which wouldn\u2019t surprise my sister. Bobby and I giggle at our ineptitude and hush each other. Every few minutes we go to the window and make sure that Daniel is busy. It isn\u2019t until I stand back to inspect the tree that I really feel it.</p><p>A tug of loss and longing. I can\u2019t help remembering how it used to be between me and Stacey at this magical time of year. Like the time she gave me the Holly Hobbie doll Santa had given her, just because I wanted it more. And there was the hellacious camping trip when we were little. Mom had been in full headband-wearing, tie-dyed T-shirt glory in those days. Singing and smoking and drinking through seven desert states. Stacey\u2019s sense of humor had kept me sane.</p><p>Now she\u2019ll be having Christmas morning without me. That\u2019s never happened before, not in the whole of our lives. I believe in reconciliation for Daniel and Bobby, but what about for me and Stacey?</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>I wipe my eyes and shrug. How can I possibly fold all that longing into something as small as words?</p><p>We pause for a moment, taking strength from each other, then we get to work. I decide to let him choose and place all the ornaments and lights. It\u2019s his tree, after all; my job is encouragement and understanding.</p><p>He goes to the box. Choosing takes a long time. Finally, he reaches down and finds an ornament. It is an intricately painted globe that reflects the rainforest. He shows it to me. \u201cMy mommy made this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>He puts the ornament on the tree, then returns to the box. For the next hour he moves in a ceaseless, circular pattern, from the box to the tree and back again. At each ornament, he says something, gives me some piece of himself.</p><p>Finally, he comes to the last ornament in the box. \u201cThis was her favorite. I made it in day care.\u201d</p><p>He hands it to me. I take it gently, mindful of the fragility of both its structure and sentiment. It is a macaroni and ribbon frame, painted silver. Inside is a photograph of Bobby and a beautiful dark-haired woman with sad eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d he says.</p><p>Below the picture someone has written: Bobby and Maggie/2001.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lovely,\u201d I say because there\u2019s nothing else. I wish he\u2019d turn to me, let me hug him, but he stands stiffly beside me. Pushing the hair from his eyes, I let my hand linger on his warm cheek. \u201cIt\u2019ll get better, Bobby. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>He nods, sniffs. I know he\u2019s heard those words before and doesn\u2019t believe them.</p><p>\u201cShe drove into a tree at night,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was raining. The day after Halloween.\u201d</p><p>So recently. No wonder he and Daniel are so wounded.</p><p>I wish I had something to say that would comfort him, but I\u2019ve lost a parent. I know that only time will help him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say good-bye,\u201d he says. \u201cI was mad \u2019cause she made me turn off X-Men.\u201d</p><p>My heart twists at that. Regret, I know, is a powerful remainder; it can bring the strongest man to his knees. One small boy is no match for it at all. No wonder he \u201csees\u201d his mom.</p><p>He looks at me through watery eyes. Tears spike his lashes. The ugly purple bruise reminds me how broken he is on the inside. \u201cI told her I hated her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows you were just mad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave me, will you?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>For the first time I glimpse the danger I\u2019ve walked in to. I\u2019m a woman running away from trouble; that\u2019s hardly what this boy needs.</p><p>The silence between us seems to thicken; in it, I hear the distant sound of water slapping against the dock and the clock ticking. I can hear Bobby\u2019s sigh, too, as quiet as a bedtime kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you now,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>He hears the word that matters: now.</p><p>\u201cBobby . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. People leave.\u201d He turns away from me and stares at the Christmas tree. For both of us, I think, some of today\u2019s shine has been tarnished now.</p><p>People leave.</p><p>At eight, he already knows this sad truth.</p><p>The Christmas tree takes up the entire corner of the lobby, between the fireplace and the windows. Dozens of ornaments adorn the scrawny limbs; there are so many the tree looks full and lush, even though they are oddly placed. It is, in every way, a tree decorated by a young boy. On the rough-hewn wooden mantel is a thick layer of white felt covered with glitter. Dozens of miniature houses and storefronts dot the \u201csnow.\u201d Tiny street lamps and horse-drawn carriages and velvet-clad carolers line the imaginary streets. Bobby\u2019s favorite Christmas album\u2014the Charlie Brown soundtrack\u2014is playing on the stereo. Music floats through the speakers and drifts down the hallway.</p><p>He looks toward the window. \u201cIs he coming?\u201d</p><p>It is the fifth time he\u2019s asked me this question in five minutes. We are both nervous. An hour ago, it seemed like a good idea to decorate the house. Now, I\u2019m not so sure. It seems . . . arrogant on my part, like the actions of a flighty relative who means to help and causes harm.</p><p>Last night, as I lay in my bed, spinning dreams of today to fight the nightmares of my real life, I imagined Daniel happy with my choice.</p><p>Now I see the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of that.</p><p>He will be angry; I\u2019m more and more certain of it. He won\u2019t want to be reminded of the past, or of his own carelessness with his son\u2019s holiday. He\u2019ll see me as an interloper, a problem-causer.</p><p>Bobby sits on the hearth, then stands. He goes to the window again. \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout thirty seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you think he\u2019ll be mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say after too long a pause to be credible. Both of us hear my uncertainty. Bobby, who has been talking to a ghost for two months, seems attuned to the tiniest nuance of sound.</p><p>\u201cHe used to love Christmas. He said it was the best day of the year.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThen Mommy and me moved out here and they got divorced.\u201d He goes to the window, stares out.</p><p>I can see his watery reflection in the window.</p><p>\u201cHe kept telling Mommy he was gonna visit me but he never did.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what to say to that. I remember the day my own father left. I was just about Bobby\u2019s age, and I spent more than a decade waiting for a reunion that never came. My mom tried to ease my hurt with reassurances, but words fall short when you\u2019re listening for a knock at the door. Bobby knows about silence, how it leaves a mark on you. Then again, I know about divorce, too. It\u2019s possible that Bobby doesn\u2019t have the whole story. It\u2019s never one person\u2019s fault. The thought shocks me. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve admitted it to myself. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d I say slowly, \u201che\u2019s here now. Maybe you should give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>Bobby doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Outside, a bright sun pushes through the clouds. The lake looks like a sheet of fiery glass.</p><p>\u201cHere he comes!\u201d Bobby runs to me, stands close.</p><p>The door opens.</p><p>Daniel walks into the lodge. He\u2019s wearing a pair of insulated coveralls, unzipped to the waist. Dirty gloves hang from his back pocket. His black hair is a messy, curly mass; his green eyes look tired. \u201cHey, there,\u201d he says to us without smiling. He\u2019s halfway to the registration desk when he stops and turns toward the tree. \u201cWhat have you done, boyo?\u201d</p><p>I feel myself tensing up. It would be so easy for him to say the wrong thing now . . .</p><p>\u201cWe done it. Joy and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy? Our house is her business now, is it?\u201d he says quietly as he walks over to the tree.</p><p>Bobby glances worriedly at me.</p><p>We shouldn\u2019t have done it\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have done it. That truth is bright and shiny now. I know nothing about them, not really. Sometimes memories hurt too much to be put on display. I am the grown-up here, the one who should have known better. I have to soften it for Bobby. \u201cDaniel,\u201d I say, taking a step forward. \u201cSurely . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used all her favorite ornaments,\u201d Daniel says, slowly touching a white angel ornament.</p><p>\u201cYou bought her that one,\u201d Bobby says. \u201cRemember? At the farmer\u2019s market by Nana and Papa\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Daniel turns to face us. He looks still and stiff, like a man chiseled from granite. I wonder how he can bear it, the distance from his son. \u201cWhere\u2019s the star?\u201d he asks at last.</p><p>Bobby glances at me. \u201cIt\u2019s on the table. We couldn\u2019t reach the top.\u201d</p><p>Daniel reaches down for the hammered tin star on the table. He is about to place it on the top of the tree; then he stops and turns to Bobby. \u201cMaybe you and I can do it together?\u201d</p><p>I hear the uncertainty in Daniel\u2019s voice, the fear that his son won\u2019t comply, and it reminds me how fragile we all are, how easily we can wound one another, especially when love is involved.</p><p>Stacey.</p><p>I close my eyes for just a second, awash in regret. When I open my eyes, Bobby is moving toward his father. The sight of them coming together makes me smile.</p><p>Daniel scoops Bobby into his arms and stands up. Daniel hands his son the star, and Bobby puts it on the tree.</p><p>They step back, admiring their work.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s grand,\u201d Daniel says. I hear a thickness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cTell Joy, Dad. It was her idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she knows I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tell her. She\u2019s right there.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, they turn to face me.</p><p>When Daniel looks at me, there\u2019s no mistaking the sheen in his green eyes. I can tell that he is a man who loves his son fiercely, maybe more than he knows how to bear. In that moment I forgive all his rudeness. Lord knows I understand how grief and love can break you. \u201cThank you, Joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could talk to her, Daddy. She\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not talked to women well in a long time. It doesn\u2019t come so easily anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say, feeling oddly connected to him. We are survivors of divorce, both of us; victims of a common war. Though I\u2019ve been divorced for months, I hardly feel single. I feel . . . halved, or broken perhaps, and Daniel is right: conversation no longer comes as easily as it once did.</p><p>That\u2019s all it takes\u2014the word, divorce\u2014and I\u2019m plunged back into reality. Suddenly I\u2019m thinking of Stacey and Thom, of who we all used to be, then I\u2019m thinking of the tree strapped to my Volvo, dying in the blackness of long-term parking.</p><p>\u201cJoy, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Bobby\u2019s voice pulls me back. I smile at him, hoping it looks real. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s okay,\u201d Daniel says, \u201cit\u2019s Christmastime. And now, as much as I\u2019d love to chat with you and Joy, it\u2019s time for your doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, nuts,\u201d Bobby whines. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, boyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Joy come? Please?\u201d he pleads, looking from his father to me. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll be with you, Bobby,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI need Joy.\u201d</p><p>I see how hurt Daniel is by that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d I say, studying Daniel\u2019s profile.</p> <p>\u201cPleeease, Joy?\u201d Bobby whines. Tears glaze his eyes.</p><p>I can\u2019t disappoint him. \u201cOkay, but I\u2019ll stay in the waiting room.\u201d</p><p>Bobby wiggles out of his dad\u2019s arms and slides to the floor. \u201cI gotta get Freddy.\u201d</p><p>As Bobby runs up the stairs, I stand there, staring at Daniel, who is looking now at the Christmas tree with an unvarnished sadness. I can see how much it has wounded him, this decorating of ours, and perhaps, his absence from it. I should say something, do something, but any word from me will be an intrusion.</p><p>And then my chance is gone. Daniel is moving past me, going up the stairs. Fifteen minutes later, he is back in the lobby, dressed in worn jeans and a forest green sweater. We leave the lodge and head for the truck. Bobby opens the door and climbs up into the cab, settling into the middle section of the bench seat. He is clutching a battered, well-loved stuffed lamb. I slide into place beside him. Daniel shuts the door and goes around to the driver\u2019s side.</p> <p>The drive to town takes no time at all, but even in the mile and a half or so between there and here, I am blown away by the beauty of this place. Giant evergreen trees grow everywhere\u2014along the roadsides, in great, dark forests that block the path to the snow-covered mountains in the distance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful out here,\u201d I say, seeing the ghostly image of my own face in the window glass; behind it, all around me, are the green and black blur of the trees we pass.</p><p>The town is exactly as I remember it: a few blocks of quaint storefronts, draped in holiday garb. Traffic is stopped here by signs and pedestrians; there are no traffic lights. On this bright blue afternoon the sidewalks are busy. Everywhere I look, pods of people are gathered to talk. It looks like a Hallmark card until we turn a corner.</p><p>Here, the street is overrun with people and vans.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Daniel says, slamming on the brakes. \u201cThis is getting old.\u201d</p><p>I am just about to ask what\u2019s going on when I see the letters painted on the side of the van beside me.</p> <p>KING TV.</p><p>It\u2019s the media.</p><p>The crash.</p><p>Of course. I turn my face away from the window instinctively. I know they aren\u2019t looking for me\u2014can\u2019t be\u2014but, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Still, I catch a glimpse of the police station and the crowd clamoring at the door.</p><p>Daniel turns onto another road and we are in the clear. He maneuvers the old truck into a parking spot and kills the engine, which slowly sputters and dies.</p><p>In the silence that follows, Bobby looks up at his dad. \u201cHow come I gotta see the doctor again?\u201d</p><p>Daniel unhooks Bobby\u2019s seat belt. \u201cYou\u2019ve had some hard knocks, boyo. Anyone would be sad after losing their mum.\u201d</p><p>Bobby sighs and crosses his arms. There\u2019s a wealth of emotion in the sound. \u201cBut not everyone talks to her ghost.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel sighs. \u201cI\u2019m tryin\u2019 to help, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would help if you believed me,\u201d Bobby says. Slithering out of the cab, he runs on ahead.</p><p>I walk across the parking lot with Daniel. We are so close our arms are nearly touching, but neither of us pulls away. For a moment, as we enter the building, I imagine we\u2019re a family, the three of us, here for Bobby\u2019s regular checkup. If it were true, I\u2019d follow them down the hallway and turn into the doctor\u2019s office. I\u2019d answer all the doctor\u2019s questions about my son\u2019s health. No doubt the three of us would go for ice-cream cones when it was over.</p><p>Instead, I go to the waiting room and sit down, alone. At some point, while I\u2019m staring out the window at a rhododendron the size of a luxury car, a nurse comes up to me. She puts a hand on my shoulder and peers down at me.</p><p>The touch startles me. I hadn\u2019t even heard her approach.</p><p>\u201cHow are we today?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I frown. Had I fallen asleep? Had some kind of nightmare? I don\u2019t think so. I was staring out the window, thinking about the big green leaves on the rhododendron; that\u2019s all. I open my mouth to say \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks,\u201d but what comes out is, \u201cI\u2019m alone.\u201d</p><p>The nurse with the plump, apple cheeks smiles sadly. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>It makes me feel better, that assurance, but when she leaves, I am alone again. Waiting.</p><p>For the first time since I ran away from Bakersfield and the crash, I wonder what it is I\u2019m waiting for.</p><p>A fter the doctor\u2019s appointment, as we\u2019re heading across the parking lot, Daniel says, \u201cI could go for some ice cream right about now. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYippee!\u201d Bobby squeals, bouncing with each step.</p><p>\u201cIce cream sounds good,\u201d I say, trying not to smile. It is the first time I\u2019ve felt welcomed by Daniel, included.</p><p>Beyond the parking lot is a lovely tree-lined street with small, well-tended houses on either side. The yards are full of color, even on this chilly December day\u2014bright green grass, yellow bushes, blue-green kale in terra cotta pots. Ornamental cherry trees line the sidewalk, and though the limbs are bare now, it\u2019s easy to imagine them awash in pink blossoms. Come spring, this street must look like a parade route with the air full of floating pink confetti.</p><p>As we reach the corner, we merge into the crowd out Christmas shopping on this sunny day. All around us, people are talking to one another. Every person we pass calls out a greeting to Daniel and Bobby.</p><p>We duck into a cute little ice-cream shop that proudly offers seven flavors. Behind the counter, a television is playing. On it, Jimmy Stewart is running down the snowy streets of Bedford Falls. The girl serving ice cream\u2014a pretty teenager with a pierced nose and jet black hair\u2014smiles at us. \u201cHey, Bobby. You want your regular?\u201d</p><p>Bobby grins. \u201cYou bet. Double scoop.\u201d</p><p>The girl looks at Daniel. Her blush and stammer reminds me how good-looking he is. Even a teenage girl notices. \u201cI\u2019ll have a pralines and cream,\u201d he says in that velvet brogue that makes the girl smile.</p><p>I am just about to order a single scoop of cookie dough ice cream on a sugar cone when a picture of a crashed plane fills the television. On-screen, a local broadcaster is standing in front of the charred wreckage, saying, \u201c . . . plane crashed in the woods northeast of here. Survivors have been airlifted to several local hospitals for treatment. Authorities are in the process of identifying survivors and contacting family members. All of the named passengers on the manifest have been accounted for.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. Everyone survived.</p><p>\u201cHowever, witnesses report that an unidentified woman bought a last-minute ticket on the flight . . .\u201d</p><p>Panic seizes hold of me. They\u2019re trying to find me. Without thinking, I mumble, \u201cexcuse me,\u201d and push past Daniel and Bobby. I can\u2019t get out of here fast enough.</p><p>Outside, I collapse onto a park bench and lean back. My heart is beating a mile a minute.</p><p>I look up just in time to see Daniel and Bobby come out of the ice-cream shop. Both are frowning.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Bobby asks me.</p><p>I can see it in his eyes, the fear and worry. He is a boy who knows how life can turn on a dime, how people can be there one day and gone the next.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not even in fine\u2019s neighborhood.</p><p>They\u2019re searching for me.</p><p>What do I do now? How much longer do I have in anonymity?</p><p>My purse. They could find my purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Daniel asks, looking down at us.</p><p>I\u2019m panicked and shaky. I want to say I can\u2019t go back, but the words would make no sense to him. When I look up, I catch Daniel\u2019s gaze and lose my place. Something about the way he\u2019s looking at me makes my heart speed up.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>His concern touches a place deep inside me. I have been alone\u2014lonely\u2014for too long. Apparently the slimmest strand of caring surprises me. I am stunned by how much I suddenly want to stay here. And yet, now I know that the clock is ticking. Once they discover my name, I will have to return home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>I get to my feet, feeling unsteady. Bobby sidles up close to me.</p><p>Together, the three of us walk down the crowded street. The decorated windows catch my attention, give me something to think about beside the news story. Occasionally, we go into stores, and when we do, we are welcomed. People look at us and smile and wish us a Merry Christmas. Dozens of knickknacks and souvenirs tempt me; an ornament made of Mount St. Helens\u2019 ash, a wind chime made of copper and shells, a T-shirt that reads: \u201cWet and wild in the rainforest,\u201d but I don\u2019t have any money with me. I make a mental note to come back to some of these shops on my way out of town. I\u2019ll want to add plenty of brochures and flyers and maps to my file cabinets back home.</p><p>Back home.</p><p>I push the thought aside and focus on enjoying the day.</p><p>We stroll pass a diner with a Christmas painting on the window, then a frame shop.</p><p>Bobby stops dead.</p><p>I glance down at him. \u201cBobby?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s staring at the building to our right. It\u2019s a gorgeous stone church with stained glass windows, a big oak door, and a nativity scene in the yard.</p><p>Daniel looks down at his son. \u201cWe could go in and light a candle for your mum.\u201d</p><p>Bobby shakes his head, juts out his chin in a telling way. He isn\u2019t going to move.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Christmas Eve,\u201d Daniel says gently, taking hold of his son\u2019s hand.</p><p>For the next half hour, we window-shop on Main Street, and then Daniel buys a bucket of fried chicken and we sit at a picnic table in the park to eat. Bobby sets out a paper plate, napkins, and a fork for me, but to be honest, I\u2019m not hungry. The news story has ruined my appetite. Apparently I\u2019m not the only one who has been upset by our little trip to town.</p><p>\u201cSo, Bobby,\u201d Daniel finally says, snapping open a Coke. \u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Bobby stares down at his plate. \u201cTalk about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou being mad at God.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs.</p><p>Daniel studies his son. In that one look, I see a world of emotion; a man who knows how to love. \u201cI\u2019d take you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Bobby looks up at his dad, then at me. \u201cI need Joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all could go to church,\u201d I say quickly, but it\u2019s too late. The damage has been done. Bobby has chosen me over his father again. I have to do something fast to change the mood. Somehow, I have to get these two to remember who they are to each other and what they have left. Sometimes that\u2019s all that matters: what remains. \u201cTell me about the time you and your dad went to the carnival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe time he le-let me keep the change?\u201d Bobby asks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cThat time.\u201d</p><p>Bobby glances at his dad. \u201cYou remember that, Daddy? When we went to the carnival?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all it takes\u2014a word from Bobby\u2014and Daniel\u2019s face changes. His smile takes my breath away. \u201cAye. At the county fair, it was. I\u2019m surprised you remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou carried me on your shoulders.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou spilled juice in my hair.\u201d</p><p>Bobby giggles at that. \u201cMommy said you looked like an alien with purple on your face.\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s gaze is as soft as velvet, yet it hits me hard. I\u2019ve never seen a man who looks at his son with such unabashed love. Once Bobby sees that, he\u2019ll know he\u2019s safe in this world. \u201cYou were too little to get on the bumper cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they were a dumb ride anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye. And so they were.\u201d</p><p>For the rest of the meal, they trade memories and stories. By the time we head back to the truck, they are smiling at each other.</p><p>On the way home, we listen to the radio. It\u2019s Randy Travis\u2019s whiskey-velvet voice singing \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Love You Forever and Ever.\u201d As the words float through the cab, I find myself looking at Daniel.</p><p>When we get back to the lodge, it\u2019s almost seven o\u2019clock. Bobby immediately runs to the television and puts a DVD in the machine. He\u2019s chosen The Santa Clause.</p><p>I start for my room.</p> <p>\u201cWhere you going, Joy?\u201d Bobby says.</p><p>\u201cYou and your dad need some time together. I\u2019ll see you to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turns to Daniel. \u201cTell her, Daddy. Invite her to watch the movie with us.\u201d</p><p>I draw in a breath, waiting. I know he will release me and keep Bobby to himself. It\u2019s not even the wrong thing to do.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Daniel says softly, smiling my way. \u201cStay with us.\u201d</p><p>It isn\u2019t until then, when I hear his velvety brogue wrap around those three small words, that I realize how much I wanted Daniel to ask me to stay.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, hoping I don\u2019t sound as desperate as I feel.</p><p>Daniel and Bobby sit on the couch together. I curl into the red chair, opposite them.</p><p>As I sit here, listening to Bobby\u2019s laughter, I consider how quiet my own house has become. If I\u2019m to be honest\u2014and why would I lie now?\u2014our house was quiet long before Thom left me. Before he started sleeping with my sister. When I look back on my marriage, the truth is that it was too quiet from the beginning.</p><p>On that last night in Bakersfield, Stacey was right. My marriage had been falling apart long before she came into the picture. It\u2019s a truth I can finally admit.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting fat \u2019cuz he\u2019s Santa!\u201d Bobby yells, bouncing in his seat.</p><p>His happiness is infectious; in no time, Daniel and I are laughing with him.</p><p>When the movie is over and Daniel says, \u201cTime for bed, boyo,\u201d and Bobby grumbles and whines that he\u2019s not tired\u2014even though he can\u2019t keep his eyes open\u2014I am sorry to see the evening end, sorry to face the prospect of going back to my room.</p><p>Daniel picks Bobby up and carries him toward the stairs.</p> <p>\u201c \u2019Night, Joy,\u201d Bobby calls out sleepily. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>I mean to get up and go to my room. I really do, but somehow I don\u2019t move. I sit there, curled like a cat in the chair, staring at the fire. The family photographs on the mantel seize my attention. I go to the mantel, pick up the pictures, and pour over them like an archeologist looking for clues from the artifacts of a life. Who was Maggie? Why did their marriage end?</p><p>Later, when I hear Daniel\u2019s footsteps on the stairs, I realize I\u2019ve been waiting for him.</p><p>He comes into the room, stands in front of the fire. In the combination of orange light and dark shadows, he looks drawn and tired. We are close enough that a movement either way and we\u2019d be touching. \u201cI promised Bobby I\u2019d come back down. I\u2019m supposed to talk to you, don\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I dare to answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a talker these days.\u201d His voice is so soft I have to lean toward him to hear. \u201cThe funny thing is, I used to be a real loudmouth, back in the pubs in Dublin, when I was a lad. I could talk till I was blue in the face and falling-down drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny how things slip away, pieces of us, even.\u201d</p><p>Daniel sighs. Nodding, he reaches for the single photograph left on the mantel, tucked now behind the Christmas village, and holds it close. It\u2019s a picture of Maggie, looking young and vibrant and beautiful.</p><p>I have no idea what to say or do. He looks so raw right now, so utterly broken, that I\u2019m afraid to speak.</p><p>He puts the photograph back and sits down on the hearth. \u201cSo, Joy.\u201d He makes a sound that\u2019s almost a laugh. \u201cMaybe you could help me, too. It seems I was a bad father and a worse husband. I didn\u2019t even think about putting up a Christmas tree. All I thought about was getting Bobby out of this place where the memories are so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving won\u2019t put his heart back together.\u201d This is a truth I know; I learned it firsthand. I sit in the chair opposite him and lean forward. In a daring that\u2019s completely foreign to me, I touch his thigh. \u201cHe needs you for that.\u201d</p><p>A frown darts across his forehead. \u201cWhat the hell . . .\u201d</p><p>I draw back, instantly contrite. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He gets to his feet. \u201cThe doc said I should talk to you, for Bobby, but . . .\u201d</p><p>I get up and go to him, unable to stop myself.</p><p>We\u2019re close now, almost face to face. I feel the softness of his breathing, smell the hint of wood smoke scent that clings to his T-shirt. \u201cDaniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a bloody fool. How in the hell am I supposed to talk to you?\u201d</p><p>I step back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have . . .\u201d</p><p>What? Touched him? Said anything? Come here in the first place? I have no idea what to say to him, what I did that was so wrong.</p><p>He turns away from me and goes to the fireplace. When he\u2019s put out the fire, he goes about the business of closing up the lobby for the night, locking the doors and drawing the curtains shut, until the lobby is jet black. He disappears down the hallway, then returns.</p><p>I wait for him to look at me, and try to figure out what I\u2019ll say when he does. How I\u2019ll explain being an idiot for a second, a woman caught and blinded by her own needs. I try to make out his face in the dark. Is he smiling? Frowning? I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>When everything is dark and quiet he goes toward the stairs. I can hear his hushed footsteps on the carpet and the cadence of his breathing. I wait for him to pause on the stairs, to say something, but in this I am disappointed. He makes his way up the stairs; later, I hear a door open and close, and then I am left alone, standing by the fire, staring at the photographs of another woman\u2019s family.</p><p>The plane is going down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s burning . . . don\u2019t touch . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>I\u2019m in the air, tumbling, screaming . . . we\u2019re going down . . .</p><p>I wake up, screaming in the dark of my room. My chest is crushed, my face smashed. I can\u2019t make my legs move.</p><p>I\u2019m paralyzed.</p><p>No. I\u2019m dreaming.</p><p>I touch my chest, press the skin until I can feel my heart beating. It\u2019s fast but steady.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine.\u201d The sound of my voice calms me, coming as it does from the darkness of my room. On shaking, weak legs, I walk to the window, push it open. The pine-scented air caresses my cheeks, grounds me instantly.</p><p>I\u2019m here. Alive.</p><p>Tiny raindrops flutter on my face and the windowsill, cooling my skin. Gradually, I feel myself calming down.</p><p>The images fade, slink back into my subconscious.</p><p>I stand there, watching the shiny combination of rain and moonlight until my hands stop shaking and I can breathe evenly again.</p><p>I hear footsteps upstairs, pacing. Someone else can\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Daniel.</p><p>I wish I could go to him, say simply, \u201cI can\u2019t sleep, either.\u201d</p><p>Instead, I turn away from the window and return to my thin, empty bed.</p><p>Mist, as translucent and flimsy as a layer of silk organza, floats across my window, blurring the forest beyond. Everything is obscured by the haze; two-hundred-foot trees appear strangely fragile. Even time seems elastic; the days and nights are passing with near impossible speed. I know that it is because I want time to slow down that it is speeding up.</p><p>This morning, as I stand at my window and look across the yard, I see shadows moving in and out among the trees. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that Bobby sees his mother in all this softness. There is an otherworldliness to the forest here. I also know how easy it is to see what you want to see.</p><p>For almost the entire year before Thom betrayed and left me, I knew he was unhappy. I was unhappy. But we did what people do\u2014we closed our eyes and thought it meant we didn\u2019t see.</p><p>I knew he was talking to Stacey about our troubles.</p><p>If I\u2019d looked instead of merely seen, I wouldn\u2019t have been so surprised by how it ended.</p><p>This is my resolution for the New Year. I will be honest with myself. I\u2019ll keep my eyes open. I\u2019ll see what\u2019s there, not just what I want to see.</p><p>After my shower, I redress in my old clothes and get my camera.</p><p>The lobby is quiet, steeped in tea-colored shadows.</p><p>I walk past the cold dark fireplace.</p><p>Daniel\u2019s truck is gone. No wonder the place is so quiet.</p><p>Peaceful.</p><p>That\u2019s what the quiet is here. Unlike in my home, where for the last year the silence has been like the indrawn breath before a scream.</p><p>The quiet and the mist draw me outside. I stand in the yard and stare at the silvery lake beyond. Through the haze, the dock looks almost translucent, a charcoal line against the gray-tipped waves.</p><p>I need a photograph of this. Maybe several.</p><p>I lift the camera to my face and work to put a blurry world into focus. It\u2019s not until I\u2019ve taken several shots that I realize how cold I am. Disappointed, I return to the warmth of the house. But I feel the need to walk in that pearlescent mist.</p><p>I could borrow a coat.</p><p>Why not? I checked myself in; I eat their food. I\u2019m certainly making myself at home. Besides, they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m sure neither would begrudge me the use of a jacket for an hour or two.</p><p>It takes some searching, but I finally find a coat closet near the back door. In it is a jumble of coats and sweaters and yellow slickers. I pull out a bulky, beautifully knit aqua-blue fisherman\u2019s sweater and slip it on. It\u2019s huge on me, but warm.</p><p>For the rest of the day, I explore this magnificent corner of paradise and take seventeen photographs\u2014of the sunlight on the lake, of a swan taking flight, of a spiderweb turned into a necklace by dew drops. By mid-afternoon, I have begun to imagine how I will frame these prints and display them.</p><p>In my living room, I think, above the sofa. Every day of my real life, I will look up and remember this adventure. Finally, at around two o\u2019clock, hunger sends me back inside.</p><p>I am just finishing a sandwich when I hear the truck drive up. Quickly I clean up my mess and run to the living room to greet them. It\u2019s silly, I know, perhaps even stupid, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve missed them today.</p><p>Bobby rushes in. \u201cJoy!\u201d</p><p>I love the way he says my name; it\u2019s as if he\u2019s been missing me all day. \u201cHey, Bobby,\u201d I say, looking behind him for Daniel, who comes in a moment later, looking so handsome that I catch my breath.</p><p>Bobby runs at me. \u201cIt\u2019s beach night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe need to leave in about fifteen minutes,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cSo you\u2019d best hurry up.\u201d</p><p>He is looking at me. A shiver runs up my spine. \u201cI\u2019m invited?\u201d</p><p>Bobby giggles. \u201c\u2019Course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a coat,\u201d Daniel says to both of us. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out there.\u201d</p> <p>I decide to move fast, just in case Daniel wants to change his mind. Feeling like a girl on her first date, I run back to my room and retrieve the big cable knit sweater. It\u2019s certain to be warm enough.</p><p>In two minutes, I\u2019m back in the lobby with Bobby.</p><p>\u201cDid you brush your teeth?\u201d Daniel asks his son.</p><p>We both answer, \u201cYes,\u201d at the same time.</p><p>At the sound of our laughter, Daniel smiles, and I am blown away by the sight of it. It takes ten years off his face and gives me a glimpse of the hell-raiser of the Dublin pubs. \u201cCome on, then.\u201d He slings a backpack over his shoulder and leaves the house. Bobby and I follow along behind him, still laughing. It is the freest I\u2019ve felt in years, and I wonder what it is about this place and these people. Here, with them, I become so easily the younger version of myself, the me I always imagined growing into. I\u2019m more like my mother\u2014free, loving, easygoing. In the dry, dusty town of Bakersfield I\u2019d been a flower slowly dying; in the moisture and mist of this green cathedral, I can feel myself blossoming.</p> <p>In the truck, we turn up the radio and sing along to Bruce Springsteen. \u201cBaby, I was born to run\u201d are suddenly the most meaningful words I\u2019ve ever sung. By the time the song is finished, we are on an old, winding, two-lane highway. For miles, we are surrounded by trees, then we come to the harvested part of this great forest. Acres of shorn land lie on either side of the road. All that\u2019s left are tiny new plantings and signs that talk of reforestation and regeneration.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d I say. \u201cAs if new trees are no different than old ones.\u201d</p><p>Bobby tilts his face to look at me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live in one of the few old growth forests left on the planet. Cutting down trees that have lived for two hundred years is a crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they go to jail?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Daniel says, hitting his turn signal and easing to a stop.</p> <p>\u201cThe loggers who cut down the old trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No,\u201d Daniel answers, frowning as he turns onto another road.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not literally a crime,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s just sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m big, I\u2019m gonna protect the old trees,\u201d Bobby says, nodding as if it\u2019s a stern, implacable decision.</p><p>\u201cWhat started this conversation?\u201d Daniel asks.</p><p>I\u2019m about to answer when we turn a corner and park.</p><p>There it is, in front of us: the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>The huge, roaring expanse of blue water and gray sky is nothing like my familiar Southern California coastline, with its powdery sand and rolling surf and volleyball nets placed every one hundred yards or so.</p> <p>Here, the beach is as wild as the forest, as primitive, too. Waves crash onto the shore, sounding like a lion\u2019s roar, even from the distance of our car.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say, sitting back.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s never done beach night before either,\u201d Bobby says. \u201cMommy and me did it every Tuesday night, after t-ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to be here,\u201d Daniel says. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s wistfulness in his voice or regret, or if he\u2019s missing his ex-wife. \u201cHow about your Joy? Is she a beach gal?\u201d</p><p>Bobby turns to me. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the beach,\u201d I answer, looking at Daniel\u2019s profile.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Bobby says, bouncing in his seat. \u201cShe loves the beach.\u201d</p><p>I feel lit up inside. I don\u2019t know how else to put it. Daniel grabs his backpack and helps Bobby out of the car. The boy immediately runs on ahead, across the sand.</p><p>\u201cNot too close to the water, boyo,\u201d Daniel calls out.</p><p>I slip into place beside him.</p><p>The beach is beautiful. A full, fiery sun hangs in the teal blue sky. Golden streamers light the waves. I have never seen so much driftwood on a beach before, and it is no ordinary collection of sticks. It is a heaping, jumbled mass of silvery logs, shorn of branches and polished to white perfection. Many of them are more than one hundred feet in length. The trees along the road have been sculpted by the wind. They look like giant bonsai.</p><p>\u201cDad, my kite!\u201d Bobby yells, running back at us.</p><p>\u201cJust a second,\u201d Daniel answers, bending down to make a fire. Within moments, the small circle of wood and newspaper is aflame. I sit on a log by the fire, watching Daniel teach his son to fly a kite. By the time Bobby gets it, the afternoon is fading. Neon orange clouds streak across a midnight blue sky.</p><p>\u201cLook, Dad! Look, Joy! I\u2019m flyin\u2019 it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are. Run faster,\u201d Daniel says, laughing as he sits down beside me. He\u2019s so close I can feel the warmth of him beside me.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d brought my camera,\u201d I say.</p><p>Bobby runs toward us, dragging the kite behind him. It flaps against the heavy sand. \u201cDidja see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s the best kite flying I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>His smile is so bright it lights his dark eyes. He flops to sit on the sand beside us. Gradually, though, his smile fades.</p><p>Silence falls, broken only by the crackling of the fire and the whooshing of the waves.</p><p>\u201cHave you got something on your mind, boyo?\u201d Daniel asks.</p><p>Bobby kicks at the sand before he finally looks up. \u201cHow will we have beach night in Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking about. Moving.\u201d</p><p>Bobby glances quickly at me. I nod encouragingly. He takes a deep breath and says: \u201cI want to stay here, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who picked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Things were different then.\u201d</p><p>At that, the reminder of how their lives have changed, they fall silent. After a long pause, Bobby says, \u201cTell Joy how you found this place.\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s sigh threads the night, falls toward me. I\u2019m pretty certain it\u2019s a story he doesn\u2019t want to tell. He leans forward, rests his elbows on his thighs. Shadows and firelight mark his face. \u201cWe were livin\u2019 in Boston, in a house not two doors down from Nana and Papa. Your mom managed the makeup counter at Macy\u2019s and I spent my days\u2014and too many nights\u2014on the thirtieth floor of the Beekman Building. I used to dream of towering trees and lakes that were full of fish. Mostly I dreamed of us being together all the time, instead of all going our separate ways. One day I read about this summer house for sale in Washington State. It was a bed and breakfast that had gone bankrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we bought it. Just like that,\u201d Bobby says, \u201cWithout seeing it even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Daniel says, and this time I\u2019m sure it\u2019s wistfulness I hear in his voice. \u201cWe had our dreams, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>In the silence that follows, I know they\u2019re thinking about how far apart they are. All I can see is how close they\u2019ve become. It will only take the merest move by either one of them to find the middle ground.</p><p>I twist around to face Daniel. We are so close now. I can see the tiny grains of sand and bits of ash that cling to his skin and hair. His green eyes look at me with an unnerving intensity. Behind me, I know Bobby is watching us. \u201cI can see why you fell in love with this place. It\u2019s magical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Mommy always said.\u201d I can hear the sadness in Bobby\u2019s voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asks suddenly. \u201cWhy do we have to move?\u201d</p><p>Daniel looks down at his hands, as if he\u2019ll find the answer in his flesh and bone. \u201cI want the best for you, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the best.\u201d</p><p>Daniel looks at his son. \u201cHow am I supposed to run this place all by myself? I don\u2019t know anything about fishin\u2019 or such.\u201d</p><p>This is a question I can answer. \u201cThere are dozens of books that can teach you. I\u2019ve read a lot of them. If you take me to the local library, I\u2019ll help you find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy tole me you were smart,\u201d Bobby says accusingly.</p><p>Daniel smiles at that. \u201cI like to think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen learn,\u201d Bobby says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d Daniel says finally. \u201cI\u2019ll think about staying if you\u2019ll think about leaving.\u201d</p><p>They look at each other, father and son, and in the fading sunlight and firelight, I am struck by how alike they are.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Bobby says solemnly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Daniel agrees. \u201cNow, how about some hot dogs and marshmallows before the sun leaves us for good?\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, as the sun slowly drops from the sky and the stars creep into the night, we roast hot dogs and make smores and walk along the darkened waterline. I am too full from my late lunch to eat anything, but a lack of appetite doesn\u2019t keep me from enjoying the fire. A battery-operated radio, perched on a log behind the fire, cranks out one pretty song after another. Often, we sing along. Daniel\u2019s voice is pure and true and sometimes renders me voiceless. We are packed up and ready to leave when a beautiful rendition of \u201cThe Way You Look Tonight\u201d starts.</p><p>By the way Daniel sings along, the harshness of his voice, I know the song means something to him.</p><p>\u201cYou used to sing this song,\u201d Bobby says.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDance with Joy.\u201d</p><p>I catch my breath, surprised.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Daniel says, careful not to look at me.</p><p>\u201cPleeease,\u201d Bobby says, looking at us. \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>I am in the darkness just beyond the dying fire\u2019s glow. Daniel is across from me. His face is all shadows and orange light. I can\u2019t see his eyes, but I know he\u2019s not smiling.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right there, Daddy,\u201d Bobby says, pointing at me. I know it\u2019s not dark enough here to cloak me. I start to say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay,\u201d but my words grind to a halt.</p><p>Daniel is moving toward me, his hand outstretched.</p><p>I take his hand and move into the circle of his arms. The warmth of his touch makes me sigh; it is a sound I try to take back. In this darkness, it is too loud, too breathy.</p><p>We move together awkwardly; I wonder if it has been as long for him as it has for me. \u201cI was never much of a dancer,\u201d I say by way of explanation. This is an understatement. Thom flat out refused to dance.</p><p>I can feel Daniel\u2019s gaze on me. \u201cI can\u2019t see your feet, but I\u2019ll wager I\u2019m steppin\u2019 on \u2019em,\u201d he says with a nervous laugh.</p><p>I feel young in his arms, and safe. We find a rhythm easily, and move together as if we\u2019ve danced for years.</p><p>Overhead and to our right, a star tumbles through the sky in a streak of white. \u201cMake a wish,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>My answer is you, but that\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t think I could stand it if he laughed at me now, so I say, \u201cI want to start over.\u201d</p><p>The music ends and Daniel releases me. It\u2019s all I can do not to reach for him. I know I will think about this moment, his touch, all night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Behind us, Bobby flicks off the radio, plunges us all into the real world again. Now there is only the roar of the surf and the crackling of the fire. \u201cI know my wish, Dad. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a long time before Daniel answers. When he does, he\u2019s looking at me. \u201cStarting over would be nice.\u201d</p><p>I stare at Daniel, unable to look away, unable to stop thinking what if?</p><p>What if I could fall in love again and start my life over? What if I could belong here?</p> <p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s get going,\u201d he says at last. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our light.\u201d</p><p>At that, I think: Have we? Have we lost our light, or have we perhaps just glimpsed it for the first time? All I know is that, when I climb into the truck with this man and his son, I\u2019m smiling.</p><p>Suddenly, I know what I have been waiting for all these years, why I\u2019ve been collecting brochures and books and snapping pictures of other places.</p><p>I\u2019ve been wanting to start over, dreaming of it.</p><p>And now, finally, I know where I want to be when I begin this new part of my life.</p> <p>All that night, as I lie in my bed, I think of Daniel. Over and over in my mind, I replay our dancing. The way he looked at me, held me, whispered, \u201cMake a wish.\u201d As the night rolls toward dawn, it takes on the shiny patina of myth.</p><p>I am just waking up when I hear a noise.</p><p>Footsteps on the stairs.</p><p>Daniel. I can tell by the sound.</p><p>I throw my covers back and get out of bed. A quick run into my bathroom, and I\u2019m dressed. Then, carefully, I peer out my door.</p><p>A light is on in the lobby.</p> <p>I walk quietly down the carpeted hallway. In the lobby, I find no one. It takes me a second to notice that the door is open.</p><p>In the purple mist of early morning, I see him standing in the front yard. This time, I don\u2019t even think about hanging back. I am starting over now; this is my new beginning.</p><p>I am almost beside him when I see Bobby out on the end of the dock. He is talking to the air. Even from this distance, I can see that he is crying and yelling.</p><p>Daniel makes a sound. In this foggy morning the sound is distorted, drawn out until it sounds like a sob.</p><p>I lay my hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I say.</p><p>He shivers at my touch, but doesn\u2019t turn to look at me. \u201cGod . . . how long will this go on?\u201d</p><p>The truth is forever and not long. \u201cHe\u2019ll talk to her until he doesn\u2019t need to anymore.\u201d</p><p>We stand there, side by side. Out on the dock, Bobby is yelling for his mommy.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cHe has a father who loves him. That would have made a difference to me. When my mom died, I mean. All I had was my sister.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m thinking about Mom\u2019s funeral and how I\u2019d fallen apart completely. Stacey was the glue that put me back together, held me together. She was my strength during Mom\u2019s long illness.</p><p>Stacey.</p><p>For the first time, I don\u2019t wince at the thought of her. The memory doesn\u2019t hurt: rather, it takes on the ache of longing. I have missed my sister; this is one of the many truths from which I\u2019ve been running.</p><p>Bobby hurtles toward us.</p><p>Daniel immediately kneels. \u201cI\u2019m here, boyo.\u201d</p><p>Bobby skids to a stop. His cheeks are wet with tears, his eyes are bloodshot. \u201cShe didn\u2019t come. I yelled and yelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bobby,\u201d Daniel says, wiping his son\u2019s tears. I can see him struggling for the right words of comfort. We both know that Bobby needs to let go of his imaginary mother, but the letting go will hurt.</p><p>Daniel pulls Bobby into his arms and holds him tightly, whispering words in a lilting, song-like language I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>Bobby looks at him. \u201cBut I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgetting her,\u201d Bobby says in a quiet, miserable way.</p><p>Daniel closes his eyes for a moment, and in this reaction I see how hurt he is by his son\u2019s revelation. When he opens his eyes, I can see the sheen of tears. \u201cI should have done this a long time ago,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Daniel scoops Bobby into his arms and carries him into the house. \u201cWait here,\u201d he says, depositing his son on the sofa. He runs up the stairs.</p><p>Bobby looks so small, sitting there on the sofa, with his glistening cheeks and missing front tooth. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>I sit down on the hearth across from him. I don\u2019t sit beside him because I want him to hear me. To listen. \u201cTell me about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy?\u201d His voice breaks, but I can see how a smile wants to start. I wonder how long he has waited for someone to ask.</p><p>\u201cShe liked pink. And she talked really fast.\u201d</p><p>I smile at that. It reminds me of my own mom, who snorted when she laughed. Once, when I was little, she laughed so hard milk came out of her nose. It is a memory I thought I\u2019d lost until just now. \u201cMy mom used to kiss my forehead to see if I had a fever. I loved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mommy used to wear butterflies in her hair when she got dressed up.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward. \u201cYou won\u2019t forget her, Bobby. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll leave me, too, won\u2019t you? Just like her.\u201d</p><p>The question\u2014and the sad resignation in his voice\u2014is hard to hear. I know I shouldn\u2019t promise him anything\u2014my life is in upheaval right now and the things I want may well exceed my grasp, but I can\u2019t just sit here and say nothing. \u201cI have another life in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll say good-bye, right? You won\u2019t just disappear.\u201d</p><p>My life might be mixed up, but this vow is easy to make. I\u2019d never leave without saying good-bye. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Daniel comes down the stairs, carrying a big brown photo album and a shoebox.</p><p>I stand, feeling shaky on my feet. This is a private moment. I don\u2019t belong here. \u201cI should go. I\u2019ve . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Bobby says. \u201cTell her, Daddy. Tell Joy to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Joy,\u201d he says, pulling Bobby close against him. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>It is the way he says please that traps me; that, and the knowledge that Bobby is fragile now. I cross around the makeshift coffee table and sit down next to Daniel.</p><p>\u201cMake room for her, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Daniels scoots toward his son.</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of room,\u201d I say.</p><p>Bobby looks up at his dad. \u201cJoy says I\u2019ll always remember things about Mommy. Like the butterfly clips she wore. And the way she gave me fish kisses at naptime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFish kisses,\u201d Daniel says, his voice gruff. I know he\u2019s remembering her now, too.</p><p>\u201cShe always got the words wrong in the Winnie-the-Pooh song.\u201d Bobby\u2019s voice is stronger now, less uncertain.</p><p>\u201cHer nighttime prayers went on forever,\u201d Daniel says, smiling now. \u201cShe blessed everyone she\u2019d ever met.\u201d He looks down at Bobby. \u201cAnd she loved you, boyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Daniel opens the photo album on his lap. There, in black and white is a series of pictures: a boy playing kick-the-can on dirty streets, and riding his rusty bike, and standing by a stone stacked fence, with a kite. The boy has jet black hair that needs a cut. Daniel.</p><p>There\u2019s another shot of a dirty street and a pub called the Pig-and-Whistle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Nana and Papa,\u201d Bobby says, pointing to the couple standing at the pub\u2019s wooden door. \u201cThey live in Boston now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill spend their time hanging around the pubs,\u201d Daniel says, laughing as he turns the page.</p><p>Maggie.</p><p>Her face looks up at us, wreathed in bridal lace. She looks young and bright and gloriously happy. Her smile could light up Staples Center.</p><p>I can\u2019t help thinking of my own wedding album, tucked deep in an upstairs bookcase, gathering the dust of lost years. I wonder if I\u2019d even recognize my younger self, or would I look through the images of my own life like an archeologist, studying artifacts of an extinct race?</p><p>And what of Stacey? Can I really stay away from her wedding, her big moment? We have always been the witnesses of each other\u2019s lives. Isn\u2019t that what family is? Even broken and betrayed and bleeding, we are connected.</p><p>I push the thoughts aside and focus on the photographs in Daniel\u2019s album.</p><p>The next few pages contain dozens of wedding shots. Daniel goes through them without comment; I hear his relieved sigh when he comes to the end of them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s me,\u201d Bobby says, pointing at the first photo of a baby so tiny his face looks like a pink quarter.</p><p>\u201cAye. That\u2019s the day we brought you home from the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mommy\u2019s crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she loved you so much.\u201d</p><p>From there on, as Daniel turns the pages, he talks, telling the story of their family in that musical brogue of his, and with every passing moment, every syllable that sounds like a song lyric, I can see them moving closer together, this boy with a broken heart and the man who loves him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your first friend, your cousin Sean . . . your first birthday party . . . the day you said \u2018Mama.\u2019\u201d</p><p>In time, I begin to notice that there are fewer pictures of him and none of him and Maggie. The whole album is Bobby.</p><p>I know how a thing like this happens. Not all at once, but day by day. You stop wanting to record every minute of an unhappy life. In Bakersfield, I have a drawer of similar albums, where the oldest versions are of Thom and me, and the newest ones are mostly scenery.</p><p>By the time Daniel reaches the last page, Bobby is asleep, tucked in close to his father. Daniel says softly, \u201cJoy?\u201d</p><p>At my name, whispered as it is in the quiet between us, he sighs and smiles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I say, waiting for more.</p><p>When he says nothing, I decide to be bold. I lean toward him, say, \u201cMaybe you and I . . .\u201d I don\u2019t know how to finish, how to ask for what I want, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve gone too far, revealed too much. Daniel shakes his head and pulls away from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m losing my mind,\u201d he says without looking at me. Then, he gets up from the sofa and carries Bobby to the stairs.</p><p>What was I thinking to say \u201cyou and I\u201d with the photographs of his lost wife between us?</p><p>As always, I am a master at timing.</p><p>Once again, I am alone.</p><p>I try to fall back asleep, but after the predawn show, it\u2019s impossible. Somewhere around seven o\u2019clock, I give up and take a shower. I am in the kitchen, looking for coffee when I hear footsteps on the stairs, then in the hallway. I turn just in time to see Daniel coming in to the room. He looks haggard, worn down. The lines around his eyes are so deep and dark they appear to be drawn in charcoal.</p><p>He sees me and the coffeemaker, in that order, and he smiles. \u201cAh, coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we have an addiction in common. That, and wanting to start over.\u201d The minute the words are out of my mouth, I want to call them back. Even worse than the words is my voice; it\u2019s all breathy, Marilyn-Monroe-Mr.-Presidenty.</p><p>He stares at me a moment longer, then leaves the room.</p><p>I stand there, feeling like a fool. Everything I say to Daniel is wrong.</p><p>It\u2019s hardly surprising. I haven\u2019t exactly had a lot of experience. There was Jed Breen in high school and Jerry Wist the summer after graduation, but that\u2019s all. I met Thom at a party in my sophomore year at Davis, and Lord knows I haven\u2019t dated since our divorce. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sipping my coffee, I head out of the kitchen.</p><p>Bobby runs up to me, as if he\u2019s been waiting. \u201cTeach me more reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He leads me to the sofa. For hours, we sit there, sounding out sentences. I praise and encourage him, but all the while I\u2019m also listening for footsteps on the deck. I keep remembering my dance with Daniel. Make a wish. Starting over would be . . .</p> <p>\u201cJoy,\u201d Bobby says. \u201cJOY.\u201d</p><p>I blink, come into the now. \u201cSorry, Bobby.\u201d I\u2019m like a teenager, mooning over a boy. The thought makes me smile. Who would have thought?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this word?\u201d</p><p>I turn my attention back to the book that\u2019s open in my lap. It\u2019s the Disney version of Pinocchio, and Bobby has an endless appetite for the story of the wooden boy who wants to be real. This is the second read of the day. \u201cR . . . E . . . A . . . L. Real.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at me. \u201cI wish the Blue Fairy would make Freddy real.\u201d</p> <p>If the Blue Fairy existed, Freddy would be knee-deep in clover. Heaven knows the stuffed lamb with the straggly fur and loose button eye has been loved.</p><p>Behind us, the door bangs open.</p><p>Bobby slams the book shut. He wants to surprise Daniel with his reading.</p><p>Daniel walks in to the lobby, his flannel shirt and down vest peppered with sawdust and rain. His face is gray with wet dirt. When he smiles, his teeth are brilliant white. \u201cHey, there.\u201d He takes off his jacket, lays it on the chair back, then turns on the television. \u201cIt\u2019s no use workin\u2019 any more. A storm is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA storm?\u201d Bobby sounds scared.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, boyo. I\u2019m here to protect you.\u201d</p> <p>Bobby tucks in closer to me, whining. \u201cI hate storms.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, I notice how dark it is in the lobby. Outside, charcoal clouds obliterate the sky overhead. Shadows crawl across the lake and grass.</p><p>\u201cTurn on the news, will you, Bobby?\u201d Daniel says, bending over to unbutton his work boots. \u201cI\u2019ll be back down in a sec.\u201d With that, he goes upstairs.</p><p>Bobby reaches for the remote and hits the power button. There is a thump of sound, then a picture.</p><p>\u201cI hate the news,\u201d he mutters, eying the darkening day outside.</p><p>On screen, a pretty blond woman is talking about a three-alarm fire in downtown Seattle. After that, she relays the rest of the local news: a few burglaries, a car stolen in Hoquiam, and a goat mascot stolen from a nearby high school.</p><p>They show a series of local homes, decked out for the holidays, even giving out the addresses so people can drive by to see the displays.</p><p>We have different drive-bys in Southern California.</p> <p>Outside, thunder rolls. Lightning flares.</p><p>Bobby screams. I reach for him, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>Then I hear: plane crash. I want to say, \u201cTurn off the set! Change the channel!\u201d But I can\u2019t speak. Instead, I get to my feet, take a step forward.</p><p>\u201c. . . nearly eighty miles north of here. As reported earlier, the eleven named passengers on the charter flight were rescued by firefighters on Friday evening and taken to local hospitals.\u201d</p><p>The picture from my driver\u2019s license fills the screen.</p><p>\u201cJoy Faith Candellaro,\u201d the anchorwoman says pleasantly, as if she\u2019s relaying a tuna casserole recipe and not news of a missing person, \u201cfrom Bakersfield, California. When the director of the charter flight, Riegert Milosovich, regained consciousness following surgery, he told authorities that this woman had purchased a ticket at the last moment and had been onboard the plane when . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the thunder done?\u201d Bobby asks nervously.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, Bobby.\u201d White noise roars in my head, blocking out the broadcast. I\u2019m trying to hear the words when the picture onscreen changes and I gasp.</p><p>It\u2019s Stacey; she is standing in front of her three-car garage, crying. In a pale yellow sweatshirt and matching pants (which I gave her for her birthday last year), she looks washed out and colorless. \u201cWe\u2019re praying she comes back to us.\u201d She glances at Thom, who looks surprisingly shaken. Is he crying? \u201cIt\u2019s the season of miracles, right?\u201d Stacey says to the reporter.</p><p>\u201cThat lady looks like you,\u201d Bobby says, pointing at my sister.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I answer dully. I\u2019ve heard it all my life. Irish twins. Two sisters, only a year apart in age, who were always there for each other.</p><p>\u201cShe sure is sad.\u201d</p><p>Who would have thought she\u2019d miss me so much?</p><p>But that is a lie. I see the truth I\u2019ve hidden from myself all these days and nights. I knew Stacey would miss me, weep for me. I wanted that, wanted her to regret what she\u2019d done to me.</p><p>I wanted to break her heart, like she\u2019d broken mine.</p><p>But it is one thing to want Stacey to feel bad for me, it\u2019s something else to let her believe I\u2019m dead.</p><p>My vacation is over.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Joy?\u201d</p><p>Thunder rolls outside, shaking the lodge. The windows rattle at the storm.</p><p>Bobby screams: \u201cDaddy!\u201d and leaps off the couch.</p><p>Daniel is down the stairs in an instant, scooping Bobby into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s just a storm, boyo,\u201d he says soothingly, \u201cnothing to be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Bobby. There\u2019s nothing to be scared of,\u201d I say dully, but even as I say the words, I know they are a lie. There is something to be scared of now for Bobby and for me. I have to go home.</p><p>Lightning flashes into the room, turning everything blue-white for an instant. I look at Daniel, who is holding his son tightly, and Bobby, whose small, pale face is ruined by tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like when Mommy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cShhh.\u201d He turns, carrying Bobby upstairs. I can hear their voices. Soft. Uncertain.</p><p>Daniel is singing to Bobby; the hushed notes of the song underscore the sounds of crying. It\u2019s a song I don\u2019t recognize, and I don\u2019t understand the words, but it moves me nonetheless, makes me think about the times in my life\u2014long ago now\u2014when I felt safe and loved.</p><p>I feel my way to the registration desk and find the phone. It\u2019s time to call Stacey. Lightning is a strobe light that turns off and on, blasting me in and out of darkness.</p><p>I pick up the phone and call the operator. There are two rings, then, the electricity snaps off, the phone goes dead, and everything goes dark.</p><p>In my dreams, the world is full of strange noises and unfamiliar smells.</p><p>Light. It is buzzing all around me like bees around the comb. There is a thunk-whoosh sound that repeats itself, over and over.</p><p>It\u2019s the surf at the beach they called Kalaloch; I hear the waves whispering to me, calling me to come forward, feel their coolness. I feel as if I\u2019m being held under the water. I can\u2019t breathe. Panicked, I try to fight my way to the surface, but it\u2019s useless.</p><p>\u201cJoy, wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up. Pleease.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my sister\u2019s voice.</p><p>I\u2019m out of the ocean now. For a blissful moment I\u2019m ten years old again, and we\u2019re at a KOA campground in Needles, California. Stacey wants to break the rules, go swimming at night in the pool by the registration building. She is tugging on my sleeve.</p><p>Then I\u2019m back on Madrona Lane, close enough to touch my pregnant sister and yet unable to reach out. The wedding invitation is on the asphalt between us. Thomas James Candellaro and Stacey Elizabeth McAvoy request your presence . . .</p><p>\u201cWake up, Joy.\u201d</p><p>Someone touches my arm, pushes me gently.</p><p>I open my eyes, disoriented at first by the shadowy darkness around me. I expected to be at home, staring up at my own ceiling, listening to the sound of old Mr. Lundgren\u2019s lawn mower.</p><p>Bobby is beside my bed, looking down at me.</p><p>I push to my elbows, shove the tangled red hair from my eyes. \u201cBobby,\u201d I say, trying to get past my dream. Everything is still watery, confusing. I can\u2019t remember a sleep so deep.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t wake up,\u201d he says, his eyes full of worry.</p><p>\u201cI was up late last night,\u201d I say, as if he can understand the kind of sleepless night that comes with regret.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed you went away.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and sigh. How could I have blithely befriended him and not seen how all this would end?</p><p>Fantasies.</p><p>I\u2019ve wrapped myself in them, let pretty images from an impossible future be my safety net, my safe place to land. I\u2019ve thought of my time here as an adventure. In truth, it was an escape. All along, the clock on my discovery has been ticking. I simply didn\u2019t hear it before.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d</p><p>I want to lie to him; more than that, I want my lie to be the truth.</p><p>But I don\u2019t belong in this wild place, no matter how much I want to. This is the truth I stumbled upon in the dark last night as I tried to sleep. Daniel has never even hinted that he feels something for me. All my \u201cwhat ifs\u201d were really \u201cif onlys.\u201d</p><p>I have been like Bobby, a child chasing a ghost on a dock at dawn.</p><p>I touch Bobby\u2019s plump cheek. In no time at all, his skin will roughen and grow hair. He will be a young man, and I will be a memory of his childhood.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay,\u201d he says, his voice unsteady.</p><p>Later, I will let myself feel the ache of those words. Now, I do not dare. \u201cYou have a daddy who loves you. And I have . . . a sister who tried to ask for my forgiveness. I need to go back to her. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned here\u2014from you and your daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you leave, I\u2019ll miss you. Don\u2019t you care about that?\u201d</p><p>I can hardly answer; the tears are so full in my throat. \u201cI do care about that, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me through damp, accusing eyes. \u201cWill you stay for Christmas morning? We can open presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleease?\u201d</p><p>How can I say no? Especially when I want it so badly? I\u2019ll call Stacey and let her know I\u2019m okay. Then I\u2019ll end my adventure with Christmas morning in this place I\u2019ve come to love. And then I sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll stay for Christmas morning, but then I\u2019ll need to leave. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise you\u2019ll stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He barely smiles.</p><p>We both know it\u2019s not good enough. It\u2019s not what either of us wants.</p><p>But it\u2019s all there is.</p><p>By the time I\u2019ve taken my shower and had breakfast, it\u2019s nearly ten.</p><p>I leave my room\u2014or mean to\u2014but as I step across the threshold, I stumble and fall into the doorway. Righting myself, I look back at this small, shabby space. Room 1A in a run-down fishing lodge with a ridiculous name.</p><p>And I know how much I will miss it. Whenever I close my eyes, I see this room as it could be, as I\u2019ve imagined it: the log walls scrubbed to perfection and oiled to a glossy shine; the green carpet gone, in its stead the wide-plank pine boards that lie beneath; a pretty white wrought-iron bed, covered with handmade quilts and lavender-blue throw pillows\u2014exactly the hue of the night sky just before the sun sets. Fresh flowers on the antique dresser. A bathroom redone in white tile and brass, with a clawfoot tub.</p><p>I close the door on the image and walk away. My footsteps are soundless on the olive green carpeting. In the kitchen, I find a tray filled with fruit and cheese slices on the counter, and an otherwise empty room. I don\u2019t need to go upstairs (not that I would) to know that Daniel and Bobby are gone. I\u2019ve come to know the moods of this place, the feel of it when people are here, and when they\u2019re gone. There are no creaking floorboards overhead, no fluttering fall of dust from the ceiling as Bobby rides his skateboard in the halls upstairs. The Christmas tree lights are off and the registration desk is dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I go to the window, just to be sure. Outside, the storm has paused; clouds squat above the trees; the wind blows leaves across the deck and pushes at the trees as if they are bendable toys. But it isn\u2019t raining.</p><p>The truck is gone.</p><p>I look around for a note, knowing I won\u2019t find one. I\u2019m a guest. Why would they let me know where they\u2019ve gone or when they\u2019ll be back? Still, I can\u2019t help feeling disappointed.</p><p>I stand there a long time. Finally, I go to the phone and pick it up. The receiver feels cold against my ear.</p> <p>There is still no dial tone.</p><p>I feel a rush of relief, but it doesn\u2019t last long. As much as I\u2019d like to, I can\u2019t stay here, alone, hiding out from the world, my world. My Christmas gift to Stacey will be a phone call. Just that, a call, but it will be a start. Who knows where we\u2019ll go from there?</p><p>So I go to my room and get my borrowed blue sweater from the closet, then I find an umbrella behind the registration desk\u2014just in case\u2014and I\u2019m off.</p><p>Wind blows down the road and whistles through the trees. The forest is darker than usual, as is the sky.</p><p>I follow the winding black ribbon of asphalt that parallels the lake. Leaves and debris skid down the pavement, blow past me. Brown water gurgles in the ditches.</p> <p>I angle against the wind, trudging forward, sloshing through dips and puddles from last night\u2019s storm. Ahead of me, the road shimmers with water.</p><p>At first, I walk at a pretty good pace. I\u2019m in decent shape, after all, I do aerobics on a quasi-regular basis, and I\u2019ve lost weight in the past week. I feel thinner, anyway. I haven\u2019t actually stepped on a scale.</p><p>Every bend in the road promises to be \u201cThe One.\u201d I keep expecting to see the town spread out before me, a tiny tiara of holiday lights tucked in to all this stormy darkness.</p><p>But every corner leads to another straightaway. This old highway goes on and on.</p><p>I am losing steam, which seems odd because my breath is a series of white clouds, shooting out in front of me. The steps get harder. It\u2019s cold. Wind scratches my face, tugs at my hair.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I walked this far after the crash. Then, it had felt like nothing, this trek through the ancient woods. In truth, it\u2019s miles.</p> <p>How could I have done it?</p><p>On and on I go, until I truly begin to consider turning back.</p><p>I am all alone out here. In the time I\u2019ve been walking, no cars have passed me, no headlights have cut down the pavement to show me the way back, even for a fifty-five mile-per-hour moment. Black clouds hang ominously low in the sky, make this afternoon almost dark.</p><p>Up ahead, there is another bend in the road.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I say aloud. I will turn around if town isn\u2019t around the corner.</p><p>Then, in the distance, I hear cars.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>The walking is easier again, with the end in sight. I pick up my pace a little, until I\u2019m breathless when I finally come to town.</p> <p>I leave the two-lane highway and turn onto a pretty little tree-lined street called Azalea. I have gone fifty feet or so when it hits me.</p><p>The lights are out here, too.</p><p>The town is dark; buildings seem smaller without light, bunched together, as if they\u2019re huddling to keep warm.</p><p>In the gray patch of the park, I see an old-fashioned phone booth on the corner. It\u2019s something I haven\u2019t seen in a while. In my part of California, the world has gone cellular, moved on from these glass-walled booths.</p><p>I duck inside, close the door behind me. No light comes on at the motion. I know before I pick up the phone what I will find.</p><p>It\u2019s dead. There is no phonebook hanging from a rusty chain.</p><p>When I step outside the booth, thunder grumbles across the slate-colored sky. Lightning flashes strobe-like, electrifying the sleepy town for a second. Then it starts to rain.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>I grab my umbrella and pop it open. Rain is thunderous on the plastic dome over my head. I run across the park.</p><p>In town, the eaves protect me. I walk close to the buildings, seeing even in the shadows how well tended everything is. Holiday decorations fill every window. At a diner called the \u201cDew Drop In,\u201d I see a \u201cCLOSED: No Juice\u201d sign that makes me smile in spite of how cold and miserable I am.</p><p>At the end of the street, I come to a four-way stop and turn right because the eaves protect me.</p><p>Two blocks later I see the impossible: a gas station with its lights on. They must have a generator.</p><p>I rush across the wet, slick street and go to the door. Inside, it\u2019s a mini-mart with rows and rows of brightly colored merchandise. The lights are so bright I have to squint.</p><p>Behind the counter, a man is reading something from a manila folder and making notes on a clipboard of some kind. A slim gray cell phone sits on the counter by his right hand.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I say, tossing my dripping umbrella to the linoleum floor. \u201cThis storm is crazy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He looks up at me, obviously surprised that anyone is out in this weather. He is thin-faced, with elegantly cut white hair and blue eyes that seem surprisingly sharp for a man of his age. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to know how long it\u2019ll last.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the same thing the weathermen always say. I smile at him. \u201cI need to use your phone.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me oddly and taps at the hearing aid in his left ear. \u201cBroken bones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bones. Phone. I need to make a call. Collect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d he says, leaning closer. \u201cIt\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d I say, trying to keep the impatience out of my voice. I\u2019m tired, soaking wet, and freezing cold. It would be easy to snap, so I take a deep breath and try to smile. \u201cI know the electricity is out.\u201d I tap his cell phone. \u201cMay I use it? Please? I need to talk to my sister.\u201d</p><p>At that, he smiles, showing me a hint of flawless white dentures, and tugs at his ear, which\u2014surprisingly\u2014sports an earring that looks like a tiny diamond. \u201cTalking is good.\u201d</p><p>The poor man is deaf as a post. If I weren\u2019t freezing and desperate, I\u2019d be polite. As it is, I say, \u201cYes, it is. Look. I\u2019m using your phone. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mind is a delicate thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\u201d I reach for his phone. Every second, as I flip it open and punch in the numbers, I expect him to stop me, but he doesn\u2019t. He simply goes back to his reading.</p><p>The phone rings.</p><p>And rings.</p><p>At each bleating ring, I tense up a little more. Finally, the machine clicks on. It\u2019s Stacey\u2019s voice. Happy holidays. Stacey and Thom aren\u2019t in right now, but if you\u2019ll leave a message, we\u2019ll call you back. Thanks!</p><p>I\u2019m momentarily nonplussed by the casual linking of their names. Staceyandthom. Thomandstacey. Now they\u2019re one word, just like we used to be.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . Hi, Stace. It\u2019s Joy. I\u2019m fine. You don\u2019t need to worry. I\u2019ll call you on Christmas Day.\u201d It seems like I should have more to say, but nothing comes to me. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and hand the phone back to the attendant. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He peers at me. \u201cYou can keep talking to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I grab my umbrella and leave the warm light of the gas station.</p><p>It\u2019s not until I\u2019m back in the park, trudging through the now blinding rain that I think: I should have asked him for a ride home. This is Small Town, U.S.A. People do favors for each other here. I turn back, walk down the street. Thunder roars again; the rain hammers me.</p><p>In the violence of the storm, I\u2019m confused, though, disoriented; I can\u2019t find the gas station again.</p><p>I have always had a crappy sense of direction.</p><p>With a sigh, I head for the park, and then find my way onto the old highway. My first thought is: this is the way home.</p><p>Then I remember.</p><p>My home sits on a pretty little street in a not-so-pretty section of Bakersfield, the same city where my pregnant sister and ex-husband now live together.</p><p>Staceyandthom.</p><p>What will I say to them?</p><p>J ust when I think the weather can\u2019t get any worse, it starts to snow.</p><p>In an instant, this stormy landscape changes into a place of magical, impossible light. The clouds lift, a bright moon peers out from above and casts the road in silvery light. The driving rain transforms itself into a shower of tiny cotton balls, drifting lazily downward.</p><p>Everything stills; the world holds its breath. The gurgling water in the ditch turns into a child\u2019s laugh. I can smell the pine trees again, and the rich scent of wet earth.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sudden beauty has a wicked bite.</p><p>It\u2019s cold.</p><p>Inside my suddenly inadequate sweater, I shiver and try to keep warm. My breath clouds everything, makes me feel as if I\u2019m walking through a deep fog.</p><p>Once I start shivering, I can\u2019t stop. I must look like an escaped mental patient, running from the electrical shock room, dancing along the crumbling edge of the road. I am so tired; all I want to do is stop, but I know that if I do, I\u2019ll fall, and maybe I won\u2019t get up. My eyelids are heavy, my fingers and toes sting with cold. My cheeks are so icy they feel hot; every snowflake burns my skin. Only a woman raised in California would have gone for a walk on a day like this.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t th-think like that,\u201d I say aloud, trying to sound stern and failing miserably. My teeth are chattering like an Evinrude. I need to focus on good thoughts.</p><p>Like the lodge, dressed in its holiday finery, with Bobby and Daniel on the deck, waiting for me.</p><p>Are they home? I wonder. Have they noticed that I am gone? Are they worried?</p><p>How long has it been since someone waited at home for me, worried about me?</p><p>Stacey.</p><p>Even with all that has happened; all she has done, the truth is there, buried beneath the resentment: I miss her.</p><p>She is the one I want to tell about my time in the rainforest, and the man and boy about whom I\u2019ve come to care.</p><p>I guess a plane crash and being lost in a snowstorm will show you things.</p><p>I am caught so deeply in my own thoughts that it takes me a moment to hear the noise behind me.</p><p>It is an engine. Seconds later, I see the twin beams of headlights come up behind me. In their glow, I see the snow falling all around me.</p><p>I stop, turn.</p><p>It is Daniel\u2019s red pickup, chugging down the road. They are like something out of a dream, a blur of red in a snowy white world. I\u2019m not entirely sure it\u2019s real. Perhaps I\u2019ve imagined my saviors.</p><p>The truck pulls up beside me and stops. The blue passenger door creaks, then bangs open.</p><p>Bobby is scooted all the way to the edge of the bench seat. His small face is scrunched with worry and too colorful somehow in this hazy world and half-light. \u201cJoy?\u201d</p><p>I try to answer, to smile even, as if this is nothing, but all I hear is the sound of my own teeth chattering. Suddenly I\u2019m crying like a baby. That\u2019s when I realize how scared I was that I would be simply lost out here, all alone again. No wonder I thought of Stacey.</p><p>\u201cHelp her, Dad!\u201d Bobby cries out. \u201cShe\u2019s freezing!\u201d</p><p>Daniel whips open his door and jumps out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . fine,\u201d I say, sounding like a jackhammer on concrete. I grab the top of the truck door\u2014the metal is so cold it burns me\u2014and climb into the seat. I don\u2019t want him to know how cold I am, how foolish I was. I could have died out here. \u201cTh-thanks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing by the side of the truck, Daniel looks worriedly through the cab at me. He\u2019s probably never seen a woman with blue cheeks before. There\u2019s a strange look in his eyes, one I can\u2019t read. It\u2019s more than just worry, though. I think he\u2019s angry with me for being so stupid, for scaring his son. He climbs back into the driver\u2019s seat and slams the door shut. \u201cA person could die in this weather,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. I was just . . . trying to find a phone to call my sister. I\u2019m sorry to have worried you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy has a cell phone,\u201d Bobby says accusingly. I can tell how upset he is. He thought I\u2019d simply left without a word. Disappeared like his mother.</p><p>I have no answer to that. My actions were stupid. Plain stupid.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been driving around for hours looking for you,\u201d Bobby says. I can hear the panic in his voice. \u201cI told him you were in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised you Christmas morning,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cRemember? I just needed to make a phone call. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, still looking unconvinced.</p><p>I dare to glance at Daniel. \u201cBobby invited me to spend Christmas morning with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Daddy that you were staying for Christmas and then leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel still doesn\u2019t look at me. Driving in snow takes all his concentration. Or, perhaps, he wants Christmas morning with only his son.</p><p>Before, in my life, I would have been silent now, waited for him to invite me, to want me, but somewhere along the way of this adventure, I\u2019ve grown bold. Life can be short. Planes can simply fall out of the sky; sisters can lose the chance they need. \u201cWhat do you think of that, Daniel?\u201d</p><p>In the silence that follows my question, the windshield wipers seemed almost obscenely loud. He can hurt me now, ruin me with a look or a smile, but I take this risk. It\u2019s what I want: Christmas with Bobby and Daniel. Then I\u2019ll go back to Bakersfield. Every heartbeat that he doesn\u2019t answer wounds me. It\u2019s crazy, I know, and na\u00efve, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>Bobby must sense the tension and feel for me. \u201cDaddy?\u201d he says when the quiet has gone on for almost a mile. \u201cYou want Joy to stay for Christmas, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I draw in a sharp breath, but Daniel doesn\u2019t turn to me. Quietly, he says, \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>Of course.</p> <p>As if my question were unnecessary. The tension seeps out of me, leaving me strangely limp. I lean back into the seat.</p><p>Daniel turns on the radio. \u201cJingle Bell Rock\u201d blares from the speakers, making me smile. My mom loved this song.</p><p>\u201cWhat does your family do for Christmas morning?\u201d Bobby asks me.</p><p>\u201cWe go to church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what me and Mommy used to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI light a candle for my mom,\u201d I add. \u201cSo she knows how much I still love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you light one for my mommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll come to church with me, I will.\u201d</p> <p>A long moment passes, punctuated by the thunk of the wipers. Then, quietly, he says, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I look down at him, feeling tears sting my eyes. The courage of this boy slays me. \u201cWe can pray for her together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay what?\u201d Daniel says, frowning as if he\u2019s missed something. He turns down the radio.</p><p>\u201cJoy\u2019s gonna help me light a candle for Mommy on Christmas morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn church?\u201d</p><p>Bobby nods.</p><p>I can she how moved Daniel is by those few words. He doesn\u2019t look at his son or me; I suspect if he did that his eyes would be moist. \u201cI can see how Joy got her name.\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s voice is so soft and warm. It wraps around me like a blanket. Smiling, I rest my head against the cool window and close my eyes. All at once I\u2019m exhausted.</p><p>Daniel pulls into the lodge parking lot and shuts off the ignition. He immediately turns to Bobby. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Bobby launches himself at his dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, boyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want Joy to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I sit up slowly. An ache blossoms in my chest at the sight of them. If ever I am inclined in the future to disbelieve in love, I will remember this moment.</p><p>Daniel tightens his hold on his son. \u201cYou\u2019re my whole world, Bobby. You know that, don\u2019t you? We\u2019re a team now. You and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Joy comes back later? Can she be part of us?\u201d</p><p>Daniel smiles. He looks younger suddenly, unburdened.</p><p>I catch my breath. It would be so easy to lose myself in Daniel\u2019s eyes, and find myself in his world.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, boyo,\u201d Daniel says, looking at me over Bobby\u2019s head. \u201cA thing like that comes down to . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFate.\u201d</p><p>We whisper the word at the same time, Daniel and I. It seems as soft as a love song in the cab, and as sturdy as one of these old trees.</p><p>But Bobby wants something more concrete. \u201cIf she comes back, can she stay with us?\u201d</p><p>Daniel is frowning suddenly. I wonder if, like me, he\u2019s come undone by the single word that somehow joins us, gives us a glimpse of maybe. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d Bobby says.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Daniel answers, still gazing at me. I feel something waken in me, a longing that makes my heart speed up. \u201cAll she has to do is say, \u2018Open the damn door, Daniel. It\u2019s cold out here,\u2019 and I\u2019ll let her in.\u201d</p><p>Bobby laughs. It is the purest, clearest sound I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t swear, Dad.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Daniel and I laugh together.</p><p>The best pieces of chocolate in the box are always the last ones. So it is with this second-to-last night I have at the Comfort Fishing Lodge. By the time we get home, the electricity is back on. In no time, the Christmas tree and mantel are pockets of glowing colored lights and there\u2019s a roaring fire in the fireplace.</p><p>Bobby and Daniel go to the kitchen for dinner; I go to my room and take a shower. I\u2019m cold to the bone; food is the last thing on my mind.</p><p>Rather, I think about tomorrow.</p><p>Christmas Eve.</p><p>It will be my last night here.</p><p>Already I know that my vacation is over. When Stacey gets home\u2014probably from Thom\u2019s office party\u2014she\u2019ll listen to my message and immediately start looking for me. I\u2019ll be \u201cbig news.\u201d The authorities will clamor for answers to questions I don\u2019t want voiced, let alone answered. I don\u2019t believe any of them will understand why I chose to walk away from the crash.</p><p>The few who will understand will be those who have been where I was in early December. People who have lost themselves in the dark woods of ordinary life, who have been betrayed by loved ones and forgotten how to be led by dreams.</p><p>And Daniel.</p><p>For no reason I can articulate, I am sure he will understand my bizarre choice. He is a man who knows about drifting, about betrayal and loss. I\u2019m certain of it. It\u2019s why he bought this place, those years ago when his family lived amid the red brick of Boston. Sometimes a change of scenery can be the answer. Or an answer, anyway.</p><p>Stacey, too, will understand, and she will forgive me. The question is: can I forgive her? Even with all that I have learned, I don\u2019t know the answer to that, and truthfully, I don\u2019t want to think about it. I haven\u2019t much time here at the Comfort Lodge. I need to soak up every second and fashion the time into memories. I will need them when I\u2019m home again.</p><p>It is the need for more that sends me in search of them again. I go out to the lobby, where Bobby and Daniel are watching Miracle on 34th Street.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Bobby says at my arrival. \u201cYou didn\u2019t miss anything.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t yet know how many times we watch Christmas movies in our lives. I take a seat in the red leather chair by the fireplace.</p><p>Together\u2014like a family\u2014we watch the movie.</p><p>As I watch the scenes unfurl, I can\u2019t help thinking of other Christmases, long ago.</p><p>\u201cMy mommy loved this part,\u201d Bobby says softly.</p><p>Onscreen, a young Natalie Wood is running through her new house, finding the cane that proves a miracle.</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d I say as the screen goes black and the credits roll.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s smile dips for a second, then returns. \u201cYou wanna play Chutes and Ladders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I answer.</p><p>Daniel laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s better than watching the Grinch again.\u201d</p><p>Bobby laughs at that, and the sound of their braided laughter\u2014Daniel\u2019s throaty and full, his son\u2019s high and childish\u2014finds a soft spot in me.</p><p>Bobby runs upstairs and is back in no time. Within minutes, the game is set up on the card table.</p><p>Daniel sits on the hearth facing the game. The fire backlights him. It is impossible not to notice how handsome he is. \u201cWell, boyo,\u201d he says, rubbing his hands together, \u201cyou ready for a whoopin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Bobby giggles and sets out our pieces. I sit in the empty chair to Daniel\u2019s left. Bobby sits across from me. \u201cI get to move for everyone,\u201d he says, trying to stack the cards on the place where they go.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cYou always do. Just like you open everyone\u2019s presents.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, Bobby leads us around the board. He picks all the cards and moves all the pieces and laughs whenever he pulls ahead. Daniel and I can hardly get a word in edgewise, but, in truth, we\u2019re not trying very hard. I can tell that Daniel is captivated by his son\u2019s smile, and I am mesmerized by the pair of them.</p><p>Unlike me, Bobby will never know the nagging ache of an absent father; he will have the loss of his mother inside him, like a thin shadow on a bright day, standing close, but he won\u2019t have that dragging sense that he was unloved, somehow, unworthy. For the whole of his life, he will go to sleep at night knowing his father loves him.</p><p>\u201cYou sure are laughin\u2019 a lot tonight, boyo.\u201d Daniel\u2019s voice pulls me back into the moment.</p><p>\u201cJoy keeps getting the worst cards,\u201d he answers with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hardly my fault.\u201d When I look up from the board, I catch Daniel\u2019s gaze and wonder if he sees who we could be together. I try to come up with a gem of a remark\u2014one that will make him want me the way I\u2019m beginning to want him\u2014but nothing comes to me, and the moment moves on.</p><p>As the night darkens, and we go from Chutes and Ladders to Candy Land, I have to keep reminding myself that I\u2019m a guest here. Otherwise, I\u2019ll reach for Daniel. I\u2019ll touch his arm and say something stupid like \u201cAre you lonely, too?\u201d or \u201cDo you feel it, this spark?\u201d It takes all my self-control to say nothing of importance. Each moment I\u2019m silent, I know, is a moment lost, a second that brings me closer to good-bye.</p><p>This night\u2014and everything it represents\u2014is the dream I\u2019ve held onto all my life. A family held together by love, a child who needs me. A man who knows how to love. I want so desperately to belong here, to be invited to stay. I could start over here, maybe get a job at the local high school and help Daniel refurbish this place. I\u2019d be good at it; I know I would. If only he\u2019d ask me. If only I had the courage to say it first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have to go all the way back,\u201d Bobby giggles, looking at my card. \u201cLook, Dad, Mommy has to go back.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the crackling of the fire is loud in the room, as is Daniel\u2019s indrawn breath.</p><p>\u201cI mean Joy,\u201d Bobby chirps happily, moving my man back.</p><p>Daniel looks at Bobby; his face is pale, his lips tight. I don\u2019t know him well enough to read his expression. Is it fear that Bobby has come to love me too much? Or regret that some things longed for can\u2019t be had? Or is it grief for the woman who should be at this game table on this night? I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I wish he\u2019d looked at me, if even just for an instant, and smiled. Instead, I see how he avoids looking at me in this moment where I\u2019ve been called Mommy for the first time in my life.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn, Dad,\u201d Bobby says, reaching for another card.</p><p>And the game goes on. I try to forget that Bobby called me Mommy and that Daniel looked so hurt by it, but I can\u2019t. It makes me want\u2014that single word and all that it implies.</p><p>Mommy.</p><p>I learn something about myself this cold winter\u2019s night. Something I should have known, perhaps; had I known it, I never would have walked away from the crash site.</p><p>You can run away from your life and your past, but there\u2019s no way to distance yourself from your own heart.</p> <p>At eight o\u2019clock, Daniel ends our perfect evening.</p><p>\u201cI know a boy who needs to get ready for bed,\u201d he says, standing up.</p><p>\u201cAw, Dad,\u201d Bobby whines, making a face. He is getting up from his chair when he smiles. \u201cBut Joy and me hafta wrap your present.\u201d</p><p>Daniel looks down at his son. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is Christmas Eve,\u201d I say to Daniel. \u201cAll presents need to be under the tree.\u201d</p><p>Daniel isn\u2019t fooled. \u201cYou just want to stay up. Okay. I have a few presents of my own to wrap, but I want you upstairs by eight-thirty. Should I set the timer on the oven to remind you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s on time,\u201d I say.</p><p>Daniel stands there a moment longer, looking at us. Bobby is right beside me now. He\u2019s so excited his little body seems to be vibrating.</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d Daniel finally says. \u201cSee you in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>When he is gone, Bobby runs to the sofa and pulls his copy of Green Eggs and Ham out from under the cushion. \u201cI need to practice one more time, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>We settle into the comfortable cushions together and open the book.</p><p>\u201cI . . . am . . . Sam. Sam . . . I . . . am.\u201d Bobby has memorized this part of the book, so he runs through it quickly. By the time he gets to page sixteen, he has slowed down and begun to sound out the words. \u201cI . . . w . . . ou . . . l . . . d would not like th . . . em them h . . . ere here or th . . . ere there.\u201d</p> <p>I tighten my hold on him.</p><p>By the time he finishes the book, his smile is so big it\u2019s like a storm wave breaking over the beach. Uncontainable.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best present you could give your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArnie Holtzner won\u2019t call me stupid now.\u201d He twists around to look up at me. \u201cThanks.\u201d He says it quietly, but it still hits me hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I lean toward him and gently kiss his forehead. It should be a perfect moment, a memory to take away with me, but when I feel the velvet of his warm skin and breathe in the sweet citrus scent of his hair, all I can think about is how it will feel to say good-bye.</p><p>I ease back from him, trying to smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few more minutes before your dad is expecting you. Will you help me with something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a piece of paper and something to write with.\u201d</p><p>Bobby slides eel-like off the sofa and runs to the registration desk. He is back in mere moments, holding a yellow legal pad and a red crayon.</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling. I haven\u2019t written with a crayon in years. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go to the card table.\u201d</p><p>We clear the game and take our seats, side by side, tucking in close. I hand Bobby the crayon and position the pad in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to write a list out for me. It\u2019s your dad\u2019s Christmas present from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. It\u2019s good practice. I\u2019ll tell you the words and you sound them out and write them down. It\u2019ll make my present extra special.\u201d</p><p>He looks so scared I want to hug him. Instead, I don my best teacher\u2019s face and say, \u201cThe first word is ideas. I . . . d . . . e . . . a . . . s.\u201d I help him sound it out but let him spell it himself.</p><p>The crayon quivers in his hand. He holds it tightly, fisting it, and bends over the paper. \u201cGo slow,\u201d he says, frowning in concentration.</p><p>It takes almost fifteen minutes of working together, but in the end, we have a list that looks like this:</p><p>Ibeas.</p><p>chng nme/rmantic</p><p>pant trm</p><p>flwrs</p><p>fix cbns</p><p>websit</p><p>no crpt flr</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Bobby says when we\u2019re done. \u201cMy mom wanted to do some of these things. You think he\u2019ll do it? I wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I don\u2019t want him to say his hope out loud. Some things need to be simply planted in the soft dirt of possibility. \u201cBut you remember this, Bobby: What matters is you and your dad being together. You guys are a team now. A family.\u201d</p><p>Bobby looks up at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back someday, won\u2019t you, Joy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWild horses couldn\u2019t keep me away. Now, let\u2019s wrap this present up and put it under the tree.\u201d</p><p>I show Bobby how to roll the list into a cylinder and wrap it in the pretty red foil paper, then to coil ribbons on each end. When we\u2019re finished, the clock reads 8:25. \u201cTime for you to go.\u201d</p><p>He grumbles in protest but heads dutifully for the stairs.</p><p>After he\u2019s gone, I sit on the hearth, listening to the last strains of the fading fire.</p><p>I have one more gift to place beneath the tree for Christmas morning\u2014if I can find what I am looking for.</p><p>I go to my room and retrieve the still damp sweater I wore to town. Shrugging into it, I head outside.</p><p>The night is quiet and cold. A slushy layer of newly fallen snow covers the ground. Already it is beginning to melt. The green lawn shows through in big, irregular patches. Water drips from the eaves and branches, makes tiny dark holes in the melting snow.</p><p>I walk down the uneven path toward the lake.</p><p>As if on cue, the cloud overhead drifts on, revealing a nearly full moon. Shimmery blue light falls on me, on the lake and the clock, and the dark ground. It is almost eerie, this light, vaguely impossible. A shiver runs through me. Although it can\u2019t happen, I know it can\u2019t, I hear a woman\u2019s voice. It is quiet, barely above a whisper, but I hear it nonetheless, hear her say, \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>I look down. There, lying all alone on top of a bed of shiny black stones, is a bright white arrowhead. Moonlight hits it and reflects it back at me, turning it for a second into a fallen star.</p><p>I spin around, but there is no woman around me.</p><p>Of course there isn\u2019t.</p><p>I bend down for the arrowhead. It fits perfectly in my palm, feels as smooth as silk and as cold as a snowflake. I tuck it into my pocket and walk back to the lodge, through a night that is both silvery light and jet black.</p><p>By the time I get to the door, I\u2019ve told myself in no uncertain terms that nothing unusual happened by the lake. I merely went in search of an arrowhead and found one.</p><p>But as I step onto the deck, hear it creak beneath my feet, I say softly, \u201cThanks, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>Then I go inside.</p><p>B y morning, the snow is almost gone. I stand at my window, staring out at the green, sunlit backyard. I can see a corner of one of the cabins. The roof shingles are furred with thick moss. Come spring, I imagine that tiny flowers will sprout up from the mossy patches.</p><p>I should have added power-wash roofs to my list. And advertising in more in-flight magazines. I\u2019ll have to tell Daniel those things face-to-face.</p><p>Outside, on this Christmas Eve, the day is both sunlit and gray. A light rain is falling; the drops are so thin and tiny they\u2019re almost imaginary, like tears.</p><p>And suddenly I am thinking of Stacey.</p><p>I remember that last night in Bakersfield when she asked me to come to her wedding. And showed me her pregnant stomach.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, she\u2019d said.</p><p>I remember her on television, crying for me, believing in the miracle of my return, hoping for it.</p><p>And Thom. The man I vowed to love forever, who now loves my sister.</p><p>The thought makes me sad, but doesn\u2019t ruin me anymore. I can actually think of them together without wincing.</p><p>If nothing else, this pause has given me that: a lens through which to view my previous life. It\u2019s not forgiveness. Not even near that yet, but it is . . . acceptance, and that\u2019s better than nothing.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how long I stand at my window, staring out, thinking about my life Before and what will happen tomorrow. Time is odd in this place, more fluid than I\u2019m used to somehow. When I finally take my shower, get dressed in my borrowed skirt and sweater, and go out to the lobby, Bobby is by the tree, shaking presents. Daniel is behind him, laughing.</p><p>I pause at the corner, watching them. All it takes is a look at Bobby and Daniel, a moment in their presence, and the bitter aftertaste of my previous life is gone. A smile comes easily; I feel it deep inside, too, not just a curving of my lips, but a lifting of my spirit. In some small way, I have given them this moment. Without the tree, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to slide back in time, to recapture one of those ordinary moments that becomes extraordinary from a distance. I only hope I can do the same for myself. Stacey and I need to see ourselves more clearly. Maybe then we can find our way back.</p><p>At the sound of my footsteps, Bobby looks up. \u201cJoy!\u201d He is shaking a present, but pauses long enough to say, \u201cAre you gonna go see the old people with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell \u2019er where we\u2019re goin\u2019, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe church serves brunch at the nursing home,\u201d Daniel answers.</p><p>It\u2019s what I do on my own holiday. It\u2019s a tradition my mom started long ago. For all the years of my childhood, I spent Christmas Eve afternoon at the nursing home with Grandma Lund. In my adult years, I volunteered on holidays.</p><p>Fate.</p><p>\u201cYou better hurry,\u201d Daniel says to Bobby and me. I race down to my room, tame my riotous hair, brush my teeth, and make my bed. Then we all go out to the truck.</p><p>Between the Christmas lights and the remnants of an early morning rain, the town glistens with water and light. People fill the sidewalks; cars clog the streets.</p><p>Daniel pulls into a parking lot and stops. We are at the Rain Shadow Convalescent Center. It\u2019s a lovely little brick building set well to the back of a deep lot. A few older trees, bare now, flank the sides, and giant rhododendrons and azaleas grow out front. Christmas lights outline the windows, and a fully lit menorah sits on the sill.</p><p>Inside, the center is a hive of activity. In the lobby, several white clad attendants are pushing people in wheelchairs toward a room marked \u201cChristmas Eve Brunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go meet the guys and get breakfast ready. You can help get people to the tables, okay?\u201d Daniel says to us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get Mr. Lundberg!\u201d Bobby cries out, rushing down the hall.</p><p>When I turn to ask Daniel something, he\u2019s gone, but I don\u2019t need his direction. I\u2019ve spent plenty of time in nursing homes. I know how to help.</p><p>I walk down the busy hallway, looking in to the various rooms. Most are empty now. That\u2019s why the hallways are so full.</p><p>In the very back of the building, I find an elderly woman sitting in a chair, all by herself, facing a window that looks outside. She wears a pale pink ruffled dressing gown, with ribbons in her snow white hair. Her small, heart-shaped face has been overtaken by wrinkles, and bright red lipstick doesn\u2019t quite match her lip lines, but her eyes reveal a woman who was once gorgeous enough to stop traffic.</p> <p>\u201cHello, there,\u201d I say, stepping into the small room. \u201cMerry Christmas Eve. Would you like to go to the brunch?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer me. I\u2019ve probably spoken too softly. I enter the room, make my way past the bed, and kneel down in front of her.</p><p>She\u2019s muttering something, playing with a red satin ribbon. The thin strip of fabric is coiled around her knobby, veiny knuckles.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, smiling up at her. \u201cI\u2019m here to take you to the brunch.\u201d I have to yell the words.</p><p>The woman frowns. Her fingers still. She blinks down at me. \u201cIs it my time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe brunch starts in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister is supposed to come for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll meet you in the dining room.\u201d I stand, offer her my hand.</p><p>She looks up at me. Her eyes seem huge in her tiny face. \u201cWalk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you.\u201d I help her to her feet and coil my arm around her. It\u2019s easy. The woman is almost impossibly frail. Together, moving slowly, we shuffle down the hallway. It\u2019s less crowded now. Only a few people are lingering about.</p><p>We pass a nurse, or orderly, someone in a white polyester outfit who stares at us, then frowns. \u201cMrs. Gardiner?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to plant tulips,\u201d the woman beside me says, tightening her hold on my arm.</p><p>We go the last bit to the dining room and turn. At our entrance, I notice how everyone looks up sharply. More than a few gasp. A heavyset nurse rushes toward me. \u201cMrs. Gardiner, what are you doing here? You know an aide would have brought you a wheelchair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe walked really well,\u201d I say, holding her steady.</p><p>\u201cMy sister?\u201d she croaks, looking up at the nurse.</p><p>\u201cNow, Mrs. Gardiner, you know Dora is gone. But your son is here, and your granddaughters.\u201d The nurse points to a table in the back of the room where a good-looking gray-haired man is seated between a pair of twins. All three of them get to their feet when they see us. Even from here I can see the tears in their eyes.</p><p>The man rushes forward, takes his mother\u2019s hand. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d His voice is shaky.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dora?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mom. Your granddaughters are here.\u201d The man tucks her into his side and leads her toward the table.</p> <p>The nurse beside me shakes her head, makes a tsking sound. \u201cPoor Mrs. Gardiner.\u201d</p><p>Another nurse joins us, stands beside me. \u201cShe spends all day waiting for her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad. Dora\u2019s been gone almost fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>I ease away from them and head toward the buffet line to help, but volunteers already stand shoulder to shoulder behind the food.</p><p>There\u2019s no room for me.</p><p>I will do dishes, I guess. I look around for Bobby, but don\u2019t see him. From my place in the doorway, I try to get Daniel\u2019s attention and fail. He\u2019s deep in conversation with an elderly man who seems to want a mountain of hash browns.</p><p>I go out into the now-quiet halls. \u201cBobby?\u201d</p><p>When there is no answer, I go in search.</p><p>I find him in the recreation room, alone, playing with his action figures. I hear his sound effects before I enter the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo. What\u2019cha doing?\u201d</p><p>He barely looks up at me. \u201cI\u2019m too little.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the plaid sofa behind him. \u201cThat won\u2019t be true for long.\u201d</p><p>He sits back on his heels. The action figures fall to the side, forgotten. \u201cMommy never said I was too little. She always let me hand out napkins and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, Bobby.\u201d I pat the seat beside me. He jumps up to the sofa and snuggles in close. \u201cDid you tell your dad you wanted to help?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, looking miserable.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell people how you feel . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Stacey said.</p><p>The memory shakes me. Suddenly I have a pounding headache.</p><p>I should have listened to her . . .</p><p>\u201c. . . and give them a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Bobby says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get no argument from me on that one, kiddo.\u201d Later, when I call my sister, it will be the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done.</p><p>Daniel walks in. \u201cThere you are. I\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d</p><p>I smile at him over Bobby\u2019s head. \u201cHe was disappointed that he was too little to help serve.\u201d</p><p>Bobby looks at me for encouragement. At my nod, he turns back to his dad and says quietly, \u201cMommy always let me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bobby. I guess I\u2019m sorta learnin\u2019 the ropes on this dad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Joy said.\u201d</p><p>Daniel seems surprised by that. \u201cShe\u2019s a smart woman, your Joy. And now, boyo, it\u2019s time for church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Bobby says quietly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cI\u2019ll hold your hand the whole time. We\u2019ll light a candle for your mum. She\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let go?\u201d Bobby asks his father.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Daniel promises.</p><p>Bobby looks at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Bobby takes a deep breath. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Awash in light, the church looks like a small white jewel against the royal blue sky.</p><p>We stand on the sidewalk out front, Daniel and I, with Bobby between us. All around us, people are talking to one another and funneling up the stone steps to the church.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Daniel says.</p><p>They\u2019re a pair now, the two of them, holding fast.</p><p>Like Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion, we advance cautiously up the sidewalk toward the steps, which we take one at a time.</p><p>An elderly priest is positioned at the door. He smiles at the sight of Bobby.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, young Robert,\u201d he says, his eyes bright. \u201cWe missed you.\u201d</p><p>Bobby nods in answer and doesn\u2019t slow down. I can see how nervous he is, but he keeps moving. One foot in front of the other.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brave boy,\u201d I say, feeling a swell of pride for this child who is learning young to fight his fear.</p><p>He leads us into the back row and slides into the pew. I know he wants to be close to the door. Daniel and I bookend him, give him safety on both sides.</p><p>As people pour into the church and fill up the pews, Bobby stands as straight as a newly cut board. He doesn\u2019t sit until the processional begins and the doors behind us bang shut.</p><p>It is then, when the pews are full and the doors are shut and the priest is blessing the congregation, that I realize how much I have missed my own faith. I haven\u2019t been in church since my mom\u2019s funeral.</p><p>For the next hour, we rise and kneel and rise again, and with each word spoken, each prayer reiterated, I feel a bit of myself return.</p><p>At the conclusion of The Lord\u2019s Prayer, Bobby looks up at his dad and whispers: \u201cC\u2019n Mommy hear me in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can hear you everywhere,\u201d Daniel answers.</p><p>Bobby scrunches up his face and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was mad at you, Mommy,\u201d all in a single breath.</p><p>I hear Daniel gasp. \u201cOh, Bobby . . .\u201d</p><p>Bobby\u2019s eyes glisten as he looks at his dad. \u201cI told her I hated her.\u201d</p><p>Daniel touches his son\u2019s face, wipes his tears away. \u201cShe knows how much you love her, boyo. No silly fight can change that.\u201d</p><p>The words are exactly what Bobby needs to hear. For the first time, I see his true smile. It lights up his face, shows off all of his crooked, missing, and growing teeth.</p><p>When a hymn begins, Bobby turns to the right page in the hymnal, and joins his clean, high voice with his father\u2019s.</p><p>For the remainder of the Mass, they stand side by side and hand in hand. I watch them find their voices, and the sight of it fills my heart.</p><p>Starting over.</p><p>I\u2019m seeing it. For all my dreams of complex new beginnings and convoluted endings, it can all be as easy as this: a boy singing hymns again.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>I close my eyes at that. When I open them again, the mass is over. People are crowding together, shaking hands, and talking to one another. A ruddy-faced man turns to me, smiling. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Peace be with you.\u201d I can\u2019t stop smiling. I feel almost giddy with happiness. I\u2019d forgotten this feeling.</p><p>We follow the crowd to the parking lot behind the church, where a group of carolers, dressed in old-fashioned Victorian garb, is singing. Volunteers are handing out Styrofoam cups full of hot cider and paper bags filled with hot nuts.</p><p>We stand at the back of the crowd, listening to the beautiful voices.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see, Dad. Pick me up.\u201d</p><p>Daniel scoops Bobby into his arms.</p><p>I move in close to Daniel. Although people are all around us, listening to the carolers, whispering among themselves, sipping hot cider, I can hear only Daniel\u2019s quiet, even breathing.</p><p>The beat of it matches my heart.</p><p>And I think: This is it. My moment. If I\u2019ve learned nothing else in the past few days, it\u2019s that happiness must be fought for. I need to tell him how I feel tonight; tomorrow, this adventure of mine will end. At that, my heart starts hammering in my chest. A headache flares behind my eyes. I\u2019ve always been afraid to reach for what I want.</p><p>But not this time. I won\u2019t let a panic attack stop me.</p><p>I turn to him. \u201cDaniel.\u201d</p><p>The carolers change songs. I recognize the music, but can\u2019t quite place the song. Something is wrong. There\u2019s a buzzing in my head. My vision is blurring.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d I say, making my voice loud. When he doesn\u2019t look at me, I dare to touch him. \u201cDANIEL!\u201d I am screaming his name suddenly, trying to grab him.</p><p>\u201cJoy?\u201d Bobby is looking at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I can see how scared he is. And he can see how scared I am.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d I say. I\u2019m moving away from them, but I don\u2019t want to. I fight to get back; there are people everywhere. I think I see Stacey, standing in the crowd. She\u2019s crying and saying something, but I can\u2019t hear her. But that\u2019s not possible. She has no idea where I am.</p><p>Something is buzzing. I can hear people talking, yelling.</p><p>Don\u2019t leave us, Joy.</p><p>It\u2019s Bobby . . . and it\u2019s not.</p><p>I reach out, grab Daniel\u2019s sleeve. \u201cHelp me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDad, help her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy?\u201d Daniel whispers my name; at least I think he does.

The ceiling overhead is made up of white acoustical tiles with long tubes of fluorescent lighting.</p><p>There are people all around me, too, dressed in orange, moving in and out and around me like dancers. I can see them talking to one another, but I can\u2019t hear anything except that buzzing in my ears and the whoosh-thunk of a machine that sounds like waves breaking on the beach.</p><p>On either side of me are machines that make noises. I see a black television screen with a green graph that moves across it in waves.</p><p>I\u2019m in a hospital.</p><p>I must have collapsed in the park. Had a heart attack or something. I try to move, to angle up to sit so that I can see more of the room around me, but my arms and legs feel useless, heavy.</p><p>\u201cBobby?\u201d I whisper. My throat burns at the effort. I\u2019m painfully thirsty. \u201cDaniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, there, Joy. It\u2019s nice to see you.\u201d</p> <p>A man\u2019s face swims in front of me. I struggle to focus. I can see him in pieces: snow white hair . . . tan skin . . . blue eyes . . . a diamond earring.</p><p>It\u2019s the man from the gas station.</p><p>\u201cWh . . . t?\u201d I want to ask \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d but my tongue isn\u2019t working.</p><p>He gives me an ice chip to soothe my fiery throat. \u201cDon\u2019t try to talk, Joy. You\u2019ve been intubated. The soreness in your throat is normal. I\u2019m Dr. Saunders. You gave us all quite a scare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? . . .\u201d Are you? I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening and it scares me.</p><p>\u201cYou just rest now.\u201d</p><p>The people in my room talk among themselves in whispered tones designed to keep me from hearing. Their faces are a sea of blurry circles; everyone is frowning at me and pointing. There is a lot of head-shaking going on. One by one, they leave.</p><p>I can hear their footsteps walking away, and the opening and closing of a door.</p><p>Then there are only the machines in here with me, making their noises\u2014a click-buzz, a thunk-whoosh; a blip-blip-blip. And I am alone, unable to move, staring up at this unfamiliar ceiling.</p><p>Poor Bobby. He must be terrified.</p><p>I won\u2019t leave you.</p><p>And here I am, in the hospital.</p><p>I want him here, beside my bed so that I can smile and tell him I\u2019m fine.</p><p>Behind me, the door opens again. Footsteps move haltingly toward me.</p><p>It\u2019s Bobby. Thank God.</p><p>I feel a rush of sweet relief. He\u2019s knows I didn\u2019t leave him. I\u2019m fine. Fine. In my head, the protestation is vibrant and clear, but the sound that issues from my cracked, dry lips is barely a whisper and even that useless sound tires me. Instead, I try to lift my hand to show how fine I am.</p><p>\u201cJoy?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the wrong voice; not a boy\u2019s. It takes forever for me to turn my head, and when I do, the pillow puffs up around my face, blocking the view from my left eye.</p><p>I can see well enough, though.</p><p>She looks smaller, somehow, like a pencil that\u2019s been used down to the nub. Her eyes are swollen and red; there\u2019s no mistaking the tear tracks on her cheeks.</p><p>Stacey.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand. How is she here? How did she find me?</p><p>\u201cWha . . . here?\u201d</p><p>She leans close, pushing the damp hair from my eyes. Her touch is quick, as if she\u2019s not sure it will be welcomed. Almost before I feel it, she draws back. \u201cI was so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u201d did you \u201cfin . . .\u201d me?</p><p>I can see her answering me, but there\u2019s something wrong. I can\u2019t hear over the buzzing in my ears. My head is pounding, too. I want to ask her where Bobby and Daniel are, but my voice is turning against me. All that comes out is, \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey airlifted you to Bakersfield. You\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d The word comes out sounding cracked. I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s Christmas \u201cEve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I know how much you love the holidays.\u201d</p><p>What \u201cDay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the thirtieth. You\u2019ve had a rough two weeks, but the doctors think you\u2019re going to be okay now.\u201d</p><p>Her words scatter like BBs on a kitchen table; it\u2019s impossible to grasp them all at once.</p><p>\u201cDaniel?\u201d</p><p>Stacey frowns. \u201cDo you understand me, Joy? You were in a plane crash, remember? The firemen rescued you moments before it exploded. The doctors said you might have trouble with your memory.\u201d</p><p>Rescued you. Firemen.</p><p>But I walked away from the crash, left my tattered life behind in the wreckage and went on an adventure. If anyone rescued me, it was Bobby and Daniel. I want to shake my head in denial, but I can\u2019t seem to move. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in a medically induced coma for almost ten days. Because of a head injury.\u201d</p><p>Head injury.</p><p>It steals over me like a cold shadow, the meaning of her words. She\u2019s saying I\u2019ve been here, in this hospital bed, since the crash.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand. Why would she lie to me? Because I ran away, because I let her think I was dead?</p><p>\u201cJoy? What do you remember?\u201d</p><p>Daniel and Bobby . . .</p><p>Walking away . . .</p><p>Dancing by the fire at the beach . . .</p><p>My heart starts pounding so fast I can\u2019t breathe. Beside me, a machine starts beeping. \u201cLying,\u201d I accuse in a whisper. At the word, and the effort behind it, my throat seems to catch fire.</p><p>As if from a distance, I hear my sister calling for someone. Within moments there are people in my room.</p><p>I see a needle.</p><p>\u201cQuit thrashing,\u201d my sister says. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>Please be lying.</p><p>I feel myself fading to gray, closing my eyes. The terrible sound in my head goes still.</p><p>Lying.</p><p>I\u2019m flying above the rainforest, looking down at the brightly lit tiara of a town. From a great and yawning distance, I see the black ribbon of a road. Moonlight gilds the center line and I follow it.</p><p>This time, I know I\u2019m dreaming. I can hear the buzz of the fluorescent lighting overhead and the thunk-whoosh sound of the stork-like machine beside my bed. There is also a kind of low-grade thrumming in my blood, a euphoria, that comes from an IV drip. I guess it\u2019s camouflaging a serious pain, but it\u2019s masking it so well I don\u2019t care.</p><p>From my place amid the silvery clouds, I see the Comfort Fishing Lodge, tucked down along the glassy gray lake. Moonlight glitters on the water.</p><p>That\u2019s where I want to be. I close my eyes and make it happen.</p><p>When I open my eyes, I\u2019m in the lobby, pressed against the wall. The room is still decorated. The lights of the tree are on; the mantel holds several lit candles amid the snowy town. The stereo is playing Bruce Springsteen\u2019s version of \u201cSanta Claus is Coming to Town.\u201d</p><p>I hear footsteps upstairs. This old place rattles and groans as someone races down the hall overhead, then clatters down the stairs.</p><p>It is Bobby. He is at a full Christmas morning run.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, he pivots left and rushes past me to Room 1A.</p><p>He pulls the door open, yelling, \u201cJoy!\u201d and disappears inside.</p><p>I picture him skidding to a stop beside the empty bed. The sorrow I feel at that overwhelms me, making it difficult to breathe again.</p><p>Daniel comes down the stairs and stops beside me. I long to feel the warmth of him, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m close enough to see the tiny sleep lines that mark his cheek, to hear the soft strains of his breath, and yet I feel as if I\u2019m miles away. \u201cBoyo? I thought you\u2019d go straight to the tree.\u201d</p><p>Bobby steps back into the hall. He looks smaller somehow, younger. His shoulders are slumped, his mouth is shaking. I can see how hard he is trying not to cry. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>I try to go to him, but I can\u2019t push away from the wall. My legs are like lead pipes.</p><p>Bobby shuffles toward his father in that hangdog way of disappointed children everywhere. \u201cShe promised. It\u2019s just like Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I say, desperately trying to reach out for him. \u201cDon\u2019t say I\u2019m not here.\u201d</p><p>Daniel pulls Bobby into his arms. I can tell that Bobby is crying, but it\u2019s nearly silent, the way of a boy who has learned too early to cry and is trying to hide it.</p><p>When Bobby draws back, his eyes are red and watery.</p><p>\u201cRemember what the doctor said?\u201d Daniel asks, wiping his son\u2019s tears with a gentle hand. \u201cWhen you didn\u2019t need your imaginary friend anymore, she\u2019d leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t imaginary, Dad.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t. You talked to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctors told me to pretend.\u201d</p><p>I feel as if I\u2019ve been struck.</p><p>I was Bobby\u2019s imaginary friend.</p><p>Daniel never saw me.</p><p>I scream, \u201cIt isn\u2019t true,\u201d but even as I say the words, I remember things. The times Daniel didn\u2019t look at me or speak to me. When he did talk to me it was a pretense, at doctor\u2019s orders, to make Bobby feel loved. Like the time we danced. Now I recall that Bobby pointed to where I was. She\u2019s right there, Daddy. Dance with her.</p><p>\u201cI can be the one you talk to, Bobby,\u201d Daniel says. His voice cracks. I can see in his eyes how confused he is by all of this, and how afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me,\u201d Bobby says stubbornly. He spins on his heel and marches over to the Christmas tree, then squats in front of it.</p><p>At Bobby\u2019s movement, I am released. I follow him, move when he does, where he does.</p><p>When he kneels at the tree, I sit on the hearth, as I have done so many times before. To my left, the card table is still set up with Candyland. There are three men on the board.</p><p>I\u2019ll move for Joy, Dad.</p><p>At that, another piece clicks into place. Whenever Bobby and I played with action figures, he wanted me to be Frodo, wearing the ring.</p><p>The ring that made Frodo invisible.</p><p>Bobby reaches underneath the tree and pulls out a small package. It is a crudely wrapped cylinder with ribbons on each end.</p><p>We catch our breath at the same time, Bobby and I. It\u2019s proof of my impossible journey, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cLook, Dad. This is from Joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>Daniel takes the cylinder in his hands; it looks tiny and frail against his long, tanned fingers. He unwraps it carefully, extracts the list. As he reads it, he frowns. Then he looks at Bobby. \u201cHow did you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Joy\u2019s present to you. She told me what to write.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glances down at the list again.</p><p>I was here.</p><p>I was.</p><p>Surely Daniel will believe Bobby now.</p> <p>Daniel looks down at his son. \u201cYou did this by yourself,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cPlease admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t, Dad,\u201d Bobby answers earnestly.</p><p>In the silence that follows, Daniel looks around. \u201cIs she here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She disappeared in the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSEE ME,\u201d I say as loudly as I can.</p> <p>Daniel frowns. I can see that he\u2019s bothered by this. He knows Bobby didn\u2019t write that list on his own, but he doesn\u2019t believe in me. How could he?</p><p>\u201cPlease believe me,\u201d Bobby whispers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Mommy. Or Mr. Patches. I swear it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Daniel stares at the list in his hand. The paper shivers a little, as if he\u2019s shaking. Then he looks at his son. \u201cYou need me to believe in magic.\u201d</p><p>Bobby\u2019s nod brings tears to his father\u2019s eyes, and to mine. \u201cMommy would believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Bobby sighs. It is a terrible, harrowing sound; in it, I hear his defeat.</p> <p>At last, Daniel says, \u201cWell, I\u2019m Irish, and we\u2019re a crazy lot.\u201d</p><p>Bobby draws in a sharp breath. It\u2019s the sound of hope, this time. \u201cNana used to say a leprechaun lived in her cookie jar.\u201d</p><p>Daniel smiles at that. \u201cMy point exactly. I guess, boyo, for you I can try to believe, too. But you\u2019ll have to show me how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I show you?\u201d</p><p>Daniel shrugs. \u201cTell me about her, I guess. Keep talking until I believe.\u201d</p><p>Bobby hurls himself into his father\u2019s arms.</p> <p>I see the way Daniel holds his son, with a ferocity that is borne of desperate love. When Bobby draws back, they are both smiling.</p><p>See me, I whisper, wanting it so much my chest hurts. Please.</p><p>\u201cCan we open presents now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Bobby runs to the tree and starts dispersing gifts. Most of them collect in a pile on the coffee table. On his last pass, he reaches deep under the tree and pulls out the orange Dr. Seuss book. It has a yellow ribbon stuck dead center. Carrying it carefully, he hands it to his dad, who is now seated on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me your favorite book, boyo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Bobby sits down next to Daniel, then opens the book.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to read to you?\u201d Daniel asks, frowning. \u201cHow about . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet. I gotta think.\u201d He scrunches up his face, concentrating hard. One syllable at a time, he sounds out the words. \u201cI . . . am . . . Sam. Sam . . . I . . . am . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSshh, Daddy. \u2018I . . . do . . . not . . . like . . . green . . . eggs . . . and . . . ham.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I listen to Bobby\u2019s sweet, stumbling voice, but it is Daniel to whom I look. At first he is sitting upright, in control, but as his son sounds out the words, I see Daniel\u2019s control wash away. Everything about him softens\u2014the look in his green eyes, the shelf of his broad shoulders, and the hard line of his spine.</p><p>Love. Never have I seen it so clearly or longed for it more desperately.</p><p>I\u2019m part of this, I say to them. See me, too.</p><p>When Bobby finishes the book, he looks up at his dad. \u201cYou\u2019re cryin\u2019. Did I do bad?\u201d</p><p>Daniel touches his son\u2019s cheek. \u201cYour mum would be so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Tears sting my eyes, make everything blurry, and I\u2019m glad. I need this moment to be out of focus.</p><p>\u201cJoy taught me every day.\u201d</p><p>Daniel stares down at his son for a long moment. \u201cDid she now? Then I guess your Joy has a place here, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss her, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you\u2019ve got your old man, and he\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>I can hear the fear in Bobby\u2019s voice, and in the sound, I make sense of it all. That\u2019s been Bobby\u2019s fear all along. That he would be alone. It was the same fear that caused me to board the airplane bound for Hope.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward. It is as much movement as I can make. \u201cBelieve in me,\u201d I say desperately, willing them to see with their hearts. I focus all my mind on it, thinking over and over again: Believe.</p><p>The effort takes everything I have. When I\u2019m done, I can hardly breathe. I feel my heartbeat speed up again. The world starts to go fuzzy and out of focus.</p><p>I am fading.</p><p>Fading.</p><p>I reach out for something to hold on to.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing. I close my eyes and scream: No!</p><p>When I open my eyes again, I see bright white lights. A nurse is standing by my bed. It is the woman I \u201cmet\u201d at the doctor\u2019s office in my dream.</p><p>\u201cHow are we today?\u201d she asks in her completely familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I manage, closing my eyes again. I try to find my way back to the rainforest, but, this time, all I see is darkness.</p><p>I want to be on the drugs again.</p><p>Instead, I am fully awake now, and sitting up in bed. There are so many people clustered around me that I can\u2019t see the walls behind them. A sheen of light hugs the ceiling, coming from a window I can\u2019t see.</p><p>I find myself listening for the rain.</p><p>But I am in Bakersfield now; it\u2019s the thirty-first of December, and the sun is shining outside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. Tell me again.\u201d</p><p>The people gathered around me frown. I recognize all of them. There\u2019s Stacey, of course. She hasn\u2019t left the room since I woke up, except to go out for food or\u2014no doubt\u2014to call Thom. And the nurse I saw in my dream. She\u2019s the day nurse who has been taking care of me. The ruddy-faced man from church is the orthopedist who put my right leg back together. Apparently I\u2019m held together by a titanium pin of some kind. This is more than I can say for my mind, which is held together lately by nothing. The gas station guy is my cardiologist; he brought me back to life, though the real credit goes to a man and boy who probably don\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cYour right leg was broken just below the knee. And your concussion was quite severe. We worried about swelling of the brain for several days,\u201d says the gas station attendant, whom I now have to start calling Dr. Saunders.</p><p>I want to make a joke about having a bigger brain, but words fail me.</p><p>\u201cWith a little physical therapy, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d my sister says. The council nods in unison like bobbleheads in the backseat of a car.</p><p>\u201cCan I still ice skate?\u201d I ask, although I haven\u2019t ice skated since Melinda Carter\u2019s ninth birthday party.</p><p>Dr. Saunders frowns. This is a question he didn\u2019t anticipate. \u201cIn time, certainly, but . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d I try to smile. \u201cWhen can I go home?\u201d</p><p>The head bobbing starts again. This is a question they like. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take it easy for a while,\u201d says Dr. Saunders.</p><p>I look down at my casted right leg. No kidding.</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re careful, and barring any unforeseen complications, we think you can go home in a few days.\u201d</p><p>I want to smile for them. I really do. I know how hard they have all worked to help me so that I can go home.</p><p>Alone. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>I see how Stacey looks at me. She knows what I\u2019m thinking. It is a bond that has been in place a long time, and apparently neither anger nor betrayal can break it.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, meaning it.</p><p>As a group, they leave, and we are left alone, Stacey and I.</p><p>Neither one of us speaks. We obviously don\u2019t know what to say, how to start.</p><p>It\u2019s up to me; I know that. She has already made her move\u2014she invited me to her wedding. It\u2019s why I\u2019m lying here, hooked up to machines and held together by a metal pin.</p><p>I sit up, reposition the pillows. The minute I\u2019m up here, I know it\u2019s a mistake. There\u2019s no way to avoid seeing Stacey\u2019s stomach. She has gained a few pounds already.</p><p>She notices where I\u2019m looking. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t thrown me out,\u201d she says, softly. I can hear the longing in her voice, the missing of me, and it reminds me of a dozen memories of our youth.</p><p>\u201cAt your current weight, I\u2019d need some kind of catapult.\u201d</p><p>She wants to smile at my lame joke; I can see the desire. But she doesn\u2019t. Probably she can\u2019t. Neither can I. \u201cI haven\u2019t gained that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had two good legs, I\u2019d kick your ass, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Stacey says. \u201cYou always make jokes when you\u2019re hurting.\u201d</p><p>And there it is: the core of everything. We\u2019re sisters. We know each other intimately. Our pasts, our secrets, our fears. It is a precious gift that we tried to throw away but can\u2019t really let go of.</p><p>Stacey bites her lower lip. It\u2019s what she\u2019s done her whole life when she\u2019s scared. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joy. I don\u2019t know how it happened. I didn\u2019t mean . . .\u201d</p><p>I hold up my hand. Of all the things we could say now, the hows and whys of what happened are at the bottom of my list. But I make my move too late; her words get through, make me angry . . . and hurt me. \u201cYou make it sound like you slipped on a banana peel and fell on my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d</p><p>The soft tenor of her voice, the trembling of her lip, the regret in her eyes; I see it all, and in seeing it, seeing her, I lose that spark of anger, just let it go. When the plane was going down, it was Stacey whom I thought about. That\u2019s what I need to always remember now. \u201cWe find a way to get past it. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you and what have you done with my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s trying to be funny?\u201d</p><p>Stacey stares down at me with a combination of awe and gratitude. \u201cTwo weeks ago you hated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never hated you, Stace,\u201d I say the words softly, realizing almost before I\u2019ve finished that they\u2019re not enough. What I want to say, need to say, now before I lose my nerve is what I learned in the rainforest: \u201cWe\u2019re sisters.\u201d</p><p>At that, Stacey starts to cry.</p><p>I wait for her to say something, but she remains quiet. Maybe, like me, she\u2019s wondering how exactly we move forward from here. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d I say.</p><p>She wipes her eyes. \u201cWhat is?\u201d Taking a small step closer, she looks down at me, pushes a strand of hair from my eyes. \u201cI am sorry, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sigh. \u201cWhen I was in the rainforest,\u201d I stop abruptly, realizing what I was about to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat rainforest?\u201d</p><p>I try to smile and fail. \u201cIf I told you, you\u2019d think I was brain damaged. Or crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most level-headed person I know.\u201d</p><p>I look at her closely, trying to gauge how much to say. \u201cOn television, I heard you tell the reporters you were hoping I\u2019d come back to you.\u201d</p><p>Stacey frowns. \u201cHow\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer me. Did you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I prayed every day that you\u2019d wake up and come back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow, I saw that real broadcast from a fake world. \u201cAnd you were wearing the yellow outfit I bought you.\u201d</p><p>Stacey nods slowly, then leans forward, rests her arms on the rail. \u201cYou never saw that broadcast. You were in a coma.\u201d</p><p>Who can I tell if not my sister? And I need to tell someone. I\u2019m like the \u201cI see dead people\u201d kid. If I try to handle this all alone, I\u2019ll go nuts. \u201cAfter the crash, I woke up . . .\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo. You never regained consciousness. The paramedics . . . \u201d</p> <p>\u201cCrazy, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I was in this clearing. There was smoke everywhere, and fire, and loud noises, and . . . Mom.\u201d</p><p>Stacey goes very still. \u201cYou saw her?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knelt beside me and told me it wasn\u2019t my time.\u201d I lean forward slightly, desperate to be told I\u2019m not insane, even though I know I must be. \u201cTell me I\u2019m wacko.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the field . . . Your heart stopped for almost a minute. You were legally dead.\u201d</p><p>I release a deep breath. There\u2019s a strange sense of peace that comes with the news. \u201cShe made me wake up. When I did, I saw how alone I was, how far from the survivors. At first, I was going to go to them and get rescued, then I thought of you and I changed my mind. I walked away from the crash and ended up in some little town in Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the plane crashed about one hundred miles northeast of here?\u201d</p><p>It shakes me, that new bit of information. \u201cI was never even in Washington State?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll think about that later. For now, since I\u2019ve started on my mad story, I want to finish it. \u201cI found a run-down resort called The Comfort Fishing Lodge and got a room. There was a boy there, and a man.\u201d</p><p>Stacey holds up a hand to stop me. \u201cWait a second.\u201d She runs to the corner of the room, where my purse is on a mustard-yellow plastic seat. Beside it is my camera.</p><p>\u201cMy camera,\u201d I whisper. \u201cDid you develop my film?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? No.\u201d Stacey digs through my black leather tote and finally pulls out a magazine, then hurries back to my side. \u201cI read this while you were in surgery.\u201d She opens it to a page, hands it to me.</p><p>It\u2019s the article on The Comfort Fishing Lodge. \u201cI was looking at this in the airport.\u201d</p><p>I feel as if I\u2019m unraveling, coming apart. This is where it began. In my subconscious. I looked at the pictures of this place and longed to go there. And a morphine drip made it possible.</p><p>\u201cThis article says the lodge was torn down in 2003, to make way for a corporate retreat.\u201d</p> <p>Torn down.</p><p>\u201cDoes it mention a Daniel?\u201d</p><p>Stacey scans the pages. \u201cNo. The resort was built by Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Hightower. They moved to Arizona when the Zimon Corporation purchased it. The new place hosts corporate shindigs and self-help seminars.\u201d</p><p>There is no Comfort Fishing Lodge.</p><p>I was never there.</p><p>No doubt Daniel is my neurologist and Bobby is some nurse\u2019s son who darted into my room for a second while I was sleeping.</p><p>\u201cJoy, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes so she won\u2019t see my tears. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>I finally look at her. Through my tears, I can see how worried she is. I wish I could reassure her, but I can\u2019t. \u201cWill you develop my film?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want me to?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cStace, I\u2019m not sure about anything.\u201d</p><p>I am like an autistic with a puzzle. For the rest of my hospital stay, I study the pieces, putting them together in a dozen ways in an attempt to see the whole picture.</p><p>They tell me I didn\u2019t walk away from the crash and I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re lying.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen the newspaper stories\u2014complete with photographs that made me physically ill. Several of the passengers, including Riegert, reported seeing me carried off the plane. As soon as they found my purse and identification, they called Stacey. I may be brain damaged and hallucinatory and drug addled, but I\u2019m not stupid. I can add up the evidence.</p><p>I never walked away from the crash.</p><p>That\u2019s what I know.</p><p>Somehow I have to make it what I believe.</p><p>If I could remember the crash, maybe that would make everything real. But the shrinks who now circle me like sharks in bloody water, think I\u2019ll never remember. \u201cToo traumatic,\u201d they say.</p><p>I tell them \u201cremembering\u201d Daniel and Bobby hurts me more.</p><p>They don\u2019t like that, the brain experts. Whenever I mention my adventure, they make tsk-tsk sounds and shake their heads.</p><p>Only Stacey lets me talk about Bobby and Daniel as if they\u2019re real, and that\u2014the simple act of her silent acceptance\u2014somehow draws us together again. It seems, after all, that I am not the only one who has been changed by my near death. The nurses tell me that Stacey was my champion throughout it all, demanding the best for me, and organizing prayer and candlelight vigils in town.</p><p>Last night, she even slept in my room; this morning, she was up at the crack of dawn, readying my discharge papers.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>Now she is standing by the door. A nurse is next to her, with an empty wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>I could knit a sweater in the time it takes me to get out of bed and into the wheelchair.</p><p>No one seems to notice but me. And then we are off, tooling down the hallway. Everyone I see says: \u201cGood bye, Joy. Good luck.\u201d I mumble thanks and try to look happy about going home.</p><p>Outside, Stacey rolls me over to a brand-new red minivan.</p><p>\u201cNew car, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThom got it for me for Christmas,\u201d she says.</p><p>Thom. It is the first time she\u2019s said his name to me.</p><p>We stare at each other for an uncomfortable moment longer, then she helps me into the passenger seat.</p><p>On the drive home we try to find things to say, but it isn\u2019t easy. Suddenly, it\u2019s as if my ex-husband is in the backseat, scenting the air between us with his aftershave.</p><p>\u201cI got your car from the airport,\u201d Stacey says as she turns onto Mullen Avenue.</p><p>It seems like a year ago that I turned into the long-term parking area. \u201cHow was the tree? Did it catch fire on the drive home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tree was fine. I donated it to the nursing home on Sunset.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right. The tree was only strapped onto my car for a day or so. Not the week I imagined. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Stacey pulls into my driveway and parks. \u201cYou\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>There are cars everywhere, and lights are on all up and down the street, but the neighborhood is strangely silent for late afternoon. For almost ten years I have lived in this house, on this street, and yet, just now, looking at it, I wonder if it ever really was my home. Rather, it was where I passed the time between shifts at the high school and tried to make a failing marriage into something it could never be.</p><p>The Comfort Lodge . . .</p><p>(which doesn\u2019t apparently exist)</p><p>. . . now that\u2019s a home.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there, Joy.</p><p>Stacey comes around to my door and helps me out. She gets me situated on my crutches and together, moving slowly, we make our way around the yard.</p><p>We are at the corner, by the huge, winter-dead lilac tree that was our first investment in the yard, when a crowd of people surge out from behind the house, yelling, \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p><p>I stumble to a halt. Stacey places a hand in the small of my back to steady me.</p><p>There must be two hundred people in front of me; most are holding lit candles, several hold up signs that say \u201cWelcome Home, Joy.\u201d The first person to come forward is Gracie Leon\u2014a girl I suspended last semester for defacing all three copies of To Kill a Mockingbird. \u201cWe prayed for you, Mrs. Candellaro.\u201d</p><p>A young man comes forward next, stands beside Gracie. Willie Schmidt. Seven years ago, he was my fourth period teacher\u2019s assistant. Now he has students of his own at a local high school. \u201cWelcome back,\u201d he says, handing me a beautiful pink box. Inside it are hundreds of cards.</p><p>Mary Moro is next. She\u2019s a junior this year, and head cheerleader. She holds out a Christmas cactus in a white porcelain bowl. \u201cI bought this with my babysitting money, Mrs. Candellaro. Remember when you said the only plant you could keep alive was a cactus?\u201d</p><p>Then I see Bertie and Rayla from work; they stand pressed together like a pair of salt and pepper shakers. Both of them have left their families to be here.</p><p>My throat is so full I can hardly nod. It\u2019s all I can do to whisper, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>They surge toward me, all talking at once.</p><p>We stand in the yard, talking and laughing and sharing the surface connections of our lives. No one mentions the plane crash, but I feel their curiosity; unasked questions hang behind other words. I wonder if and when it will become a thing I can talk about.</p><p>By the time they finally start to leave, night is falling on Madrona Lane. The streetlamps are coming on.</p><p>My sister guides me to my front door and unlocks it.</p><p>My house, on my return, is as silent as it was when I left.</p><p>\u201cI put you in the downstairs bedroom,\u201d Stacey says, and our thoughts veer onto an ugly road. We are both remembering the day I came home to find her in my bed.</p><p>It is not the first time our thoughts have gone here and it won\u2019t be the last. Our recent past is like a speed bump; you slow down and go over it, then drive on your way again.</p><p>\u201cGood thinking,\u201d I say.</p><p>She helps me get settled in the downstairs guest room. When I\u2019m in bed, she brings me several books, a plate of cheese and crackers, a Big Gulp from the local mini mart, the television remote and my wireless laptop. I notice a magazine in with the books. It\u2019s the same Redbook I was reading in the lodge. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty old,\u201d I say, pointing to it.</p><p>Stacey glances at the magazine, then shrugs. \u201cI read it to you in the hospital almost every day. There was a great article in it on refurbishing a log cabin that used to be a bed and breakfast. Remember when you wanted to be an innkeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d is all I can say. No wonder my Comfort Lodge was in need of repair.</p><p>Stacey props my cast onto a pillow, then steps back. \u201cWill you be okay for the night? I could stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your . . . Thom will miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he? That\u2019s quite a turn around.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other; neither of us knows where to go after that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like napalm, the way it comes and goes,\u201d Stacey says.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home to your . . .\u201d Despite my best intentions, I trip up. What do I call him, my ex-husband? Her lover? Boyfriend? What?</p><p>\u201cFianc\u00e9.\u201d She stares at me hard, biting her lip. I know she wants to say just the right thing, as if the perfect words are a bleach that can remove this stain between us.</p><p>The silence lingers, turns awkward. I want to mention her wedding, perhaps even say I\u2019ll be there, but I don\u2019t know if I dare promise such a thing.</p><p>I can see how the quiet between us wounds her. She tries valiantly to smile. \u201cDid you tell Mom about me and Thom, by the way?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s what was on my mind when I was dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were a tattletale.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling at that. Her words take us back to a time when there was no silence between us. Suddenly we\u2019re six and seven again, fighting in the smelly backseat of Mom\u2019s VW bus. \u201cYou\u2019re right. And, yes, I told her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe told me to wake up. It\u2019s good advice.\u201d</p><p>Stacey reaches out, brushes the hair from my eyes. \u201cWhen you were . . . sleeping, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get another chance with you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say except, \u201cI know.\u201d The nurses have told me that her devotion to me was legendary.</p><p>\u201cI was there at the hospital, you know,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom the second we heard. I almost never left.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s what I would have done for her, too. \u201cI missed you, Stace.\u201d</p> <p>She finally smiles. \u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>By the end of my first week at home, I\u2019m ready to scream.</p><p>I spend the better part of my days on pain pills, trying not to move. Everything hurts, but pain is not the worst of it. What I hate most are the nights.</p><p>I lie in bed, staring up at my ceiling, trying to tell myself that the rainforest was a construct of my own mind. Before the plane crash, I was lost and lonely, desperate to want someone and be wanted in return. I can admit it now; losing both my sister and my husband unhinged me somehow. Without them, I was adrift.</p><p>So I made up the man I wanted to love me and the boy I wanted to love.</p><p>In the cold light of day, it makes sense. I was tired of hot, dry Bakersfield; I imagined a magical world of green grass and towering trees and impossible mist.</p> <p>On paper, it pencils out, makes perfect sense in a psych 101 kind of way. At night, however, it\u2019s different.</p><p>Then, the darkness\u2014and my loneliness\u2014just goes on and on and on. For the first time in my life, I can\u2019t read to pass the time. Every hero becomes Daniel; every heartfelt moment makes me sob. Even movies are useless. When I turn on the television I remember Miracle on 34th Street and the Grinch; not to mention the fifteen Winnie-the-Pooh videos we watched.</p><p>God help me, in the darkness, I believe. Over and over again, I try to \u201creturn.\u201d Each attempt and failure diminishes my hope.</p><p>I can\u2019t stand it.</p><p>It\u2019s time for me to either fish or cut bait. I\u2019ve spent too long floating on a drug sea, dreaming of one place, and sitting in another. I need to believe in my rainforest, to find it, or to let it go. It\u2019s a cinch what my shrink would advise. There\u2019s no room in the real world for the kind of fantasy realm I\u2019ve imagined. But I keep thinking of moments\u2014the way Daniel and I said \u201cfate\u201d at the same time; the way our wish on the star was the same. The television broadcast with Stacey. I didn\u2019t hear her broadcast from my coma; I saw it. And there\u2019s the fix-it list Bobby had on Christmas morning. Maybe that was somehow real. If it was, I was there, however impossible that sounds.</p><p>What I need is evidence. And if there\u2019s one thing a librarian can do, it\u2019s research.</p><p>Throwing the covers back, I hobble out of bed, get my crutches and then turn on all the lights. In the garage, I find what I\u2019m looking for: my files. I take several\u2014the Pacific Northwest, Washington, and North American rainforests. Clutching the manila folders to my side, I return to the desk in my living room.</p><p>Beneath a light bright enough to dispel shadows and sharp enough to illuminate the truth, I begin laying out my materials, organizing them into piles. Then I turn on my laptop and search the Web.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t take long to identify the core problem.</p><p>All I know about my dream life is that it took place in a rainforest in Washington State. According to a Googled statistic, the Olympic National Forest is roughly the size of Massachusetts.</p><p>And I am trying to find one\u2014imaginary\u2014lakeside town that probably has a population of less than one thousand people.</p><p>Oh, and let\u2019s not forget that I don\u2019t know the name of the town, or the lake, or Daniel and Bobby\u2019s last name.</p><p>A woman less impressionable might say that if fate exists, it doesn\u2019t want me to find my way back.</p><p>Still, I trudge ahead, unwilling\u2014unable, maybe\u2014to give up. I make my own map, underline possible towns and lakes and call information for each city I can find. There is no listing for a Comfort Fishing Lodge. Then I call realtors. There are two fishing lodges for sale in the area; I\u2019ve gotten e-mail photos of both. Neither is the one I remember.</p><p>Finally, nearly eight hours after I begin my search, I shut my laptop and lay my head on top of it, closing my eyes. By now, the walls of my living room are studded with pieces of paper\u2014maps, photographs, articles. The place looks like a task force command center.</p><p>And none of it helps.</p><p>I don\u2019t know exactly how long I remain there. At some point, I hear a car drive up.</p><p>I glance up, and see Stacey\u2019s van pull into the driveway.</p><p>I grab my crutches and head for the entry.</p><p>At her first knock, I open the door.</p><p>She is on my porch, holding a casserole pan in gloved hands.</p><p>It\u2019s Mom\u2019s chicken divan recipe. Chicken, cheese, mayonnaise, and broccoli. \u201cI guess you forgot about them restarting my heart.\u201d</p><p>Stacey pales. \u201cOh. I didn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding. It looks great. Thanks.\u201d I wobble around and make my way back to the living room.</p><p>Stacey veers into the kitchen, probably puts the casserole in the oven, and then joins me. In the living room, she comes to a dead stop. Her gaze moves from wall to wall, where papers hang in grape-like bunches.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Obsessionville,\u201d I say. There\u2019s no point in trying to explain. I make my halting way to the sofa and sit down, planting my casted foot on the coffee table. \u201cI\u2019m searching for the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you never went to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>Stacey sits in the chair opposite me. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you. Thom says . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not start a conversation like that. It\u2019s your turn to care about what he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been home almost seven days and you haven\u2019t let anyone visit except me. And now . . .\u201d She lifts her hand to indicate the walls. \u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBertie and Rayla have both stopped by.\u201d</p><p>Stacey gives me \u201cThe Look.\u201d \u201cBertie called me because you said you were too tired to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that really it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, my keeper?\u201d I don\u2019t want to explain the inexplicable.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that dream, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I sigh, feeling my defenses crumble. All I can tell her now is the sad truth. \u201cI can\u2019t let go of it. I know it\u2019s crazy\u2014that I\u2019m crazy\u2014but the pictures are so familiar. I know how it smells there and feels there, how the mist floats up from the grass in the morning. How do I know these things? Maybe when you develop my film, I\u2019ll get an answer.\u201d It\u2019s the dream I\u2019ve clung to.</p><p>As I say the words, I see my sister frown. It\u2019s a quick expression, there and gone, but if there\u2019s one thing sisters recognize in each other, it\u2019s a secret being kept. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hiding something from me, and, given that your last big secret was my husband, I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>Stacey stands. Turning away, she walks out of the room. A few moments later she\u2019s back, carrying a manila envelope. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>I take it from her, though if I had two good legs, my instinct is to run. \u201cI won\u2019t like this, will I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Stacey\u2019s voice is soft; that makes me more nervous.</p><p>I open the envelope and find photographs inside. I look up at Stacey, who shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The envelope drops from my grasp. I turn through the pictures. When I get to the few taken in the airport, I gasp. There\u2019s the plane, before the crash, and the crowd of hunters waiting to board, and the interior before takeoff. Riegert, giving his buddy the thumbs up.</p><p>After that, nothing.</p><p>No photos of the lodge or the rainforest or the lake. No spiderwebs dripping with dew, no clusters of old growth trees and the giant ferns at their feet. Just twenty-nine empty gray pictures.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there,\u201d I say slowly, feeling it for the first time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joy,\u201d Stacey says after a moment, \u201cbut you have a real life here. And people who love you. Rayla says students ask about you every day.\u201d</p><p>I can hear my sister talking, but the words are like smoke, drifting past me. All I can think about is the boy who made me promise to stay for Christmas. My heart feels like it\u2019s breaking down the middle; it\u2019s hard to breathe. It takes all my self-control not to cry at the smoky, blank photographs. Still, I know what I\u2019m supposed to say, what she wants to hear. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be fine when I start working again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you miss it?\u2019</p><p>It takes me a minute to hear her. I look up. \u201cMiss what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe library. You used to love it.\u201d</p><p>I know Stacey hears herself say love it; all I hear is used to. \u201cWhat I love doesn\u2019t seem to exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club, little sister.\u201d</p><p>It is amazing how quickly a bone can heal. If only the heart were as durable. A little plaster, two months of bed rest, and voila! your broken heart is mended. I wish it were true.</p><p>By late February, I am moving well again. My headaches are all but gone and my leg is coming along nicely, according to the battalion of doctors who oversee my care. They urge me to consider returning to work, though, to be honest, I have trouble contemplating my future.</p><p>It\u2019s because of the nights.</p><p>Alone in my bed, I can\u2019t control or corral my thoughts. In sleep, I dream about the Comfort Lodge and Daniel and Bobby.</p><p>Even during the stark, bright daylight hours, I have problems. No matter what I\u2019m supposed to be doing, I keep drifting northward in my mind. Everything reminds me of the pseudo-memories I can\u2019t let go of.</p><p>My psychiatrist\u2014the newest member of the post-crash-save-Joy-team tells me that what I\u2019ve experienced is not that uncommon. Apparently lots of head cases are head cases, if you know what I mean.</p><p>My shrink says it\u2019s because I\u2019m not happy with my real life. She thinks I\u2019ve let the accident paralyze me emotionally, and that when I wake up, I\u2019ll quit needing a forest mirage as my ideal.</p><p>I tell her she\u2019s wrong. I was emotionally paralyzed before the crash. This is just same old\u2013same old. The difference is, now I know what I want. I just can\u2019t find it.</p><p>Before the crash, I wanted Thom back.</p><p>Now I\u2019m actually happy he\u2019s gone. I worry for my sister that it\u2019s dangerous to love a man who has already betrayed one wife, but she has made her choice, and truthfully, at his heart, Thom is a good man. I can only hope he\u2019ll be a good husband to my sister.</p><p>I\u2019m so deep in thought, I\u2019m surprised when I hear my doorbell ring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance at the clock. It\u2019s twelve-fifteen. As usual, she\u2019s right on time with my lunch. \u201cCome in,\u201d I say, getting to my feet, reaching for the crutches.</p><p>Stacey comes in, carrying a stack of magazines and videos. They have become her peace offerings, these things she collects for me, her way of saying she doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy, even though I\u2019m sure she does. \u201cThese are the newest Sunset magazines\u2014two have articles on rainforest getaways\u2014four local Sunday newspapers, and two movies shot up there. Harry and the Hendersons, about a Sasquatch, and Double Jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>We both know how much it means to me, these pointless, silly gifts; we also know it won\u2019t do any good. I\u2019m not going to suddenly \u201csee\u201d where I\u2019ve imagined. The walls of my downstairs are now entirely covered with maps and photographs. None of the butter yellow walls beneath can be seen.</p><p>I take the pile of things from Stacey, knowing I will watch or read each item carefully. Knowing, too, that all I\u2019ll find are images that strike a chord but create no real memory.</p> <p>While Stacey puts things away in the kitchen, I go into my living room and sit down on the sofa. In the new Sunset magazine, I see a photograph of the Hoh rainforest that makes me feel homesick for a place that doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cJoy?\u201d</p><p>I look up to see Stacey holding a tray of croissant sandwiches. It isn\u2019t until I see the look on her face that I realize I\u2019m crying.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t bring you this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need them,\u201d I hear the panicked edge in my voice.</p> <p>So does she. She sets the tray down on the coffee table. \u201cYou have to come into the real world.\u201d Her voice is tentative; I know she\u2019s wanted to say this for a long time, but has been afraid. We are not yet the sisters we once were, who could say anything to each other. She plucks up a sandwich, sets it on a napkin and sits across from me.</p><p>\u201cThe real world,\u201d I say softly, putting the magazine aside. Getting up, I make my awkward way to the window. There I stand on my good leg, staring out at the houses across the street. Now, in the winter, the lawns are dead and brown, as are the trees. There hasn\u2019t been a leaf on the road for months. Everything on the block is gray or brown, it seems, and the pale sunlight only manages to dull it all. \u201cLast night I dreamt I was stuck right here,\u201d I say, without turning to look at Stacey. \u201cWatching life pass me by. In my dream, I could see your house. Your lights were always on; there were kids in your yard. One of them was a quiet, watchful girl who always waited her turn. You named her Joy. And here I was, stuck. Wrinkling like a dying grape, going gray, wanting.\u201d I take a deep breath and turn around to face her. There\u2019s something I need to tell her; something I probably should have admitted before. \u201cYou weren\u2019t the only reason I got on that plane. Most of it, maybe, but not all. I was so tired of who I\u2019d become.\u201d</p><p>Stacey doesn\u2019t respond to that. I\u2019m not surprised. She doesn\u2019t know what to say, and she doesn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing. Our relationship is fragile; we both handle it like hot glass.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t understand,\u201d I finally say. How could she? My sister never let anything pass her by. She\u2019s never been a spectator.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d She stares at me as if I am a science exhibit under glass. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know about wanting more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a cheerleader, for gosh sake, and homecoming queen. And now you\u2019re pregnant and in love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSixteen years ago I was a cheerleader, Joy. When you went off to college, I stayed in Bakersfield and worked dead-end jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you met Chris . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t just break my heart, he shattered it, remember?\u201d She sighs. \u201cI used to watch your life and feel like such a failure. You came home from college in love with Thom and had the perfect wedding and then got the great job at the high school. You succeeded at everything you tried. I hated always being in your shadow.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cIs that why you moved away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought a big city would help, but in Sacramento I felt even more lost. It was too busy for me. So I came back here and used my divorce settlement to buy a house, but I still couldn\u2019t manage to get a decent job. It\u2019s tough when you\u2019re twenty-eight years old with no husband and no education\u2014especially when your sister seems to have it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell her it\u2019s not true, but we\u2019re well past the lying-to-each-other stage. The last year has given us that, at least. I glance out the window; anything is better than looking at her. \u201cI know you did, but I was barely hanging on. Thom and I were fighting like crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI came over one day to talk to you, and found him at home.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s how it had begun. I\u2019d wanted to know, though I never would have asked. Now that she\u2019s planted the words, I see them grow: how they were friends first, my sister and my husband, commiserating about their disappointed lives, then commiserating about me, then finding solace in each other.</p><p>\u201cIt took him a long time to tell me how unhappy he was, but once he did . . .\u201d</p><p>I hold up my hand. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I know about being lost, Joy,\u201d she says instead. \u201cCan you imagine how it feels to hurt the one person you love most in the world? To break your sister\u2019s heart and know you can never apologize enough?\u201d</p><p>This time when I look at my sister I see a woman I\u2019ve never met, one who\u2019s been through hard times\u2014is still going through them, perhaps\u2014and lives with the pain of her own bad choices. She knows about fading; maybe every woman of a certain age does, especially in quiet towns like this one where the sun can be so hot.</p><p>Not like the rainforest.</p><p>There, in that moist green and blue world, there is no drying up of a woman\u2019s spirit.</p><p>I push that thought away. No good can come of it. I turn back to Stacey. This is what matters. Us. Whatever is unreal about who I met or where I\u2019ve been, it\u2019s all led me back to this moment with my sister. The beginning. \u201cSo,\u201d I say softly, \u201chow\u2019s the pregnancy going?\u201d</p><p>I hear her surprise; she takes a thin breath and battles a sudden smile. I can\u2019t help wondering how long she\u2019s been waiting for me to ask. \u201cGood. The doctors say everything is normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think it\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>A niece to shop for; dress up like a little doll . . . love. \u201cMom would have gone nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought we\u2019d name her Elizabeth Sharon.\u201d</p><p>That hits me hard. \u201cYeah. She\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>We fall silent again. I want to say more, make a sweet, innocuous comment about the baby, but I\u2019ve lost my voice. Selfishly, I am caught in my own sense of loss; I take a deep breath and try to let it go, but it\u2019s difficult. I keep remembering my dream, where I was frozen in this spot, the aging aunt, watching life pass her by.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Stacey says after the pause.</p><p>I look at her, wondering if that\u2019s accurate. Can you lose something you never really had? \u201cI\u2019m scared, Stace. It\u2019s like . . . I don\u2019t know what to hang on to. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, frowning. Just when I expect an answer, she leaves the room. I hear her making a phone call in the kitchen. Then she returns and says, \u201cCome on. I\u2019m taking you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care? It\u2019s out of this house. Get your purse.\u201d</p><p>To be honest, I\u2019m thankful for the distraction. I follow her out to the minivan.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, we pull up to our destination.</p><p>The high school is bathed in lemony sunlight. Bright purple crocuses cover the dry brown ground around the flagpole, reminding me that spring is on its way.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>It is a question I\u2019ve come to hate. To answer it requires either a lie or a truth that no one\u2014me included\u2014wants to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>Stacey says something I can\u2019t quite hear, then gets out of the van and slams the door.</p><p>I get out of the minivan and stand on the sidewalk, leaning heavily on my crutches. Gripping their padded handles, I step-swing-step-swing down the wide cement courtyard toward the administrative building.</p><p>The Quad is surprisingly quiet today, no kids skipping classes to play hacky sack in the sunshine or looking for a place to kiss or smoke.</p><p>Stacey runs ahead to the building and opens the door for me. Familiar flyers\u2014they\u2019re the same ones year after year\u2014clutter the bulletin boards in the hallway. They\u2019re looking for student leaders, and singers for this year\u2019s spring musical, and volunteers willing to decorate for the upcoming dance.</p><p>As I approach the main entrance, the bell rings. Within seconds, the Quad is crowded with kids laughing and talking.</p><p>When they see me, a roar of recognition goes up. Suddenly I\u2019m Mick Jagger on stage. A star. Everyone talks to me at once, crowding in close.</p><p>Stacey squeezes my arm. \u201cThis,\u201d she whispers in my ear, \u201cis your real life.\u201d</p><p>It takes us the entire ten minutes of the class break to work our way through the crowd and to the main office, where we\u2019re overwhelmed again. Finally, when I\u2019ve hugged at least one hundred people and been welcomed back by even more, we make our way down the hall to the library.</p><p>I\u2019m struggling with my crutches at the turnstile, when I hear Rayla\u2019s throaty laughter and scratchy, I-used-to-be-a-Camel-unfiltered-smoker\u2019s voice. \u201cWell, it\u2019s about darn time.\u201d</p><p>I push through the shiny metal barrier and find her standing at the checkout desk, with a skyscraper of books beside her elbow. \u201cThis is a big job for one woman,\u201d she says with a toothy grin.</p><p>I laugh at that. We both know that either of us could easily do it alone. It is a secret we keep from the administration. \u201cNow, Rayla, you know you love bossing the kids around when I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>She comes around the desk, her skirt flowing, her silver bracelets tinkling, and enfolds me in a fierce hug that smells of hairspray and Tabu perfume. \u201cWe missed you, kiddo,\u201d she says.</p><p>I draw back, look down at her. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d And it\u2019s true.</p><p>For the next half hour, we walk around the library, talking about ordinary things\u2014budget cuts, contract negotiations, recent acquisitions, and Rayla\u2019s upcoming spring break trip to Reno.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says at last. \u201cWhen can we expect you back?\u201d</p><p>It is the question I\u2019ve been dreading. Back. By definition, it\u2019s a return to what was.</p><p>I take a deep breath, knowing there is only one acceptable answer, only one sane one.</p><p>Stacey is watching me closely. So is Rayla. They both know. Not everything, perhaps, not all the reasons for my disquiet and my disappointment, but enough.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d I say, trying to smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On the drive home, Stacey and I are quiet.</p><p>I feel like Dorothy, back in Kansas, a black-and-white girl in a black-and-white world, with memories in color.</p><p>Beside me Stacey sings along to some catchy, generic song from one of the American Idol runners-up.</p><p>Then it\u2019s Bruce Springsteen, singing \u201cBaby, I Was Born to Run.\u201d</p> <p>Memory overwhelms me. I close my eyes, remembering.</p><p>I\u2019m in a red truck, bouncing down a country road, singing along to the radio. I can feel Bobby beside me, hear him laughing.</p><p>When I open my eyes\u2014unable to take any more\u2014I see the airport exit.</p><p>It can\u2019t be accidental. Stacey never goes home this way.</p><p>And I think: Dorothy had to click her heels together three times and say, \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home.\u201d Even magic requires something.</p> <p>Maybe I need to quit waiting for proof and go in search of Hope, like I did before. \u201cTurn here, Stacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never there.\u201d I know how much she hates to say those words to me. It\u2019s in her voice. \u201cYou saw your real life at the high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, she follows the exit to the airport and pulls up outside the America West ticket counter. \u201cThis is crazy, Joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I grab my purse and the crutches from the backseat, and I\u2019m off, hobbling into the terminal. At the counter, I find a beautiful dark-haired woman in a blue and white uniform. Her nametag identifies her as Donna Farnham.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want a ticket to Seattle on the next flight.\u201d</p><p>The ticket agent looks to her computer screen, types quickly on the keys, then looks up at me. \u201cThere\u2019s a flight leaving in forty minutes. The next one is tomorrow afternoon. Same time.\u201d</p><p>I reach into my purse for my wallet. What\u2019s a credit card for if not unnecessary expenditures? \u201cI\u2019ll take a ticket for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we have left is first class.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even ask how much. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>By the time I\u2019ve made it through the security line and find my way to the gate, my hands are sweating and my heart is hammering.</p><p>I try to think of Daniel and Bobby, try to believe I can make the magic strike again. I\u2019m Dorothy. There\u2019s no place like home, I tell myself, but my confidence is draining fast, being pummeled by the bright fluorescent lights overhead. In this light, I can\u2019t help seeing clearly.</p><p>When they call my flight, I take a step forward.</p> <p>Then I see the plane.</p><p>Images charge me; hit me so hard I almost fall down. I close my eyes and try to breathe, but that\u2019s no help. In the darkness, I\u2019m on the plane again, going down. Flames are all around me . . . I smell the stink of fuel . . . and hear the screams. I\u2019m falling, tumbling, and hitting . . . being carried out of the wreckage. I can see it all: my face covered with blood; my arm hanging down from the gurney; the bone poking up through my torn, bloody jeans. The plane exploding behind me.</p><p>The shaking starts in my fingers and radiates outward until I can hardly hold onto my crutches. My palms are slick with sweat; I can\u2019t swallow. Tears stream down my cheeks and blur my vision. Several people ask if I\u2019m okay. I nod and push them away. If I could run, I would, but I\u2019m as broken outside right now as I feel within, so I leave slowly, limping away from Hope. I\u2019d crawl if I had to.</p><p>When I finally emerge from the terminal and step out into the bright, sunlit day, I see my sister.</p><p>She\u2019s standing in front of her minivan, by the passenger door.</p><p>I go to her, clutching my ticket. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>She puts her arms around me, holds me, and lets me cry.</p><p>F or the next three nights, every time I go to sleep, I relive the crash. Over and over again, I wake up screaming and drenched in sweat, lying in the blackness of my own guest bedroom. There are no memories of the clearing left, of my mom telling me to wake up, or of Bobby showing me to my room.</p><p>By the fourth night, I get it. I may not be the brightest bulb on the porch, but I can figure out what message my subconscious is sending: You were on the plane, stupid.</p><p>You never walked away.</p><p>I have been like an anthropologist, looking in darkness for evidence of a lost civilization. Maps, photographs, drawings, they all decorate the walls of my house.</p><p>But now, finally, I see the light.</p><p>I am the one who has been lost, and it\u2019s time to let go.</p><p>This is the message of my nightmares: Let go and move on or cling to fantasy and fall. My own mind has taught me the lesson that a battalion of shrinks could not. Too long has my heart been living outside my body\u2014outside the state of California and all semblance of reality.</p><p>The next morning, I waken feeling bruised by nightmares, and I know what I must do. I totter out of bed; make a big pot of coffee and a resolution.</p><p>Inch by inch, I clear my walls. I start with the photographs of the Comfort Lodge and the map of the Olympic Peninsula. I am halfway done when my doorbell rings. I stand back, looking at my so-called progress. The entire east wall of my living room is littered with pin holes.</p><p>Tiny empty spaces where something used to be.</p><p>This is precisely the kind of thought I\u2019ve been trying to avoid. When my doorbell rings again, I lunge for my crutches and head for the entry.</p><p>There, I open the door and find Stacey frowning at me.</p><p>\u201cYou look like crap.\u201d</p><p>That hurts. \u201cWell . . . you\u2019re fat.\u201d I spin on my left crutch and step-swing into my guest room.</p><p>Although I can\u2019t hear footsteps on the carpet, I know she\u2019s following me. I go to the wall and tear down a picture of Mount Olympus.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting rid of it all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy . . .\u201d</p><p>Something in her voice gets to me. I turn around finally, face her. \u201cI\u2019m losing it.\u201d</p><p>Stacey sits down on my bed, and then pats a place beside her.</p><p>I hop to the bed and sit down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep. Nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the crash?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cMy shrink said I brought it on by going to the airport. Like I needed to hear it was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Daniel and the boy?\u201d</p><p>I can hear the question in her voice, the wondering if she should mention the obvious. Actually, I appreciate it. There will come a time\u2014soon, I think\u2014when I won\u2019t want to hear their names anymore. \u201cI haven\u2019t dreamt about them since you took me to the high school. And when I think about them, it\u2019s . . . blurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean, you think? Are you getting well?\u201d</p><p>I look down at my hands. I\u2019ve thought a lot about this. A woman who can\u2019t sleep has plenty of time to contemplate. \u201cI think . . .\u201d I can\u2019t say it out loud.</p><p>Stacey puts her hand on mine.</p><p>Her touch steadies me. I look up. Tears burn my eyes, turn her face into a Monet painting. I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t want this moment to be in focus. \u201cWhen I first woke up, I was sure it was all real. Daniel. Bobby. The Comfort Lodge. The rainforest. Then I heard the facts, and I knew it wasn\u2019t real, but still I believed. I didn\u2019t know how to stop. I wanted it all so much. I felt so alive there, so needed and wanted, and here . . .\u201d I shrug. \u201cI kept thinking: If only I could find my way back to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, release it slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve Googled it all, and called information, and read about every town near or in the Olympic rainforest. My town doesn\u2019t exist, neither does the lodge. Therefore, it makes sense that Daniel and Bobby are imaginary, too. It was all my weird way of dealing with the pain and horror of the crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like your shrink talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt two hundred bucks an hour, I listen to her.\u201d I smile, but the joke falls flat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me logic. I want emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t handle emotion anymore. It\u2019s killing me. I\u2019m too old to believe in magic and fate and destiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was the drugs, in other words, and your own subconscious.\u201d</p><p>I frown. That\u2019s not quite right. It\u2019s important to me that I get all of this absolutely right. Otherwise I\u2019ll never be able to get past it. \u201cI think Daniel and Bobby were . . . metaphors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI flunked out of tech school, remember? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they represent the love that could be out there for me\u2014if I\u2019m bold enough to change my life.\u201d I take a deep breath and say: \u201cThe truth is, Stace, I\u2019m tired of being alone. I want love, passion, and children. All of it.\u201d</p><p>Stacey is quiet for a long time, and then says, \u201cI can understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you deserve it,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>I glance around my walls, staring at the pattern of tack holes between the few remaining clippings. Soon, this room will be back to normal; all evidence of my impossible journey will be gone. What will I dream about then?</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Stacey says at last. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p><p>She ushers me out to the minivan. On the long drive to the doctor\u2019s office, we talk about little things, nothing that matters.</p><p>Once there, it takes less than an hour to cut off my cast, take an X-ray, and pronounce me healed. My orthopedist, Dr. John Turner, says, \u201cThe break has healed beautifully. As well as we could have hoped. And Mark says the physical therapy is going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHow much more will she need?\u201d Stacey asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cWe\u2019ll just take it day by day, okay? How are the headaches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d I say. Mostly, it\u2019s true. The whiplash symptoms are abating slowly.</p><p>The appointment is winding down, edging toward goodbye, when there\u2019s a knock at the door. A woman comes into the examining room; she\u2019s carrying a white plastic bag. \u201cDoctor?\u201d</p><p>He looks at her. \u201cYes, Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are Ms. Candellaro\u2019s clothes. The ones they cut off her after the crash. We would have thrown them away, but there were some personal items in the pockets.\u201d</p><p>Something about that hits me hard. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s cut off or crash. All I know is I can\u2019t smile or move.</p><p>Stacey takes the bag. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still vaguely disconcerted as we walk through the parking lot. I\u2019m using a cane for balance, though honestly, I think it\u2019s emotional, a phantom feeling of less than wholeness. In truth, my once-broken bone feels strong.</p><p>All the way home, I stare at the bag.</p><p>Stacey pulls into my driveway and parks. \u201cAre you</p><p>okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be,\u201d I say, grabbing the bag.</p><p>\u201cI could take that for you. Get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d How can I tell her I\u2019m not ready to get rid of it yet? Instead of speaking, I smile and nod and get out of the minivan.</p><p>Leaning heavily on the cane, I make my way up to the front door. Behind me, I hear Stacey drive away.</p><p>Inside the house, it\u2019s too quiet.</p><p>I\u2019ve forgotten to leave the stereo on. I immediately go to the radio and push the button. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bruce Springsteen is singing. \u201cBaby, I Was Born to Run.\u201d I change stations, find a nice, soothing Elton John ballad.</p><p>No more dreams for me. I toss the bag of clothes on top of my bureau and go back to work, stripping the pictures from my wall. When I\u2019m finished, and my butter yellow walls are a desert of tiny gray pin holes, I cram everything into grocery bags and take them out to the garbage can in my garage.</p><p>Everything goes in the trash.</p><p>A ticket to Seattle.</p> <p>A white bag full of ruined clothes.</p><p>For the next week, these two items\u2014along with the memories they represent\u2014sit on my dresser.</p><p>I look at them every time I walk past, but I don\u2019t touch.</p><p>No way.</p><p>Until my memories of Daniel and Bobby have faded completely, I will ignore the ticket and the bag. By the time I finally reach for them, they will be cold, their power stripped by the passage of days. Someday I will pay the change fee and use my first-class ticket to fly to some other destination. Maybe Florida or Hawaii.</p> <p>I am studiously ignoring the bag when the phone rings.</p><p>I answer quickly, turning my back on my dresser. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Candellaro?\u201d</p><p>I wince at the name and all that it implies. Perhaps, my summer project will be to return to my maiden name. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Ann Morford. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say to my realtor. \u201cYou want to renew the listing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m calling with good news. We have an offer on your house. Two hundred ninety two thousand five hundred dollars. I guess when you survived the crash, your house changed from bad luck to good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I sit on my bed, stunned.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to make a counter offer? See if they\u2019ll come up to full price?\u201d</p><p>It takes less than ten seconds to make up my mind. I know a second chance when I see one. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll take the deal.\u201d</p><p>The realtor and I talk for a few more minutes about details. Earnest monies and closing dates and the like. I tell her I can be out of this house by Friday if they\u2019d like, and I mean it. At the realization that I finally can leave, I\u2019m desperate to get going. She faxes me the paperwork, which I sign immediately and re-send.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019m done with that, I head for the kitchen to pour myself a celebratory glass of wine. I don\u2019t make it past my dresser, though.</p><p>This time, I\u2019m caught. The sale of my house and the prospect of moving has changed things somehow. I\u2019m finally moving, changing my direction. The idea of it makes me feel indestructible.</p><p>I grab the bag and carry it to the bed where I sit, staring down at it. Then, very slowly, I open it.</p> <p>The first thing I see is my left shoe. Just the one. I pick it up. The black-and-white Keds tennis shoe is in perfect condition. No stains or rips or mud.</p><p>My sweater has a few dark stains that I know could be either mud or blood or a mixture of both. It isn\u2019t ruined, though. A normal person, looking at this sweater would never guess its history. There\u2019s something oddly comforting in that.</p><p>Then I pull out my jeans.</p><p>The right leg has been cut and ripped from hem to waist. Dried blood makes the material stiff and discolored.</p><p>I reach into the front left pocket and pull out a wadded up Von\u2019s grocery store receipt, an airport parking stub, and seven dollars in cash. In two back pockets I find some spare change and a paper clip. Exactly the things I expected to find.</p><p>In the other front pocket, I feel something odd. I reach in farther, find something cold and hard. I pull it out and stare down at my hand.</p><p>In my palm is a small, white arrowhead.</p><p>I close my eyes and count to ten. When I look down again, the arrowhead is still there.</p><p>It can\u2019t be. You know it can\u2019t.</p><p>You didn\u2019t walk away from the crash.</p><p>Yet I\u2019m holding this arrowhead. With everything I am, everything I think and feel, I believe this.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019ve believed lots of crazy things . . .</p><p>I walk over to my bathroom and hold my hand up to the mirror.</p><p>There it is: small and white against my palm, like the tip of a Christmas tree.</p><p>I need help. Closing my hand tightly around the arrowhead, I head out of my room. As I pass the bureau, I see the airline ticket and glance at my clock. The daily flight to Seattle leaves in just under three hours.</p><p>What if?</p><p>Once again those two small words infuse my world with hope and possibility. I can\u2019t push them away, can\u2019t stop the swell of longing this time.</p><p>Shoving the ticket in my purse, I leave the house that already feels as if it belongs to someone else and go to my garage, where I limp past the file cabinets of my dreams and get into my Volvo. Behind me, the door lifts open.</p><p>Before I start the car, I look down at the thing in my hand.</p><p>It\u2019s still there.</p><p>Slowly, keeping my foot on the brake, I back out of my garage and down the driveway. All the way to my sister\u2019s house, I clutch the arrowhead and pray it\u2019s real.</p><p>I don\u2019t think my fragile mind can handle another delusion.</p><p>Still praying, I park in Stacey\u2019s driveway, grab my cane, and go to the front door, where I ring the bell repeatedly.</p><p>It isn\u2019t until I hear footsteps that I remember who else lives here and think: This could be bad.</p><p>Thom answers.</p><p>I stare at him, this man who held my heart for so many years and slept beside me and sometimes remembered to kiss me good night. It is the first time in months I\u2019ve been this close to him, and I feel . . .</p><p>Nostalgic and nothing more. Here is my past, my youth, staring down at me. He looks remarkably like he did on the night I met him, all those years ago. Back when we were kids.</p><p>\u201cHey, Thom,\u201d I say, surprised at how easy it now is to say his name.</p><p>\u201cJoy.\u201d His normally strong voice is a whisper. I can see him wondering what to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny how things work out,\u201d I say, giving him time to think.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised by how deeply his words affect me. I hadn\u2019t known until just now that I needed to hear them. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>After that, silence falls between us. Neither knows where our words should go. We stare at each other; he looks as sad as I feel. Finally, he says, \u201cIs Stacey expecting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He glances toward the stairs and yells, \u201cStace. Your sister\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Stacey comes down the stairs, looking panicked. She looks worriedly at Thom, then turns to me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better than okay, actually.\u201d I grab her sleeve and pull her into the hallway. I should wait for more privacy, maybe take her to a room, but I\u2019m too nervous and excited to be sensible. \u201cI found this in the pants I was wearing on the plane.\u201d I lift my hand and slowly unfurl my fingers.</p><p>Stacey stares down at my palm.</p><p>I can see it as plain as day\u2014a small white arrowhead.</p><p>Please . . . I don\u2019t even know how to finish my prayer. I just know that if my hand is empty, I\u2019m lost. I\u2019ll need\u2014as they say\u2014a long vacation in a rubber room. It takes every scrap of courage I possess to ask her: \u201cDo you see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rock?\u201d</p><p>White hot wonder suffuses me; with it, I can see how cold and empty I was before. \u201cYou see it,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s really there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an arrowhead, I think. What does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I\u2019m going north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I, but I\u2019m using my plane ticket.\u201d</p><p>That stops her. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred percent.\u201d</p><p>I see how her face creases at that, how her eyes fill with fear and worry. It\u2019s the crash. Like me, she\u2019ll battle those memories for a long time. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d I say gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>I touch her arm. \u201cI know it sounds crazy, but I think I need to do it just like I did before. Alone. Looking for hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving you to the airport, then. Don\u2019t even think about arguing with me about it.\u201d She runs past me and goes upstairs. I can hear her moving down the hallway overhead. I return to the living room, where Thom is waiting. We stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cTake good care of her,\u201d I say at last. \u201cShe really loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her, too, Joy.\u201d I hear the throatiness in his voice and know he means it.</p><p>I feel a pinch at that, a phantom pain, but it\u2019s gone quickly. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Stacey reappears. Grabbing her keys from the copper bowl on the entry table, she kisses Thom good-bye, then leads the way to the garage. While she\u2019s starting the van, I get my purse and the ticket. Then I climb into the passenger seat and slam the door shut.</p><p>My sister looks at me. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. We\u2019re off.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-five minutes later, we are at the airport. We pull up to the curb and park, then get out of the minivan.</p><p>On the sidewalk, she pulls me into her arms and holds me so fiercely I can hardly breathe. \u201cDon\u2019t you vanish on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you when I get there,\u201d I promise.</p><p>\u201cWherever there is.\u201d Stacey draws back. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I disappear? I have a wedding to go to in June.\u201d</p><p>Stacey draws in a sharp breath. \u201cYou\u2019ll come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sisters,\u201d I say simply.</p><p>I can see the impact of my words. Stacey smiles, but its watery and weak. \u201cI love you, Joy.\u201d</p><p>And I know then: no matter what I find or don\u2019t find in Washington State, I will always have a place where I belong. It has taken us a long time, but Stacey and I have finally returned to the beginning. We\u2019re sisters again, two little girls in the back of a hot VW bus, experiencing our lives through each other, holding hands when we\u2019re scared.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Stace.\u201d</p><p>It takes almost forty minutes to get to my gate, and then another twenty minutes before they call my flight.</p><p>I get in to line.</p><p>To my left, through the dirty bank of windows, I see my plane.</p><p>Can I do it? Suddenly, I don\u2019t know. I can feel my heart beat and the sweat popping out on my forehead.</p><p>I reach into my pocket, coil my fingers around the arrowhead.</p><p>Promise you\u2019ll come back, Joy.</p><p>It\u2019s crazy.</p><p>Head injury insane.</p><p>But I believe.</p><p>It\u2019s that simple, really.</p><p>Crazy or not, I believe.</p><p>Breathing carefully, moving slowly, I enter the aircraft and go to seat 2A.</p><p>There, I pull the seat belt tightly across my lap and check where the exit row is.</p><p>Then I pray.</p><p>I scream when we touch down in Seattle. The sound horrifies me, as does the obvious disapproval of my fellow passengers and the flight attendants, but I can\u2019t contain my fear until we\u2019ve landed.</p><p>I am still shaking as I follow the crowd of my fellow passengers off the airplane and through the busy beige bowels of SeaTac airport. Silvery fish inlaid in the tile lead me to the baggage claim area, where I rent a sensible car and get a map of western Washington.</p><p>Outside, I finally see the famous landmarks that have become so familiar. The distant snow-capped mountains and bright blue waters of Puget Sound. Mount Rainier rises out of the mist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have to remind myself forcibly that I\u2019ve never been here. I have done so much research on the area I could have a Ph.D.</p><p>Bumper-to-bumper traffic takes me to Tacoma, a city that is low and gray and seems to huddle beneath a layer of ominous clouds.</p><p>Olympia, the state capitol, is unexpectedly rural from the highway. Every now and then I see an official looking building, with a spire or a rotunda or columns, hidden in a thicket of trees.</p><p>By the town called Cosmopolis (wildly inappropriately named, I might add), I am in a different world altogether, where huge stacks pump noxious smoke into the sky, and peeled logs clog the waterways. Here, at the mouth of Grays Harbor, the economy is obviously based on timber and the sea, and both industries seem faded or failing. Houses are run-down, shops are closed up, the streets of the various downtowns are empty of commerce and people.</p> <p>At Aberdeen, I turn inland onto old Highway 101, which promises to take me to Queets, Forks, Humptulips, Mystic, and Rain Valley.</p><p>This is it. If my dream is real, I\u2019ll find it on this road, the only one that man has built between the mighty trees of the rainforest and the gray swell of the Pacific.</p><p>I pull off the road and park, suddenly afraid.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip, Joy,\u201d I say out loud, trying to use my best librarian\u2019s voice, but I am like one of my own students\u2014unconvinced. With shaking hands, I open my map.</p><p>The town names taunt me. Which one of them is \u201cmy\u201d town? Or will they all be unfamiliar? Am I looking for Daniel and Bobby and a lodge by a silver lake or was that all just a promise, a signpost to a future that hasn\u2019t begun yet? Am I supposed to find a man like Daniel? Is Bobby the son I may someday have?</p> <p>It overwhelms me, that thought, leaves me shaken. How will I know what I\u2019m looking for? I reach for my cell phone and call my sister, who answers on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Joy, it\u2019s about time. I have no fingernails left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had none to start with.\u201d I stare out the windshield at the empty road. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to go, Stace. It all looks . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath.\u201d</p><p>I do.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p> <p>I draw in a deep, calming second breath and release it.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she goes on, \u201cwhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA logging town on the coast. About an hour from the start of the National Park. What if I don\u2019t find this place I\u2019m looking for?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a crackling pause before my sister says, \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you do.\u201d</p><p>Her words sink in and settle. They give me something to cling to, remind me that though I may be crazy, I\u2019m not alone. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sitting by the phone, you understand that, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your first stop?\u201d</p><p>I glance down at the map. \u201cAmanda Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds promising.\u201d</p><p>It rings absolutely no bells in my head, but then again, my head is clearly unreliable. \u201cYeah. Talk to you later. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>I hang up, return to the road and drive north.</p><p>As I near the start of the Olympic National Forest, the view changes. Here, the landscape is unexpectedly shorn of trees. The area along the highway has been logged and replanted, but in the distance, I can see the white-capped peak of Mount Olympus rising into the gray sky.</p><p>There are hardly any mailboxes along the road, and the few homes I see are mobile or manufactured, set back on clear-cut lots with no hint of landscaping. Perhaps this place can\u2019t be clipped and claimed and domesticated; it can only be taken by force and held onto by luck.</p><p>Amanda Park is a quaint town on the shores of Lake Quinalt.</p><p>Neither of which I recognize. I drive up and down the streets but nothing is familiar, so I return to the highway and continue north.</p><p>A sign welcomes me to Queets. I follow the old, poorly maintained road toward the town and through it. Nothing is familiar.</p><p>Back out on the highway, I take a sharp turn to the right, and there is the Pacific Ocean. Endless gray water, dappled by a sprinkling of rain; white, roaring waves. I pull off to the side of the road again and get out.</p><p>The driftwood is exactly as I remember it. So are the wind-sculpted trees. Only the sand is different. On my beach night, I stood in ankle-deep California pale gold sand to dance with Daniel.</p><p>In reality, the sand, like the sky and the sea today, is a shade of gray.</p><p>The entire coast is a riotous band of emerald green\u2014huge bushes and stunted trees and mammoth ferns. I recall from my reading that it is the longest wilderness coast left in the world. Then, I was captured by the word \u201ccoast.\u201d Now, standing here, I see the word that matters is \u201cwilderness.\u201d</p><p>As I get back into my car and drive back onto 101, I am tangled in my own emotions. Amazed by the parts of my dream that were accurate, and heartened by them, and disturbed by the pieces that were wrong.</p><p>Several more towns welcome and disappoint me. Though the landscapes are familiar, none of the towns are the one of my dreams.</p><p>As I leave the wild gray shores of the Pacific and head inland again, the landscape becomes wilder and more primitive. Here, the trees are gigantic and straight, blocking out most of the sunlight. Mist clings to the old asphalt and gives everything a mystical, otherworldly feel. I drive through town after town and find nothing that speaks to me. By late afternoon, as the golden sun sets into a cache of thick, black shadows along the roadside, my faith is beginning to fade, too.</p><p>Then I come to a sign made of sculpted metal that welcomes me to Rain Valley.</p><p>Rain Valley.</p><p>My foot eases off the accelerator. There\u2019s a nervous flutter in my stomach that I haven\u2019t felt before.</p><p>I coast forward. In a way I\u2019m moving against my will now, being drawn forward.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid to believe I may have found my town . . . and more afraid that I\u2019ll be wrong again. There are only a few more turns left, here in the deep woods, and only Mystic and Rain Valley are near lakes.</p><p>I turn onto Cates Avenue and roll into Rain Valley.</p><p>In the middle of the road, I hit my brakes.</p><p>It\u2019s \u201cmy\u201d town.</p><p>And it isn\u2019t.</p><p>I pull over to the curb and get out of the car. I can feel the moisture in the air, hear it drop from leaves and boughs and plunk into potholes in the road, but it isn\u2019t really raining. By the time I reach the sidewalk, the sun is breaking through the clouds, gilding the grassy lawn. Dew sparkles on the green carpet.</p><p>I feel as if I\u2019m in a Twilight Zone episode. The town\u2014this town\u2014is the funhouse mirror version of my remembered town. There is a park in the center of it\u2014but it\u2019s nothing like I imagined. There\u2019s a gazebo in the center of the park also, its stanchions twined by wisteria that is moments away from blooming. Concrete benches and fountains are everywhere. Off to the left is a covered barbeque area surrounded by picnic tables. A shallow wading pond catches the slivers of sunlight greedily; its rippling surface seems to catch fire in streaks.</p><p>Leaning on my cane, I walk across the spongy grass to the main street of town.</p><p>My town was comprised of wooden buildings with big windows and cutesy names like the Wizard of Paws pet store, the Hair Apparent beauty salon, and The Dew Drop In diner.</p><p>I stop in front of Lulu\u2019s hair salon. To my left is the Raindrop diner.</p><p>Only the ice-cream shop is exactly as I imagined it. And the church.</p><p>My version is so close that I feel weak in the knees, and so different that I am sick to my stomach.</p><p>Was I here or wasn\u2019t I?</p><p>Am I crazy? Brain damaged?</p><p>Just as I imagined, the town is a sparkling jewel set against a backdrop of the endless Olympic forest. One million acres of trees and mountains and wilderness, without a road to drive through it. The street lamps hold hanging baskets now, their sides thick with brown vines and winter-dead geraniums. A few hardy pansies show their colorful faces.</p><p>I walk into the diner first. There is no wall of pamphlets, no man drinking coffee at the bar. There is no bar.</p><p>An older woman with a Lucille Ball\u2013red beehive hustles toward me, smiling. \u201cWelcome to the Raindrop. What can I do yah for?\u201d She hands me a plastic menu.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m looking for the Comfort Fishing Lodge.\u201d</p><p>The woman stops and frowns, her heavily made-up eyes almost close completely. \u201cHoney, I\u2019ve lived here for forty years. There ain\u2019t no such place. But old Erv Egin, he\u2019ll give you a hell of a charter. Come salmon season, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any fishing lodge?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cWe ain\u2019t that developed yet, though the good Lord knows we could use a little tourism. There\u2019s a motel out on Fall River that makes a mighty fine breakfast, and the resort out at Kalaloch, and that place up at Lake Crescent in Port Angeles, but there ain\u2019t really fishing at any of \u2019em. Your best bet is a charter. In May . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel?\u201d I whisper his name, feeling like an idiot. \u201cHe has a son, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talking about the O\u2019Shea\u2019s? Out on Spirit Lake?\u201d</p><p>My heart skips a beat. \u201cThere\u2019s a Daniel who lives on the lake? And he has a son named Bobby?\u201d</p><p>The waitress takes a step back. She\u2019s eyeing me hard now, and I don\u2019t think she likes what she sees. Her gaze pauses on the cane, then returns to my face. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Joy. I\u2019ve come a long way to find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve had their share of trouble in the past few months, and then some. What with the accident and all. They don\u2019t need no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had some trouble of my own. I wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt them.\u201d</p><p>It seems to take forever, but the woman finally nods. \u201cThey\u2019re out at the end of Lakeshore Drive.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling. I even laugh a little, though it sounds hysterical. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I limp out of the diner. I am in my car, easing away from the curb when I realize I didn\u2019t ask for directions.</p><p>But my heart will lead me. I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>I drive out along the park to the old highway.</p><p>And keep going.</p><p>There\u2019s no turn off where I remember.</p><p>I drive all the way to Forks before I finally turn around. On the way back, I study every sign carefully, slow down at every one. In the old part of Rain Valley, the houses are tiny and crammed together; the streets are named after trees. None of them is Lakeshore Drive. The sun is lower in the sky now; the streets are slowly fading into shadow. There are no street lamps out here, no sign of people.</p><p>I am about to turn around again when I see a small green marker that points to Spirit Lake.</p><p>A shiver moves through me at the name. I follow the road out of town. I haven\u2019t gone more than a mile when I come to a barricade that reads: \u201cDanger: High Water.\u201d The river has exceeded its banks and washed out a portion of the road. At least a foot of brown water runs across the asphalt.</p><p>I pull off the side of the road and park.</p><p>What now?</p><p>Is it a sign, this flooded road? Am I not supposed to go down to the lake?</p><p>Or am I supposed to walk? There\u2019s a strange pull in me at that answer. I walked here once, if the magic is real. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe I need to repeat history to find my present. I can\u2019t help noticing that there\u2019s a huge, skinned log lying along the edge of the road. A woman with a cane could walk across that, if she wanted to.</p><p>I am crazy. Even by my own standard, and God knows my threshold has fallen to almost nothing these days.</p><p>As I sit there, hands on the steering wheel, staring at the ruined road, my cell phone rings. I know without looking at the number who it is. \u201cHey, Stacey,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling for an hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no-man\u2019s-land out here. I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s service. You should see this place, it\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a travelogue. Well?\u201d</p><p>I am afraid to put it into words, this fragile impossible hope of mine, and more afraid not to. The split between what I imagined and what I now see throws me into a kind of tailspin; I don\u2019t know what to think. \u201cI\u2019m parked on Lakeshore Drive. The woman at the diner said Daniel and Bobby O\u2019Shea live at the end of the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Stacey says sharply. \u201cIs it them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. Who knows? I could be Brad Pitt/Twelve Monkeys crazy. I\u2019m probably still in the airport, sitting in my seat, drooling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in the airport drooling. I watched you board the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m stronger than I used to be.\u201d As I say the words, I realize the truth of them. I am stronger now. Strong enough to reach for this dream . . . and strong enough to handle disappointment.</p><p>What matters is that I\u2019ve finally made a move. Whether Daniel and Bobby are real or not, I belong here. Soon I will have over two hundred and ninety thousand dollars in the bank. That definitely gives me the freedom I need to start over somewhere. And this is where I want to be.</p><p>I look through the windshield. No raindrops blotch the glass. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d I say to Stacey.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you vanish on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Even as I say it, I can\u2019t help thinking of Bobby, to whom I made the same promise.</p><p>I hang up and toss my phone in my purse. Looping the straps over my shoulder, I get out of the car.</p><p>The world is radiant, bathed in the last, fading rays of sunlight. The trees on either side of the road are as big as I\u2019d imagined. Many rise well over two hundred feet into the air; their trunks are as straight as flagpoles. Salal and rhododendrons grow in wild disarray amid the trunks. Moss coats everything\u2014tree bark, branches, guardrails, rocks. Very carefully, using my cane for support, I climb up onto the log that spans the rushing water and walk to the other side. On dry land again, I limp down to the road and follow it. Walking with a cane is slow going, but not once do I pause or consider stopping.</p><p>I\u2019ve gone about a mile when I hear the lake, slapping against the shore.</p><p>I turn a corner and there I am, on a cherry tree\u2013lined driveway. At the end of the road is a sprawling old Victorian mansion with a huge covered porch. It is the kind of home that the timber barons built at the turn of the century. Even though the roof looks like a slanted mossy hillside and the porch sags dangerously to one side, it is spectacular. A hand-carved wooden sign by the entrance welcomes me to the Spirit Lake Bed and Breakfast.</p><p>There are two outbuildings on either side, small clapboard structures with broken windows and ramshackle chimneys.</p><p>No red truck with a blue door sits in the driveway.</p> <p>No dock juts out over the lake.</p><p>No pile of kayaks and paddleboats lay piled by the shore.</p><p>No ruined vegetable garden shows the first signs of spring. In fact, there\u2019s no landscaping at all. There are only the cherry trees, full of pink blossoms that line the road and lead to the front door. None of it is familiar except the trees and the lake.</p><p>I have never seen this place before.</p><p>And yet, there by the lake, is the swing set, exactly as I \u201csaw\u201d it.</p><p>I\u2019m crazy.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m not really here. The terrifying thought wings through my mind. Maybe I\u2019m in the hospital still, on killer drugs.</p><p>In a coma.</p><p>I\u2019m Neo in The Matrix before they save him.</p><p>I\u2019m . . .</p><p>\u201cStop it, Joy.\u201d</p><p>It takes a monumental act of will, but I move forward.</p><p>I follow the bumpy asphalt road to its rounded end. I am just about to turn toward the house when I hear a noise. A boy\u2019s voice carried by the breeze.</p><p>Bobby.</p><p>I turn toward the sound, listening. It\u2019s him. Gripping my cane more tightly, I hurry past the swing set and go into the trees.</p><p>There he is, kneeling in his forest church, playing with action figures. Giant trees ring and protect him. Sunset slants through the great, down-slung boughs in purple-hued rays. The ferns and moss are lime green with new growth.</p><p>As I limp toward him, my heart is beating too quickly. The spongy, damp ground swallows my footsteps. So it is that he doesn\u2019t hear me approach until I say, \u201cHey, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of my voice, his hands freeze. The action figures clatter together and go quiet. Slowly, he turns to look at me.</p><p>He is exactly as I\u2019ve imagined him\u2014black, curly hair, bright blue eyes with long lashes, and a missing pair of teeth.</p><p>But the way he frowns at me is new.</p><p>\u201cBobby?\u201d I say after a confusing minute. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Joy.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t smile. \u201cSure it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I went away, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone said you were imaginary anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I was then. I\u2019m not now.\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cYou mean . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Hope flashes across his eyes. The quelling of it is the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cI ain\u2019t falling for it. I don\u2019t wanna be crazy anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit trying to trick me.\u201d His voice catches on that. I can see how hard he is trying to be sane and grown up. And how much he wants to believe in me again.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s impossible,\u201d I whisper. \u201cAnd totally Looney Tunes, but will you trust in me one more time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come here.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>I smile. That kind of honesty will save us in this crazy situation. \u201cMe, too. Please? Believe in me one more time.\u201d I can\u2019t help remembering my dreamed-of Christmas morning where I said the same thing to him.</p><p>Slowly, he gets up and comes toward me. When he\u2019s almost close enough to take my hand he stops. He doesn\u2019t reach for me. \u201cAre you real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing you ever said to me, remember? Then, I didn\u2019t know what you meant, I didn\u2019t understand. But I\u2019m real now, Bobby. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>He won\u2019t touch me, but I see that hope come back into his eyes. \u201cYou broke your promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. And I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you have a cane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI waited for you to come back. Every day . . .\u201d His voice breaks. I can see how hard he\u2019s trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cI have a present for you,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I reach into my pocket, half expecting it to be empty.</p><p>It\u2019s not. My fingers coil around the cool, smooth bit of carved stone. I pull it out and hand it to him. The white arrowhead looks like a tiny heart in my palm.</p><p>Bobby gasps. \u201cIt\u2019s white. My mommy always promised me . . .\u201d</p><p>I move slowly toward him and drop to my knees in the dirt. \u201cShe showed me where it was, Bobby. On Christmas Eve night while you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSometimes the magic is real, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tears glaze his eyes. I know how long he has waited for an adult to say these words to him. He takes the arrowhead from me, closing his fingers tightly around it.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can keep it in your pocket always, and when you get scared or feel lost or confused, you can hold it and remember how much she loved you.\u201d</p><p>I open my arms.</p><p>He launches himself at me. I catch him easily, but lose my balance. My cane drops to the side, and we fall to the mossy ground in a tangled heap. For the first time, I\u2019m really holding him.</p><p>His kiss on my cheek is slobbery and wet . . . and real.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, drawing back, \u201cyou\u2019re warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t before?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head solemnly. \u201cWhen you touched me, it was like . . . the wind.\u201d</p><p>We sit up, look at each other. \u201cHey, Bobby O\u2019Shea. It\u2019s nice to really meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were like . . . Mommy. Gone.\u201d</p><p>I touch his cheek; it is softer than I ever imagined. \u201cNo. It just took me a long time to find my way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were you here?\u201d</p><p>I wonder if there will ever be an answer to that. If I will someday know why my dream was a flawed and tattered version of reality or how I ended up here when I was hooked up to machines in a white bed in Bakersfield. For now, all I can do is shrug and say the thing I do know. \u201cMagic.\u201d</p><p>He thinks about that. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The resilience of children. If only we could hold onto that. I smile. \u201cSo, what have you been doing since I left?\u201d</p><p>He grabs my hand and gets to his feet. \u201cCome on.\u201d Tugging hard, he leads me out of the clearing and toward the house. I can tell he\u2019s impatient with my speed, but the cane and my limp will only allow me to move so fast. I laugh and beg him to slow down.</p><p>As we move through the yard, I notice how shadowy everything is here on the edge of the deep woods; night falls quickly here, unlike in my dream world where everything seemed to go slowly.</p><p>Bobby tightens his grip on my hand and veers left. We go around the house and up a small rise. There, behind the house are five small cabins. Two are obviously old, and three are of brand new construction.</p><p>He goes to the closest one\u2014a new one\u2014and opens the door. I follow him inside, stumbling over the threshold.</p><p>It\u2019s dark in here. Behind me, he flicks a switch and light comes on.</p><p>We are in a small, beautifully constructed cabin with wide plank pine flooring, unfinished walls, and big mullioned windows that overlook the lake. To the left, a door is partway open; in the space, I can see a bathroom tiled in white with a claw-foot tub.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to do with the walls. It wasn\u2019t on the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I\u2019m confused. Before I can question him, he re-takes my hand and leads me out of the cabin.</p><p>\u201cHe fixed \u2019em all up and built the new ones. \u2019Cause of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Bobby, I . . .\u201d</p><p>He stops and looks up at me. \u201cYou know. The list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat list?\u201d</p><p>He reaches into his shirt pocket, pulls out a worn, yellow piece of paper. It appears well worn, as if refolded endlessly. He opens it, hands it to me. \u201cWe look at it every day.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the well-used piece of paper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ibeas.</p><p>chng nme/rmantic</p><p>pant trm</p><p>flwrs</p> <p>fix cbns</p><p>websit</p><p>no crpt flr</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I whisper, shivering although I\u2019m not cold. \u201cHow . . .\u201d</p><p>Bobby shrugs. We both know there is no answer to my unvoiced question. It\u2019s like the arrowhead: magic. As impossible as it is, some part of me was here, and I left these words behind.</p> <p>\u201cI told my daddy you\u2019d come back,\u201d he says quietly. When he looks up at me, I am filled with a kind of love I\u2019ve never known before.</p><p>I bend down and take him in my arms, holding him tightly.</p><p>He is the first to pull away. It couldn\u2019t have been me.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, taking my hand again, pulling me toward the house. As we cross the yard, a wind kicks up. Suddenly the world is full of falling petals. It\u2019s snowing pink.</p><p>At the door, Bobby stops and grins up at me. \u201cLet\u2019s surprise him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019ll be a surprise,\u201d I say, feeling my stomach knot up. It is one thing to get a boy to believe in magic; it\u2019s another thing entirely to pin such impossible hopes on a full-grown man.</p> <p>Bobby knocks on the door. Footsteps rattle inside the house.</p><p>I tighten my hold on his hand.</p><p>The door opens and Daniel is there, looking almost exactly as I pictured him. He is not quite as lean as I imagined, and his hair is shorter.</p><p>But it\u2019s Daniel, all right.</p><p>Bobby is moving from foot to foot so excitedly, he seems to be dancing the Macarena. I, on the other hand, am as still as stone. \u201cLook, Daddy. She\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>I try to smile, but can\u2019t. All he has to do is shut the door or turn away and I\u2019ll be lost. \u201cOpen the damn door,\u201d I say, my voice catching on the swear word, just as Bobby had known it would. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy?\u201d I hear the confusion in Daniel\u2019s voice, the disbelief.</p><p>Bobby laughs. \u201cI knew he\u2019d know you.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t understand. \u201cHow do you recognize me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby drew about a million pictures of you,\u201d he says in that lovely brogue of my dreams. \u201cAnd he talked about you \u2019til I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Heat climbs up my cheeks. I feel like a teenager, being noticed by the football captain for the very first time. It is a feeling I thought I\u2019d never experience again. \u201cThis is insane,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cJoy.\u201d The way he says my name is like a prayer. It wrenches my heart and gives me hope.</p><p>Without thinking, I move toward him, put my hand on his arm. My cane falls to the floor in a clatter, forgotten.</p><p>He touches my face, and only then, when I feel the heat of his palm against my cold cheek do I realize how keenly I wanted him to reach for me. His touch is the gentlest I\u2019ve ever known. I sigh, seeing a pale cloud of my breath.</p><p>\u201cI feel as if I already know you.\u201d</p><p>I nod. It\u2019s crazy, but I feel it, too.</p><p>\u201cSo, who are you, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy Faith Candellaro. I\u2019m a high school librarian from Bakersfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy Faith, huh? That\u2019s a grand name.\u201d He steps back, makes a sweeping gesture with his hand. \u201cWell, come on in.\u201d</p><p>I step past him and limp into the house. I can feel him staring at me, and I know he has a dozen unanswerable questions\u2014I know because I\u2019ve asked them of myself\u2014but just now I\u2019m caught between worlds, the here and there of my dream and this reality.</p><p>There is no registration desk. That\u2019s the first thing I notice. No wall of old-fashioned keys, no counter full of brochures and tourist maps. Like Rain Valley, some of what I saw was real and some was pure imagination. I don\u2019t know how to make sense of it.</p><p>I turn to my left and see the lobby. The living room.</p><p>Just as in my dream, there is a huge stone fireplace.</p><p>The decorations Bobby and I put on the mantel are still there\u2014the polyester pile of glittery snow, the cast resin homes and stores, the mirror skating pond and horse-drawn carriages. In the corner of the room, exactly where I put it, is a Christmas tree, draped in lights and ornaments. Beneath it, a lone package sits.</p><p>The single present is long and thin. It\u2019s crudely wrapped and held together by big strips of masking tape. JOY is written on it in red crayon. It is a present for me.</p><p>And that\u2019s when it hits me: I never had Christmas this year. My holiday was spent in a white room that smelled of disinfectant and flowers. There had been no magical holiday morning, no presents to open, and no unending games of Monopoly.</p><p>No one saved Christmas for me.</p><p>Until now. Tears sting my eyes but don\u2019t fall. Of all the people in my life, these two\u2014strangers in the real world\u2014have saved the holiday for me. How is that possible? Or isn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s March,\u201d I say, looking up at Daniel. Suddenly I\u2019m afraid again that it\u2019s all a lie. \u201cI\u2019m in a coma somewhere, aren\u2019t I?\u201d I step back from him.</p><p>\u201cHe never stopped believing,\u201d Daniel says to me. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have Christmas without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the tree . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our sixth one.\u201d</p><p>I limp past him to the tree. I need to feel its pointy needles, smell its sharp fragrance.</p><p>These are the decorations he put up, one by one, the mementos of his young life. That one was Mommy\u2019s favorite . . . I made it in day care.</p><p>There\u2019s a new ornament on the branch nearest me. It\u2019s a small picture frame, formed of fired, painted clay. The kind of thing a child would make at one of those pottery places. Inside the red-and-green frame is a stick figure painting of three people\u2014a dark haired man with a big smile, a curly-haired boy, and a red-haired woman. Below the people are our names, written in an adult\u2019s careful hand: Daniel, Bobby, and Joy.</p><p>\u201cI made it for you,\u201d Bobby says, grinning. \u201cBut Daddy helped.\u201d</p><p>I turn to Daniel. My heart feels swollen suddenly, tender. I don\u2019t know what to say to this man who is both a friend and a stranger.</p><p>I feel myself starting to cry. It makes me look like a fool, to be moved by something so small, and by people whom I barely know, but I can\u2019t stop the swell of emotions. I\u2019ve felt alone for so, so long now, and now\u2014however impossibly\u2014 I feel as if I\u2019ve finally come home. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m crazy . . .\u201d</p><p>Daniel wipes the tears from my cheek. \u201cYou know what\u2019s really crazy?\u201d he says in a voice so low that only I can hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man my age believing in magic.\u201d He puts his hand around the back of my neck and pulls me in close. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this whole thing happened, or where we go from here, but I know one thing: We\u2019ve been given a gift.\u201d Leaning down to kiss me, he says, \u201cMerry Christmas, Joy Faith Candellaro. We\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>It is a quick kiss, a touching of lips and nothing more, but it reaches deep inside me, warms a place that has been cold for a long time. I lean into him, put my arms around his neck. As if from a distance, I hear a little boy giggle.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Joy,\u201d Bobby says. \u201cYou have a present to open.\u201d</p><p>And I smile. Here and now. It is the best present of my life.</p><p>I look up at Daniel and whisper, \u201cMagic,\u201d and I know that for the rest of our lives we will believe.</p><p>Read on for an exciting preview of</p><p>KRISTIN HANNAH\u2019S</p><p>Magic Hour</p><p>Available in hardcover Spring 2006 from</p><p>THE RANDOM HOUSE PUBLISHING GROUP</p><p>It will all be over soon.</p><p>Julia Cates had lost count of the times she\u2019d told herself that very thing, but today\u2014finally\u2014it would be true. In a few hours the world would know the truth about her.</p><p>If she made it downtown, that was. Unfortunately, the Pacific Coast Highway looked more like a parking lot than a freeway. The hills behind Malibu were on fire again, and smoke hung above the rooftops and turned the normally bright coastal air into a thick brown sludge. All over town terrified babies woke in the middle of the night, crying</p><p>gray-black tears and gasping for breath. Even the surf seemed to have slowed down, as if exhausted by the unseasonable</p><p>heat.</p><p>She maneuvered through the cranky, stop-and-go traffic, ignoring the drivers who flipped her off and cut in front of her. It was expected; in this most dangerous of seasons in Southern California, tempers caught fire as easily as backyards. The heat made everyone edgy.</p><p>Finally, she exited the freeway and drove to the courthouse.</p><p>Television vans were everywhere. Dozens of reporters huddled on the courthouse steps, microphones and cameras at the ready, waiting for the story to arrive. In Los Angeles it was becoming a daily event, it seemed; legal proceedings as entertainment. Michael Jackson. Courtney Love. Robert Blake.</p><p>Julia turned a corner and drove to a side entrance, where her lawyers were waiting for her.</p><p>She parked on the street and got out of the car, expecting to move forward confidently, but for a terrible second she couldn\u2019t move. You\u2019re innocent, she reminded herself. They\u2019ll see that. The system will work. She forced herself to take a step, then another. It felt as if she were moving through invisible wires, fighting her way uphill. When she made it to the group, it took everything she had to smile, but one thing she knew: it looked real. Every psychiatrist knew how to make a smile look genuine.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dr. Cates,\u201d said Frank Williams, the lead counsel on her defense team. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said, wondering if she was the only one who heard the wobble in her voice. She hated that evidence of her fear. Today, of all days, she needed to be strong, to show the world that she was the doctor they\u2019d thought she was, that she\u2019d done nothing wrong.</p><p>The team coiled protectively around her. She appreciated their support. Although she was doing her best to appear professional and confident, it was a fragile veneer. One wrong word could strip it all away.</p><p>They pushed through the doors and walked into the courthouse.</p><p>Flashbulbs erupted in spasms of blue-white light. Cameras clicked; tape rolled. Reporters surged forward, all yelling at once.</p><p>\u201cDr. Cates! How do you feel about what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you save those children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know about the gun?\u201d</p><p>Frank put an arm around Julia and pulled her against his side. She pressed her face against his lapel and let herself be pulled along.</p><p>In the courtroom, she took her place at the defendant\u2019s table. One by one the team rallied around her. Behind her, in the first row of gallery seating, several junior associates and paralegals took their places.</p><p>She tried to ignore the racket behind her; the doors creaking open and slamming shut, footsteps hurrying across the marble tiled floor, whispered voices. Empty seats were filling up quickly; she knew it without turning around. This courtroom was the Place To Be in Los Angeles today, and since the judge had disallowed cameras in the courtroom, journalists and artists were no doubt packed side by side in the gallery, their pens ready.</p><p>In the past year, they\u2019d written an endless string of stories about her. Photographers had snapped thousands of pictures of her\u2014taking out the trash, standing on her deck, coming and going from her office. The least flattering shots always made the front page. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reporters had practically set up camp outside her condo, and although she had never spoken to them, it didn\u2019t matter. The stories kept coming. They reported on her small-town roots, her stellar education, her pricey beachfront condo, her devastating breakup with Philip. They even speculated that she\u2019d recently become either anorexic or addicted to liposuction. What they didn\u2019t report on was the only part of her that mattered: her love of her job. She had been a lonely, awkward child, and she remembered every nuance of that pain. Her own youth had made her an exceptional psychiatrist. It was, really, the only thing that mattered to her.</p><p>Of course, that bit of truth had never made it to press. Neither had a list of all the children and adolescents she\u2019d helped.</p><p>A hush fell over the courtroom as Judge Carol Myerson took her seat at the bench. She was a stern-looking woman with artificially bright auburn hair and old-fashioned eyeglasses.</p><p>The bailiff called out the case.</p> <p>Julia wished suddenly that she had asked someone to join her here today, some friend or relative who would stand by her, maybe hold her hand when it was over, but she\u2019d always put work ahead of socializing. It hadn\u2019t given her much time to devote to friends. Her own therapist had often pointed out this lack in her life; truthfully, until now, she\u2019d never agreed with him.</p><p>Beside her, Frank stood. He was an imposing man, tall and almost elegantly thin, with hair that was going from black to gray in perfect order, sideburns first. She\u2019d chosen him because of his brilliant mind, but his demeanor was likely to matter more. Too often in rooms like this it came down to form over substance.</p><p>\u201cYour Honor,\u201d he began in a voice as soft and persuasive as any she\u2019d ever heard, \u201cthe naming of Dr. Julia Cates as a defendant in this lawsuit is absurd. Although the precise limits and boundaries of confidentiality in psychiatric situations are often disputed, certain precedents exist, namely Tarasoff v. the Board of Regents of California. Dr. Cates had no knowledge of her patient\u2019s violent tendencies and no information regarding specific threats to named individuals. Indeed, no such specific knowledge is even alleged in the complaint. Thus, we respectfully request that she be dismissed from this lawsuit. Thank you.\u201d He sat down.</p><p>At the plaintiff\u2019s table, a man in a jet-black suit stood up. \u201cFour children are dead, Your Honor. They will never grow up, never leave for college, never have children of their own. Dr. Cates was Amber Zuniga\u2019s psychiatrist. For three years Dr. Cates spent two hours a week with Amber, listening to her problems and prescribing medications for her growing depression. Yet with all that intimacy, we are now to believe that Dr. Cates didn\u2019t know that Amber was becoming increasingly violent and depressed. That she had no warning whatsoever that her patient would buy an automatic weapon and walk into her church youth group meeting and start shooting.\u201d The lawyer walked out from behind the table and stood in the middle of the courtroom.</p><p>Slowly, he turned to face Julia. It was the money shot; the one that would be drawn by every artist in the courtroom and shown around the world, \u201cShe is the expert, Your Honor. She should have foreseen this tragedy and prevented it by warning the victims or committing Ms. Zuniga for residential treatment. If she didn\u2019t in fact know of Ms. Zuniga\u2019s violent tendencies, she should have. Thus, we respectfully seek to keep Dr. Cates as a named defendant in this case. It is a matter of justice. The slain children\u2019s families deserve redress from the person most likely to have foreseen and prevented the murder of their children.\u201d He went back to the table and took his seat.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t true,\u201d Julia whispered, knowing her voice couldn\u2019t be heard. Still, she had to say it out loud. Amber had never even hinted at violence. Every teenager battling depression said they hated the kids in their school. That was light-years away from buying a gun and opening fire.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t they all see that?</p><p>Judge Myerson read over the paperwork in front of her. Then she took off her reading glasses and set them down on the hard wooden surface of her bench.</p><p>The courtroom fell into silence. Julia knew that the journalists were ready to write instantly. Outside, there were more of them standing by, ready to run with two stories. Both headlines were already written. All they needed was a sign from their colleagues inside.</p><p>The children\u2019s parents, huddled in the back rows in a mournful group, were waiting to be assured that this tragedy could have been averted, that someone in a position of authority could have kept their children alive. They had sued everyone for wrongful death\u2014the police, the paramedics, the drug manufacturers, the medical doctors, and the Zuniga family. The modern world no longer believed in senseless tragedy. Bad things couldn\u2019t just happen to people; someone had to pay. The victims\u2019 families hoped that this lawsuit would be the answer, but Julia knew it would only give them something else to think about for a while, perhaps distribute some of their pain. It wouldn\u2019t alleviate it, though. The grief would outlive them all.</p><p>The judge looked at the parents first. \u201cThere is no doubt that what happened on February nineteenth at the Baptist church in Silverwood was a terrible tragedy. As a parent myself, I cannot fathom the world in which you have lived for the past months. However, the question before this court is whether Dr. Cates should remain a defendant in this case.\u201d She folded her hands on the desk. \u201cI am persuaded that as a matter of law, Dr. Cates had no duty to warn or otherwise protect the victims in this set of circumstances. I reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, the facts do not assert and the plaintiffs do not allege that Dr. Cates had any specific knowledge of identifiable potential victims; second, the law does not impose a duty to warn except to clearly identifiable victims; and finally, as a matter of public policy, we must maintain the confidentiality of the psychiatrist-patient relationship unless there is a specific, identifiable threat which warrants the undermining of that confidentiality. Dr. Cates, by her testimony and her records and pursuant to the plaintiffs\u2019 own assertions, did not have a duty to warn or otherwise protect the victims in this case. Thus, I am dismissing her from the complaint, without prejudice.\u201d</p> <p>The gallery went crazy. Before she knew it, Julia was on her feet and enfolded in congratulatory hugs by her defense team. Behind her, she could hear the journalists running for the doors and down the marble hallway. \u201cShe\u2019s out!\u201d someone yelled.</p><p>Julia felt a wave of relief. Thank God.</p><p>Then she heard the children\u2019s parents crying behind her.</p><p>\u201cHow can this be happening?\u201d one of them said loudly. \u201cShe should have known.\u201d</p><p>Frank touched her arm. \u201cYou should be smiling. We won.\u201d</p><p>She shot a quick glance at the parents, then looked away. Her thoughts trailed off into the dark woods of regret. Were they right? Should she have known?</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, and it\u2019s time you told people that. This is your opportunity to speak up, to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A crowd of reporters swarmed them.</p> <p>\u201cDr. Cates! What do you have to say to the parents who hold you responsible\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill other parents trust you with their children\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you comment on the report that the Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s Office has taken your name off the roster of forensic psychiatrists?\u201d</p><p>Frank stepped into the fray, reaching back for Julia\u2019s hand. \u201cMy client was just released from the lawsuit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a technicality,\u201d someone yelled.</p><p>While they were focused on Frank, Julia slipped to the back of the crowd and ran for the door. She knew Frank wanted her to make a statement, but she didn\u2019t care. She didn\u2019t feel triumphant. All she wanted was to be away from all this . . . to get back to real life.</p><p>The Zunigas were standing in front of the door, blocking her path. They were paler versions of the couple she\u2019d once known. Grief had stripped them of color and aged them.</p><p>Mrs. Zuniga looked up at her through tears. \u201cYou did help her, Dr. Cates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved both of you,\u201d Julia said softly, knowing it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cAnd you were good parents. Don\u2019t let anyone convince you otherwise. Amber was ill. I wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Zuniga said. \u201cWishing hurts most of all.\u201d He put an arm around his wife and drew her close to him.</p><p>Silence fell between them. Julia tried to think of more to say, but all that was left was I\u2019m sorry, which she\u2019d said too many times to count, and \u201cGood-bye.\u201d Holding her purse close, she eased around them, then left the courthouse.</p><p>Outside, the world was brown and bleak. A thick layer of smoke darkened the sky, obliterating the sun, matching her mood.</p><p>She got into her car and drove away. As she merged into traffic, she wondered if Frank had even noticed her absence. To him it was a game, albeit with the biggest stakes, and as the day\u2019s winner, he would be flying high. He would think about the victims and their families, probably tonight in his den, after a few Dewar\u2019s over ice. He would think about her, too, perhaps wonder what would become of a psychiatrist who\u2019d so profoundly compromised her reputation with failure, but he wouldn\u2019t think about them all for long. He didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>She was going to have to put it behind her now, too. Tonight she\u2019d lay in her lonely bed, listening to the surf, thinking how much it sounded like the beat of her heart, and she\u2019d try again to get beyond her grief and guilt. She had to figure out what clue she\u2019d missed, what sign she\u2019d overlooked. It would hurt\u2014remembering\u2014but in the end she\u2019d be a better therapist for all this pain. And then, at seven o\u2019clock in the morning, she\u2019d get dressed and go back to work.</p><p>Helping people.</p><p>That was how she\u2019d get through this.</p><p>Girl crouches at the edge of the cave, watching water fall from the sky. She wants to reach for one of the empty cans around her, maybe lick the insides again, but she has done this too many times already. The food is gone. It has been gone for more moons than she knows how to keep track of. Behind her the wolves are restless, hungry.</p><p>The sky grumbles and roars. The trees shake with fear, and still the water drips down.</p><p>She falls asleep.</p><p>She wakes suddenly and looks around, sniffing the air. There is a strange scent in the darkness. It should frighten her, send her back into the deep, black hole, but she can\u2019t quite move. Her stomach is so tight and empty it hurts.</p><p>The falling water isn\u2019t so angry now; it is more of a spitting. She wishes she could see the sun. Life is so much better when she is in the light. Her cave is so dark.</p><p>A twig snaps.</p><p>Then another.</p><p>She goes very still, willing her body to disappear against the cave wall. She becomes like the shadow of herself, flat and motionless. She knows how important stillness can be.</p><p>Him is coming. Already he has been gone too long. The food is no more. The sunny days are past, and though she is glad Him is gone, without Him, she is afraid. In a time\u2014long ago now\u2014Her would have helped some, but she is DEAD.</p><p>When the forest falls silent again, she leans forward, poking her face into the gray light Out There. The darkness of sleepnight is coming; soon it will be blackness all around. The falling water is gentle and sweet. She likes the taste of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What should she do?</p><p>She glances down at the pup beside her. He is on alert, too, sniffing the air. She touches his soft fur and feels the tremble in his body. He is wondering the same thing: Would Him be back?</p><p>Always before Him was gone a moon or two at the most. But everything had been changed when Her got dead and gone. When Him left, he actually spoke to Girl.</p><p>YoubegoodwhileI\u2019mgoneorelse.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t understand all of the words, but she knows Or Else.</p><p>Still, it is too long since he left. There is nothing to eat. She has freed herself and gone into the woods for berries and nuts, but it is the darkening season. Soon she will be too weak to find food, and there will be none anyway when the white starts falling and turns her breath into fog. Though she is afraid, terrified of the strangers who live Out There, she is starving, and if Him comes back and sees that she has freed herself, it will be bad. She must make a move.</p><p>The town of Rain Valley, tucked between the wilds of the Olympic National Forest and the roaring gray surf of the Pacific Ocean, was the last bastion of civilization before the start of the deep woods.</p><p>There were places not far from town that had never been touched by the golden rays of the sun, where shadows lay on the black, loamy soil all year, their shapes so thick and substantial that the few hardy hikers who made their way into the forest often thought they\u2019d stumbled into a den of hibernating bear. Even today, in this modern age of scientific wonders, these woods remained as they had for centuries, unexplored, untouched by man.</p><p>Less than one hundred years ago, settlers came to this beautiful spot between the rain forest and the sea and hacked down just enough trees to plant their crops. In time they learned what the Native Americans had learned before them: this was a place that wouldn\u2019t be tamed. So they gave up their farming tools and took up fishing. Salmon and timber became the local industries, and for a few decades the town prospered. But in the nineties, environmentalists discovered Rain Valley. They set out to save the birds and the fish and the eldest of the trees. The men who made their living off the land were forgotten in this fight, and over the years the town fell into a quiet kind of disrepair. One by one the grandiose visions of the town\u2019s prominent citizens faded away. Those much-anticipated streetlights were never added; the road out to Mystic Lake remained a two-lane minefield of thinning asphalt and growing potholes; the telephone and electrical lines stayed where they were\u2014in the air\u2014hanging lazily from one old pole to the next, an invitation to every tree limb in every windstorm to knock out the town\u2019s power.</p> <p>In other parts of the world, in places where man had staked his claim long ago, such a falling apart of a town might have dealt a death blow to the citizens\u2019 sense of community, but not here. The people of Rain Valley were hardy souls, able and willing to live in a place where it rained more than two hundred days a year and the sun was treated like a wealthy uncle who only rarely came to call. They withstood gray days and springy lawns and dwindling ways to make a living, and remained through it all the sons and daughters of the pioneers who\u2019d first dared to live among the towering trees.</p><p>Today, however, they were finding their spirit tested. It was October seventeenth, and autumn had recently lost its race to the coming winter. Oh, the trees were still dressed in their party colors and the lawns were green again after the brown days of late summer, but no mistake could be made: winter was coming. The sky had been low and gray all week, layered in ominously dark clouds. For seven days it had rained almost nonstop.</p><p>On the corner of Wheaton Way and Cates Avenue stood the police station, a squat gray-stone building with a cupola on top and a flagpole on the grassy lawn out front. Inside the austere building, the old fluorescent lighting was barely strong enough to keep the gray at bay. It was four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, but the bad weather made it feel later.</p><p>The people who worked inside tried not to notice. If they\u2019d been asked\u2014and they hadn\u2019t\u2014they would have admitted that four to five consecutive days of rain was acceptable. Longer if it was only a drizzle. But there was something wrong in this stretch of bad weather. It wasn\u2019t January, after all. For the first few days, they sat at their respective desks and complained good naturedly about the walk from their cars to the front door. Now, those conversations had been pummeled by the constant hammering of rain on the roof.</p><p>Ellen Barton\u2014Ellie to her friends, which was everyone in town\u2014stood at the window, staring out at the street. The rain made everything appear insubstantial, a charcoal rendering of town. She caught a glimpse of herself in the water-streaked window; not a reflection, precisely, more of a feeling played out momentarily on glass. She saw herself as she always did, as the younger woman she\u2019d once been\u2014long, thick black hair and cornflower blue eyes and a bright, ready smile. The girl voted homecoming queen and head cheerleader. As always when she thought about her youth, she saw herself in white. The color of brides, of hope for the future, of families waiting to be born.</p><p>\u201cI gotta have a smoke, Ellie. You know I do. I\u2019ve been really good, but it\u2019s reaching critical mass about now. If I don\u2019t light up, I\u2019m heading to the refrigerator.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her do it,\u201d Cal said from his place at the dispatch desk. He sat hunched over the phone, a sheath of black hair falling across his eyes. In high school Ellie and her friends had called him the Crow because of his black hair and sharp, pointed features. He\u2019d always had a bony, ill-put-together look, as if he wasn\u2019t quite at home in his body. At almost forty, he still had a boyish appearance. Only his eyes\u2014dark and intense\u2014showed the miles he\u2019d walked in his lifetime. \u201cTry tough love. Nothing else has worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d Peanut snapped.</p><p>Ellie sighed. They\u2019d had this same discussion only fifteen minutes ago, and ten minutes before that. She put her hands on her waist, resting her fingertips on the heavy gun belt that was slung across her hips. She turned to look at her best friend. \u201cNow, Peanut, you know what I\u2019m gonna say. This is a public building. I\u2019m the chief of police. How can I let you break the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Cal said. He opened his mouth to say more, but a call came in and he answered it. \u201cRain Valley Police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Peanut said. \u201cAnd suddenly you\u2019re Miss Law and Order. What about Sven Morgenstern\u2014he parks in front of his store every day. Right in front of the hydrant. When was the last time you hauled his car away? And Large Marge shoplifts two boxes of freezer pops and a bottle of nail polish from the drugstore every Sunday after church. I haven\u2019t processed her arrest papers in a while. I guess as long as her husband pays the tab it doesn\u2019t matter. . . .\u201d She let the sentence trail off. They both knew she could cite a dozen more examples. This was Rain Valley, after all, not downtown Seattle. Ellie had been the chief of police for four years and a patrol officer for eight years before that. Although she stayed ready for anything, she\u2019d never processed a crime more dangerous than breaking and entering.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let me have a cigarette or am I going to get a doughnut and a Red Bull?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll both kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they won\u2019t kill us,\u201d Cal said, disconnecting his call. \u201cHold firm, El. She\u2019s the patrol clerk. She shouldn\u2019t smoke in a city building.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re smoking too much,\u201d Ellie finally said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m eating less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to the salmon jerky diet? Or the grapefruit one? Those were both healthier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking and answer me. I need a smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started smoking four days ago, Peanut,\u201d Cal said. \u201cYou hardly need a cigarette.\u201d</p><p>Ellie shook her head. If she didn\u2019t step in, these two would bicker all day. \u201cYou should go back to your meetings,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cThat Weight Watchers was working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months of cabbage soup to lose ten pounds? I don\u2019t think so. Come on, Ellie, you know I\u2019m about ready to reach for a doughnut.\u201d</p><p>Ellie knew she\u2019d lost the battle. She and Peanut\u2014Penelope Nutter\u2014had worked side by side in this office for more than a decade and been best friends since high school. Over the years their friendship had weathered every storm, from the ruination of Ellie\u2019s two fragile marriages to Peanut\u2019s recent decision that smoking cigarettes was the key to weight loss. She called it the Hollywood diet and pointed out all of the stick-figure celebrities who smoked.</p><p>Grinning at Cal, she placed her hands on the desk and pushed herself to a stand. The fifty pounds she\u2019d gained in the past few years made her move a little slower. She walked over to the door and opened it, although they all knew there\u2019d be no breeze to suck the smoke away on such a wet and dismal day.</p><p>Ellie went down the hall to the office in the back that was technically hers. She rarely used it. In a town like this, there wasn\u2019t much call for official business, and she preferred to spend her days in the main room with Cal and Peanut. She dug past the signs from last month\u2019s pancake breakfast and found a gas mask. Putting it on, she headed back down the hall.</p><p>Cal burst out laughing.</p><p>Peanut tried not to smile. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may want children someday. I\u2019m protecting my uterus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d worry less about secondhand smoke and more about finding a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s tried everyone from Mystic to Aberdeen,\u201d Cal said. \u201cLast month she even went out with that UPS guy. The good-looking one who keeps forgetting where he parked his truck.\u201d</p><p>Peanut exhaled smoke and coughed. \u201cI think you need to lower your standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure look like you\u2019re enjoying that smoke,\u201d Cal said with a grin.</p><p>Peanut flipped him off. \u201cWe were talking about Ellie\u2019s love life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you two ever talk about,\u201d Cal pointed out.</p><p>It was true.</p><p>Ellie couldn\u2019t help herself: She loved men. Usually\u2014okay, always\u2014the wrong men.</p><p>Peanut called it the curse of the small-town beauty queen. If only Ellie had been like her sister and learned to rely on her brains instead of her beauty. But some things simply weren\u2019t meant to be. Ellie liked having fun; she liked romance. The problem was, it hadn\u2019t yet led to true love. Peanut said it was because Ellie didn\u2019t know how to compromise, but that wasn\u2019t accurate. Ellie\u2019s marriages\u2014both of them\u2014had failed because she\u2019d married good-looking men with itchy feet and wandering eyes. Her first husband, former high school football captain Al Torees, should have been enough to turn her off men for years. But she\u2019d had a short memory and just a few years after the divorce she married another good-looking loser. Poor choices, to be true, but the divorces hadn\u2019t dimmed her hopes. She still believed in romance and was waiting to be swept away. She knew it was possible; she\u2019d seen that true love with her parents. She lifted the gas mask and said, \u201cAny lower, Pea, and I\u2019d be dating out of my species. Maybe Cal here can set me up with one of his geek friends from the comic book convention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cal looked stung by that. \u201cWe\u2019re not geeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peanut said, exhaling smoke. \u201cYou\u2019re grown men who think other men in tights look good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make us sound gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Peanut laughed. \u201cGay men have sex. Your friends wear Matrix costumes in public. How you found Lisa, I\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p> <p>At the mention of Cal\u2019s wife, an awkward silence stumbled into the room. The whole town knew she was a run-around. There was always talk; men smiled, women frowned and shook their heads at the mention of her name. But here in the police station, they never spoke about it.</p><p>Cal went back to reading his comic book and doodling in his sketch pad. They all knew he\u2019d be quiet for a while now.</p><p>Ellie sat down at her desk and put her feet up.</p><p>Peanut leaned back against the wall and stared at her through a cloud of smoke. \u201cI saw Julia on the news yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Cal looked up. \u201cNo kidding? I gotta turn on the TV more.\u201d</p> <p>Ellie reached behind her head and pulled off the mask. When she set it on the desk, she couldn\u2019t help sighing. It had only been a matter of time before they came around to the subject of her brilliant younger sister. \u201cShe was dismissed from the lawsuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Her answering machine had a lovely tone. I think she\u2019s avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>Peanut took a step forward. The old oak floorboards, first hammered into place at the turn of the century when Bill Whipman had been the town\u2019s police chief, shuddered at the movement, but like everything in Rain Valley, they were sturdier than they appeared. The West End was a place where things\u2014and people\u2014were built to last. \u201cYou should try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how jealous Julia is of me. She especially wouldn\u2019t want to talk to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think everyone is jealous of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>Peanut gave her one of those Who-do-you-think-you\u2019re-fooling? looks that were the cornerstone of friendship. \u201cCome on, Ellie. Your baby sister looked like she was hurting. Are you going to pretend you can\u2019t talk to her because twenty years ago you were homecoming queen and she belonged to the math club?\u201d</p><p>In truth, Ellie had seen it, too\u2014the haunted, hunted look in Julia\u2019s eyes\u2014and she\u2019d wanted to reach out and help her younger sister. Julia had always felt things too keenly; it was what made her a great psychiatrist. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t listen to me, Peanut. You know that. She considers me only slightly smarter than a pet rock. Maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of footsteps stopped her.</p><p>Someone was running toward their office.</p><p>Ellie got to her feet just as the door swung open, hitting the wall with a crack.</p><p>Lori Forman skidded into the room. She was soaking wet and obviously cold; her whole body was shaking. Her kids\u2014Bailey, Felicia, and Jeremy\u2014were clustered around her. \u201cYou gotta come,\u201d Lori said to Ellie.</p><p>\u201cTake a breath, Lori. Tell me what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe me. Heck, I\u2019ve seen it and I don\u2019t believe me. Come on. There\u2019s something on Magnolia Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYee-ha,\u201d Peanut said. \u201cSomething\u2019s actually happening in town.\u201d She reached for her coat on the coatrack beside her desk. \u201cHurry up, Cal. Forward the emergency calls to your cell phone. We don\u2019t want to miss all the excitement.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was the first one out the door. </p> </body></html>"]
