He\u2019d calmed down some when they had boarded the plane, enough to offer her a reassuring smile, but now as they landed, he turned pale. Sweat gathered at his hairline. Gripping his cane, he scanned the human currents of the airport as they entered the terminal building. His fingers shook on the pewter wolf\u2019s head handle. She\u2019d seen him take out a couple of men half his age with that cane, but she doubted it would do them any good now.</p><p>He cleared his throat, licking his dry lips. \u201cNever contradict. Never ask questions. Don\u2019t speak until you\u2019re spoken to and then say as little as you can. If you\u2019re in trouble, bow. They consider it below them to strike a bowing servant.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded again. This was the sixth time he had recited the instructions to her. She realized it calmed him down, like a prayer, but his trembling voice ratcheted her own anxiety until it threatened to burst into an overwhelming panic. The airport, the booming announcements spilling from the speaker, the crush of the crowd, all of it blended into a smudged mess of colours and noises. Her mouth tasted bitter. Deep inside her a small voice protested, \u201cThis is just crazy. This can\u2019t be real.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will be fine,\u201d Gerald muttered, hoarsely. \u201cIt will be fine.\u201d</p><p>They passed the gates into a long hallway. The bag slipped off her shoulder, and Grace pulled it back on. The simple action crested her panic. She stopped. Her heart hammered, a steady heavy pressure pushing on her chest from inside out. A soft dullness clogged her ears. She heard herself breathing.</p><p>Twelve hours ago she woke up four states away, ate her usual breakfast of an egg and a toasted English muffin, and got ready to go to work, just like she had done every day. Then the doorbell rang and Uncle Gerald was on her doorstep with a wild story.</p><p>Grace always knew her family was special. They had power. Small magic - insignificant even - but it was more than ordinary people had, and Grace had realized early on she had to hide it. She knew there were other magic users in the world, because her mother had told her so, but she had never met any of them. She\u2019d thought they were like her, armed with minor powers, and rare.</p><p>According to Gerald, she was wrong. There were many other magic users in the world. Families, whole clans of them. They were dangerous, deadly and capable of terrible things. And one of these clans had their family in bonded service. They could call upon them at any time, and they had done so for years, demanding her mother\u2019s assistance whenever they needed it. Three days ago they requested Grace. Her mother had told her nothing; she simply went in her place. But Clan Dreoch called Gerald. They wanted Grace and only Grace. And so she flew to the Midwest, still dizzy from having her world turned upside down and listening to Gerald\u2019s shaky voice as he told stories of terrible magic.</p> <p>Her instincts screamed to run away, back into the airport filled with people who had no concept of magic. It was just an animal reaction, Grace told herself. The Dreochs had her mother and if she did run, her mother would have to take her place. Grace was twenty-six years old. She knew her responsibilities. She had no doubt her mother wouldn\u2019t survive whatever they demanded, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have required her presence. Grace knew what she had to do, but her nerves had been rubbed raw, and she simply stood, unable to move, her muscles locked into a rigid knot. She willed her body to obey, but it refused.</p><p>The crowd of people parted. A man stood at the end of the hallway. He seemed too large somehow, too tall, too broad, and emanated power. He loomed, a spot of otherworldly magic among people who stubbornly ignored his existence. She saw him with preternatural clarity, from the ash-blond hair falling to his shoulders to the pale green eyes, brimming with mournful melancholy like the eyes of a Russian icon. His was the face of a brute: powerful, stubborn, aggressive, almost savage in its severity.</p><p>He looked straight at her and in the depths of those green irises she saw an unspoken confirmation: he knew. He knew who she was, why she was here, and, more, if she were to turn around and dash away, he wouldn\u2019t chase her. The choice was hers and he was content to let her decide.</p><p>The flow of people blocked him and she reeled, released from the spell of his eyes.</p><p>Uncle Gerald thrust into her view. \u201cWhat is it? You have to come now, we can\u2019t keep them waiting, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, suddenly calm. Whatever would be would be. Her family owed a debt. Her mother had been paying it for years, carrying the burden alone. It was her turn. \u201cUncle,\u201d she said, holding on to her newfound peace.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be quiet now. They\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, stunned. Grace shouldered her bag and walked on.</p><p>They reached the end of the hallway. The man was gone, but Grace didn\u2019t worry about it. She headed to the twin slope of escalators. Behind her Gerald mumbled something to himself. They took the escalator down to the baggage claim.</p><p>\u201cGrace!\u201d The shot laced her ears. She wheeled about and saw her mother on the escalator rising in the opposite direction. Her mother stared at her, a horrified expression stamped on her face.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Mother turned around and clutched the escalator handrail, trying to head down, but two people in grey blocked her. She pushed against them. \u201cLet me through! Gerald, you old fool, what have you done? I\u2019ve lived my life, she hasn\u2019t. She can\u2019t do this. Damn it, let me through!\u201d</p> <p>The escalators dragged them in opposite directions. Grace spun around to run up the moving steps and saw the man with green eyes blocking her way. He towered behind her uncle, immovable like a mountain. Green eyes greeted her again. Power coursed through them and vanished, a sword shown and thrust back into its scabbard. Uncle Gerald turned, saw him and went as white as a sheet.</p><p>They reached the bottom. Three people in grey waited for them, one woman and two men. Grace stepped onto the floor, light-headed as if in a dream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done . . . I\u2019ve done the best I could,\u201d Gerald muttered. \u201cThe best. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done wonderfully,\u201d the woman said. \u201cNikita will escort you back to your plane.\u201d</p><p>One of the men stepped up and held out his hand, indicating the escalator heading up. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The green-eyed man stepped past them. His gaze paused on Grace\u2019s face. An unspoken command to follow. Grace clenched her teeth. They both knew she would obey, and they both realized she hated it.</p><p>He strode unhurriedly towards the glass doors. Grace matched her stride to his. She supposed she should have bowed and kept her mouth shut until she was spoken to, but she felt too hollow to care. \u201cYou robbed me of what might be my last moment with my mother,\u201d Grace said softly.</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be helped,\u201d he answered, his voice quiet and deep.</p><p>They stepped into sunshine in unison. A black vehicle waited for them, sleek and stylish. The trunk clicked open. Grace deposited her backpack into it. The man held the rear door open for her. Grace took her seat on the leather.</p><p>The man slid next to her, filling the vehicle with his presence. She felt the warmth of his body and the almost imperceptible brush of his magic. That light touch betrayed him. She glimpsed power slumbering inside him, like an enormous bear ready to be roused and enraged in an instant. It sent shivers down her back, and it took all of her will to not wrench the car door open and run for her life. \u201cYou\u2019re him.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The car pulled away from the kerb, carrying them off. Grace looked out of the window. She had made her choice. She was a servant of Clan Dreoch and there was no turning back.</p><p>The scenery rolled by, scrawny shrubs and flat land, its sparse-ness mirroring her bleak mood. Grace closed her eyes. A whisper of magic tugged on her. It was a polite touch, an equivalent to a bow. She glanced at him. Careful green eyes studied her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely name. You may call me Nassar.\u201d</p><p>Or \u201cMaster\u201d, she thought and bit the words before they had a chance to escape.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you know?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI know that my family owes your family a debt. One of you can call on one of us at any time and we must obey. If we break our oath, you\u2019ll murder all of us.\u201d She wished she had been told about it sooner, not that it would make any difference at the end.</p><p>His magic brushed her again and she edged away from it.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Nassar asked.</p><p>Say as little as possible. \u201cI know what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA revenant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>She looked him in the eye. \u201cA man who died and robbed another of his body so he can continue to live.\u201d The cursed revenant, Gerald had called him. A bodysnatcher. An abomination. Monstrously powerful, clouded in vile magic, a beast more than a man.</p><p>Nassar showed no reaction, but a small ripple in his magic sent her further away from him. She bumped into the door.</p><p>\u201cAny further and you\u2019ll fall out of the car,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYour magic . . . It\u2019s touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf all goes as planned, you and I will have to spend the next few days in close proximity. I need you to become accustomed to my power. Our survival will depend on it.\u201d</p><p>She sensed his magic halt a few inches from her, waiting tentatively. She was a servant; he could force her. At least he permitted her an illusion of free will. Grace swallowed and moved within its reach. His magic brushed her. She winced, expecting his power to mug her, but it simply touched her gently, as if her magic and his held hands.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he said. \u201cI know how people in your family see me. Body thief, aberration, murderer. The Cursed One. What I\u2019m called doesn\u2019t concern me. Neither I nor my family will torture, rape or degrade you in any way. I simply have a specific task I need completed. I need you to want to succeed with me. What would make you want to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreedom,\u201d she said. \u201cLet my family go, and I\u2019ll do whatever you ask.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t give you permanent freedom. We need your services too much. But I can offer you a temporary reprieve. If you and I succeed, you can go home and I promise not to call on you and yours for six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d The resolute tone of his voice told her it was his last offer.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWhat happens if I fail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll both die. But, our chances of success will be much better if you stop fearing me.\u201d</p><p>That was certainly true. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of you.\u201d</p> <p>His lips curved slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re terrified.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cThe sooner we get done, the faster I can go home. What do you need me to do?\u201d</p><p>Nassar reached into his jacket and took out a rolled-up piece of paper. \u201cIn our world disputes between the clans are resolved through war or by arbitration.\u201d</p><p>Grace arched her eyebrow. \u201cHow many clans are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve. We\u2019re now in dispute with Clan Roar. War is bloody, costly and painful for everyone involved and neither of the families can afford it now. We\u2019ve chosen arbitration. The issue is pressing and the dispute will be decided through a game.\u201d</p><p>He unrolled the picture and held it. She would have to move closer to him to see it. Grace sighed and moved another three inches to the right. Their thighs almost touched.</p> <p>Nassar showed her the paper. It was an aerial photograph of a city.</p><p>\u201cMilligan City,\u201d Nassar said. \u201cSquarely in the middle of the rust belt. A couple of decades ago it was a busy town, a blue-collar haven. Good life, family values.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefined future,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes. Then the conglomerates shifted their operations overseas. The jobs dried up, the real-estate values plummeted, and the residents fled. Now Milligan\u2019s population is down 42 per cent. It\u2019s a ghost city, with all the requisite ghost city problems: abandoned houses, squatters, fires and so on.\u201d He tapped the paper. \u201cThis particular neighbourhood is completely deserted. The city council\u2019s getting desperate. They relocated the last of the stragglers to the centre of the city and condemned this neighbourhood. In nine days, it will be bulldozed to make way for a park. The arbitration will take place here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I think of arbitration, I think of lawyers,\u201d Grace said. \u201cBoth sides present their case and argue to a third party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately this case isn\u2019t something that can be settled through litigation,\u201d Nassar answered. \u201cThink of it in this way: instead of having a large war, we decided to have a very small one. The rules are simple. This area of the city was warded off from the rest, hidden in the cocoon of magic and altered. It\u2019s been officially condemned, so no others are allowed near it. Those who try are firmly discouraged, but if someone does make it through, to their eyes the area will appear as it always was.\u201d</p><p>She chewed on that \u201cothers\u201d. Normal, non-magical people. He said it in the way one might refer to foreigners.</p><p>\u201cArbitration by game is a big event. By last count, representatives often clans have shown up for the fun. Two weeks were allowed to each clan who so wished to dump whatever hazards they could manage into this space. It\u2019s full of things that go bump in the night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe other clans don\u2019t like you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNone of the clans like each other. We compete for territory and business. We have wars and bloody battles. And it will be up to you and me to help us avoid such a war this time.\u201d He touched the photograph. \u201cSomewhere in the zone the arbitraries have hidden a small flag. Two teams will enter the game zone to retrieve the flag, while the rest of the clansmen will bet on the outcome and enjoy their popcorn. Whoever touches the flag first will win and be ported out of the zone. Whether the flag is retrieved or not, in three days\u2019 time the wards will constrict, sweeping anything magic from the area into its centre. The pyromancers will destroy it in a preternaturally hot bonfire, while the locals blissfully sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we one of the teams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Now she understood. Mother was almost fifty and overweight. She wouldn\u2019t be able to move fast enough. They needed someone younger and she fitted the bill. \u201cWill the rival team try to kill us?\u201d</p><p>Another light smile touched his lips. \u201cMost definitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any offensive magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re entirely too polite for that.\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment to catch the pun. \u201cI\u2019m a dud. I sense magic and I can do small insignificant things, but I can\u2019t foretell the future like my mother and I haven\u2019t been trained as a fighter like Gerald. For all practical purposes, I\u2019m the \u2018other\u2019, a completely ordinary person. I\u2019ve never fired a gun, I\u2019m not exceptionally athletic, and my strength and reflexes are average.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you need\u2014\u201d Magic stabbed her, cold and sharp, wrenching a startled gasp from her. Her eyes watered from pain.</p><p>\u201cLilian!\u201d Nassar barked.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d The chauffeur mashed a square button on her dashboard.</p><p>The roof of the vehicle slid aside. A dark sheath coated Nassar.</p><p>The pain pierced Grace\u2019s ribs, slicing its way inside.</p><p>Nassar jerked her to him. She collided with the hard wall of his chest, unable to breathe.</p><p>The dark sheath flared from him, filling the vehicle in long protrusions, shaping into a multitude of pale feathers.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Nassar snarled.</p><p>Grace threw her arms around his neck and they shot straight up, into the sky. Wind rushed at her. The pain vanished. She looked down and almost screamed \u2014 the car was far below.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic.\u201d</p><p>The flesh of Nassar\u2019s neck crawled under her fingers, growing thicker. She turned to him and saw a sea of feathers and, high above, huge raptor jaws armed with crocodile teeth. Her arms shook with the strain of her dead weight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d the monster reassured her in Nassar\u2019s voice.</p><p>Her hold gave. For a precious second, Grace clung to the feathers, but her fingers slipped. She dropped like a stone. Her throat constricted. She cried out and choked as a huge claw snapped closed about her stomach.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d The feathered monster bent his neck. A round green eye glared at her.</p><p>She sucked the air into her lungs and finally breathed. \u201cYour definition of OK has problems.\u201d The wind muffled her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>\u201cI said, your definition of OK has problems!\u201d The ground rolled past them, impossibly far. She clenched her hands on the enormous scaly talons gripping her. \u201cIs there any chance that this could be a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hammered so hard, she was worried it would jump out of her chest. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClan Roar - our opponents in the game. Or one of their agents, to be exact. They\u2019re not dumb enough to attack you directly. Once the game is scheduled, all hostilities between the participants must cease. Interference of this sort is forbidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lilian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can take care of herself.\u201d</p><p>Grace shivered. \u201cWhy would they be attacking me in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my defence. If they kill you, I\u2019ll have to withdraw from the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds ridiculous! You\u2019re the revenant and I can\u2019t even defend myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything later. We\u2019re beyond their range now and we\u2019ll arrive soon. Try to relax.\u201d</p><p>She was clutched in the talons of a monstrous creature, who was really a man trying to rescue her from a magical attack by flying hundreds of feet above solid ground. Relax. Right. \u201cI serve a madman,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Far beyond the fields, an empty piece of the horizon shimmered and drained down, revealing a dark spire. Tower Dreoch, Uncle Gerald had called it. He\u2019d said the Dreochs lived in a castle. She thought he\u2019d exaggerated.</p><p>Nassar careened, turning, and headed to the tower.</p><p>They circled the tower once before Nassar dived to a balcony and dropped her into a waiting group of people below. Hands caught her and she was gently lowered to the ground.</p><p>In the overcast sky, Nassar swung upwards and swooped down. The group parted. A dark-skinned woman grasped Grace by her waist and pulled her aside with the ease one picks up a child.</p><p>Nassar dived down. His huge talons skidded on the balcony and he tumbled into the room beyond. Feathers swirled. He staggered up. \u201cLeave us.\u201d</p><p>People fled past her. In a moment the room was empty.</p><p>Grace hugged herself. Up there, in the evening sky, the cold air had chilled her so thoroughly, even her bones felt iced over. Her teeth still chattered. She stepped to the double doors and shut them, blocking off the balcony and the draught with it.</p><p>The large rectangular room was simply but elegantly furnished: a table with some chairs, a wide bed with a gauzy blue canopy, a bookcase, some old, solidly built chairs before the fireplace. A couple of electric table lamps radiated soft yellow light. An oriental silk rug covered the floor.</p><p>Nassar slumped in front of the fireplace. Bright orange flames threw highlights on his feathers, making them almost golden in the front. His feathers seemed shorter. His jaws no longer protruded quite as much.</p><p>Grace crossed the carpet and stood before the fire, soaking in the warmth. It all seemed so dreamlike. Unreal.</p><p>\u201cThis will be your room for the next couple of days,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how strange this is to me,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>His smart eyes studied her. \u201cTell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my world people don\u2019t turn into . . . into this.\u201d She indicated him with her hand. His feathers definitely were shorter now. He\u2019d shrunk a little. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fly unless they have a glider or some sort of metal contraption with an engine designed to help them. Nobody tries to murder someone through magic. Nobody has mysterious castles masquerading as empty fields.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A careful knock interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your room,\u201d Nassar murmured.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she called.</p> <p>A man entered, pushing a small trolley with a teakettle, two cups, a dish of sugar, a ewer of cream and a platter with assorted cookies. As he passed her, she saw a short sword in a sheath at his waist. \u201cYour sister suggested tea, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery thoughtful of her.\u201d</p><p>The man left the trolley, smiled at Grace, and departed.</p><p>Grace poured two cups of tea.</p><p>\u201cI suppose in your world people don\u2019t drink tea either?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe drink tea,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cWe just don\u2019t always have servants armed with swords to bring it. Cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar and lemon, please.\u201d Nassar had returned to his normal size. The feathers were mere fur now, and his face was bare and completely human.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with your feathers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m consuming them to replenish some of my energy. Transformations such as this are difficult even for me.\u201d He sank into a chair, took a cup from her with furry fingers, and sipped from it. \u201cPerfect. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live to serve.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved into a familiar half-smile. \u201cSomehow I deeply doubt it.\u201d</p> <p>Grace sank into the other chair and sipped shockingly hot tea, liberally whitened by cream. Liquid heat flowed through her. His magic brushed her again, but she had flown over miles bathed in it and she accepted his touch without protest. She was so very tired. \u201cThis is a dream. I\u2019ll wake up, and all of this will be gone. And I\u2019ll go back to my quiet little job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you do?\u201d</p><p>Grace shrugged. He knew, of course. His clan had been keeping tabs on her family for years. When you own something, you want to pay attention to its maintenance. He probably knew what size of underwear she wore and how she preferred her steak. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a headhunter. You find jobs for others. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s boring at times and stressful, but I get to help people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know about your family\u2019s debt, did you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She refilled her cup.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it sudden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI always knew about magic. I was born able to feel it. At first I was told I was a very sensitive child, and then, once I was old enough to realize I needed to keep it to myself, more complicated explanations followed. I live in a world of very small magics. I can sense if I\u2019ll miss the bus. In school, I could usually foretell my grade on tests, but I could never predict anything else accurately. If I concentrate very hard, I can scare animals. A dog once tried to chase me, and I was frightened and sent it running.\u201d</p><p>She drank again. \u201cSmall things, mostly useless. I thought that all magic users were like me. Working their little powers in secret. I never imagined people could fly in the open. Or walk through crowded airports without being seen. My mother is a fabric buyer. My uncle\u2019s a mechanic who really likes weapons. My dad\u2019s normal in every way. My mother and he divorced when I was eighteen. He runs a shift at a tyre repair plant.\u201d</p><p>Grace drank more tea. Her head was fuzzy. She was so comfortable and warm in the soft chair. \u201cWhen Uncle Gerald told me this half-baked story about blood debt, I didn\u2019t believe him at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat convinced you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was terrified. Uncle Gerald is like a rock in the storm: always cool under pressure. I\u2019ve never seen him so off balance.\u201d</p><p>She yawned. She was so drowsy. \u201cI think my mother hoped I would never have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why,\u201d Nassar said softly. \u201cWe live in constant danger. I would think any mother would want to shield her child from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d Drowsiness overtook her. Grace set the cup down and curled into a ball in the chair. \u201cEven though your world is so . . .\u201d</p><p>She vaguely saw him rise from his chair. He picked her up, his magic cloaking about her. She should have been alarmed, but she had no resolve left.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo magical.\u201d</p><p>He drew the canopy aside and lowered her onto the bed. Her head touched the pillow and reality faded.</p><p>Nassar stepped out of the room, gently closing the door behind him. Alasdair waited in the hallway, a lean sharp shadow, with a robe draped over his arm. Nassar took it from him and shrugged it on, absorbing the last of his feathers. His whole body hurt from too much magic expended too quickly. Walking was like stepping on crushed glass.</p><p>\u201cIs she asleep?\u201d Alasdair asked.</p><p>Nassar nodded. They walked down the hall together.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty. Chestnut hair and chocolate eyes - a nice combination.\u201d</p><p>She was also calm under pressure, smart and wilful. When she looked at him with those dark eyes, Nassar felt the urge to say something intelligent and deeply impressive. Unfortunately, nothing of the kind came to mind. It seemed her eyes also had a way of muddling his thoughts. The last time he felt that dumb was about fourteen years ago. He\u2019d been eighteen at the time.</p><p>\u201cYou like the girl,\u201d Alasdair offered.</p><p>Nassar levelled a heavy gaze at him.</p><p>\u201cLilian said you tried to be funny in the car. I told her it couldn\u2019t possibly be true. The moment you try to make a joke, the sky shall split and the Four Horsemen will ride out, heralding Apocalypse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow droll. Did you double the patrols?\u201d</p><p>Alasdair nodded his dark head and stopped by the ladder. Nassar walked past him, heading to his rooms.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Alasdair called.</p><p>\u201cDid I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you joke with the girl?\u201d</p><p>Nassar kept walking.</p><p>\u201cDid she laugh?\u201d Alasdair called.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Nassar entered his room. He hadn\u2019t expected her to laugh. He was grateful she didn\u2019t collapse in a hysterical heap. Her uncle had been scared to within an inch of his life - fear had rolled off of him in waves. In Gerald\u2019s life of some fifty odd years his services had been requested only twice, but the second time had scarred him for life. In the zone he would be useless.</p><p>Grace\u2019s mother, Janet, was always meticulous and formal. She took no initiative. Working with her was like being in the presence of an automaton that obeyed his every order while being grimly determined to dislike it. Taking her into the zone, even if he could compensate for her age and health, would be suicide.</p><p>He was never comfortable with any of them. He was never comfortable with the whole idea of the bonded servant and took pains to avoid requesting their presence. But this time he had no choice.</p><p>Working with Grace presented its own set of difficulties. He could still remember her scent: the light clean fragrance of soap mixing with the faint rosemary from her dark hair. His memory conjured the feel of her body pressed against his and when he\u2019d picked her up to place her on the bed, he hadn\u2019t wanted to let go. He wasn\u2019t an idiot. There was an attraction there, and he would have to manage it very carefully. The imbalance of power between the two of them was too pronounced: he was the master and she was the servant. Don\u2019t think about it, he told himself. Don\u2019t imagine what it would be like. Nothing can happen. Nothing is going to happen. She\u2019s off-limits.</p><p>Grace followed the servant into a spacious atrium. Morning sun shone through the glass panels in the ceiling. The stone path wound between lush greenery, parallel to a stream lined with smooth river pebbles. Spires of bamboo rose next to ficus and ferns. Delicate orchids in half-a-dozen shades dotted the moss-covered ground. Red Kaffir lilies bloomed along the stream\u2019s banks, echoed by paler blossoms of camellia bushes. The air smelled sweet.</p><p>The path turned, parting, and Grace saw the origin of the stream: a ten-foot waterfall at the far wall. The water cascaded over huge grey boulders into a tiny lake. Near the shore stood a low coffee table surrounded by benches. A dark-haired man lounged on the bench to the left, sipping tea from a large cup.</p><p>Nassar stood next to him, talking softly. He wore blue sweatpants and a light-grey T-shirt. A towel hung over his shoulder and his pale hair was wet and brushed back from his face. Poised like this, he appeared massive. Muscles bulged on his chest when he moved his arm to underscore a point. His biceps stretched the sleeves of his shirt. His legs were long. Everything about him, from the breadth of his shoulders to the way he carried himself - controlled and aware of his size - communicated raw physical power. His wasn\u2019t the static bulk of a power weightlifter, but rather the dangerous, honed build of a man who required muscle to survive. If a genius sculptor wished to carve a statue and name it Strength, Nassar would\u2019ve made a perfect model.</p><p>He glanced at her. His green eyes arrested her and Grace halted, suddenly realizing she wanted to know what he would look like naked.</p><p>The thought shocked her.</p><p>Something in her face must\u2019ve equally shocked him, because he fell silent.</p><p>A torturous second passed.</p><p>She forced herself to move. Nassar looked away, resuming his conversation.</p><p>I can\u2019t be attracted to him. He forced me to come here and risk my life and I don\u2019t even know why. I know nothing about him. He\u2019s a monster. That last thought sobered her up. She approached the benches.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d Nassar said. His magic brushed her. \u201cThis is Alasdair, my cousin.\u201d</p><p>Alasdair unfolded himself from the bench. \u201cCharmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Grace nodded at Alasdair, then turned to Nassar. \u201cYou drugged my drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I drugged the cream,\u201d he said, \u201cand technically it was my sister who did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in shock. I wanted to spare you the breakdown and anxiety when you came out of it.\u201d</p><p>Grace held herself straight. \u201cI would appreciate it if you didn\u2019t do it again. We have a deal. I\u2019ll keep my part, but I can\u2019t do it if I have to watch what I eat and drink.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nassar considered it for a long moment. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA deal?\u201d Alasdair\u2019s eyebrows crept up. He was lean and sharp, his movements quick. His stare had an edge. If Nassar was a sword, Alasdair was a dagger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve agreed to do my best to help you and, in return, you\u2019ll leave my family alone for five years,\u201d Grace said.</p> <p>Alasdair grimaced at Nassar. \u201cThat\u2019s incredibly generous, considering what they\u2019ve done. We owe them nothing.\u201d</p><p>Nassar shrugged his massive shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s worth the reward to have her full cooperation.\u201d</p><p>Grace took a seat on the bench. \u201cWhat did we do exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Alasdair passed her a plate of scones.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>The dark-haired man glanced at Nassar, who shrugged. \u201cYou tell it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAt the end of the nineteenth century your family and our clan were in dispute,\u201d Alasdair said.</p><p>Grace was learning to decipher their code. \u201cIn other words, we were murdering each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. The dispute grew out of control and so our families agreed to end it. The peace was to be sealed through a wedding. Jonathan Mailliard of your family was to marry Thea Dreoch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was your great-grandfather\u2019s brother,\u201d Nassar supplied.</p><p>\u201cThe wedding went well,\u201d Alasdair continued. \u201cThere was a very nice reception in one of the Mailliard gathering halls, a beautiful old hotel. Everyone ate, drank and was merry. The couple went upstairs to their rooms, where Jonathan pulled out a knife and slit Thea\u2019s throat.\u201d</p> <p>Grace froze with a scone halfway to her mouth. She had expected something of this sort. To force her family into indefinite servitude, the crime had to be horrible. But it still shocked her.</p><p>\u201cHe waited for almost two hours by her cooling corpse,\u201d Alasdair continued, \u201cuntil the party died down. Then he and several Mailliard men and women went through the hotel door to door. They murdered Thea\u2019s sister, her husband and their twin daughters who were flower girls at the wedding. They killed Thea\u2019s parents and her two brothers, both minors, and would\u2019ve slaughtered the entire party, but they were seen by a Dreoch retainer, who started screaming. Our offensive magic was always stronger and we were inside your family\u2019s defences. There was a bloodbath. Every member of the Mailliard family was killed, except Thomas Mailliard, who was fourteen at the time. He hid in a closet and wasn\u2019t discovered until later in the day, when the butchery had stopped. Because Thomas was a child and hadn\u2019t participated in the slaughter, he was given a choice: death or servitude for all of his descendants. And that\u2019s why you now serve us.\u201d</p><p>Grace sat in a sickened silence.</p><p>\u201cAnything to say?\u201d Alasdair asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very horrible,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, I never knew Jonathan Mailliard. I didn\u2019t even know his name. I feel awful about the murder and I understand that my family bears responsibility, but I never killed anyone. I\u2019ve never hurt you and neither has my mother, my uncle nor my great-grandfather, who hid in the closet.\u201d She tried to make her voice sound calm and reasonable. \u201cI\u2019ve done you no harm, yet you limit my freedom and force me to risk my life because of a crime perpetrated a century ago by someone I\u2019ve never met. Our family has served yours for over a hundred years. At some point this debt will have been repaid. When do you think will that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Alasdair said.</p> <p>It felt like a slap. She looked to Nassar. \u201cSo this is how you do things? You dumped all of the blame for a bloody feud onto a fourteen-year-old child who hid in a closet, and because he failed to stop grown men from killing, you keep his descendants in perpetual servitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly perpetual,\u201d Nassar corrected. \u201cSince I assumed the responsibility for the clan fifteen years ago, I\u2019ve called on your family only four times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we know we can be called on at any point. We have to live with the knowledge that at a moment\u2019s notice we might be required to risk our life for a complete stranger for no reason and we might never see our loved ones again. We can\u2019t refuse. The terms are obedience or death. Would you want to live like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nassar admitted.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me when the debt will be paid?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThis arrangement is to our advantage,\u201d Nassar said. \u201cIt makes no sense for us to release you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019ll have to release us then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Alasdair gave a short barking laugh. \u201cHow exactly are you planning on doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy uncle has no offspring and I\u2019m my mother\u2019s only child. To my knowledge, I\u2019m the last of the Mailliards. I\u2019ll have to make sure that I don\u2019t continue the line.\u201d She rose. \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen the washroom on the way here. I really need to splash some water on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond door on the right,\u201d Nassar told her.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>Grace walked away. Her knees shook a little in her jeans. Her face burned.</p><p>Nassar watched Grace\u2019s figure retreat down the winding path.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Alasdair offered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink she\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Mailliard.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d seen the same steely resolve in her mother\u2019s eyes, Nassar reflected. He suspected it was the same will that drove the wedding night atrocities a century ago. It enabled her mother, Janet, to grimly bear her service, and fuelled Grace\u2019s fight against it. He doubted she would ever go into outright rebellion, not while her mother and Gerald were alive, but he could tell by the way she held herself, by her face and her eyes and her voice, that she would rather give up her future children than bring them into the Dreochs\u2019 \u201cservice\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou like her,\u201d Alasdair said.</p><p>\u201cWhat of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a move?\u201d</p><p>The imbalance of power between them was too great, and her antipathy and contempt for Clan Dreoch was painfully obvious. Nassar took the towel off his shoulder and sat on the bench. \u201cBecause she can\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>When Grace returned, Alasdair was gone; Nassar sat alone. It was easier if she simply admitted it, Grace decided. Sometimes you see another person in passing, your eyes meet, and you know by some instinct that there is something there. She felt that something for Nassar.</p><p>It was wrong on so many levels that her head reeled from simply contemplating it. He was a revenant, a creature more than a man. Her great-grandfather\u2019s brother slaughtered his relatives. His family held hers in bondage. If he really wanted her, he could simply order her to submit. Maybe it was some sort of twisted version of Stockholm syndrome. Or an animal attraction. He was . . . not handsome exactly, but very male. Powerful. Masculine. Strong. But there was more to if. the sadness in his eyes, the courteous way he managed himself, the feel of his magic. It pulled her to him and she would have to be very careful to keep her distance.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me what you need me to do,\u201d she said.</p><p>He rose. \u201cWalk with me, please.\u201d</p><p>Grace followed him down the path deeper into the atrium. Nassar led her out through an arched door and into a large round chamber. Bare, it was lit by sunlight spilling through a skylight very high above. A thick metal grate guarded the skylight. Plain concrete made up the floor, showing a complicated geometric pattern with a circle etched into its centre. Nassar stood on its edge.</p><p>\u201cWhen a revenant takes a new body, he gains great power but he also inherits the weaknesses of that body. The body I took was cursed. After I transferred into it, I was able to heal the damage and break the curse. But all of my invulnerability to the curse is gone. I\u2019ve used it all up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the man who was born in this body? What happened to him when you took it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died,\u201d Nassar said.</p><p>She\u2019d hoped he wouldn\u2019t say that.</p><p>A woman entered the chamber through the door in the opposite wall. A pale blonde like Nassar. She smiled at them. Nassar didn\u2019t quite smile back, but the melancholy of his face eased slightly.</p><p>\u201cThis is Elizavetta. My sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Liza,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d Grace said simply. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who drugged the cream.\u201d</p><p>Liza nodded. \u201cYes. Alasdair warned me I may have earned your undying hate for it. I sincerely hope we can put it past us. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven that I\u2019m a servant, my feelings are hardly relevant, but I appreciate it,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>Liza blinked. An uncomfortable silence ensued. Nassar cleared his throat. \u201cLiz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, right.\u201d Liza stepped inside the design.</p><p>\u201cEvery revenant has a fatal weakness,\u201d Nassar said, his gaze fixed on his sister. \u201cThis is mine.\u201d</p><p>Liza arched her back, spreading her arms. Her hands clawed the air. She spun in a place, twisting. Magic pulsed from her and filled the lines etched on the floor with pale yellow light. Liza brought her hands together, cried out and forced them apart with a pained grimace. A clump of mottled darkness appeared between her fingers. She stepped back.</p><p>The clump spun, growing, and ruptured, vomiting a creature into the circle. The beast was three-feet long and slender, shaped like a slug or a leech except for the fringe of carmine feathery hairs along its sides. A patina of grey and sickly yellow swirled over its dark hide, like an oil rainbow on the surface of a dark puddle.</p><p>The creature shivered. The red fringe trembled and it took to the air, sliding soundlessly a foot off the ground. A cold, foul magic emanated from it. It touched Grace. She jerked back and bumped into Nassar.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on her shoulder, steadying her. \u201cA marrow worm. They live in dark places, where there is stagnant water and decay. They feed on small animals, fish and old magic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The worm hovered behind the glowing outline of the circle. Its head was blunt and as it rose up, testing the boundaries of its invisible cage, Grace saw a slit of a mouth lined with sharp serrated teeth on its underside.</p><p>Liza approached the worm. The creature shied away, sliding as close to the glowing lines as it could.</p><p>\u201cThink of them as germs. Most people have a natural resistance to them, an immunity. I don\u2019t. To me, they\u2019re fatal. We did our best to keep this fact to ourselves, but I have no doubt the Roars know it. They would be fools not to. Unfortunately, marrow worms are easy to summon.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d stepped behind her and she was painfully sensitive to the presence of his large body only an inch from her back. His magic touched her. Her every nerve shivered, hyper-aware of his movements. She sensed him lean to her and almost jumped when his quiet voice spoke into her ear. \u201cDo you remember when you sent that dog running? I want you to do that again.\u201d</p><p>Grace swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what I did. It just happened.\u201d</p><p>His big hand pushed against her back gently, making her take a step towards the circle. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>Grace took a deep breath and stepped over the glowing lines inside the circle. The worm jerked away from her like a wet ribbon. Grace glanced at Nassar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just normal resistance to humans. Keep trying.\u201d</p> <p>Grace stared at the worm twisting. Go away, she thought. Gone. I want you gone.</p><p>The worm remained where it was.</p><p>Grace glanced at Liza. \u201cAny idea what I\u2019m supposed to be doing?\u201d</p><p>Nassar\u2019s sister shook her blonde head. \u201cNone. Dreochs are aggressors. We have few defensive abilities and they\u2019re radically different from yours. Mostly our defences consist of Nassar hacking at things with something large and sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe magic you\u2019re trying to do is called the Barrier,\u201d Nassar said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the natural Mailliards\u2019 magics. Very talented members of your family used it both as a defence and as a weapon. Your mother stated that it can\u2019t be taught. You simply do it or you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Grace focused on the worm and tried to pretend it was a large, mean-looking German shepherd.</p> <p>An hour later she sat exhausted on the floor. The worm floated at the edge of the design.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless.\u201d Liza unscrewed a cap from a fresh bottle of water. She had gotten a cooler with drinks, migrated to the wall, and now sat on the floor. \u201cWhy Janet didn\u2019t practise with Grace is beyond me, but she didn\u2019t. We\u2019ll have to change the plan. Instead of you and Grace, I\u2019ll go with Alasdair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Steel laced Nassar\u2019s voice. He leaned against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>Nassar\u2019s face was dark like a storm. \u201cBoth of you will die. I have resistances and power to counter Clan Roar\u2019s attacks. You don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t counter this one.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just turn into a bird and fly through the zone?\u201d Grace asked.</p> <p>\u201cFlight is forbidden in the game,\u201d Nassar answered.</p><p>Liza sighed. \u201cGrace, would you like some water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Liza tossed her a new bottle.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Grace caught it. \u201cWhy are you fighting the Roars anyway? What\u2019s this dispute about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about children,\u201d Nassar said. \u201cAnd killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur aunt married a member of Clan Roar,\u201d Liza said. \u201cArthur Roar. He turned out to be a wart on the ass of the human kind: abusive, violent, cruel. She left after eight years and took their three kids with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve left sooner,\u201d Nassar said. His green eyes promised violence, the light irises so cold that Grace took a small step back.</p><p>\u201cShe had her reasons for staying,\u201d Liza said. \u201cThere was a large dowry involved and she didn\u2019t want us to have to pay restitution and interest. But in the end it was just too much. After Arthur broke his son\u2019s legs, she grabbed the kids and came home. Now, nine years later, Arthur suddenly wants his children back.\u201d</p><p>Liza took a drink from her bottle. \u201cHe\u2019s never shown any interest in them. No calls, no letters, not even a card. He\u2019s done nothing to support them. But Aunt Bella signed the wedding agreement that specified equal amount of time with the children for each parent in the event of separation. Arthur claims that since the kids were with her exclusively for nine years, now he has exclusive rights to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a damn about the kids. It\u2019s an excuse for the Roars to test the waters,\u201d Nassar said. \u201cThey have a couple of strong people and they\u2019re thinking of moving in on our interests. Before they do it, they want to weaken us. They knew that if they challenged the clan, I would enter the game, and they believe they have a reasonable chance of killing me. They\u2019ll knock out the biggest power user of our clan and earn respect from other clans for killing a revenant, and they will do it all before the war ever starts.\u201d</p><p>He pushed from the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for lunch. Let\u2019s take a break.\u201d</p><p>Lunch was laid out on a long table in a vast dining hall. Nassar held out a chair for Grace and she sat down. He took a place to her right, while Liza sat down at her left, next to Alasdair. Other people came into the room \u2014 two men and three women. They took their seats, nodded and smiled, started conversations in calm voices. Alasdair said something and a woman laughed. They were so at ease and the warmth of their interaction began to thaw Grace\u2019s resolve.</p><p>The four chairs directly opposite her remained empty. She wondered who would sit there and a couple of minutes later she had her answer. Three children entered the room, followed by a pale woman. Of course. Nassar had arranged it so she would spend the meal looking at the faces of the children whose fate would be decided in the game.</p><p>They took their seats: the woman with careworn eyes, a young boy with a wild mass of dark hair, and two girls, one slender and blonde, and the other only about ten or so, with short dark hair and big blue eyes. The youngest girl saw Nassar and came grinning around the table. \u201cHug?\u201d she asked him seriously.</p><p>\u201cHug,\u201d he agreed and put his massive arms around her.</p><p>\u201cAnd no dying,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>He let go and nodded.</p><p>The girl noticed her. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Polina.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible not to smile back. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to protect Nassar,\u201d Polina said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he tells me.\u201d</p><p>The child looked at her with her blue eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let him die,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</p><p>Polina went around the table to her seat. Grace leaned to Nassar and whispered, \u201cLaying it on a little thick, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t put her up to it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She glanced into his green eyes and believed him.</p><p>Lunch went on. Dishes were brought and passed around the table: roast beef and mashed potatoes, green beans, corn, iced tea and lemonade. The food was delicious, but Grace ate little. Mostly she watched the children. The boy leaned to his mother, making sure her cup was filled. The older girl seemed on the verge of tears. She became more and more agitated, until finally, just as peach cobbler made its way past Grace, the girl dropped her fork. Her voice rang out. \u201cWhat if they win?\u201d</p><p>The table fell quiet.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Nassar said calmly.</p><p>\u201cIf Arthur touches us, I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Steel vibrated in the boy\u2019s voice.</p><p>Their mother leaned her elbows on the table and rested her forehead on her hands. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not strong enough,\u201d she told him in a dull voice. \u201cNot yet. You must do whatever it takes to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Nassar\u2019s magic surged out, spreading behind him like invisible wings. It brushed against Grace. Breath caught in her throat. So much power . . .</p><p>Nassar fixed the children with his stare. \u201cYou\u2019re our kin. You belong to Clan Dreoch. Nobody will take you from us. Anyone who tries will have to go through me.\u201d</p><p>With his power rising above the table, the prospect of going through him seemed impossible. His magic was staggering. It would take an army.</p><p>The anxiety slowly melted from the children\u2019s faces.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try again,\u201d Nassar said, as the two of them strode back into the room.</p><p>The worm still floated in the circle. Grace stepped inside. It shied from her. \u201cWhy did you tell the children about the curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to them. The possibility of defeat exists and they have to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>That defeat seemed very likely at the moment.</p><p>\u201cBut I will fight to the death to keep them safe. And even if I lose, the clan won\u2019t surrender them. We will go to war. We won\u2019t turn over children to a man who will break their bones.\u201d</p><p>Neither would she. It didn\u2019t matter who they were. A child was a child. She couldn\u2019t let them suffer, not after watching them near panic with the fear of having to leave their mother. Their family and their home, all would be ripped away if Nassar and she lost.</p><p>\u201cNow do you understand why I fight?\u201d he asked her softly.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI need your help desperately. Please help me, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could,\u201d she said, her voice filled with regret.</p><p>Nassar watched her for a long moment. \u201cWhat do you remember about your encounter with the dog? What did you feel?\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned. \u201cIt was twelve years ago. I remember being scared for myself. And for the dog. He was my friend\u2019s dog. I knew that if he bit me, he would be put down.\u201d</p><p>Nassar strode to her, a determined look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Nassar kept coming.</p><p>She realized he was going to cross the line. \u201cLiza isn\u2019t here to save you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gave her the familiar half-smile. \u201cOnly you can save me now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nassar stepped over the line. The worm streaked to him. It skimmed the surface of his magic and clamped onto his shoulder. Nassar\u2019s magic shrunk. He staggered and ripped the worm off. Grace cried out.</p><p>The worm flipped in the air and slid over him. Nassar tried to knock it off, but it slipped past his hands and leeched onto his side. Nassar gasped. His face went bloodlessly white. He spun, tripping over his feet, pulling at the writhing body, and stumbled to her. The worm slithered from his fingers and swooped down on him. Nassar fell.</p><p>Grace lunged forwards. She meant to thrust herself in front of it, but instead magic pulsed from her in a controlled, short burst. The worm hurtled back, swept aside.</p> <p>She pushed harder and the worm convulsed, squeezed between the press of her power and the glowing lines. \u201cNassar?\u201d She knelt by him. \u201cNassar, are you OK?\u201d</p><p>Nassar\u2019s green eyes looked at her. His nose bled. He wiped away his blood with the back of his hand. \u201cProtective instinct,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p><p>It felt so right. As if the pressure straining at her from the inside suddenly found an outlet. So that\u2019s what she\u2019d been missing. All these years, she had suspected there was something more to the magic coursing through her and now she finally found it.</p><p>\u201cI guess I did,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWere you scared for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. How could you have done that? That was so reckless. What if I couldn\u2019t save you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped you could,\u201d he said.</p><p>The way he looked at her made her want to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cYour family is free,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve let Clan Mailliard go,\u201d he said. \u201cI signed the order before lunch.\u201d</p> <p>She sank to the floor. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sat up. \u201cBecause I decided that\u2019s not what I do. I don\u2019t force people to fight our battles. I don\u2019t want to be the man who blames children for their parents\u2019 mistakes. And I don\u2019t want you to be the last of the Mailliards. Whether you have children should be your choice alone. I don\u2019t want to take it away from you.\u201d</p><p>It slowly dawned on her. \u201cSo I\u2019m free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me. I could just take off right now and leave you here to deal with the game on your own. Do you have any idea how scared I am? I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d He gave her another sad smile.</p><p>She hung her head, torn. She was deeply, deeply afraid. But walking away from the children wasn\u2019t in her. She wouldn\u2019t be able to look herself in the eye. It was as if they stood in the road with a semi hurtling at them at full speed. What kind of person wouldn\u2019t push them out of harm\u2019s way?</p><p>\u201cI should practise more,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need another worm then,\u201d Nassar said.</p><p>She glanced at the beast. It lay dead, sliced in half.</p><p>\u201cYou killed it,\u201d he told her. \u201cSometimes the Barrier magic can also become a blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to worry about that now,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as you can defend me, we should be fine.\u201d</p><p>Three days later Grace stood in the middle of the street in Milligan City, hugging herself as the sun set slowly. Nassar loomed next to her. Behind them unfamiliar people moved, their magic shifting with them, their clothes colour-coded by their clan: grey and black for Dreoch, green for Roar, red for Madrid. Nassar had explained the rest of the colours, but she couldn\u2019t recall any of it. The anxiety pulsated through her with every heartbeat.</p><p>Ahead a seemingly empty stretch of a suburban street rolled into the sunset. The round, red sun hung low above the horizon, a glowing brand upon the clouds.</p><p>Familiar magic brushed her and a heavy hand touched her shoulder gently. Nassar. He wore grey pants tucked into military boots. A long-sleeved shirt hugged his arms and over it he wore a leather vest that wanted very much to be called armour. She wore the same outfit. The leather fitted her loosely enough not to be constricting, but tight enough not to get in the way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Nassar said.</p><p>Her gaze slid to the large axe strapped to his waist. She touched her own blade, a long, narrow combat knife. Gerald had taught her the basics of knife-fighting a long time ago but she\u2019d never been in a real fight.</p><p>A male voice rose to the side. \u201cCan he bring a servant into the game?\u201d</p><p>It took a moment to sink in. Of course, her status would be public knowledge among them, but it still cut her like a knife. She turned. A group of people stood on the side. Five of them wore dark blue robes. The arbitrators, she remembered from Nassar\u2019s explanations. An older female in the arbitrator robe regarded her with serious grey eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to withdraw, you may do so now,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>She could withdraw. She could simply refuse to go in. If she did, Nassar would be doomed. He had already committed to the game and she knew he couldn\u2019t simply substitute someone else in his place. He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Overnight, her fears had grown into near panic. Now she could walk away from them.</p><p>Grace looked at the gathering of the clansmen. Her family used to be a clan. Her people should have stood right here. Instead the clansmen viewed her as a servant. Pride spiked in her. She had as much right to be here as anybody else. The vague feeling of unease that had eaten at her ever since Nassar had transformed into a bird crystallized and she finally understood it: it was envy. Envy of the magic used freely. Envy of knowledge. Circumstances had jettisoned her out of this world, but she refused to stay locked out.</p><p>Grace drew herself to her full height. \u201cWhy in the world would I want to withdraw?\u201d</p><p>A red-haired man in Clan Roar\u2019s green shook his head. \u201cShe can\u2019t refuse. She isn\u2019t even properly trained. She\u2019s a servant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any more,\u201d Nassar said softly behind her.</p><p>The gathering suddenly grew quiet.</p><p>The arbitrator surveyed them for a long moment. \u201cNassar, am I to understand that you\u2019ve released Clan Mailliard from their service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>The arbitrator looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re here of your own free will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>The arbitrator glanced at the Roar clansman. \u201cThere is your answer. Let the record reflect that Clan Mailliard chose to assist Clan Dreoch. You have our leave to proceed.\u201d</p><p>They passed her. Grace let out her breath.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Nassar murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Two young men in Clan Roar\u2019s green came to stand at the other end of the street. Both were lean, strong and hard, as if twisted from leather and twine. Both had long hair bound into horse tails: one red, one black.</p><p>Nassar leaned to her. \u201cConn and Sylvester Roar. Powerful, but they lack experience.\u201d</p><p>The arbitrators passed between them, blocking her vision. As the blue robes fluttered by, Grace saw Conn Roar turn to her. He grinned, his eyes alight with feral fire, and snapped his teeth.</p><p>Alarm dashed down her spine in a rush of cold. She raised her eyebrows. \u201cSomeone forgot his muzzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee the pendant around Conn\u2019s neck?\u201d</p><p>Grace glanced at a small black stone hanging on a long chain.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a summoning stone. They\u2019ll use its power to manifest creatures.\u201d</p><p>Marrow worms. They\u2019d use it to summon the marrow worms. Nassar had warned her that the Roars would try to kill them. Him, specifically. The game was only the opening salvo to the hostilities between the two clans, and the Roars wanted to land the first blow by taking out the Dreochs\u2019 best magic user.</p><p>The arbitrators raised their hands. A controlled surge of magic washed over the street. The reality drained down, as if it were a reflection in a melting mirror. A new street opened before them. Green and red lianas hung from the dark, sinister houses. Kudzu vines climbed in and out of windows. To the left a huge clump of yellow foam dripped rancid red juice onto the street. A puddle of brown slime slivered across the asphalt like an amoeba and slipped into the storm drain under the light of street lamps. Ahead something furry dashed across the intersection: a long, shaggy body with too many legs.</p><p>Somewhere in that zone a flag waited. Whoever touched the flag would be instantly transported out. They just had to survive long enough to reach it.</p><p>The woman arbitrator raised her hand, fist closed. Next to Grace, Nassar tensed.</p><p>\u201cLet the game begin!\u201d A white light pulsed from the arbitrator\u2019s fingers. The crowd erupted in a ragged cheer.</p><p>The two Roar clansmen screamed in unison. Flesh bulged out from under their skin. Their bodies contorted, their limbs thickened. Black fur sheathed their skin. Horns burst through their manes. Their eyes drowned in golden glow and an extra pair opened beside the first set. As one they raised monstrous faces up, the sharp fangs in their jaws silhouetted against the red sky. Eerie howls tore free from their throats, blending into a haunting song of hunt and murder.</p><p>The Roars dashed into the zone on all fours. Nassar watched them go, his face calm. Leaping and growling, they turned the corner and vanished behind the abandoned houses. The echoes of their snarls died. Nassar took his axe from its sheath, rested it on his shoulder, and strode into the zone, unhurried. Grace swallowed and followed in his footsteps.</p><p>The street lay quiet. They would be watched by magical means while in the zone, but for now the press of many stares bore directly into her back. Her nerves knotted into a clump.</p><p>They reached the intersection.</p><p>A hint of movement on the roof of a two-storey house made her turn. Grace frowned.</p><p>A flat, wide shape leaped off the roof, aiming at her. She caught a glimpse of a fang-studded mouth among bulging veins. Too stunned to move, she simply stared.</p><p>Nassar\u2019s huge back blocked the mouth. A hot whip of magic sprung from his hand, cleaving the creature in two. Twin halves of the beast fell to the ground, spilling steaming guts onto the asphalt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to dodge,\u201d Nassar said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The enormous blue beast bore on them. Grace watched it come. It thundered down the street, its six stumpy legs mashing potholes in the crumbling pavement.</p><p>In the past seven hours, she\u2019d used her magic for defence countless times. Blood splattered her face, some dried to flecks, some still wet. Her side burned where a red, furry serpent had bitten her before Nassar chopped off both of its heads. A long rip split her left pant leg, exposing puckered flesh of the calf where a liana stung her with its suckers. It never ended. There was always a new horror waiting to pounce on them from some dark crevice. Grace clenched her teeth and watched the beast charge.</p><p>It brushed against a house, sending a shower of broken boards in the air, and kept coming, cavernous mouth gaping wide, the sound of its stomping like a cannon blast salute at a funeral. Boom-boom-boom.</p> <p>Keep it together. Keep it steady.</p><p>Boom-boom-boom.</p><p>The beast was almost on her. Two bloodshot eyes glared. The black mouth opened, ready to devour her.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Nassar barked.</p><p>She slammed her magic into it.</p> <p>With a surprised roar, the beast rammed the invisible barrier. Her feet slid back from the pressure. The beast\u2019s momentum pitched it to the side. The mammoth body fell, paws in the air. Nassar leaped over it, a feral shadow caught in the moonlight. White light sliced like a huge blade from his hand and Nassar landed by her. Filthy and bloody, he looked demonic.</p><p>Behind him the beast lay split open, like a chicken with a cleaved breastbone. The soft, beach-ball-sized sac of its heart palpitated once, twice, and stopped,</p><p>Grace stared mutely at the carcass. She had never imagined the night could hide things like it - terrible, awful things. She felt like she had aged a lifetime.</p><p>A soft humming filled her skull. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Nassar grasped her face and turned it to him.</p><p>\u201cBuzzing.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his head, listened and grabbed her hand. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d learned not to ask why. They sprinted, zigzagging through the labyrinthine streets, past overgrown lawns, past an abandoned playground, where small things with round red eyes clutched at the jungle gym with sharp claws, past office buildings, and burst into a park. In the middle of the park lay a pond, bordered by a row of street lamps spilling orange light. The moon slid from the clouds, illuminating the water\u2019s surface and the raised concrete basin of a dried fountain in the centre.</p><p>Nassar pulled her into the water and pointed to the fountain. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>She swam through the murky water without thinking. Something soft brushed her legs. She shied and squeezed a frantic burst of speed from her exhausted body. Dizziness came and then her hand hit the concrete base. She pulled herself up. Nassar climbed up next to her, grabbed her by her waist and hoisted her up into the seven-foot-wide basin. She fell on dried leaves and dirt.</p><p>The buzzing grew louder, steady and ominous like the hum of a giant engine.</p><p>An invisible whirlpool of magic built around Nassar. He stood cocooned in its fury, his axe held high. His body trembled under the pressure. The cuts and gashes on his arms reopened and bled.</p><p>The buzzing swelled like a tidal wave.</p><p>She saw the axe fall in an arc, its tip prickling the pond. The magic sucked itself into the axe handle and burst through its blade into the water. The pond became preternaturally calm, its surface smooth like glass. The buzzing vanished.</p> <p>Nassar swayed. Grace grabbed his shoulders and pulled him against the lip of the basin, steadying him. His hand squeezed hers. He turned carefully, leaped up, and pulled himself into the basin next to her.</p><p>A swarm of insects spilled from the street. Green and segmented, like grasshoppers armed with enormous teeth, they were the size of a large cat. They streamed around the water in a mottled mass, bodies upon bodies, but none touching the pond.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d Grace whispered hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cAkora. The spell keeps them out of the water. As long as nothing disturbs the surface, they can\u2019t see or hear us. Don\u2019t worry. They can\u2019t survive the sun. They\u2019ll stay here entranced by the spell until morning.\u201d He lay on his back and closed his eyes.</p><p>Across the water the green insects crawled over the stone benches, perched on lamp posts, and combed the weeds of the once perfectly cut lawn. They had surrounded the pond. Everywhere Grace looked long segmented legs rubbed, sharp mandibles gnawed on random refuse and backs split to flutter pale wings.</p><p>There were too many of them.</p><p>She felt so hollow. The seven hours she had spent in this place had consumed her: there was nothing left inside her. \u201cWe\u2019ll die here,\u201d Grace whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll eat us, and I\u2019ll never see my mother again.\u201d What was the point of going on? They\u2019d never make it out. She no longer cared if they would.</p><p>A warm hand grasped her and pulled her with irresistible strength snug against Nassar\u2019s chest. His arms closed about her, shielding her, shocking her cold body with their heat. His cheek rested against her hair. \u201cI won\u2019t let you die, Grace,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t let you die.\u201d</p><p>She lay rigid against his chest, her face in his neck, listening to his strong, even heartbeat. His lips grazed her cheek. \u201cI must be out of my mind,\u201d he whispered and his mouth closed on hers.</p><p>He kissed her, at first gently, then harder, as if he tried to breathe his life into her. She felt numb, but he persisted, his kiss passionate and searing. His arms caged her. His large hard body cradled hers, keeping her from slipping off into the empty deadness. His magic wrapped them both. He kissed her again and again, anchoring her, refusing to let her go. Caught on the threshold between complete numbness and painful awareness, Grace teetered, unsure. He pulled her back to life, back to the desperate reality. She didn\u2019t want to face it.</p><p>A shudder ran through her. She closed her eyes and let him part her lips with his tongue. He drank her in and finally she thawed. She wanted to live, to survive so she could feel this again. She wanted Nassar.</p><p>Tears wet her cheeks.</p><p>Nassar released her mouth and crushed her to him. \u201cI want you so much,\u201d he whispered, his green eyes looking into the distance. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t have you. I really must be cursed.\u201d</p><p>She lay in his arms for a long time.</p><p>The coal darkness of the sky faded to the pale grey of predawn. Grace stirred. \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cWhy did you become a revenant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was dying,\u201d he answered, his voice hoarse. \u201cWe had a feud with the Garveys. They cornered my brother, John, and I went to get him. John didn\u2019t want to be taken alive. He didn\u2019t think help was coming, and he cursed himself and all those around him with a plague of marrow worms. A suicide curse is very potent. I brought him out of the trap, but the curse had caught me. We were both dying and the family could do nothing to keep us alive. I\u2019d lost consciousness. John knew that if I took his body, I\u2019d gain a temporary boost of power to break the curse. He made the family commence the ritual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sacrificed himself?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes. I remember there was a rush of red, like I was swimming through a sea of blood and drowning, and then I saw this shape floating in the depths. I thought it was my body and I knew if I wanted to survive, I had to get to it. I grabbed it, saw it was John . . . The pull to live was too strong. I awoke in my brother\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>She put her arms around his neck and kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI killed my brother so I could live,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any worse than that.\u201d</p><p>She simply held him.</p><p>A low growl froze both of them. Grace flipped onto her stomach and glanced over the lip of the basin. In the night, the insects had stopped moving. They lay still now, entranced by the spell, their chitin mirroring the grass and weeds around them so closely that if she didn\u2019t know they were there, she would\u2019ve mistaken them for heaps of vegetation.</p><p>A lean muscled creature trotted along the edge of the pond. It gripped the ground with four oversized paws armed with sickle claws. Its serpentine tail lashed its dark pelt, which was spotted with flecks of red and yellow. The beast padded down the shore, its dragon-like jaws hanging open, showing off fangs the size of her fingers. Foamy spit leaked from between its teeth, staining the long tuft of red and yellow fur hanging from its chin. It halted, sniffed the air and turned to the basin. Four glowing amber eyes glared at her.</p><p>\u201cSylvester Roar,\u201d Nassar murmured.</p><p>Sylvester sniffed the water. His narrow muzzle wrinkled. He looked like he was grinning at them with his monstrous mouth.</p><p>Nassar growled. \u201cNo, you young idiot! Can\u2019t you see the spell on the water?\u201d</p><p>Sylvester snapped his teeth and snarled in a feral glee. An eerie raspy growl came from between his teeth. \u201cI see you, Nassar. You can\u2019t hide from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInexperienced fool.\u201d Nassar reached for his axe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, Nassar. I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d Sylvester gave a short ragged howl and splashed into the water. Little waves ran over the surface of the pond. Behind Sylvester the akora swarm swelled. Buzzing filled the air. Sylvester turned\u2014</p><p>Nassar grabbed Grace and forced her to the floor of the basin, next to him.</p><p>A hoarse scream sliced through the morning, a terrible howl of a creature in impossible agony being torn to pieces. Grace squeezed her eyes shut. Sylvester screamed and screamed, the buzzing of the akora a morbid choir to his shrieks, until finally he fell silent.</p><p>Grace lay still, afraid to breathe. Slowly she opened her eyes.</p><p>An akora perched on the lip of the basin. It sighted her with dead black eyes. Its back split, releasing a pale gauze of wings.</p><p>Sun broke above horizon. Its rays struck the insect. Tiny cracks split its shiny thorax. The insect shrieked and fled, breaking apart over the pond. Grace rose. All around the pond the insect horde fractured and crumbled under the rays of the sun. The air smelled faintly of smoke. She looked beyond the heaps of melting insects and drew a sharp breath. Past the park, to the right, rose a tall heap of rubble that had been a multistorey building in its former life. Atop the rubble a small white flag fluttered in the wind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe flag!\u201d</p><p>Nassar had already seen it and jumped into the water. Together they swam across the pond. As she waded onto the solid ground, Grace passed a human skeleton, stripped bare of all flesh - all that remained of Sylvester.</p><p>Nassar moved cautiously along the sidewalk, jogging lightly on his feet, axe at the ready. She followed him, gripping her knife.</p> <p>He wanted her and she wanted him. He\u2019d forged a connection between them she couldn\u2019t ignore. The way he had held her, the way he\u2019d touched her made her want to hold on to him. She had no idea what would come of their connection, but her instinct warned her she wouldn\u2019t get an opportunity to find out. Thinking of losing him now, before she had a chance to sort it out, terrified her.</p><p>They reached the rock pile. Nassar paused, measuring the height of the rubble with his gaze. It was almost three floors tall. He glanced at her. She saw the confirmation in his green eyes: it was too easy. He expected a trap.</p><p>\u201cWe go slowly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must touch it together.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>They climbed the pile of debris, making their way higher and higher. Soon they were level with the first floor of the neighbouring buildings, then the second. The flag was so close now, she could see the thread weave of its fabric.</p> <p>The cold magic slammed her. Grace screamed. A lean shape burst over the top of the pile - half-man, half-demon, surrounded by marrow worms, the summoning stone on his chest glowing with white. The beast hit Nassar in the chest. Nassar reeled, the refuse slipped under him, and he plunged down, rolling as he fell, the dark worms swirling over him.</p><p>Grace ran after them. Below, the beast that was Conn Roar tore at Nassar, all but buried under the black ribbons of worm bodies.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t get to him in time. Grace jumped.</p><p>For a moment she was airborne and falling and then her feet hit hard concrete midway down the slope. It gave under the impact, pitching her forwards. She fell and rolled down, trying to shield her head with her arms, banging against chunks of stone and wood. Pain kicked her stomach; she\u2019d smashed into a section of a wall. Her head swam. Her eyes watered. Grace gasped and jerked upright.</p><p>Ten feet away the marrow worms were choking Nassar.</p><p>Magic surged from her in a sharp wave. The blast ripped the worms clear. They fled.</p> <p>Nassar lay on his back, his eyes staring unseeing into the sky. Oh no.</p><p>She killed the panicked urge to run to him, crouched, and picked up his axe from where it had fallen. Her own knife was gone in her fall.</p><p>A dark shape launched itself at her from the pile. She whipped about, reacting on instinct. Nightmarish jaws snapped, her power pulsed, and Conn Roar bounced from the shield of her magic, knocked back. His paws barely touched the rubble before he sprung again. This time she was ready and knocked him down once more, deliberately.</p><p>Conn snarled.</p><p>She backed away towards Nassar\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cHe killed my brother,\u201d the demonic beast said. His voice raised the small hairs on her neck. \u201cLet me have Nassar and I\u2019ll let you live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me.\u201d Conn circled her. He limped, favouring his left front paw, and a long gash split his side, bleeding. Nassar had got a piece of him before he went down.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, I can kill you,\u201d she told him, building up her magic. \u201cI\u2019m a Mailliard.\u201d</p><p>She only had one shot at this. If she failed, he\u2019d rip her to pieces.</p><p>Conn tensed. The muscles in his powerful legs contracted. He leaped at her. She watched his furry body sail through the air, watched his jaws gape in joy when he realized her Barrier wasn\u2019t there, and then she sank everything she had into a single devastating pulse. Instead of a wide shield, she squeezed all her power into a narrow blade.</p><p>It sliced him in two. His body fell, spraying blood. His head flew by her, its four eyes dimming as it spun.</p><p>She didn\u2019t give it a second glance.</p><p>\u201cNassar?\u201d She dropped the axe and pulled him up by his giant shoulders, sheltering a weak flutter of magic emanating from him with her own power. He was covered in blood. Her chest hurt as if she\u2019d been stabbed. \u201cCome back to me!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>No! Grace dropped and put her ear to his chest. A heartbeat, very weak, faltering, but a heartbeat.</p><p>She wiped a streak of blood from her eyes with her grimy hand so she could see. She couldn\u2019t help him. She didn\u2019t know how. But his family would.</p><p>Grace looked up at the pile of concrete and rubble, to the very top, where a white flag flailed in the breeze.</p><p>Nassar leaned against a tree across the street from a brick office building. Grace was inside. He couldn\u2019t sense her, not yet, but he knew she was inside.</p><p>He vividly remembered waking up to the familiar vaulted ceiling. He\u2019d whispered her name and Liza\u2019s voice answered, \u201cShe\u2019s alive. She dragged you out, and I released her and her family, like you wanted.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe her at first. He knew how much he weighed. No woman could have dragged his dead weight up that heap, but somehow Grace had done it.</p><p>She had left no note. No letter, no message, nothing to indicate that she didn\u2019t hate him for dragging her into the horror of the game. He thought of her every day while he lay in his bed waiting for his body to heal.</p><p>It took a month for him to recover. Three days ago he was finally able to walk. Yesterday he was able to make it down the stairs unassisted. Now, as he leaned against an old oak for support, his left arm still in a sling, he wondered what he would say if she told him to leave.</p><p>He would say nothing, he decided. He would turn around and go back to the airport and fly back to his life as the cursed revenant of Dreoch Tower. Nobody would ever know what it would cost him.</p><p>He wanted to hold her, to take her back with him, to have her in his bed, to taste her lips again, and to see the sly smile hidden in her eyes for him alone.</p><p>The door opened. Three women stepped out, but he saw only one.</p><p>Grace halted. Nassar held his breath.</p><p>She took a small step towards him, and then another, and another, and then she was crossing the street, and coming near. He saw nothing except her face.</p><p>Her magic brushed him. She dropped her bag. Her hands went up to his shoulders. Her brown eyes smiled at him.</p><p>She kissed him. </p> </body></html>"]
