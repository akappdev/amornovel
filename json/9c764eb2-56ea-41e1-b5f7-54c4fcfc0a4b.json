Despite the days and nights the men had spent in their hellish hole in the earth, some jumped at the sound.</p><p>Others barely twitched.</p> <p>They\u2019d been holding the line nearly a week, waiting for reinforcements. Though word kept coming through that the men from Airborne would be shoring them up, none had arrived. Some of the men were bitter, but Brandon Ericson shrugged at their comments without replying. He was certain the men from Airborne had been sent out.</p><p>They just hadn\u2019t made it yet. Gut instinct warned him that the paratroopers had been dropped from their planes with all good intentions. Some of them had tangled in the trees. Others had been shot down while their chutes were still billowing in the absurdly blue skies. Some of them had met death on the ground.</p><p>And some were wasting away in the enemy\u2019s prison camps. No lack of intent or valor left them as they were now. Just the brutal determination of a foe determined to conquer all Europe.</p><p>\u201cJesu! That was close!\u201d Corporal Ted Myers muttered, crossing himself. His pale blue eyes were bright against their red rims and the dark grime on his face. Beside him, Jimmy Decker started to shake. What began as a trembling turned suddenly into a full-force spasm. Then Jimmy slammed forward, crashing against the wall of earth that shielded them, and back again.</p><p>\u201cBetter get him out of the line,\u201d the lieutenant said quietly. \u201cBack to the infirmary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAin\u2019t no infirmary anymore, Lieutenant,\u201d Sergeant Walowski said. He leaned back against the earth and sank to a sitting position, drawing a cigarette from his pocket. \u201cCaved in last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe medics have something else rigged up. Myers, get Decker out of here,\u201d the lieutenant said. He stared across the earth. Pretty soon, dusk would fall. Until then, there would be another barrage of mortar fire. After that, the enemy would make a run at their position again. He didn\u2019t need anyone in the line who was cracking. They\u2019d held here now for nearly two weeks under impossible odds. They\u2019d done so because, for the most part, the men were crack shots. They weren\u2019t budging, and from where they were, they could have a field day with troops approaching them\u2014even the trained professional German soldiers who had been ordered to root them out.</p><p>Still, they could only hold so long. The enemy powers had ordered those soldiers\u2014family men, many of them, like their French and American counterparts\u2014to give their lives, as many as need be, for the Fatherland. They\u2019d just send more and more troops, night after night. Even if fifty of the enemy were killed for every one of his men, eventually, they would fall. Unless reinforcements could reach them. And quickly.</p><p>A whistling tore through the air.</p><p>\u201cTake cover!\u201d the lieutenant ordered. Myers, running with the shell-shocked Decker, ducked and kept running. The men remaining in the trench flattened themselves. This one didn\u2019t explode quite so close.</p><p>\u201cKeep down!\u201d the lieutenant warned, and sure enough, the first explosion was followed by a second, and then by a third. On the last, great piles of earth fell like rain upon the already filthy men, but there were no cries of pain, no shrieks indicating an imminent death among their shrinking number.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be coming through the dusk and fallout,\u201d the lieutenant warned. \u201cRemember that ammo is low.</p><p>Hold your fire until I give the command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot till we see the whites of their eyes,\u201d Myers muttered.</p><p>\u201cHell, we\u2019ll never see the whites of their eyes in this powder and dirt,\u201d Lansky said. Lansky was something of an old timer. Forty-five when the war had broken out. He\u2019d joined up anyway, two days after his son was killed in Italy. By then, the recruiters hadn\u2019t cared much about his age. He was a damned good man to have on the line. He\u2019d learned to shoot hunting in Montana and he rarely missed his mark, no matter what the conditions.</p><p>\u201cEvery shot counts,\u201d the lieutenant reminded them all. He was less than half Lansky\u2019s age, but Lansky never batted an eye at an order. Lansky had proven to be his best friend out here. He\u2019d seen action at the end of the First World War. He\u2019d learned a lot about digging into the trenches, and he had a way of giving damned good suggestions. Quietly. Without irritating even the officers with higher ranks than the lieutenant\u2019s.</p><p>He saw Lansky\u2019s eyes now. \u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d Lansky said. \u201cI can feel it.\u201d The lieutenant gave him a nod. And a moment later, Lansky was proven right. From out of the dusk, powder, and drifting dirt, the soldiers suddenly appeared. Knowing that they were within sight, they let out strange cries, like warriors of old. Maybe battle never changed, the lieutenant thought. Just the time, the place, the argument. Maybe men needed to scream, to run into a maelstrom of bullets, even if they were armed and prepared to deal out death themselves. Perhaps a battle cry was a man\u2019s last roar to heaven or hell that he was, indeed, alive.</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d the lieutenant shouted.</p><p>The earth seemed to split apart with the roar of the guns. The line coming toward them stumbled and broke. The eerie battle cries turned to screams of pain as men fell and died.</p> <p>And yet, where the line had been broken, new men came rushing in, and the battle cry they had taken up seemed to soar and echo into the darkening sky. \u201cFire!\u201d he roared again, and another barrage filled the night, and more men fell. But like ghost soldiers, the enemy kept coming, more soldiers filling in where the others had been. The line was coming closer and closer, and the enemy soldiers were firing as well, aiming blindly for the trenches.</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d</p><p>Again, the roar of bullets. Powder filled the night so thickly that it was almost impossible to see anything.</p><p>They heard screams, and knew more men had fallen.</p><p>And knew that they were close.</p><p>A soldier burst into view, throwing himself into the trench, gun aimed at Lansky. The lieutenant used his own weapon instantly and instinctively as a mace, cracking the enemy with a vengeance on the back and neck. The man fell before he could get off a shot, but others were coming, almost upon them.</p><p>\u201cFire at will!\u201d he roared in the night. In a minute, it would be a melee, the enemy would be in the trenches, a man wouldn\u2019t know who the hell he was shooting anymore. Rifle fire rattled explosively in the night as the defenders shot almost blindly at the enemy encroaching upon them. A soldier caught a bullet in his gullet and fell into the trench, on top of Lansky. Lansky pushed the dead man aside and took aim again.</p><p>Then, out of the night, came a howling. It wasn\u2019t the battle cry of the enemy. Eerie, uncanny, like the scream of a thousand banshees, or a cry from the damned in the deepest pits of hell. It was so startling, so deep, so soul-wrenching that, for moments, neither side fired a single shot.</p><p>The silence was as eerie as the hell-hound cry that had stilled them all.</p><p>MacCoy, the boy from Boston, spoke softly. \u201cMay all the saints bless us and preserve us!\u201d he whispered.</p><p>All hell broke loose; the baying began again, along with the sound of wild shots, shots fired from the trenches into the dust and darkness, shots fired at the approaching enemy, shots that whistled into the darkness.</p><p>Then ...</p><p>The thunder against the earth. As if cavalry were upon them ...</p><p>The screams began, screams coming from the German soldiers, while they could still see nothing in the whirl of powder, earth, and dust before them.</p><p>\u201cHail Mary, full of Grace ...\u201d MacCoy intoned.</p><p>\u201cBlessed Lord!\u201d Lansky cried, and it was a prayer and a curse, for a German soldier burst out of the haze, covered in blood, falling in upon them and to their feet. Their eyes fell instinctively to the man in the muck.</p><p>And that was when the creatures came.</p><p>Creatures ...</p><p>Wolves, but not wolves. Some were silver, some were black, some were tawny. They had the form and structure of the canine beasts, but they were larger, and their eyes .. . their eyes were different. Their eyes saw, and knew, and the machinations of thought and cunning could be seen in them as they sprang, seeming to sail and fly above the soldiers in the trenches and then they came pouncing down.</p><p>\u201cFire! Fire!\u201d the lieutenant roared.</p><p>Guns blazed, animals fell, men fell, the trenches themselves became a mire of men and blood, German uniforms, American, cloth so bloodied, ripped, and torn, it couldn\u2019t be discerned. \u201cFire, fire, fire!\u201d the lieutenant thundered again and again, and he heard the deafening rat-a-tats as his men obeyed his command. At his side, Lansky\u2019s body was suddenly wrenched up and away. He saw Lansky fall before the trench just as another bloodied, terrified member of the German elite came hurtling in upon them, eyes open in death.</p><p>\u201cLansky!\u201d He went flat, crawling, down, down against the dirt, determined to drag Lansky back to the relative safety of the trench. Bullets, wild and stray, whistled above his head as he inched along.</p><p>He was struck. He didn\u2019t know by what. He felt the weight, a terrible crushing weight, upon his back.</p><p>Then the stinging at his nape. A bullet, a bayonet, a knife ... he didn\u2019t know what. He just felt the stinging sensation. Not even real pain ... just the thrusting ... and the sting.</p><p>He\u2019d been hit.</p><p>By fire? By one of the rabid wolves? But he was breathing. Alive and breathing. And still crawling.</p><p>Lansky lay just ahead, at his side. Lansky, the crack shot. He had to get him back. Sweat dripped into his eyes. Not sweat. Blood. His vision was blurring. He refused to die in the mud; he refused to lose the battle this way. He inched forward, aware that more and more of the dust and haze seemed to be filling his vision from the inside. He looked where Lansky lay and saw his countryman\u2019s hand. He reached out, catching his friend, dragging him toward him.</p><p>As the body came near, he screamed aloud himself, recoiling. Lansky had no head.</p><p>Despite the horror, his scream faded. His lungs burned. His entire body seemed to be afire, and yet, in seconds, that fire seemed to be fading to a strange cold. Cold.</p><p>Death was cold.</p><p>He was dying. It was his life\u2019s blood dripping into his eyes. Oozing from his veins through the stinging gash at the back of his neck. What dim light there had been was fading away completely. Just as sound. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could no longer hear the screams of his men. He could no longer hear the sound of rifle fire. Time stood still, and cold, and it seemed that sound kept ebbing, and ebbing ...</p><p>There was stillness. He didn\u2019t think that he had blacked out yet. And he didn\u2019t think that he had died.</p><p>Yet.</p> <p>But still, time had passed. Sped like light, drifted like a slow current...</p><p>The stillness remained.</p><p>Then there was a dim sense of sound and movement again.</p><p>Footsteps. Walking. Hard on the ground. He tried to turn. He felt something on the earth at his side.</p><p>Heard language that didn\u2019t register in his mind.</p> <p>He blinked hard. His sight seemed to be dimming to a tiny peephole surrounded by a haze of red and black.</p><p>Yes, something by his side. He blinked again, fighting to remain conscious, yet knowing that he would lose the battle any minute.</p><p>Yet, there, yes... a boot. A man\u2019s black boot, planted against the muck and mud and blood of the earth.</p><p>Black, and something shining despite the caking mud that spattered it.</p><p>Just as his eyes closed completely, he recognized the shining insignia on the boot.</p><p>A swastika.</p> <p>The thought registered ...</p><p>Then there was no more thought. The world faded into a haze of crimson, and then ...</p><p>There was nothing but blackness.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>\u201cHe has changed since you last saw him. He has simply changed.\u201d Ann waved her hand in the air as she spoke, the plume from her cigarette creating a swirl of smoke.</p><p>Tara stared at her cousin blankly. She was exhausted\u2014she had managed to cross the Atlantic without even a catnap, despite the overnight duration of the flight when traveling eastward. She wanted nothing more than to reach her grandfather\u2019s little chateau on the outskirts of Paris, but after picking her up at the airport, Ann had insisted they stop for petit dejeuner before heading out of the city.</p><p>And now, though she wasn\u2019t putting it in so many words, Ann was trying to tell her that their grandfather was senile, or suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p><p>Tara narrowed her eyes, perplexed, as she watched Ann. She shook her head, taking a long swallow of her cafe au lait. \u201cAnn, if Grandpapa is ill, then perhaps he should come back to the States\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPhui!\u201d Ann wrinkled her nose, inching it higher in the air. \u201cWhy must you always think that there will be something better in the United States?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really mean that,\u201d Tara said, then lowered her eyes, biting her lip. The medical care in France was excellent. She did have that tendency to think that the best of everything had to be in America.</p><p>Except for croissants, perhaps. And cafe au lait.</p><p>She looked at Ann and grimaced ruefully. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Ann shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re trying to tell me that he has lost his mind completely\u2014\u201d Ann sighed deeply. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not that! Really, it\u2019s not that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think, though, that he is becoming senile? He\u2019s certainly old enough to be allowed some eccentricities.\u201d</p><p>Ann shrugged again at that. \u201cMais oui. He claims he does not know how old he is himself. He said that he was older than most of the boys in the Resistance, and lord, World War II ended in nineteen forty-five! So, yes, he is up there in years. He has had the respiratory trouble, as I told you on the phone, but I\u2019ve had him out of the hospital now for several days, and though I chide him and tell him he must be careful, he is up and about a bit each day. But he sits in his library when he is up! He shuts himself in, and he talks about something that he calls the Alliance all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he is reliving his war years.\u201d</p><p>Ann appeared troubled, drawn, and weary, which was not like her. Tara had always thought her cousin was one of the most beautiful women she had ever seen. Her eyes were deep, penetrating blue. He hair was dark, her complexion very fair, and the contrast was startling and appealing. She was tall and elegantly slim, with curves just where they should be.</p><p>There had been times in Tara\u2019s life when she had hated the visits of her French cousin. She\u2019d had too many friends in high school and college who all but drooled openly when Ann came around. She could admit to a certain amount of jealousy over the years, but she also loved her cousin, more so once she had gotten older, when high school and college were long in the past. Ann had spent enough time in her house when they were growing up to make it a rivalry that sisters might have shared\u2014except that in Tara\u2019s case, her \u201csister\u201d had come with a fascinating accent and the allure of being an exotic foreigner. Ann came to the United States frequently; Tara and her family went to Paris just three times in the years when she was growing up. Ann spoke both French and English perfectly, while Tara\u2019s French was poor and her accent far too obviously American. Jacques DeVant had fallen in love with their grandmother, Emily, an American nurse, at the end of the war. The two had married, and moved to the United States. Their son, David, had, in turn, fallen in love with a French artist, Sophie, during a summer term of college in Paris. He had remained, while their daughter, Tara and her brother Mike\u2019s mother, had married Patrick Adair, a first generation Irish American.</p><p>Their cultural differences therefore, despite their grandparents, were great.</p><p>But those old times seemed long ago now. When Tara graduated from college, she had spent a summer at the old chateau. Her grandmother had died and her grandfather had moved back to Paris by then, taking up residence in his family home, where Ann had grown up. Ann\u2019s parents had retired, and spent most of their time in a little house on the beach at Costa del Sol.</p><p>To call her grandfather\u2019s house a chateau was, perhaps, a bit presumptive, but it had been called Le Petit Chateau DeVant since it was enlarged in the seventeen hundreds, and thus it remained. The war had basically destroyed what hadn\u2019t exactly been a family fortune, but a decent portfolio, and now, though somewhat decayed, the little estate did have tremendous charm. The house itself was two stories with an old-fashioned hall rather than a parlor or living room, a magnificent library, and beautiful upstairs bedrooms with balconies that overlooked a courtyard. The carriage house still housed a small buggy and Daniel, an incredibly old, gentle, gray draft horse who did little more these days than amble around the adjoining pasture.</p><p>Ann suddenly shook her head and crushed out her cigarette, leaning forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not the war. Perhaps his writings have gotten to his mind. Maybe he read too many American comic books. He is distressed, thinking that he deserted ... something. He does talk about the war, saying that the realities of it made him forget what he was, who he was. And then, going to America, and he should have known, because it was there, even in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was there\u2014even in America?\u201d Tara asked.</p><p>Ann threw up her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He suddenly becomes disturbed, as if he has spoken too much.</p><p>Maybe you will do better with him than I have. I took time off from work when he was so sick ... but I can\u2019t now, or I won\u2019t have a job anymore. I don\u2019t make a fortune, but I love my work.\u201d Tara felt a twinge of guilt that it had taken her so long to make it to France. But she had a few deadlines of her own.</p><p>She and Ann had taken different paths, but oddly enough, wound up working on similar projects. Ann was an editor with a company that purchased and translated English and American tides. Tara was a commercial artist who was frequently hired for book covers.</p><p>\u201cYou can do a lot of work at home, though, right?\u201d Tara asked her.</p><p>Ann laughed. \u201cI have to come home to work half the time, what with the phones and the meetings all day long. But that\u2019s just it\u2014I have to be at those meetings.\u201d</p><p>Tara nodded. \u201cWell, I am here now.\u201d She yawned. \u201cAnd really tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m not taking you celebrating to any local bars tonight? There are some exciting fellows around now. You said on the phone that you had split with the stockbroker.\u201d Tara nodded. \u201cYes, we split. But should you really go bar hopping? What happened to the new love in your life?\u201d</p><p>Ann wrinkled her nose. \u201cWe, too, have split\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nasty split?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNasty?\u201d Ann raised a brow with perfect contempt. She sighed. \u201cThere was an art meeting in my office that ran very late. You know, of course, that I met Willem when he came in to take over as head of the sales force. About a week ago, he was to lock up for me\u2014he was finishing some business with the art director and the models hired for the ad campaign\u2014and meet me at\u2014 well, meet me at a hotel room. I left to pick up some food for a romantic dinner, but I had forgotten a manuscript I wanted to work on, and went back to the office. He had not been expecting me, nor had the model for the advertising campaign. I found him in a compromising position with the girl. I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed he\u2019d be out of it by the time I went back the following Monday,\u201d Ann said dryly.</p><p>\u201cAnd he was, I take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad was it? Did he call? Did he try to apologize? Did he have an excuse or an explanation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called. I assured him he had nothing to say that I would like to hear.\u201d The man had hurt her Tara decided. But Ann also had a tendency to see the world in white and black.</p><p>She could be totally unforgiving when she chose. Pride and direction were important to her.</p><p>\u201cIt must be difficult. I mean, he\u2019s still with the company. You two still work together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does not work in my office.\u201d</p><p>Tara was silent for a moment. Ann had talked about Willem with such great enthusiasm. She had expected to hear that her cousin was engaged at any time.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let me get a little more personal here. Just what was he doing?\u201d Ann flashed her a glance and rolled her eyes. \u201cThe girl was on my desk. He was bent over her. What more do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d Tara said. \u201cWere they\u2014dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had clothing about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for him!\u201d Ann said irritably. \u201cThey were kissing and pawing one another, at the very least. And that is too much for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making excuses for him. But .. . perhaps the model forced him into a compromising situation.</p><p>Or maybe he was showing her a pose that he particularly wanted.\u201d Tara grimaced, wondering why she was trying to defend a man she didn\u2019t know, who had been caught in a situation she knew nothing about.</p> <p>Ann laughed curtly. \u201cThere were no photographers in the room. Nor was the male model there. So ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ended it then and there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that if he stepped in my office again, I would quit. I meant it, and he believed me. Of course, I also said that I would skewer him with my letter opener. I meant that as well. Now, what about your stockbroker?\u201d</p><p>Tara hesitated. Ann already thought that she was dealing with madness where their grandfather was concerned. She wasn\u2019t sure how to explain the feelings that had caused her to break off her relationship with a really nice, attractive guy.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Ann persisted. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly laid my heart and the truth on the table!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wasn\u2019t right? You said that he was good looking, polite, charming, and sexy! Did he become unsexy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ann shook her head. \u201cHe made a decent income, he wasn\u2019t a starving artist, he didn\u2019t play ridiculous music in a coffee shop?\u201d</p><p>Tara laughed. \u201cNo, there was nothing in the least wrong with Jacob. He\u2019s a great person. I can\u2019t really explain this. He wanted to move in together, buy a ring ... and I backed away. It just wasn\u2019t ... right. I don\u2019t know how else to explain this ...\u201d she finished lamely. She really didn\u2019t know how to explain why she had broken up with Jacob. He had understood about her coming to Paris. And yet...</p><p>She\u2019d had the oddest feeling about coming here. As if she\u2019d been waiting for this trip\u2014this time\u2014all her life.</p> <p>And ... there had been the dream.</p><p>She had plans to come to Paris, a little bit later, but while she was working on a deadline, trying to decide on the right date, she\u2019d gone to sleep and ...</p><p>Been in Paris. She had seen the city beneath her as her plane landed. She had seen the city she loved, the spires of Notre Dame, the rise of the Eiffel Tower. She had seen herself with Ann, sitting at the cafe, driving out to the village. And then ... a mist had rolled in, and she was walking. Walking through the woods in the surrounding countryside, intent on her destination. And as she walked, she had been afraid.</p><p>Afraid of the shadows that surrounded the place, shadows that twisted and moved and formed strange shapes, and seemed to whisper. She didn\u2019t know if the whispers were words that beckoned her onward, or if they were warnings. But she had to get to the house, and it had something to do with her grandfather. Every step brought greater fear, and greater determination. Through a field of tangled trees and shrubbery, she could see a structure ahead. It seemed to glow with a strange yellow light, like that of the moon sifting through clouds and mist. And in her mind, she was repeating the words help me over and over again, though she wasn\u2019t sure who it was she was calling to, only that she believed, had to believe that he would be there.</p><p>She had awakened with perfect logic, explaining to herself that the dream was all about her grandfather.</p><p>She adored him. And he was in trouble. She needed to reach him because of his illness. She was being selfish and foolish by not getting on the first plane she could in order to be with him. The dream was a warning that her grandfather needed her, and her fear of shadows was her fear of illness.</p><p>And at the same time, despite all her logic, she felt that some cycle in life was ending, and that another was about to begin. Oddly enough, whatever it was, she had been waiting for it all her life, and now was the time.</p><p>Which brought up Jacob. She did care for him. He was wonderful, full of fun, sensual, a down-to-earth bastion to balance her flights of fantasy. But there was simply something else out there, and she had to go to Paris, and discover what it was.</p> <p>Somewhat insane. And yet...</p><p>The right thing to do.</p><p>Crazy, but right. How, she couldn\u2019t begin to fathom. She didn\u2019t intend to stay in Paris forever. It wasn\u2019t her home. New York was.</p><p>Yet the call to Paris, and whatever she was seeking, was ridiculously strong.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go to New York with you and meet Jacob,\u201d Ann said, wrenching Tara out of her reverie.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Tara said, \u201cI guess I just wasn\u2019t... in love with him.\u201d Ann could be so totally down to earth and practical. There was no way that Tara could explain her feelings to Ann.</p><p>Ann shook her head in confusion. \u201cGreat. You give up Mr. Perfect, and then you give me a hard time?</p><p>The man I love cheats, and you think I should listen to him. You have someone open, honest, and loyal, but you\u2019re just not in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do care about him, a great deal. But not enough.\u201d</p><p>Ann was silent a few minutes, watching her, and then shrugged. \u201cWell, look at the two of us! We definitely should go bar hopping. It\u2019s not the way to meet the right man, but work is definitely not the right place either. And I do nothing else except work, so it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really should go out\u2014only semi on the prowl\u2014 and we will,\u201d Tara said. \u201cBut not tonight. I\u2019m so tired. I don\u2019t think that I could deal with the excitement of a good-looking man. Or a nice one. Or even an ugly fellow who wanted to buy me a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s get on to the chateau. You can hear for yourself what Grandpapa is saying. You can talk to him this afternoon, and I will go back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you and Willem will work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI carry my letter opener with me always,\u201d Ann said, lifting her hand to the waiter to signal for the check.</p><p>Ann insisted on paying. As they were rising, she suddenly froze for a moment, then caught Tara\u2019s arm, turning her about on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem,\u201d Ann muttered.</p><p>\u201cWillem? Where?\u201d</p><p>Tara tried to turn, anxious to see the man her cousin had been so deeply involved with. Ann kept dragging her along, but she was able to catch a quick glimpse of the man. He was tall and blond, wearing a designer business suit, very suave. A lock of hair fell over the darkness of his sunglasses as he paused to light a cigarette before choosing the cafe table they had just vacated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stare! Let\u2019s just get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you still work with him. You could introduce me. Then I could be a better judge of his character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has no character. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ann dragged her along. Tara couldn\u2019t help but look back. As she did so, she was certain that the man was watching them leave, though she could see nothing of his eyes through the glasses. He was appealing in a very smooth way that would have fit very well with Ann\u2019s cool veneer of sophistication.</p><p>His attention was taken from her as he was joined by another man at the table. Willem apparently knew the fellow he was meeting. He rose, and, American style, shook the man\u2019s hand. The other fellow was light as well. Tall, with sandy blond hair, and, beneath his business suit, he appeared to be in excellent condition. They were moving too quickly for Tara to make out his features; he, too, wore sunglasses.</p><p>Nearly tripping, Tara looked forward for a moment. She was startled by an uneasy feeling, a sense of being watched\u2014or stalked, even. Goose bumps rose on her arms, and a bolt of icy adrenaline shot through her, causing her to shiver.</p><p>She looked back.</p><p>Neither of the men was at the table. Tara stopped where she stood on the busy street, staring back, puzzled. The two had simply vanished.</p><p>\u201cHe met someone,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the head of sales! He\u2019s always meeting someone,\u201d Ann said impatiently. \u201cAnd I have to get you home, and come back in and do some work. Please, let\u2019s get moving!\u201d Tara gave herself a shake. She was tired. She hated the long flight over the Atlantic. She loved Europe, but hated getting here. She smiled ruefully at herself. It was really a beautiful Paris morning.</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, they were in the car, heading out of the city.</p><p>\u201cHe has an interesting look,\u201d Tara commented, watching her cousin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care to talk about him anymore.\u201d Ann still seemed distracted. \u201cThere is more to worry about than a lying, cheating, man. There is Grandpapa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there more you should be telling me?\u201d Tara asked.</p><p>\u201cI have told you that he is a lying cheat. Is there more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant about Grandpapa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Ann glanced at her. \u201cWe\u2019ll be home soon enough. When you see him, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his health is good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good, but better. He has made a sound comeback from his bout with pneumonia. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s willing himself to get better and be strong. One thing that has bothered me is that he\u2019s incredibly concerned with an archaeological dig going on in our village .. . seems they\u2019ve dug to the crypts of the ruins of the old church. Grandpapa wakes first thing in the morning, looking for the newspaper. He\u2019s asked me to go see what they\u2019re doing. He pores over those ancient books of his, and gets all excited.</p><p>He wants to go himself, but the doctors have told him that he mustn\u2019t, that the air in such a place would be extremely bad for him. When he heard it might actually kill him, he realized that he couldn\u2019t go. He is determined to stay alive. He is trying to stay healthy, and guard himself, but he has been driving me crazy to go down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have you gone?\u201d</p><p>Ann shook her head. \u201cI am not feeding into his fantasies! I told him that the crypts are off limits to tourists and that I have no way to get into the dig.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was true,\u201d Ann said, flashing Tara a little smile of guilt. \u201cThey were worried about the integrity of the underground structure. I don\u2019t really know what the situation is right now. There were a few write-ups in the paper when they began, but now, there may be a column or two every few days.\u201d She glanced at Tara and shrugged as she drove. \u201cOkay, I think they have opened the dig to tourists. I\u2019m not sure why.</p><p>We\u2019re really nothing more than a little village on the outskirts of a big city\u2014Paris offers the visitor so many major attractions that a small dig doesn\u2019t usually get much attention. Some professor involved is certain that he\u2019s on to a major historical find, but he doesn\u2019t seem to generate much enthusiasm from his colleagues. And most people come to Paris to see the art and beauty. Those with a morbid twist to their minds can crawl down into the catacombs and see thousands of bones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps Grandpapa is all excited mainly because the ruins are in our little village. He grew up here, lived a lot of his life here. Maybe he feels that there is a family connection to this dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him that,\u201d Ann said.\u201cHe was appalled, assuring me that we had nothing to do with ground that was deconsecrated. But then, hey, you\u2019re not exactly a seasoned Parisian, but you have been to what\u2019s world famous and historical here. If you want to tramp around in a crypt, be my guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you were afraid that it would feed into his fantasies.\u201d Ann shrugged. \u201cWell, I\u2019m still afraid. But I\u2019m also trying to catch up with work. And trying to keep the old place going with little help. I don\u2019t mean you, your folks, your brother, or my folks. I mean on a day-to-day basis, simply keeping bathrooms clean, straightening out, keeping the roof on, and the ivy down. We\u2019ve only got Katia running the house and Roland keeping up the grounds. Debbie, his old assistant in the States, has written to say that she wants to come to look after Jacques, but it will take her a while to put her affairs in order. So, you see, I really haven\u2019t had any extra time to go running around to ruins. And I\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re here. You said that you were actually all caught up and would do some painting that you wanted to do\u2014rather than what was commercial and paying the bills\u2014while you were here. Maybe you\u2019ll find inspiration in the crypt. Maybe they\u2019ll even let you set up an easel. I don\u2019t know. I love old Jacques with my whole heart. Remember when we were kids? He wrote popular fiction, but people were always interviewing him as if he were a great scholar or literary writer. He\u2019s always had such a grip on the world, on human nature ... I don\u2019t want to lose the grandfather we\u2019ve known and loved all our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him, too. He was always magnificent, larger than life. He gave me my love of art, and you\u2019ve certainly learned a lot about writing and publishing from him. He means the world to us, and he loves us very much as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you are the one with the love of stories and tales and fantasies. I am far too logical and straightforward for him. So you talk to him. See if you can make sense of it all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here to do whatever is needed.\u201d</p><p>Ann nodded, falling silent as they drove.</p><p>They had left the city behind and were driving through beautiful countryside with little clusters of charming old houses. Minutes later, Tara saw the drive to the chateau before them, and then the home that had been her fantasyland as a child. The drive wound haphazardly through trails of flowers\u2014Ann\u2019s babies, as she called them. Then they came around the gravel drive directly in front of the old stone steps.</p><p>The front door opened and Roland, who was close to her grandfather\u2019s age, came hurrying down the steps, throwing open the car door before she could do so herself. He burst into a warm and enthusiastic greeting so quickly spoken that she could pick out only one word in every few; it didn\u2019t matter, she knew she was being welcomed. She hugged Roland, then insisted she was perfectly able to handle her own bag. By then, Katia, a few years younger than Roland, had arrived at the door. She wiped her hands on her apron, ran down the steps, and folded Tara into a massive hug as well. Tara struggled for the right words in French to return her greeting, gave up, and hugged her back. It seemed that the cheek kissing went on forever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to work,\u201d Ann called to her. \u201cI\u2019m not going inside. You\u2019re in your old room.\u201d Tara had her own firm grip on her bag again; she wasn\u2019t about to let either Roland or Katia try to take it from her.</p><p>\u201cYour grandpapa is in the library!\u201d Katia said with stern disapproval, shaking her head with such vehemence that little gray tendrils of hair escaped from her neat chignon and whispered around her face.</p> <p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t excite him too much; he can be such an old fool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tie him down if he gets too frisky,\u201d Tara assured her.</p><p>Ann continued around the gravel drive and headed for the street, returning to the city, and Roland and Katia followed Tara back into the house. In the once grand foyer, Tara paused. She looked around at the beautiful woodwork, and the fraying tapestries on the wall. The long, claw-footed table in the hall held Ann\u2019s computer surrounded by mounds of paper.</p><p>Tara smiled. It was good to be here.</p><p>Far across the Atlantic, Jade DeVeau woke with a start, and then wondered what had caused her to do so.</p><p>It was still night... or the wee hours of the morning. For a moment, she lay tensely, eyes narrowed, as she tried to ascertain what danger might have stirred her survival instincts while she slept And yet...</p><p>She heard nothing.</p><p>She opened her eyes farther, twisted silently around.</p> <p>Moonlight streamed through the window above the charming courtyard of her Charleston home. Lucian sat in the rocker by the window, looking out at the night.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t strange that he should be there. Jade had changed her own natural sleeping schedule to coincide with his, and he had learned to lie down and rest in the darkness of the night. But still, many a night she woke, and saw him there. Sometimes, he read, with a book light, so as not to disturb her.</p><p>Sometimes, he sat, rocking, watching the moon. Most of the time, he was at ease, simply a quiet night owl, who, when really restless, went downstairs to work or watch one of the twenty-four-hour news stations or an old classic movie.</p><p>Tonight... there was something different.</p><p>Jade sat up, reaching for her robe at the foot of the bed, still afraid, though she knew not why, and feeling strangely vulnerable in the naked state in which she slept. She knew that he was instantly aware that she had wakened; he could sense her slightest movement.</p><p>He turned toward her, and even in the dimness of the moonlight, she saw that he smiled apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI woke you. I\u2019m sorry. I thought I was quiet.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t wake me. I just woke.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her down to sit on his lap. She drew her fingers through his hair, wondering if it was a sin to love anyone so much.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked him, her voice a whisper.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>A shiver shot through her. His arms tightened around her. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened. It\u2019s ... whatever it is, it\u2019s away. Far away. Of course, that\u2019s what bothers me. I can feel something. But I don\u2019t know what.\u201d As if he were afraid that he might be sending his tenseness straight into her soul, he stood suddenly, setting her upon her feet. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a hamburger.\u201d She looked up at him dryly.\u201cAt five in the morning?\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted by a sudden wail. \u201cThe baby,\u201d Jade said. She turned, hurrying to the next room down the hall. She knew that Lucian dogged her footsteps, though she didn\u2019t hear his movement.</p><p>She flicked on the light and hurried over to the crib where six-month-old Aidan slept. At the moment, he was wide awake, tufts of blond hair standing straight up from his tiny skull, cheeks red, little fists flying, tears streaking down his little face. Jade scooped him up into her arms.</p><p>The hardest thing for her to face when she married Lucian was the fact that she couldn\u2019t have children.</p><p>She had decided not to adopt; she wouldn\u2019t put an infant into danger. But then, she heard about Aidan, just days old at the time he was orphaned.</p><p>And now ...</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that she couldn\u2019t bear children. Aidan was her child. She loved him as fiercely as she ever could any child who had been born of her own flesh and blood.</p><p>She cradled him gently in her arms, crooning to him. He began to calm down, making little gulping sounds. \u201cLittle boy, little boy, little boy ... you\u2019re all right. It\u2019s all right. Mommy is here.\u201d His sobs subsided, then began again.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Lucian said, and took him from her arms. Lucian looked down at their son. He spoke softy in French. Aidan looked up at his father, fell silent, and slowly closed his eyes, sound asleep.</p><p>Jade took him from her husband and slipped him back into his crib, then came back to Lucian. \u201cI should resent your ability to calm him so easily, you know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI cheat. My French is excellent. And it\u2019s a soothing language.\u201d She smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, raising him, trying to keep working ... to keep up ... I\u2019m far too exhausted most of the time to be resentful.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her on the forehead. \u201cGo back to bed, my love. Get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired anymore. Let\u2019s have hamburgers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want an omelette?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt is veering toward breakfast time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the mood for beef, very rare. How about steak and eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will do.\u201d</p><p>They went down the stairs, hand in hand. Jade was proficient in a kitchen, and good scrambled eggs were one of her specialties. But she noted, though Lucian spoke to her, his words casual, that he kept staring out the rear windows. The pool\u2014not much of a pool, but enough of a little lap pool\u2014was in the back, surrounded by latticework and vines, a beautiful area. And a high stone wall that dated back more than a hundred and fifty years surrounded the backyard. She couldn\u2019t understand what he was watching so intently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or perhaps she did.</p><p>He watched the moon.</p><p>Moments later, she came out to the dining room. \u201cSteak and eggs, and a wonderful Burgundy to accompany the meal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBurgundy\u2014at this hour of the morning?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d she told him.</p><p>They sat down to eat. She tried to be casual. She talked about Aidan\u2019s smiles. The book she was reading. He responded with all the right words but he wasn\u2019t really listening.</p><p>The deep darkness of night began to lift.</p><p>He stood, stretching. \u201cWell, that was delicious. We should try to get a little sleep.\u201d Jade nodded. She started to pick up the dishes. He caught her arm, and his deep brown eyes touched hers.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get them later,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded, feeling a jump in her heart, in all her senses.</p><p>Her husband was an expert lover.</p><p>A vastly experienced one, but...</p><p>He loved her, and she knew how deeply, and the past didn\u2019t matter at all.</p><p>She followed him up the stairs, her hand in his. And at the foot of the bed she shed the robe she had wrapped around herself. In seconds she felt his hands upon her bare flesh, and as always, it was as if she was set afire, as if she melted ...</p> <p>As if nothing else mattered in the world at all...</p><p>No matter the darkness, no matter the light, always, she felt his eyes, liquid fire, traveling over her, into her ...</p><p>And in the end, always, she would be amazed that she could still feel such passion, time after time, as if the world burst into gold, and sometimes, after the volatile climax seized, seared, and sated her, the brilliance would fade to black.</p><p>Finally, exhausted, she slept in peace.</p><p>He lay awake, and when he was sure she was completely into a world of dreams, he rose.</p><p>He closed the curtains, and went down the stairs, then down again, into the basement.</p><p>He kept a computer there. He started toward the desk, determined to send an e-mail.</p><p>Then he decided against it. He found his place in the dark coolness of the lowest section of the house.</p> <p>There he closed his eyes.</p><p>And receded into the depths of his mind.</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d</p><p>Jacques DeVant might be aging, and his health might not be the best, but he could still offer his granddaughter a bone-crunching hug. He didn\u2019t go on and on welcoming her, he just said her name the way only he could say it, and hugged her. And she hugged him back.</p><p>Then, of course, there were the inevitable kisses, one on each cheek, and he held her out at arm\u2019s length, studying her.</p><p>He was a handsome man, even at his age. He\u2019d never lost his hair. It was thick and snow white glinting silver in the light His eyes were incredibly blue, and though his features were weathered and worn, there was a nobility in his facial structure that gave him a tremendous dignity and appeal.</p><p>\u201cTerrific hug,\u201d she told him, ushering him back to his library chair. \u201cAnd you look wonderful. But you have to be careful, you know. You have to rest. And not go about throwing away too much energy.\u201d He arched a furry white brow to her, looking at her skeptically. \u201cI\u2019m doing very well. And trust me, I\u2019m extremely careful of my health. I intend to live until... well, you know, until I reach a ripe old age. A riper old age.\u201d</p><p>He had been going to say something else, Tara thought. I intend to live until... it was as if he meant to say that he was going to live until he was done. Until some task was completed.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, you could be a young dude of only sixty,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He shrugged and smiled, accepting the compliment. Tara perched on the edge of his library desk, looking at the old volume he had been reading.</p><p>She decided to cut right to the chase. \u201cWhat are you up to? Ann is upset because you want her to go down and find out what\u2019s going on at a dig in the village.\u201d His smile faded just slightly, becoming rueful. \u201cShe thinks I am a demented old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she would never think that. But she is worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know what is happening there, and Ann has resisted me, and ... well, thank God you\u2019re here!\u201d He spoke the words so fervently that Tara immediately understood her cousin\u2019s concern. \u201cWhat is it about this dig?\u201d she asked</p><p>\u201cI have to know what they\u2019re after. And what they\u2019ve found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bunch of old bones, I would imagine, if they\u2019re digging up the crypt of a deconsecrated church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know exactly what they\u2019re digging up. I need the plans to the crypt. I need to know if the professor has other scholars working on the project, who, just exactly who, is involved. I believe that the work must be stopped. And if I don\u2019t have all the information, I won\u2019t be able to do anything. Tara, you must go for me. You must be my eyes and ears. I have to be so careful, you see. My own grandchild thinks I am losing my mind. If I am not careful, others will see that I am locked away. That can\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa, you are a scholar. A well-known author.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn author of fiction. Of far-fetched tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith tremendous messages,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>That compliment only irritated him. \u201cFiction. They will think that all the fiction of my many years has slipped into my mind, and that I am crazy. Of all the times to be old and ill and weak!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t appear to hear her. He was staring into the old stone fireplace where logs burned and flames danced, rising in blue, orange, yellow, red, and soft gray plumes of smoke.</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to go to the church,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cI promise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow may be too late. Perhaps today is too late, and yet I haven\u2019t heard of anything terrible happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat terrible thing can happen in an old church crypt?\u201d Tara asked. \u201cAre you afraid that there is something of immense value down there and someone may be after it? Are the men in charge of the dig in danger? Is there something that you really know?\u201d</p><p>He stared from the flames into her eyes. He shook his head. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand. But you must find out for me what is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that I would. But you know me, I can\u2019t sleep on planes. I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019ll go tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday.\u201d He looked her up and down. \u201cKatia will get us some strong coffee. If you keep moving, you\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s once you lie down and rest that jet lag gets to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m wiped out. I had to turn in a project before I got on the plane. I haven\u2019t had a lot of sleep in days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen one more day won\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! You\u2019re my grandparent, you\u2019re supposed to be concerned about my health and welfare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned. But you will go this afternoon and bring me back every possible piece of information they have on the dig. The name of everyone involved. You must somehow get in right where they are working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may not allow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens! Flirt your way in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want me to just sell my body on the street?\u201d He let out a sound of impatience, giving her a stern frown. \u201cThis is not a matter for joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques!\u201d she said, using his first name, as she had always done when pretending to be among the literary community he had known so well in New York. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. If I could understand, it would help. What exactly do you think is going on that you feel you must stop? Ann says you\u2019ve spoken about something called the Alliance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the Alliance. I am one of the Alliance, and there are not many of us left, not many who have understood the calling. Surely, there are others. But perhaps they don\u2019t know as yet. There are those I may be able to find ... but first! I must stop the dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques, what is this Alliance? A group from the war? A group of writers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Alliance ... there isn\u2019t time. Yes, perhaps you could say we\u2019re a group from the war. Now please, we can talk for days on end. You must do this for me. If you do not, I will have to risk another bout of pneumonia or respiratory failure and go myself. If I\u2019m right about what they may find ... who they may find ... you\u2019ve got to get down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you know something, you should call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police would not understand. They would have me locked up. Please, if you love me at all, Tara, you will help me now. I need you.\u201d There was a desperation in his tone that made her seriously wonder about his mental state.</p><p>\u201cThe police cannot help,\u201d he went on. \u201cNot now. We are not in danger from any thief or ordinary murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa, what is the danger, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil, pure evil. Tara, I\u2019m begging you. You must do as I ask.\u201d She was startled by his words. She wanted to open her mouth, to protest the things that he was saying.</p><p>Yet, she suddenly could not.</p><p>A chill had settled over her. A chill that seemed to sweep straight through her, blood, flesh, and bones.</p><p>\u201cYou will go?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou will go for me. Today. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>The gloom in the crypt seemed overwhelming. Despite the many portable lamps hung around the vault deep in the earth, the corners were cast in shadow, deep and gloomy, shadows that moved in a macabre dance, making angels, saints, gargoyles, and grotesques come to life in an eerie profusion of darkness and light.</p><p>\u201cDig carefully!\u201d Professor Dubois admonished.</p><p>Carefully! They could barely see.</p><p>\u201cCarefully, carefully!\u201d Dubois repeated.</p><p>The man was distraught. But then, to Jean-Luc, Dubois always appeared on the edge of a frenzy, as if his explorations in the crypt were world-shattering and his findings would change the shape of the globe.</p><p>Down in the ground, in the area of deconsecrated ruins of the old St. Michel recently rediscovered foundations, the workmen were tired. Jean-Luc Beauvoir stared at the professor with his thick glasses and wild gray hair and bit his lip to keep silent He and the American, Brent Malone, had been working tirelessly for hours, slowly, slowly digging away the age-old rot around the coffins. Professor Dubois was expecting an incredible archaeological find. He was certain he was going to unearth not only the dead, but worldwide recognition, honors and awards, and naturally, the fortune to be made from the book he would write, and the lectures and speeches he would give. The professor gave little thought to the fact that most learned men thought he was a raving lunatic, or that he had bought his way into the excavation either by bribery or by making a large donation to the current St. Michel. Little money had been left to pay for the highly trained archaeological staff Dubois had wanted, and so the professor constantly shouted orders and ridicule at the two-man team of laborers he had managed to obtain, and forced them to keep working once the afternoon began to wane toward evening. The American seemed able to silence the professor with a single stare from his strange, gold-tinted hazel eyes, but the professor would merely start all over again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The St. Michel now standing in the little village just outside Paris dated back to the sixteenth century; the crypt in the old ruins they now worked so laboriously to probe and restore predated the new church by three or four hundred years. The work was treacherous, but they had shored up the area enough to allow tourists to pay extra francs to come and view the dig in process. Now, to add to the aggravation of the professor leaning over their shoulders, directing the tedious and back-breaking labor, there were the curious stopping to ask questions every other minute. The Americans were easy to ignore; he pretended he spoke no English. The French were more annoying because the professor would pause to speak with them, then shout at his laborers again that they were working far too roughly; they might damage coffins that had survived for centuries.</p><p>Jean-Luc stared over at Brent and rolled his eyes as a young woman began a conversation with the professor. Not just a young woman. A beautiful one, with a smooth cultured voice and a knowledge of the area, and the church. American. Her accent was definitely American. And though her words were curious and knowledgeable, there was also a friendly charm to the very sound of her voice. It was not lost on the professor. The old man was not without a lascivious nature; he would hold the young woman to balance her over the opening so that she could see better, and so that he could get his bony hands on her young flesh.</p><p>Brent didn\u2019t seem to catch Jean-Luc\u2019s look. He was distracted, not noting the young woman talking to the professor, either. He was studying the area in which they worked, which connected to the underbelly of the new church through a maze of vaults and corridors, many of which had housed the bones of the noble dead. This area, some distance from the new foundations, was different in its style and decor.</p> <p>Typical Gothic arches created both support and architectural features, but the walls and crypts were decorated with a strange combination of the customary and bizarre. Large crosses, in various metals, surrounded the grave sites, but were joined by myriad demons and gargoyles.</p><p>In the pit where they now dug, they had just come to an obstruction. He knew it, and the American knew it. As the professor chatted with the young woman in French, Brent at last gave Jean-Luc his undivided attention. He gave a little shake of his head, indicating that they should not tell the professor just what point they had reached.</p><p>Jean-Luc grinned. The American was smart. The corpse they were about to exhume might be laden with precious jewels and adorned in gold. Let the professor have his accolades. They would take the riches.</p><p>But the American frowned, and Jean-Luc frowned as well. What was Brent planning?</p><p>The young woman was lingering, speaking with the professor, but watching the American as he worked in the crypt. Why not? Jean-Luc thought with a shrug. The woman was young. Tall, sleek, elegantly, sensually built with full curves and a slim waist. She had long, sandy hair, and wickedly long legs. Large, luminous eyes, and a perfectly fashioned face. Smooth flesh. Professor Dubois was as wrinkled as a prune and as wild looking as an electrocuted Pekinese. The American worker was a tall man, wiry and powerful with an easy grace of movement and finely honed muscles that seemed to swell and tighten each time he used a tool. His features marked him as somewhere between twenty-five and thirty-five, while his eyes were that strange green-gold color and his hair, neatly long, almost to his shoulders, frequently tied, was a dark sable. Rich, probably tempting to a young woman. The world didn\u2019t change. Women might marry a man with intelligence and riches, but when it came to a man with whom to find pleasure, they tended to hunt out a man with physical power. Animal instinct. The American, however, still wasn\u2019t giving the electric beauty of his countrywoman much notice. He was pretending to dig deeper now, but making no real moves to disclose whatever treasure they might have come upon.</p> <p>Jean-Luc had simply paused; now he wondered if it was the American, or the grave, to which the young lady was giving her sharp attention while casually making conversation with the professor.</p><p>\u201cProfessor,\u201d Brent said suddenly and impatiently, interrupting the conversation and leaning on his shovel.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dubois demanded.</p><p>The American looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s late. We have to begin again in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so late. We shouldn\u2019t stop. I have studied the old records. We must be nearly upon the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you are upon the grave you seek, you\u2019ll want experts in here to move the final layers of dirt and sand, and you will not get the professionals you will need at this time. As of now, we have nothing here, nothing to bring in grave robbers by night. If we start again by morning, you will have ample time to do your discovery justice. It is nearly seven. We have already worked hours overtime. The church is closed.</p> <p>We must get this young lady out, and shut down for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have overstayed!\u201d the young woman exclaimed. \u201cI simply find it all so fascinating. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive you? Not at all, my dear,\u201d Dubois said, draw-ingJean-Luc\u2019s greater attention to the woman.</p><p>She wore jeans and a sweater and handsome black loafers, now covered with the dust from this realm of the dead. Simple clothing, but worn very well, hugging the form that had so drawn the professor\u2019s interest. Her hair was a sandy blond, long, but drawn back in a smooth, sleek ponytail that heightened the fine sculpture of her features. Her eyes, deepened by the murky light and shadow, appeared to be almost turquoise, the color of the sea off the French coast. They were never going to get the professor to let this morsel go.. .Jean-Luc could almost understand the old man\u2019s desire to hold on to something so simple as conversation, just as long as he could.</p><p>\u201cShall I see our guest out?\u201d Brent asked bluntly. He stared coolly at the woman. \u201cShe needs to be out\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, she must be seen safely out, but you must finish up. I will see the young lady out,\u201d Dubois said. \u201cMy dear, if you will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please, don\u2019t worry, I can make my way,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cI am simply so intrigued. I\u2019ll be back, if I may?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, you are so very welcome, Miss ...\u201d Dubois said.</p> <p>\u201cMarceau. Genevieve Marceau, Professor. And thank you, you\u2019ve been so kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA French name. But you\u2019re an American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf French descent. And I\u2019m familiar with such vaults\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut still! Alors! You must not go alone. The flooring is tricky. And despite the lights ... well, it gets late, and though we are underground, it seems even darker once the night has come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am absolutely fine. I will see you then, Professor. Thank you so very much.\u201d She shook the professor\u2019s hand. The professor was loath to let go of her hand. She managed to retrieve her fingers, and repeated, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Please!\u201d She started out then, quickly, determined to exit on her own. The professor looked after her for a long while. When she was gone at last he stared with narrowed eyes at the American. \u201cMake sure that the tomb is secured when you leave. Totally secured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The professor glanced at this watch. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I must make calls ... find the right people. And you!</p><p>Jean-Luc! Keep your heavy hand off the work from now on. You hack away as if you were plowing weed-strewn fields. This is great work going on here.\u201c</p><p>Without another word, the professor turned and started from the tomb.</p><p>Brent looked at Jean-Luc. \u201cI have to open this tomb tonight,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course. We have done the work. The professor will take everything; we are nothing to him but muscle. He is like a slave driver. But what will we do? If we rob the tomb, he will know. The government will be called in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, pay attention to me,\u201d Brent said impatiently. \u201cWe will open it carefully, and reseal it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd rob it first, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be a trinket, something you can take. But we are not robbing the tomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen .. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be a reward for you, and Dubois will never know. All right? Help me with the last of the dirt.</p><p>Quickly.\u201d</p><p>The dirt was easy to shift, but the sarcophagus was covered by a huge stone slab.</p><p>\u201cWe will never shift this,\u201d Jean-Luc muttered.</p><p>\u201cTake the side.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Luc hefted his huge frame against the slab, grunting and groaning, sweat immediately popping out on his brow. The American set to the task with him. The stone shifted and Brent shouted that they must be careful; they didn\u2019t want it crashing to the floor and breaking. The stone settled. They could see the coffin itself.</p><p>It was black. Crosses abounded over and around it. Brent immediately set to work removing them.</p><p>Jean-Luc joined in. \u201cThere is strange writing on the coffin. Look, how odd, I cannot make it out completely, but the words speak of the devil while the coffin is covered in signs of the Lord! Sacrebleu!</p><p>How very strange!\u201d</p><p>Brent had picked up a crowbar.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it will work. It appears as if the coffin has somehow been sealed with some kind of adherent ... like a soldering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will open it.\u201d</p><p>Brent shoved the crowbar against the coffin. The creaking sound it gave out caused even such a man as Jean-Luc to feel a prickle of fear at his nape. The silence that followed the creaking was deep and complete.</p><p>So deep, in fact, that they were both startled to hear a sound ... a furtive, rustling sound, coming from the exit to the vault. One of the portable lamps suddenly burned to an end; in the wall sconce at their side, there was a popping sound, and the area went dark. And still, they could hear something . . . footsteps, stealthy, careful, coming from the exit to the vault.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the woman, surely,\u201d Brent said, and swore impatiently. \u201cI\u2019ll get rid of her. Touch nothing, nothing, do you hear me, nothing, while I am gone, Jean-Luc, on pain of death. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Never. I swear that I will not,\u201d Jean-Luc said, and crossed himself. But as he watched the American silently disappear into shadows that seemed to close around him, he felt the birth of resentment in his soul. The American wanted to rob the tomb without getting caught. Good, sane concept. But the American wanted the finest riches in the coffin to be for himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The lid had been pried open; it was surprising that the American had managed it so easily. A sumo wrestler might have struggled with such a task.</p><p>Jean-Luc looked toward the Stygian darkness of the exit vaults. Brent was not returning, yet.</p><p>He edged his away around the coffin to the side where his work partner had stood. He could not resist.</p> <p>He lifted the lid of the coffin, hearing again the blood-chilling creaking as the hinges, hundreds of years old, gave way. He steeled himself against the ghastly look of the ancient dead; he had become quite accustomed to skulls; to open jaws that appeared to have been captured in a victim\u2019s last scream against death. Decayed flesh, withered flesh, gray and moldy, fragments of clothes, boots, with bits of bone poking through ... this would be nothing new.</p><p>Yet he gasped as he stared into the tomb. There was no scent of decay, not even the musty smell that came when centuries had passed since death. There was no bone to be seen. What he stared upon was</p><p>Eyes.</p><p>Eyes wide open, black as pitch, but open. Staring, staring straight into Jean-Luc\u2019s own. As if the corpse had never died but slept, and waited ...</p><p>And then ...</p> <p>The corpse moved.</p><p>Jean-Luc let out a shrill, bloodcurdling scream that might have wakened the dead not only in Paris, but in all of France ...</p><p>Darkness, wavering light, filled the tomb as the lamps suddenly swung. The black of the grave, the white of the flickering light...</p><p>The brilliant crimson of blood ...</p><p>All filled the tomb.</p><p>Standing in the vault, about to accost their unwelcome visitor, Brent heard the scream.</p> <p>And he swore, damning himself. And damning her.</p><p>\u201cMy God!\u201d she cried.</p><p>The woman had been returning to the vault. Sliding along the vaults with their smell of rot and decay, she had been returning to the site of the dig. Why? Who the hell was she? What was she doing. .. at this site, here, and now?</p><p>She forgot to hide as they heard Jean-Luc\u2019s scream tear through the corridors of the vault like the haunted shrieking of the damned.</p><p>And so she cried out herself. Cried out, and ...</p><p>She saw Brent, saw his eyes ...</p><p>Her scream echoed Jean-Luc\u2019s.</p><p>She turned to run.</p> <p>Too late ...</p><p>Oh, yes, by God.</p><p>Far too late ...</p><p>Tara had never heard anything quite like the sound that still seemed to echo within the walls of the crypt.</p><p>She had felt a strange sense of the ages while going down into the underground ruins, and she had felt a sadness for all the lives gone by, and even a bit of awe for lives lived so very long ago, and the intense history of mankind. She hadn\u2019t felt entirely comfortable with the mausoleums and graves of the dead, but she hadn\u2019t been afraid. Not even in the darkness and the gloom.</p><p>Then she heard the scream.</p><p>The shadowy light in the bowels of the earth gave life to the savage grins and leers of gargoyles, grotesques, and angels alike.</p><p>Sound seemed to rise from the dead.</p><p>The walls to grow closer, darker.</p><p>And there, ahead of her, as frozen by the sound as she, stood the American.</p><p>And the look on his face as he stared at her, in that split second when they were both paralyzed by the echoes that seemed to rise from hell, from the shrieks that still seemed to fill the hellish world of the dead in which they stood, transfixed her.</p><p>He stood some distance away, and she knew that he had come after her, somehow aware that she hadn\u2019t left the tomb, that she had an agenda of her own.</p><p>He was some distance down the corridor, where the tombs had been laid out as shelves. The shadows had grown darker as the work lighting had dimmed, as lamps had shattered. She couldn\u2019t possibly see his face, not really, he was just a silhouette there, and yet one filled with menace. And she was certain that he was staring at her with fury, and with a vengeance that seemed to make the hair at her nape rise.</p><p>Seconds, flew by, seconds, and yet in that time, she could feel his tension, as if it were an ancient wind, roiling down the length of the tunnel toward her. He would come after her, he wanted to kill her, do to her what she had heard in that bloodcurdling scream, still seeming to echo against stone and concrete.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t come toward her.</p><p>He turned, racing back toward the sound of the scream, as if hell had come bursting through the earth below the crypt, and if he could stop exploding fires that had risen from hell.</p><p>And yet she knew. He had seen her face. And every single line and nuance of her countenance had been embedded in his memory.</p><p>He would still come after her.</p><p>She turned and ran. As fast as he had run back toward hell, she ran away from it. Down the corridors that had been home to centuries of the dead.</p><p>Down through the darkness. Desperate, almost blinded by fear. The stairs to the new church at last loomed before her. She flew up them, barely aware of her feet touching the steps. She arose near the doors at the rear, raced across a length of marble and threw herself against the doors that would lead back into the sanity of the French night.</p><p>The doors were locked.</p><p>Brent felt as if he had been physically torn in two. And in the minuscule span of time during which he had heard the scream and stared at the woman down the corridor, eons of thought had passed through his mind.</p><p>He\u2019d been the biggest fool in the world to leave Jean-Luc alone with the coffin.</p><p>But he had known that the woman remained in the crypts, and he knew he must get her out. He hadn\u2019t even been certain that he had been right about the tomb. He had taken on the job of digging just as a precaution. Because of a vague legend that had circulated hundreds of years ago, a nightmare story told by schoolgirls and boys around the fire on a cold winter night.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>He should have known.</p><p>Despite her loafers, the woman could run. She had been far ahead of him. And she had run like a cougar, and he knew, even as he raced back to the tomb, his heart sinking, that she had taken off again, and she was sure to be trouble.</p><p>She had heard the scream as he had. And no one with any sanity or instinct or sense of self-preservation could ever be fooled into thinking that it was the sound of an owl in the night or a wolf howling in the far off woods.</p><p>He swore, even as he ran.</p><p>The scream ...</p><p>As much as he had heard, had seen in life, the scream still seemed alive. Within the walls, within his soul.</p><p>He swore to himself. He should have come to know Jean-Luc better. The scream that had echoed throughout the ancient stone had indicated that he had been a greedy fool, that he had opened the coffin.</p><p>That legend was true.</p><p>And Jean-Luc had already paid the price of greed.</p><p>Brent raced with lightning speed back to the site of the excavation. But as quickly as it had all occurred, he was too late. Which, of course, he knew. Too late for Jean-Luc. And yet had hoped that he would not be too late for ... others.</p><p>Yet he knew that he would be.</p><p>Time might have been a trick of the light.</p><p>The lanterns that had illuminated the room had been cast down, broken, shattered. Only a few, down but not broken, remained to provide even a trickle of sickly, ash-colored light. Shadows ruled.</p><p>Brent damned himself over and over for leaving.</p><p>In the near darkness, he moved cautiously, all his senses attuned to the slightest movement. Yet even as he took reasonable care, he was certain that it would not matter. The tomb was empty of the living.</p><p>Of any creature ... with even a semblance of life. Even the rats had fled.</p><p>His eyesight was excellent in darkness and shadows. He found his way back through piles of earth and stone and around other craters of the dig.</p><p>He found the hole in the floor. So carefully dug. The centuries-old tomb.</p><p>In the pit, the open lid displayed an empty coffin. Jean-Luc lay on the floor beside it. Brent bent down, touching the shoulder of the man, seeking to roll him and try to find any facsimile of a pulse.</p><p>The head rolled to the side at his attempt, completely detached from the body. Jean-Luc was like a doll seized by a child in a frenzy, ripped into pieces.</p><p>Brent noticed the stains on the floor. Blood vessels had been completely severed, but there were no great pools of blood.</p><p>He stood, closing his eyes. He held dead silent, taking a moment to listen, but the crypt was empty. He couldn\u2019t hear so much as the scratch of a rat\u2019s claw or the scamper of a spider across the floor.</p><p>But then ...</p><p>There was something, a sound, far above him.</p><p>A banging. He closed his eyes and listened intently. Far, far above. From here, in the bowels of the earth, the next sound was faint, almost like the crying of the wind. It was the woman, screaming.</p><p>The crypt was empty.</p><p>The coffin\u2019s occupant was gone, and despite her years of incarceration, she would be carefully testing the new world now. Hidden in the night, in the shadows. Carefully exploring.</p><p>A long night lay ahead. Yet...</p><p>He stared down at the remains of Jean-Luc.</p><p>She had feasted. He might have the night, and the following hours of daylight, to find her before she felt the thirst again.</p><p>There was nothing else to do here ... except see that he was not arrested himself. He turned, and moved with fluent speed back along the corridors he had followed earlier. He moved in silence, still.</p><p>He noted the bag against the wall and stopped. A small leather shoulder bag. It belonged to the woman in the crypt. He knelt down beside it, feeling no qualms as he dug into its contents. She had said that her name was Genevieve Marceau. She had lied. Her name was Tara Adair. He studied her passport, her other IDs, and the contents of her purse. He stuffed the contents back into the small leather bag, and fit the bag into the leg pocket of the painter-style denim jeans he wore.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized that she had lost her purse.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t known? Or hadn\u2019t cared.</p><p>She had been desperate to escape. Naturally.

Not through anyone named Adair.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>He stopped, turning back, aware that she was still banging against the doors and screaming above him.</p><p>There was a cell phone in her purse.</p> <p>She was probably realizing just about now that she didn\u2019t have it.</p><p>He turned back quickly, dug into the purse once again. He quickly hit the buttons on the cell phone, memorizing the last number she had dialed. He scanned the contents of the purse again, but there was nothing that gave an address in or around Paris.</p><p>She had come from New York City. That morning.</p><p>Still, she spoke French decently enough, with a few hesitations and an atrocious accent. But she had a good comprehension of the language.</p><p>Then, digging in her wallet, he found a half-ripped luggage tag. It gave an address on the Upper East Side of New York City. It also listed an address in the village here, in this little place on the outskirts of Paris.</p> <p>He narrowed his eyes. Wondering.</p><p>He thought he knew the place.</p><p>From long ago, but...</p><p>He rose, and started down the corridor again. He had to reach the woman. One way or another\u2014even if someone reached the door to the main church before he did.</p><p>There was no way out of it. She had to be hunted down. Stopped.</p><p>But not until he knew what she had been after in the crypt.</p> <p>The man arrived at the cafe just after dusk.</p><p>Fashionably, casually dressed, self-assured and aware of his assets, he sat sometimes aloof, and sometimes offering a smile for the one female server at the cafe. He was not the type of man who invited casual conversation, and yet he was not averse to talking to strangers when the occasion warranted, nor was he particularly severe. When he chose, he gave that smile, and when he chose, he engaged in discourse about the weather, travel, and the beauty of the country when autumn approached.</p><p>As evening came, he sensed a strange disturbance in the air around him, and he felt a knot of tension building within him.</p><p>That evening, he waited.</p><p>He had waited before, and he would wait again.</p><p>The girl came by his table, asking if he would like more coffee. He drank it black, a large cup, like many Americans. But his French carried no accent. If he were not a Frenchman since birth, he had long ago mastered the language with all the smooth fluidity of a native Parisian.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur, another coffee?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>His eyes lingered upon her for a moment. She was young, slim, wide-eyed and pretty. He smiled in return, and saw the way that his smile touched her face\u2014she was flattered, she felt instantly close, and warmed.</p> <p>\u201cAnother coffee, certainly... Yvette, is that what your tag says?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am Yvette,\u201d she answered. Her words had taken on a slightly breathy quality. Ah, the young ones! So easily drawn to the attractive and powerful. Admittedly bored from his constant vigil, he felt the urge to play.</p><p>\u201cYvette .. . always, one of my favorite names,\u201d he said softly. \u201cCan you sit a minute?\u201d She glanced over her shoulder nervously, looking for her boss. Indecision touched her large, deep brown eyes. Ah, but the lure was greater.</p><p>She sat.</p><p>\u201cHow late do you work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMidnight, monsieur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but tell me, how old are you?\u201d he queried.</p><p>\u201cOld enough,\u201d she assured him. \u201cNearly twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d he told her. She had placed her hands upon the table\u2014perhaps ready to push against it and jump up should her employer appear. He brushed her fingers with his own and leaned closer, just a little tete-a-tete, something the few other customers lingering about the cafe would not notice. She shivered at his touch. Her eyes came to his. She seemed to be fighting to speak. \u201cYour name, Monsieur?\u201d she managed at last.</p><p>He crooked a finger toward her, beckoning her to lean in, toward him. She did so, a pretty fall of brown hair covering her face, and his.</p><p>Yet even as he played, he felt a sudden jolt rip through his body. He pulled back, leaving the girl as she had been, mesmerized. He stood, and looked around.</p><p>Then cursed himself. Something had gone wrong. Terribly wrong.</p><p>He threw francs upon the table, lifted the girl\u2019s chin, and muttered a quick thanks to her, and a promise that he would see her later. He knew, even in anger, that he wanted the friendship of this place, across from the church ...</p><p>And near the police station.</p><p>He hurried across the street, still cursing himself, and wondering what the hell had gone wrong.</p><p>The rugged American digger was behind her before she ever even realized it.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard him come up the steps, hadn\u2019t had the least idea that he was there until he came directly behind her and spoke.</p><p>\u201cIf you stand aside, I can try to break it.\u201d</p><p>She screamed, jumping away from him, clearing a space.</p><p>The glance he gave her seemed disdainful. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here through this door. Someone at the cafe down the street should have heard you by now. Of course, they\u2019re always playing loud music.\u201d Tara kept her distance from him, feeling her tension running the entire length of her body. Every cell of her flesh seemed attuned to danger.</p><p>The night lights left on in the church were dim, but offered far more illumination than the trickles of light down below that had done little more than turn blackness into murk. He was moderately tall, probably about six-one, and though he appeared wiry and well-muscled, he was no sumo wrestler. Yet there was something about him. She could almost feel the heat of his energy, the tension in his muscles. She had a feeling the man could snap a neck with the flick of his wrist. There was an underlying sense of sleek and steadfast power to his least movement. It created a complete contrast of emotion within her. The first, to get away, to keep her distance. The second, to come closer, to stand behind the bastion he somehow seemed to offer. To trust in the strange, compelling urge to come closer.</p><p>She remembered the scream she had heard. Her mistrust of everything and everyone within the crypt.</p><p>She was staring at him, she realized. Almost hypnotized by the yellow-gold color of his eyes. They were hazel, simply hazel. She had watched him work in the crypt, heedless of her appearance there, or annoyed by it, one or the other, and still, she was fighting the strange urge to trust in him implicitly.</p><p>Fight it? Hell, yes, she possessed the logic to do so, and she was furious that she had stood so long, staring, and yet, she thought, in truth, probably only seconds had gone by.</p><p>Then he moved.</p><p>And so suddenly that she was startled into jumping again as he slammed a shoulder against the door.</p><p>Once again, his strange, near-yellow eyes fell upon her. To her surprise, the door shuddered as he did so, the wood sounding as if it was about to give.</p><p>Then she remembered that she had been ruing the loss of her phone just as he arrived. He slammed against the doors again.</p><p>They might be hundreds of years old, even in the \u201cnew\u201d church, but they were heavy, solid, and strong.</p><p>\u201cMy\u2014my phone is back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my purse. A cell phone. I\u2014dropped it back there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go back there for it?\u201d he queried.</p><p>She felt whatever blood had been left in her face drain from it at his words.</p><p>She moistened her lips.\u201cWhat happened back there? What was going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he asked, pausing a moment and rubbing his shoulder. He leaned against the door as he did so, studying her with a direct gaze.</p><p>Strange sensations swept through her. Fear, for one. Because he was part of this. Because he had raced after her. Because she had seen his eyes in the crypt.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>Again, she wanted to run. She didn\u2019t want to tell him the truth. The ridiculous truth. That she had promised she would find out everything. That her grandfather thought he was part of the \u201cAlliance.\u201d That she had been told to find out exactly what and whom they had been looking for, to bring back names, dates, anything she could discover. To try to listen when the professor and the workers talked, to make sure they were not yet close to an important discovery.</p><p>Fear ...</p><p>And yet, he was leaning against the door, keeping his distance, trying to help her escape, the same as he was doing himself.</p><p>And there was something about his appearance ...</p><p>Classic looks that were somehow rugged as well. An all-American appeal with a touch of European sophistication. Something very basic about him seemed to demand trust... and to compel her to move forward. Her mind warned her to keep a good distance. She stepped closer anyway.</p><p>He was wearing a denim work shirt, the sleeves rolled up, hinting of solid muscle in the biceps above.</p><p>He was covered in dust, and still, somehow, his appearance was essentially neat and businesslike. And he appeared calm and stalwart in the face of...</p><p>\u201cWhat happened back there?\u201d she demanded. She had stepped forward again. She was just inches away from him. His jaw was square, his eyes direct. Cheekbones high and somewhat broad. There was a hint of five o\u2019clock shadow on his jaw.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, but slammed a shoulder against the doors once again. To her amazement, there was a loud cracking sound that time, followed by a snap.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get the police,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cPerhaps you should go.\u201d Those yellow eyes were on her, as if he knew ...</p><p>That she didn\u2019t want to explain her grandfather\u2019s strange demands, especially in light of...</p><p>She shook her head determinedly. \u201cI need to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think happened?\u201d he asked impatiently. \u201cJean-Luc is dead.\u201d She stepped back again, and he let out an oath of impatience. \u201cObviously, I didn\u2019t do it. I was chasing after you when we both heard the scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ...\u201d She couldn\u2019t swallow. She couldn\u2019t make another word follow the single syllable she had uttered.</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke in. Of course. This is a dig. Someone out there knew that there must have been\u2014something\u2014in the tomb. The coffin in empty. I don\u2019t know what was in it because Jean-Luc opened it when I ran after you. Now Jean-Luc is dead, and I\u2019m going to the police. Now, are you coming with me, or are you going home? Are you going to tell the police why you were running around at a closed architectural site? Wait! Never mind\u2014don\u2019t answer yet. I\u2019m not staying in this place any longer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m getting the hell out.\u201d He shoved at the door, creating a gaping hole.</p><p>Broken wood creaked and groaned again.</p><p>She crawled through, trying to force her numbed mind to function.</p> <p>Dead, a man was dead. Well, she had known that, had known it since she had heard the scream. And, of course, one thing was true. This man hadn\u2019t killed his French coworker. He had been in the corridor, chasing after her, just as he had said, when they both heard the scream. She was an American, snooping around an excavation site she had been asked to leave.</p><p>She would have to explain . . .</p><p>What she didn\u2019t understand herself.</p><p>\u201cA man is dead,\u201d she said, the words coming from her painfully. \u201cI can\u2019t run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man is dead, and there is nothing you can do,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou were where you shouldn\u2019t have been at the time. Trust me, I intend to report the matter.\u201d He swore again. \u201cListen, I\u2019m trying to let you out of this mess.\u201d</p> <p>It was night. Her grandfather\u2019s old Citroen sat in the lot by the cafe. People were milling outside it. She heard music, laughter.</p><p>She needed to see Jacques. She could always go to the police.</p><p>He must have read her mind. He was about to speak when he stiffened suddenly, almost as if he had seen something.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>It was more as if he had sensed something, like smoke on the air, a promise of a devastating fire.</p><p>\u201cDrive home,\u201d he said, his words suddenly tense. \u201cGo home. If you don\u2019t like what you see in the newspaper, you can run to the police tomorrow. Tell them what you saw.\u201d He turned away from her, starting down the walk from the church to the street. She ran after him. \u201cThey had best find out who did this,\u201d she said firmly, her words a warning.</p> <p>He nodded, letting her go as she passed him.</p><p>\u201cTara.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and turned back.</p><p>\u201cBe careful. Get in your car immediately. Now. Lock the doors, drive straight home, don\u2019t pause for anyone.</p><p>Don\u2019t invite anyone into your house who is a stranger. Don\u2019t go out alone at night. Do you understand?\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, there is a murderer loose in Paris. One who might have seen you.\u201d He walked past her. She saw that his determined footsteps were bringing him up the slight bill to the village center, and she knew that there was, indeed, a police station there.</p><p>She started across the street. Suddenly, she panicked, wondering how she was going to drive home when she had lost her purse in the crypt, then realized that the keys to the car were in her pocket.</p> <p>But as she got into the Citroen and gunned the engine, she realized with a sinking heart that the police would know that she had been in the crypt. They would find her purse.</p><p>But as she was about to go back, a chill shot through her.</p><p>Tara.</p><p>He had called her by her real name when she had introduced herself to the professor with an alias she had pulled out of thin air.</p><p>Her mouth went dry.</p><p>She needed to stop, get out of the car, go to the police.</p><p>She turned. He had stopped, he was down the street staring at her. Staring at her, or watching over her, like a strange sentinel?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go back. Not now. By tomorrow, she would know if he had indeed gone to the police, and if he hadn\u2019t, she would do so. And she would be able to describe him. And insist that although he had not committed the murder, he might know something about it.</p><p>This was illogical. She should go to the police immediately.</p><p>But an instinctive voice was rising inside her. No. Do as he says!</p><p>Shaking as she was, she pulled the car out onto the street, and headed for the chateau.</p><p>She needed to talk to her grandfather.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>There would be little that the police could do.</p><p>As Brent Malone sat in a chair before the desk of Inspector Henri Javet, he answered every question with complete honesty.</p><p>He didn\u2019t attempt to offer his own insight into the bizarre murder.</p><p>He admired the detective, and the speed with which the man worked. Within minutes, police officers had scoured the tomb. They had done so with competence and efficiency, being careful not to compromise any evidence that might be discovered by crime scene detectives and the forensic team. Then, when the site had been roped off and officials set in place to do all that they could, the questioning had begun.</p><p>And it hadn\u2019t been difficult to tell the truth. He and Jean-Luc had been closing down. He was afraid that a tourist might still have been on the premises. When he went in pursuit of the offending visitor, he heard the screams. The visitor had departed. Professor Dubois had left by the excavation route, but after finding the remains of Jean-Luc, he had panicked himself and departed by crashing through the church door.</p><p>Javet, a man with dark eyes, slick dark hair, and a build that spoke of many nights in a gym, was amazed that Brent had been able to break down the door.</p><p>\u201cAdrenaline,\u201d Brent told him, lifting his hands in a rueful explanation. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to admit this, but</p><p>... I had no thought other than to get out, and get to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2018 re certain that Professor Dubois had departed?\u201d Javet asked him.</p><p>Dubois had been a total asshole through much of Brent\u2019s association with the man. That the professor was going to face intense questioning from the police himself seemed to be a beacon in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI believe he was gone. I can\u2019t be certain. Jean-Luc and I were working to finish for the night. And then I heard noise and knew someone was not out of the church. I thought perhaps a kid, a tourist. Maybe even someone who had been dared to spend the night in the crypt. You know how crazy people can get.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t started along the corridors long before I heard the screaming. But I have no actual time frame.</p><p>When I emerged from the church and came to you, it was dark already. I might have been walking along the corridors for several minutes ... or more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you raced back?\u201d Javet said, though they had been over this before.</p><p>\u201cHe screamed. My first thought was to help. Then I went to him, and I knew I couldn\u2019t help. My next thought was to get the hell out and get to the police.\u201d</p><p>65</p><p>\u201cYou were working legitimately in France?\u201d Javet asked sharply.</p><p>Brent produced all his papers. Javet nodded. \u201cThis is your correct address in the area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t intend to leave the country?\u201d</p><p>Brent smiled. \u201cNo, sir. I have no intention of leaving at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be out of work for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily money... I dabble in the stock market and real estate back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, you were doing manual labor on a dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an eternal student of history, Inspector. I was fascinated by the dig, and glad to take any work to be apart of it\u201d</p><p>Javet nodded. \u201cWhile it seems that the man who was killed was working to keep food on his table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that I remain a suspect,\u201d Brent said flatly.</p><p>\u201cYou were there. In fact, you were the only one there. Except for this tourist or student or whomever it was you were chasing when you say the murder occurred. What else can you tell us about him\u2014or her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is practically nothing I can tell you. I didn\u2019t have a chance to find the person. Perhaps they had managed to get out. When I heard the screams, I went back to the site. And found Jean-Luc. I touched him to see if he was still breathing, but I touched nothing else at the site. I got out of there as quickly as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead is dead. And still, the way the man looked...\u201d Javet wasn\u2019t an old man, but he had a drawn look to his features, as if he had seen many evils in his years as a detective. \u201cSuch a heinous murder. And all for an empty coffin,\u201d Javet said, shaking his head sadly.</p><p>Brent shrugged, lifting his hands again in a hopeless expression.</p><p>\u201cI touched nothing after I tried to see if Jean-Luc had a pulse. When the head... well, I was quickly certain that he was dead, and, as perhaps you can imagine, I felt a surge of pure self-preservation. And I also wanted to get to professionals like you as quickly as possible.\u201d Javet nodded. Brent forced himself not to look at his watch. Hours had gone by.</p><p>Hours he needed.</p><p>\u201cI will be holding on to your passport,\u201d Javet said.</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Javet said, leaning back, \u201cwe will go over it all one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, the entire event from the beginning to the end.\u201d</p><p>He had waited and waited, and all to no avail. Watched when the two had run from the broken door.</p><p>Watched, cursing and angry, as the police had arrived, swarming over the place.</p><p>And he had stood there and tried and tried to fathom ...</p><p>All for nothing.</p><p>So he had listened. Listened to the officers talking. And then he had known what was about to occur, and hurried to position himself properly.</p><p>Shadows were easy to find in the dark streets of the village. By the train station, they were numerous.</p><p>And so he waited, watched, tensed and ready, using every sense within him.</p><p>They weren\u2019t needed. The man arrived on the train from Paris in full uniform. He immediately began to follow him. When they were on the streets alone, and the shadows were dense and tight, he approached him.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur!\u201d</p><p>The man, assured of his office and his own abilities, stopped impatiently. \u201cYes, where are you? What is it?\u201d</p><p>He stepped out of the shadows.</p><p>And approached the impatient officer.</p><p>\u201cI have information for you,\u201d he said quietly, coming close.</p><p>A cloud covered the bit of moon in the sky, and all the stars, and the two were swallowed up by the shadows.</p><p>Brent again looked at his watch, damning this man who went over and over every small detail.</p><p>Javet spoke. \u201cI must tell you as well that, as you were the only person known to be present, I could hold you now for suspicion of murder.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I had murdered the man myself, I would hardly be running to you now, telling you all that I know.\u201d Javet shrugged. \u201cI usually have a sense for certain things, Malone. And I sense that you are telling me the truth, and that you are not a murderer. But the village, and perhaps all of Paris, will be in great alarm.</p><p>They will be demanding an arrest, so that they can sleep tight in their own beds at night, unafraid. There may be many as well who think that you should be arrested on the spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to arrest me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at this moment. Every word you spoke rang true when we came to the crypt. The coroner says that you must have come straight here upon finding the body as the man had been dead so short a time.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t have hidden any riches or done away with a decaying body so quickly. For now ... no, you are not under arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ll be watching me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou assume correctly.\u201d Javet hesitated for a moment, as if he considered his next words carefully.</p><p>\u201cThere is a sense of unease rising in the city center as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Brent frowned. He\u2019d been so totally concentrated on the work in the crypt that he\u2019d paid attention to little else. \u201cHave there been other murders lately?\u201d Javet had been carefully watching him for his reaction. He shrugged. \u201cIt is probably all unrelated. We\u2019ve had reports of missing persons. But you know ... people sometimes disappear because they choose to do so.\u201d</p><p>Brent leaned forward. \u201cAnd sometimes they disappear because something has been done to them. How many missing persons?\u201d</p><p>Again, Javet hunched his shoulders. \u201cFive\u2014in my files. One was a British tourist ... a young woman of about twenty-five.\u201d He pulled open a drawer in his desk and produced a file, flipping pages. One young man, four young women in total. Two were prostitutes... the man and the other two were tourists. All three tourists possessed rail passes, so they could be almost anywhere, backpacking through Europe. As to the prostitutes ... they worked the seediest streets of the city, had drug habits, and ... well, they were young, but defying death on a daily basis.\u201c</p><p>\u201cA prostitute murdered by a John or a pimp would</p> <p>most probably be discovered in an alley somewhere, don\u2019t you think?\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve not found a single body in an alley, and as I said, the other young people might be anywhere\u2014you know, children will forget to call home, and nervous mamas will call, and become more nervous. So, we have taken the reports, and the files and pictures are all across the entire metropolitan area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything on the news, or in the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must not read past the first page. There has been mention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there should be more mention made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis is the City of Light. We need visitors from around the world. We try not to panic the public irresponsibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarning them might be nice as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should walk out before I do decide to arrest you.\u201d Brent leaned back. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to arrest me, because you actually believe that the disappearances might have something to do with this murder. And you do know that I didn\u2019t kill Jean-Luc, so there is an unknown murderer out there. He\u2014or she\u2014might be afraid that I did see something, and therefore, on the streets, I might be bait to lure the real killer.\u201d</p> <p>Javet shrugged. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d He kept staring at Brent as if he could read something from watching him.</p><p>Brent stared back.</p><p>At last Javet lifted his hands. \u201cYou are free to go. As long as you do not go far, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can hardly ask you to trust a stranger, but I am as anxious to see his murderer brought to justice as you are, sir,\u201d Brent said, rising.</p><p>Javet rose as well and shook his hand. Brent was aware that he spoke very softly to one of the men who came by his desk as Brent started out. The inspector was aware that his French was fluent, and he didn\u2019t want Brent knowing that he was to be followed.</p><p>Even if he hadn\u2019t heard the whisper, Brent knew that men would be sent out to watch his movements.</p><p>He left the station, lit a cigarette on the street, and then paused.</p><p>There was something ...</p><p>A strange sensation touched him again.</p><p>He had felt it before, coming from the crypt, onto the street When he had insisted that Tara Adair get in her car and leave quickly.</p><p>Now ...</p><p>For a moment, the feeling was strong.</p><p>And close, very close.</p><p>Looking back, he frowned. The station suddenly seemed to rest in a large shadow. Down the block and across the street, there was still much police activity around the outer entrance to the dig.</p><p>He looked back at the station, and went over his conversation with Javet again. He considered everything he had seen and sensed regarding the man.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>And yet it was there, the feeling of unease. That something wasn\u2019t quite right here.</p><p>He walked back in. The sergeant at the desk stopped him. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see Javet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has just left with another inspector. You\u2019ll have to come back.\u201d The sense of unease remained. And yet...</p><p>It was as if something had been ...</p><p>And even as he stood there, it faded ...</p><p>And was then gone.</p><p>He could do no good, standing there, arguing with the desk sergeant on duty.</p><p>He walked down the block to the cafe, took a table outside, and ordered coffee with a whiskey, neat.</p><p>He paid when his drinks arrived, then pretended to linger, staring at the crime tape around the crude stairway that led down to the excavation site from what had been a garden square area before the church. The front of the new St. Michel was also cordoned off now, around the door he had broken down.</p><p>He waited, then spoke to his waiter about the toilet facilities, and rose. Once inside, he followed an employees only door out a hallway to the delivery entrance in the rear.</p><p>He was not followed.</p><p>His car was on the street. He chose to leave it while he walked on to another bar. Once inside, he used the pay phone, though he had a cell phone in his pocket.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t certain that the phone even rang. He heard the deep voice answering almost instantly.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve felt it coming. It was today ... tonight for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known. I suspected. I\u2014failed,\u201d Brent said flatly.</p><p>\u201cThere is no blame. Unless I were to take it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne is dead. That I know of\u2014for certain\u2014so far. I\u2019ll be on the prowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have tickets already. You\u2019ll get us at Orly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been to the police. I\u2019ll explain when you arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already have tickets on the overnighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow then. I\u2019ll do what I can tonight. But... it\u2019s a big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can as well.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, walked outside, and made certain that he wasn\u2019t being followed.</p><p>He stood very still, feeling the breeze, listening.</p><p>There was nothing. Nothing on the air. Nothing in the wind.</p><p>Not even a sense of direction.</p><p>Still, he had to move.</p><p>Five disappearances. Five that were official. Paris was a transient city. People coming and going all the time.</p><p>There could be more. Many more.</p><p>And now, this girl in the tomb, if she had been seen, if they knew that she might even begin to suspect. ..</p><p>He considered taking his car, then decided against it.</p><p>For a moment, he closed his eyes, and saw her as she had stood in the tomb. Slim, blond, erect, beautiful features, intelligent, suspicious, and determined eyes. Unnerved, but not a coward, dignified even in fear. He had barely seen her, barely spoken with her.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>A sudden urge to protect and defend her gave him new direction. It was, of course, because he was pretty certain of just who she was.</p><p>And because he was fairly certain that the disappearances had plenty to do with the murder that had occurred tonight, he had good reason to worry about her.</p><p>The night was long. He need only see that those in the greatest danger were secure. And then the hours of darkness would stretch on.</p><p>And there were, of course, those things which must wait until dawn.</p><p>Determined on his course, he started out of the center of the village, seeking the darkness of the roads in the more rural region beyond. He walked and looked up at the sky. Not a full moon ...</p><p>A waning moon. But it was riding high in the heavens.</p><p>He moved more quickly, ever searching the village, and those now stopping to gawk at the police activity at the dig site.</p><p>More and more, he became certain of the reason that the girl had been there. There was so much she didn\u2019t know, and still...</p><p>She would.</p><p>He knew the address of where she was staying.</p><p>He knew where she lived.</p><p>They did not; not yet. And still, that sense of danger remained.</p><p>He began to run.</p><p>In seconds, he was swallowed up in the darkness.</p><p>Tara jerked the car to a halt in front of the chateau and went flying in, noting that Ann had not come from work. She rushed through the hall to the library, but her grandfather wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>She raced up the stairs to his room.</p><p>With pillows piled behind his back, he had been sleeping. The sound of her arrival woke him, and he opened his deep blue eyes, staring at her intently.</p><p>She had never been disrespectful to her grandfather, and she didn\u2019t really mean to be so at that moment, but words spilled from her lips before she could stop them. \u201cWhat the hell did you send me into?\u201d He stiffened, all attention, rheumy eyes as sharp as tacks.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA murder? You\u2019ve got to be explicit. Exactly what happened, who was murdered, and where did it happen?\u201d</p><p>His determined calm forced her to breathe a little more slowly, but she could be as stolid as he was, and she meant to understand what was going on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI went to the church, and they were allowing tourists into the ruins. I flirted with that ridiculous Professor Dubois, and learned that he was certain he was near to discovering the coffin of a noblewoman who had lived during the reign of the Sun King. She had been his mistress, but she had been ordered buried in unhallowed ground because of her evil practices. I kept at it as long as I could, and yet I was being urged out. They were closing down for the day. Still, I lingered, wondering if I could sneak back and eavesdrop on the workers. One of them came after me. When he did, there was suddenly the most god-awful scream I have ever heard. The fellow who had followed me went back. I went blindly racing for a way out. While I was banging away at the church door, the worker who had come after me suddenly reappeared and broke the door down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard a scream\u2014but how do you know that someone had been murdered?\u201d Jacques asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause his coworker said he had been murdered and that he was going to the police.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut... he didn\u2019t urge you to go to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he urged me to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould the one fellow have killed the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just told you, he had come after me. We were staring at one another when we both heard the scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he insisted that you not go to the police?\u201d</p> <p>Tara let out a long sigh. \u201cHe swore to me that he was going to the police, and seemed to think that he was doing me a favor by insisting that I not go with him. Now, I think that I was an idiot. I should have gone with him, and told them what I know.\u201d</p><p>Jacques was shaking his head. \u201cWhat could you have said? What do you know? You know that you heard a scream, and that was it. There\u2019s brandy on the dresser there, get yourself some. Take a few deep breaths. Settle down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Ann?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelayed at her office. Thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks I am losing my mind. She would be furious that you took my words to heart and put yourself in danger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you put me in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to,\u201d he said softly. He was frowning. \u201cBut... at least you were out of the crypt, and you did not go to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, a minute. As a decent citizen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re American, not French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a human citizen of the world\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you could have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think I should turn around right now and go back and talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said with an alarm so great it worried her. His face had gone ashen; he looked weak and frail.</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fellow who urged you to leave was doing you a great service. You must keep your name out of any investigation. Someone went into the dig and murdered a worker. Perhaps that someone is very dangerous. If your name were associated with the case, you could be in great danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa,\u201d Tara said, \u201cyou must explain to me what is going on here. The professor thought a noblewoman was buried there. Was she buried with a tremendous fortune? What would cause someone to commit murder over a corpse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your brandy,\u201d he commanded her.</p><p>Because she was still shaking, she did as he said. She swallowed the contents of a small snifter without pausing for breath. Warmth flooded her. She hadn\u2019t realized that she had felt so cold. She poured more, then took a seat by his bed.</p><p>\u201cTell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this fellow who insisted you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him? He was one of the diggers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld, young? French, English, Italian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerican. Somewhere between ... I don\u2019t know... twenty-eight and thirty-five, I believe.\u201d Jacques was frowning again. \u201cAnd what did he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDusty.\u201d</p><p>Jacques frowned.</p><p>\u201cTall, wiry build. Strong\u2014he broke down a very heavy door for us to escape from the main church.</p><p>Brown hair, I think. Hazel eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort hair?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cProbably below collar length. It was tied back.\u201d Jacques shook his head, frowning, not looking at her, but seeming to search somewhere in his mind.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, hair, it changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Jacques, I mean it. You have to tell me what is going on!\u201d He stared straight at her. \u201cThere is evil in the ruins of the old church.\u201d She sighed and clenched her teeth. \u201cJacques\u2014that won\u2019t cut it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d he said, as if he were speaking to himself. \u201cThank God. I had not imagined they had come so far. I\u2019d not have sent you if I hadn\u2019t believed that I still had time to ... to stop it. To know. Now, I know. I was an old fool. Yet it\u2019s so difficult to become involved. And there are so few of us left.</p><p>Because the world has changed, you know. That\u2019s immaterial. Go to the top drawer of my dresser.\u201d She sat stubbornly. \u201cNot until you tell me what is going on.\u201d He closed his eyes and grasped his chest suddenly.</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa!\u201d</p><p>He opened one old rheumy eye.</p><p>\u201cGo to the dresser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not! I\u2019m calling the emergency line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Dammit, I\u2019m just exhausted, I\u2019m not having any kind of an attack! But I beg of you, do as I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you get away with this!\u201d she told him firmly.</p><p>\u201cOpen the drawer.\u201d</p><p>She opened the top drawer. Her grandfather\u2019s things were neat and organized.</p><p>\u201cOpen the little brown box.\u201d</p><p>She did so. There was a cross in it. A beautiful cross. Eighteen-carat gold, she thought, large, and elegantly fashioned.</p><p>\u201cPut it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing a birthstone pendant.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, appearing deeply upset. \u201cPlease, I beg of you, wear it. Wear it for me.\u201d She unhooked the necklace she had been wearing and replaced it with the cross. When she walked back to the bed, she was startled by the strength of his grip as he took her hand.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>She sat.</p><p>\u201cThis must be between you and me for now, please. You must swear not to talk to others about me behind my back, no matter how senile you think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were senile\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, you\u2019re the only one who hasn\u2019t. But swear to me, swear on the cross that you\u2019ll say nothing about this, whether you believe me or not. I cannot afford to be locked up in a mental institution at the moment.\u201d</p><p>He sounded perfectly rational. His gaze, fixed upon her, seemed as sane as any she had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cI swear, I won\u2019t repeat any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that they have dug up a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she cried, incredulity heavy in her voice.</p><p>He sighed deeply. \u201cThere are such creatures in the world, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. There are sick people in the world, I do know that. There are people who think they are vampires, and there are people who think that dogs and even gods speak to them, and command them to go out and do terrible things. But Grandpapa, there aren\u2019t real vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would not believe me. And I\u2019m very afraid that in time, you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost, here, Grandpapa. Help me. I want to believe you, or to at least find a logical explanation for what you\u2019re thinking, believing. Because I know you\u2019re not crazy, and you\u2019ve always been the brightest man I have ever known, sane, intelligent, ready to think and reason.\u201d Once again, he was shaking his head. \u201cWould that age were not such a brutal hindrance!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, there is evil in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid there are few so innocent and naive any more that they don\u2019t recognize that fact Man himself can be more evil than\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, sadly that is true. But this goes beyond your concept of what evil may be.\u201d She looked at him steadily. \u201cGrandpapa, I don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right; I know that I am asking a lot of you. But you must promise that you will pay attention to what I ask you to do.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve just agreed that you\u2019re not a senile old man. Therefore, I shouldn\u2019t have to humor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must do what I ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear the cross. Never take it off. And let no one into the house that you don\u2019t know. Be wary. Be rude. Don\u2019t make new friends while you are here. Think of the things you have heard in legends, in books, in movies, but don\u2019t count on them all. Oh, no. They can walk by day. They may be weak, and there are those among them who love garlic, though many do not Holy water is strong against those who are evil, not against all of them mind you, but those who are evil. And a cross ... a cross is a symbol. It is the same, it means nothing against those who aren\u2019t evil, and everything against those who are. Are you listening, paying attention? It\u2019s important. You must keep the windows closed. And ask no one in. That\u2019s very important. Ask no one in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques, please, I\u2019m going to try to do as you say, but you must admit yourself that you\u2019re sounding like a madman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must listen to me. I think, I still think, there are things that must be done, she must be stopped.</p><p>There are others in the Alliance, it has just been so many years, I thought myself crazy sometimes in the States, as if I had imagined it all from the Old World as well. And then there was the war ... and more wars. Always, wars. And that\u2019s when you see the evil of man, and sometimes learn the goodness of the Alliance. In the modern world ... but they are out there, and now she is out there, and you must listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Tara was listening, and she loved him, but the more he spoke, the crazier he sounded. Except that maybe he was right about one thing. If a brutal murderer had killed a poor worker to get into a coffin, there had to have been something in it of incredible value. And to keep from being caught, the murderer might well make her a target, if he knew that she had been all but a witness in the crypt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLord!\u201d she exclaimed suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy purse. It is still in the corridors of the dig somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the young man found it\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have it when we left the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t see that he had it. Don\u2019t be afraid. If it were there, most probably, our phone would have rung by now, the police would have found you here. Let us hope it is gone, as I have said. If it is found, you must say that you lost it when you visited the church and the excavation site. You must not let on that you know anything about the murder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is still wrong, my not reporting what I know. If I could help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help. Not by going to the police.\u201d</p><p>Tara heard Ann\u2019s car in the driveway below. She walked to the windows that looked down on the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d</p><p>She turned back. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t tell Ann about anything that I have said. She will not believe. She is beautiful and smart and loving\u2014and entirely pig-headed! And I fear ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fear what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI fear that I can\u2019t keep her from danger. You must watch out for her as well. Never risk yourself, but watch out for your cousin. She is all sense and fact and what the eyes can see, and this will not help us now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa, what exactly will help us?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cI have to think... I have to think ... if only the old Alliance were still about We have grown so weak with time, with the horrors of today\u2019s world. Men fight other battles, and they forget...</p><p>easy to forget because so few believe, and then again, if they did believe, what would happen would be frightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn is on her way up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must say nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, say nothing? She told me this morning that you wanted her to go to the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her that you went, that is all.\u201d</p> <p>Ann came up the stairs, hurried into the room, and spoke so quickly herself that Tara wasn\u2019t called upon to say much.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear? Dear Lord, I had the radio on while I drove home. I never do, I usually listen to CDs, music, you know, after endless meetings. There\u2019s been a murder. At the church. Something really horrible, someone broke in, apparently stole the contents of a coffin including the corpse, and murdered one of the workers. Horribly. The man was decapitated!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe heard,\u201d Jacques said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cTara, did you go there today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me shiver, just to think of it! My God, you must have seen the poor man who was killed!</p><p>Were they working when you went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose I did see him. But the workers ignored me, mainly. I struck up a conversation with the professor running the dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDubois,\u201d Ann said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met him. He is a wild-eyed fanatic with wild hands as well. Hm. At least now, he will be stopped.</p><p>And they will hold up the excavations, so that will please you, won\u2019t it, Grandpapa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all on the news already,\u201d Jacques murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, of course. A terrible murder was discovered. The one coworker discovered the other and went to the police. Of course, he is under suspicion. They don\u2019t say so on the news, but he must be. It was just him, and the dead man, who remained at the excavation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder,\u201d Jacques murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou wonder what?\u201d Ann said.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if Dubois was really gone. Have they spoken to him since this happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was called, according to the report I heard. He was shocked when he spoke to authorities, having been interrupted at his dinner after a long day. And, of course, he was deeply dismayed, but it didn\u2019t sound as if he was as dismayed about the worker as he was that his dig would be halted. But I certainly don\u2019t think he was guilty of killing his own worker. Nothing in the world meant more to him than that dig.</p><p>He is disturbed because his great scientific work will be held up by crime scene detectives.\u201d She looked at Tara. \u201cYou\u2019re all right? The fact that you were even there today gives me shivers. I\u2019m bringing Eleanora in from the stable tonight She will sleep in the hall.\u201d Ann paused and shivered again. \u201cThis is horrible. Horrible. Such a brutal murder to have taken place so close to us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is an alarm on the chateau,\u201d Jacques reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Grandpapa. I\u2019m not a silly little chicken. It\u2019s just unnerving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery unnerving,\u201d Jacques agreed.</p><p>Ann frowned suddenly. \u201cYou look exhausted, Grandpapa.\u201d She looked at Tara, as if her cousin\u2019s arrival and time this late with their grandfather was foolish and discourteous and Tara certainly should have known it</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. But I will sleep now. And Ann, you are not a foolish little chicken\u2014you must bring the dog in, and, of course, you must see that the alarm is carefully set And as I have been telling Tara, we must not invite any strangers into this house. You understand that? We mustn\u2019t invite any strangers in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Ann said. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you now to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him on both cheeks, and Tara did the same. His eyes caught hers, and in them, there was a look of pleading along with determination.</p><p>\u201cBonne nuit, Grandpapa,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>They started out of the room. He called after them.</p><p>\u201cIf there is trouble ever, of any kind, you must call me. I mean it. I fought in the Resistance, you will remember. And I may be old, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with my aim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Grandpapa,\u201d Ann said.</p><p>They stepped out of the room. Ann closed the door behind them. \u201cYou have to learn, Tara, how easily he tires,\u201d she said reproachfully.</p><p>\u201cI just got home, and have been with him only a few minutes,\u201d Tara said. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I adore him, too, and intend to be very careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be this shocking news that has so upset him,\u201d Ann said. She shivered again. \u201cWhen I heard on the radio ... my skin just seemed to crawl! Oh, Tara, I should have a wonderful dinner and sit down and be chatty, but I am so tired. I was thinking of a very large drink in the bathtub, and then bed. Would you mind? I know that I had suggested going out tonight, but the day was so chaotic, I ran so late, and then hearing about the murder ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to bed. I\u2019m exhausted as well. I never got to sleep because Grandpapa wanted me to go to the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had arrived tomorrow, it would have been too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I arrived today,\u201d Tara said ruefully. \u201cGo to bed, get your rest. I\u2019m off to my room as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going down for the dog. Eleanora is a shepherd, huge, and loyal, and so trustworthy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, then.\u201d</p><p>Tara kissed her cousin on both cheeks, and headed for her room. Once inside, she sat down at the foot of the bed. She felt numb. The worker had been beheaded.</p><p>Sweat broke out on her palms. She had been there when it happened.</p><p>She stood, trying to shake off the mantle of fear that seemed to tighten around her as she sat. She walked to the French doors that led out to the balcony and opened them to the night breeze.</p><p>Her room was to the right of her grandfather\u2019s, while Ann\u2019s room was to the left\u2014all three of them overlooked the front of the house with the drive and the entrance to the stable to the right when she was looking down.</p><p>There were no stars in the sky, and the moon was but half full. The chill of the coming fall suddenly seemed great She looked from the sky to the stable, wondering if she had the energy to go and give Eleanora a welcoming pat.</p><p>She heard a strange sound.</p><p>A baying. Fear seemed to clasp chilled wet fingers around her heart again.</p><p>A dog. It had been nothing but a dog.</p><p>And there it was. Down below, at the end of the drive. Eleanora?</p><p>The animal was huge. She heard the baying again. Deep, and otherworldly. A haunting sound that might have come from an entire pack of deep-throated animals, crying to the night and the heavens above.</p><p>She leaned over the balcony. It was not Eleanora. It was not a shepherd.</p><p>It was a wolf. And a wolf as large as a horse, so it seemed.</p><p>There were no wolves here, just outside of Paris, she told herself. And she blinked. Hard.</p><p>The wolf remained.</p><p>And once again, the night was split with the unearthly sound of the creature crying out to the moon and the sky.</p><p>She withdrew, standing in the doorway, away from the balcony. She closed her eyes, wishing that the sound didn\u2019t seem to tear into her soul, and bring such a premonition of danger and fear.</p><p>A man had died. A horrible death. And she had been there, down in the darkness of ancient corridors that belonged to the dead. Naturally, she was frightened. And it wasn\u2019t at all usual to see a wolf in the driveway . . .</p><p>She opened her eyes. The wolf was gone.</p><p>Neither did she see Ann, securing Eleanora.</p><p>Tara hesitated for a moment, then suddenly heard a whinnying and thudding from the stables. She turned, ready to hurry down. Across the room, she realized that she had left the balcony door open.</p><p>She often left it open when she stayed at the chateau.</p><p>For a moment she stood there, watching the breeze touch the draperies. The feeling was soft, cool, seductive, but the chill was giving her goose bumps. She walked purposely back, closed and locked the doors to the balcony and then hurried downstairs.</p><p>There was no one about. But the front door wasn\u2019t locked, and she assumed Ann had to be outside, looking for the dog.</p><p>Old Daniel was still whinnying. It was very strange, because he was the most placid animal in the world.</p><p>Something had to be disturbing the horse.</p><p>She hesitated, afraid to step outside.</p><p>But...</p><p>Ann had to be out here somewhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was ridiculous. This was her home.</p><p>She stepped outside.</p><p>The door closed behind her.</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Light fell over the courtyard, but it seemed to be an eerie yellow. As she walked across the drive as she had done dozens of times, Tara felt prickles of fear along her spine, and at her nape. \u201cAnn?\u201d She called her cousin\u2019s name. There was no answer.</p><p>The large doors to the stable were hooked in their open position, allowing the strange colored light to just ebb into the stables. There was a light switch immediately within the doors. Tara hurried forward, ignoring her premonition and fear. She hit the light switch, and heard a snap and then a buzz. The lights came on, then flickered. She stood poised and ready to run back to the house, but then, the lights came on strongly. And there was Daniel, back in his centuries-old stall, brown eyes very wide.</p><p>\u201cDaniel!\u201d She hurried to him, sliding her hand down his long silky nose. He jerked away once. With his rear hoof, he kicked at the wall. He seemed to be looking past Tara, and to the courtyard beyond. She spun around, trying to see what the horse was seeing.</p><p>There was nothing there. And yet...</p> <p>That prickling sensation was still teasing her nape. And it seemed as if the huge horse was shaking as well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Daniel,\u201d she said, her tone loud, as if she would assure herself as well. She kept stroking him. He laid his heavy head on her shoulder after a minute and let her continue to pat him. She crooned softly to him. She felt the great animal begin to calm down.</p><p>\u201cYou all right now, boy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He turned to his hay bin and began munching.</p><p>\u201cGood night then, old boy,\u201d she said. Leaving the stables, she hesitated before turning off the light. Going across the drive, she saw no sign of Ann.</p><p>\u201cAnn?\u201d she called to her cousin.</p> <p>No answer. She found herself walking, calmly at first, then racing for the door. But then she reached the house\u2014and found that the door was locked. She cursed herself for not realizing her cousin might have come in first. She pounded on the door.</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019m out here!\u201d</p><p>She swallowed a burst of panic as the door opened.</p><p>Katia, gray hair mussed, a robe thrown over her nightgown, stood staring at her wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Katia stepped out, looking around.</p><p>Tara suddenly felt like a fool. There was nothing wrong, and nothing around her but the cool breeze of the night.</p><p>\u201cI was just saying hello to Daniel,\u201d she told the housekeeper ruefully. \u201cI thought Ann was outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was. She has come in\u2014and gone to bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Tara, it is nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you. I\u2014uh\u2014I didn\u2019t bring my key. I just came out to see Daniel.\u201d Katia nodded, but still seemed to think it was crazy that she had suddenly decided to see the horse at that time of night. No wonder the woman seemed to think she was daft.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really going to bed,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cBonne nuit,\u201d Katia told her, locking up, hitting the alarm buttons, and yawning as she headed to her own room behind the kitchen.</p><p>Tara walked back to her room, walked to the balcony windows, and hesitated again. She was exhausted, but she wanted a shower, wanted to wash away her fear and unease along with the dust of the crypt.</p><p>Just shower and sleep.</p><p>She let the water run over her, long and hot, then at last emerged and donned a cotton nightshirt. How long had she been up? Endless hours. Jet lag was setting in.</p><p>Maybe she would do some more unpacking.</p><p>Tara set to the task busily, hanging clothing, then taking out some of the canvases and paints she had brought with her. The easel Jacques had bought her years ago was still in the room. She set up a canvas, and found herself digging into her watercolors. She wasn\u2019t even sure what she intended to do, but she started first trying to create the colors of the nighL An image of grays, blacks, and whites began to form as well. She stared at the canvas, wondering what she was doing. Then she realized that she was really something like the walking dead, she was so tired. She had to get to bed and try to get some sleep.</p><p>But once in bed, she still lay awake.</p><p>A man had been killed. Brutally, horribly, murdered. And she had been there ... And her purse remained in the tomb. She had to pray God that the police were the ones to find it. And not the murderer.</p><p>Paris had changed.</p><p>Of course, she had seen the world change before. But nothing like this.</p><p>She hated the countryside, and had always hated the countryside. She had always loved the bright lights and bustle of the city, although she would have to say that\u2014 along with the machines ripping along the streets\u2014the country had grown up. There were people about There were shops. There were people at tables on the streets, drinking, eating. Some of them ...</p><p>Half naked. Ooh, la, la! The clothing these days!</p><p>She loved it.</p><p>There was a freshness and freedom all about her. Intoxicating. But she yearned for the city, and it didn\u2019t take her more than a few minutes to realize that she needed only to flag down one of the yellow cars to get a ride far, far from the dowdy little church in the village. And the farther they drove, the better, the stronger she felt.</p><p>The driver was first amused with her garments, yet he seemed to realize that her jewels were real. Well aware her clothing was not at all what it should be, she quickly convinced him that she was heading for a masquerade. He was young and good looking.</p><p>Delectable. She managed to get him talking about the city, about what was happening. She tried to be quite casual, and still ...</p><p>It was shocking to hear about the revolution. Shocking, amazing, deplorable. They had beheaded a king</p><p>. It was absolutely amazing. Of course, the cab driver then became somewhat suspicious, incredulous that there might be anywhere in the world that she hadn\u2019t learned something about French history of such gravity.</p><p>When he slowed to a stop, she leaned forward, and caught his eyes in the rearview mirror of the thing called a taxi. She touched his cheek, and told him that he was quite luscious. He started to smile ...</p><p>She chose not to kill him. She did, however, relieve him of his money.</p><p>Paris had changed.</p><p>And the shops were quite incredible.</p><p>She spent hours trying on clothing, telling shop girls that she had come into town for a costume party, only to discover that the mode of dress had changed. And since she was buying things for the evening ...</p><p>She was disturbed to find that she didn\u2019t have enough money for all the purchases she wanted to make.</p><p>Anger, or the thrill of her renewed power, nearly made her forget that she was in a crowded place. But she controlled herself, and she was glad, because she then found out about something called plastic that could be made into a card that worked better than money. And, of course, at the right moment, she was able to convince the shop girl that she had paid for everything that the sweet young thing wrapped up for her. She obtained more money, and a number of the plastic pieces that made buying so easy. The shop girl was young, naive, prime.</p><p>Such a pity that they were in such a public place. The girl was adorable.</p><p>Delectable. Surely, delicious.</p><p>She would remember the name of the shop.</p><p>There were moments on the street that she did not find so intriguing. The behavior of young people had become intolerable. They didn\u2019t know when to make way. The ogled ... ogled, as if they weren\u2019t at all aware of her position, of just who she was, and that, no matter what she had done, eyeing her so was a deadly and dangerous game. But then kings had been killed and who knew who ruled, and what the laws were and weren\u2019t these days. They knew nothing of finesse, of subtle charm, of the way to have what they wanted.</p><p>Sometimes, she would return a gaze. And do it in a way that not only sent a flush of embarrassment to a young man\u2019s face, but a flash of fear as well.</p><p>Then, she enjoyed herself once again.</p><p>Beginning to understand the value of her francs, she paused for wine at a sidewalk eatery, drank, and read from a paper that had been discarded by a previous customer. She shook her head. The changes were amazing. And yet...</p><p>What a world. She felt a rush of exhilaration, and yet curbed her longing to go about wildly in celebration. This time, she wouldn\u2019t make mistakes. She would jealously guard her strength, and gain greater power daily. She would send out her messages, seek within the world of dreams, and summon those who should be near her.</p><p>She finished her wine, pleased to have discovered that the French still enjoyed the best. And then, she began her explorations again.</p><p>There were old landmarks, and new landmarks. There were people and buildings everywhere. The next taxi driver insisted that he should take her elsewhere, that the destination she had in mind was certainly closed for the night She had to insist that she did not care.</p><p>He was not particularly attractive.</p><p>They came upon the old palace, and the man asked to be paid several times before she even heard his voice. By then, she was so furious that she turned and stared at him. He, of course, fell silent, and later, he wouldn\u2019t remember that he hadn\u2019t been paid. He would twist and turn, having strange dreams that night, but he wouldn\u2019t know why.</p><p>She continued to stare, appalled.</p><p>What had they done?</p><p>Naturally, the place was closed.</p><p>Naturally, she entered anyway.</p><p>She had no interest in security guards, and kept her distance from them. If she\u2019d been at all rational after being wakened from such a long, deep sleep, she\u2019d not have dug into the worker in the crypt like a half-starved waif. But then, she had been half-starved. But now, she had consumed him, and taken from others, and she could build up her strength through the coming hours when she would rest again. This night was a time of discovery.</p><p>She spent hours and hours wandering ... still appalled. Well, of course, there had always been art, but now ...</p><p>What had they done to such incredible beauty? But, alas, it was a place she knew, and once loved.</p><p>Appalling ...</p><p>Yet convenient that there were so many shops now attached. By day, she could imagine the number of people. And there were so many corridors and little rooms. It was still a fine place to seek some rest, and a good base from which to observe the new world. At least for the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It would be dangerous to stay too long, she realized. It was one of her old haunts.</p><p>And there might be those about who would know it.</p><p>Yet...</p> <p>There had to be someone about who knew her. Why else make such a determination to see that she was wakened? Perhaps she would have to find somewhere special near the village and the church to rest\u2014and observe. She must be far more careful than she had been in the past. She was aware that she had overstepped the boundaries of her power before, grown careless in her belief in herself, and in her position in the world.</p><p>Indignity swept through her.</p><p>She would not be so fearful as to become humble. That would be far too much.</p><p>She would simply be wary, and careful. And take things slowly. Slowly, until she had gotten a firm grasp on the ways of the world. And discovered who was out there. A thrill entered into her as she wondered</p><p>Yes, it could be.</p> <p>She thought about the village, as she hadn\u2019t before. And her eyes narrowed as she wondered if the same dangers existed.</p><p>Surely, they did.</p><p>Ah...</p><p>So first things must come first. She must be careful, lie low, wait. But there were dangers she could observe, and perhaps resolve, even while she watched ...</p><p>Waited.</p><p>But for tonight...</p> <p>The palace.</p><p>The things that they had done! She must see it all.</p><p>And so she wandered, deep into the region where the old architecture was displayed for the common visitors who apparently inundated the place daily.</p><p>By then, she had walked for hours, looked for hours ...</p><p>And daylight was coming.</p><p>Then ... the night.</p><p>By morning, Tara was feeling much more rational.</p><p>Like Ann, she was deeply worried about Jacques.</p> <p>No, perhaps she was even more worried. Her grandfather believed in vampires. That was extremely serious. But she had sworn to him that she would keep their conversation secret, and she intended to do so.</p><p>She wished that she dared talk to someone. Jacques had been right that there had been extreme danger in the crypt, something very wrong. But of course, now the police would know, and so it wasn\u2019t necessary for him to worry so much.</p><p>But he believed in vampires.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t share that with anyone, even if she hadn\u2019t made such a promise to him. She was very afraid that he would wind up locked away in an institution. So what should she do? Continue to regale him with logic? Or humor him.</p><p>Tease him. Tell him it was a pity they were in France and not Italy, where there was so much garlic that a vampire wouldn\u2019t dream of darkening the door.</p><p>No. Jacques did not seem to have a sense of humor about it; he was dead serious. And there had been a murder. A horrible, brutal, murder. But throughout history, there had always been enough greed and brutality among man. Perhaps inventing monsters was her grandfather\u2019s way of dealing with the evil in the world.</p><p>She could drive herself crazy with this. And with the worry that she should have done the right thing, and gone to the police.</p><p>Ann was about to leave for work when she came down to the kitchen. Katia was singing as she prepared a breakfast tray for Jacques. Roland was already out and busy about the grounds. Katia kissed Tara, who thanked her and waved her away, insisting she could get her own coffee. With cup in hand, she followed Ann to the car.</p><p>\u201cSo ... think we should still go out tonight?\u201d Ann asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Should we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really need a night out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tara said slowly. \u201cWe\u2019ll stick together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it seems to me that this guy was after the riches in the crypt I mean, he wasn\u2019t out terrorizing women or anything. Yes, I need a night out.\u201d</p><p>Tara thought for a moment and then nodded. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that we live in a world where murder is all too frequent. There\u2019s no reason to believe that someone who robbed a grave would be after us.\u201d As soon as the words were out of her mouth, she felt her muscles tighten. Where the hell was her purse? If the police had found it, they would have called by now.</p><p>Maybe the murderer had found it.</p><p>She felt the blood drain from her face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, definitely, we\u2019ll go out. I\u2019ll bring friends from work as well. In numbers, we\u2019ll be safe.\u201d She kissed both of Tara\u2019s cheeks and headed for her car. Tara looked down the drive.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ann called back.</p><p>\u201cI saw a wolf last night\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no wolves around here. There haven\u2019t been ... forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honestly, I saw a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, it was one big dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have very big dogs in France, you know. It was probably a big shepherd. Maybe it was even Eleanora. I went out to get her last night, and she was off prowling somewhere. Such a guard dog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could still swear it was a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe couple down the road have a pair of huge Mala-mutes. Maybe you saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Tara agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou were very tired. And we were all shaken by the news of that horrible, brutal killing! Now, though, Jacques will not want us crawling around the ruins anymore!\u201d She waved and blew a kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later and let you know about the plans.\u201d</p><p>Tara gave her a thumbs up. Then she wandered back into the house.</p><p>Katia told her that Jacques was still sleeping.</p><p>Normally, she would have spent her first morning just talking to him, perhaps taking a short walk in the small garden, or at the least, joining him for cafe au lait and croissants. But he was still sleeping, and, she was certain, he needed his rest She desperately wanted him to be at bis best And having learned that he was still resting, she felt an urge, strange as it was, to get out of the house.</p><p>To spend some time alone.</p><p>To think, to observe, to be in the village again, and look about, and see that the world around her was normal.</p><p>And she wanted to see the church. And what the police were doing.</p><p>Since no one had called yet, she needed to get up the nerve to go to the police and tell them she had lost her purse at the ruins\u2014during tourist hours.</p><p>She was glad that she had left some francs in her luggage so that she didn\u2019t have to ask Katia or Roland to borrow enough for a cup of coffee. And since she had showered and dressed before coming down that morning, she was ready to head out just moments behind her cousin.</p><p>She parked in almost the same spot where she had been the day before.</p><p>From a table in front of the cafe, she could see that large expanses of the area remained roped off. The church door had been jerry-rigged back together with new wood that didn\u2019t begin to match the patina of the centuries-old wood she had seen broken the night before. But the \u201cnew\u201d church itself had reopened.</p><p>Tara was certain, however, that access to the tunnels or corridors leading to the ruins of the \u201cold\u201d crypt were still blocked as well.</p><p>Having chosen her table, she picked up a newspaper and ordered cafe au lait She slid her sunglasses on, trying to pretend that her eyes weren\u2019t drawn to the church every other minute. Not that it mattered.</p><p>Though people were speaking quickly around her and her French was very rusty, they were all talking about the bizarre murder. And few of them seemed the least hesitant to simply stare at the church.</p><p>Her eyes were fixed across the road when something suddenly fell in front of her, rattling her coffee cup.</p><p>She started, nearly cried out, and looked up to see the worker from the night before. She instantly felt a flood of heat rush through her. She wondered in amazement that she hadn\u2019t sensed him behind her, she was suddenly so aware of his presence.</p><p>She looked down to see that it was her purse that had landed on the table.</p><p>He pulled out the chair at her side before asking, \u201cMay I join you?\u201d He sat She looked at the purse, and then back to him. \u201cHow did you get this? I thought you went straight to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I\u2019d picked it up and forgotten to give it you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him suspiciously. He was wearing dark glasses. If he hadn\u2019t spoken, she might not have recognized him. He was freshly shaven and apparently just out of a shower. Whatever aftershave he wore was subtle, pleasant, and alluring. He was wearing light chinos and a dark shirt His hair was loose, but not as long as she had thought. It reached just past his collar. He was tanned, at ease, and again gave a sense of casual physical power, not overly burdened with straining muscles, but smooth and sleek and taut as wire. Tara wondered if he was into the martial arts\u2014or perhaps an avid member of a fencing club. She immediately found herself noting that he was more than attractive, while a million warning signals seemed to leap to her mind. He gave the appearance of a grad student or a teacher on break rather than a stockbroker, but he was neat and clean and far more than merely presentable. A long-haired executive on break.</p><p>Long-haired executives did not dig into ancient graves for hourly wages.</p><p>The waiter must have thought he gave the impression of a man with some means or importance as well, as he hurried back to the table the minute the man was seated. \u201cCafe au lait, s\u2019il vous plait,\u201d he said, offering a broad and casual smile beneath the dark lenses of the shades. He was undoubtedly American, but his French was far superior to her own. She couldn\u2019t begin to detect the usual, guttural accent that those with English or a Germanic native language seldom ever lost.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember agreeing that you should join me.\u201d The words, Tara thought, were required. She wondered what she would have done if he had walked away.</p><p>\u201cAnd they wonder why we get a reputation for being rude!\u201d he said with a mock sigh. \u201cLast night, I saved you tremendous trouble and a great deal of time. I risked life and limb to save that\u2014\u201d he paused to indicate her small leather handbag, \u201cand here I am to return it, and you\u2019re far less than gracious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told not to speak to strangers. There\u2019s a murderer loose, if you\u2019ll recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2019re privileged to know that I\u2019m definitely not a murderer. Although to others,\u201d he continued, leaning close, \u201cI may remain suspect. There you go. In my defense of you, I have created my own hell with which to deal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere was no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s every reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, cordially thanking the waiter when his coffee came. Then he leaned close to her again.</p><p>\u201cThere would be no sense in playing it safe for myself. Everyone in the area knew that Jean-Luc and I were the primary workers Dubois hired. But there was no reason for anyone to suspect that you were in the crypt at the time\u2014 or that you had more than a casual interest in the dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had nothing more than a casual interest in the dig,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRight That\u2019s why you were crawling around in the underground corridors after making a point about knowing how to leave on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite frankly, I know nothing about the dig.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing at all?\u201d he queried.</p><p>\u201cI just arrived from New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you had a casual interest in what was going on. After a long flight, and probably no sleep, your casual interest brought you to the dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to explain myself to you. Come to think of it, I don\u2019t even know your name. And I\u2019m not sure that I want to know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick up a newspaper, and you\u2019ll read it. But since you\u2019re here, you don\u2019t need to bother. My name is Brent Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know my name, of course, because you went through my bag.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to return property when you don\u2019t know the name of the person to whom it belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve returned it.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cTara Adair. And you gave us a far different name. Something very French, if I recall.</p><p>You pretended you have French relatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have French relatives,\u201d she said, annoyed with herself immediately for being defensive.\u201c</p><p>\u201cI believe you. So\u2014what is your keen interest in the tomb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I tell you that I really know almost nothing about the dig, it\u2019s the absolute truth,\u201d she said.</p><p>He ran a finger around the rim of his coffee cup, then slid his glasses to the top of his head and watched her curiously. She noted again the almost golden color of his eyes. Very unusual.</p> <p>And it seemed almost impossible to draw her gaze from his.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about the crypts and the tomb and whatever you were on to that was so important that someone was killed over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a deconsecrated church crypt, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother St. Michel stood directly on top of it, once. They razed the original church, and built a hundred yards to the south. The corridors had been blocked and sealed for centuries. Then, recently, there was some work done In the basement of the new church, and there had been water damage in some of the walls. While the new church was being repaired, one of the old underground corridors to the old crypt ruins was discovered. Professor Dubois had been bugging the fathers at St. Michel for years, wanting to get down to the ruins. When the chance came up, the good gentle-men of the church knew that Dubois had some money and would definitely see that a large portion of it made its way to the church if he was given sole control of the dig. He has a reputation of a learned scholar in archeology, history, and especially local lore.\u201d</p><p>Tara found herself listening to the tone of his voice; it was lulling and alluring. She had taken off her own glasses. Long ago finished her coffee.</p><p>He smiled, seeing that she was watching him raptly. \u201cAnother cafe au lait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee. Would you like more coffee? I could use another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. I guess.\u201d She was being less than gracious. She managed a curt sounding, \u201cThank you.\u201d He smiled. Generous mouth, good teeth. She wanted to kick herself. She wasn\u2019t buying a horse. Yet she might have been looking over the qualities of an animal. Everything about him seemed to be exceptional and fine.</p><p>If she had met him at a different time ...</p><p>A different place, a different way ...</p><p>Yes, she would have found him attractive. Very. Even now, she found herself tempted to touch. He had an elusive quality of sexuality or sensuality or both that was almost ridiculously hypnotic. She gritted her teeth, irritated with herself. It was simple chemistry, and he was in great shape, the right age, with strong, masculine, attractive features. There was nothing in the least mysterious about his appeal.</p><p>And then again, she assured herself, the world was populated with any number of attractive men. She met many in her line of work. He was just one in the world. The same.</p><p>No...</p><p>Different.</p><p>But then, of course, that was because she had met him in a crypt.</p><p>He lifted a hand and their waiter nodded, returning with two more coffees. When he was gone, Brent Malone once again leaned toward her.</p><p>\u201cThe crypt was rumored to be the resting place of the damned and demons from hell.\u201d Tara smiled slightly. \u201cThat makes no sense. I\u2019m assuming that the original church was deconsecrated when the new church was finished. So until then, it was a working House of God. How could the evil of past centuries have been buried there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not your penny-ante evil people. Only the most truly evil and abominable\u2014and those, of course, who earned the hatred of the king. You see, it was sealed off hundreds of years ago, but there was always a way in. It was known by the kings and their most powerful lords, and by the hierarchy of the church as well. And when someone was to be entombed\u2014someone truly wicked\u2014. the corpse was taken in secretly\u2014at dawn rather than the dead of night, since the powers of the unholy are said to be greatest in darkness\u2014and sealed into their graves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His tone had carried a wonderful, almost spooky, storytelling ability. She nodded, as if accepting it all word for word. \u201cWell, we all have illusions, I suppose. The pharaohs of ancient Egypt thought that their wrappings and their rites would give them eternal life, that their preserved bodies would rise again, and they would live in splendor. And you can walk into the museum in Cairo and see room after room of once great rulers who lie in glass cases for the public to stare at, rather than have their bodies rise to renewed glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMummies... ah, well, they\u2019re a completely different story,\u201d he said with a dismissive wave of his hand and a touch of dry irony in his voice. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t believe in evil, or the powers of the dark, Miss Adair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil? Oh, my God, yes. The world is full of it. But there are so many evil men and women out there, we don\u2019t need to go looking into old stories and legends to find more.\u201d She frowned, realizing that she had made a very similar, determined, and rational statement to her grandfather. Too bad Jacques didn\u2019t have this man to talk to\u2014he wouldn\u2019t have to be worried about sounding as if he had become senile.</p><p>Even as the thought occurred to her, she felt a strange tension seize her. She didn\u2019t want this man near her grandfather. And yet, at the same time, she continued to feel that very odd attraction to him. Almost as if...</p><p>As if she\u2019d been waiting all her life to meet him.</p><p>She instantly and angrily dismissed such a ridiculous thought. He had that rather raw, masculine appeal, and she had been alone for quite a while, determined that her comfortable relationship back home had simply not been right. Artists and stockbrokers didn\u2019t always go together well. She suddenly wished that she hadn\u2019t split with Jacob, and had insisted that he come to Paris with her. If he were just sitting here now, she wouldn\u2019t be feeling such a strange urge to undress another man.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t having that urge.</p><p>Yes, she was. She\u2019d like to see him naked. Feel him next to her. Find out if it would be as thrilling to be touched by those hands as she was imagining.</p><p>Dear Lard, Tara! You\u2019re not that desperate! she told herself. She was thinking these thoughts about a stranger, a suspicious stranger.</p><p>He\u2019d been in the tombs when a man was murdered. But it was true, she was the one person\u2014other than the murderer\u2014who knew for certain that Brent Malone was not a killer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just telling you the history of the crypts, Miss Adair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me that the man who was killed opened up a tomb while you were gone and therefore opened a Pandora\u2019s box\u2014a coffin filled not with the earthly remains of a heretic or other, but filled with evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never told you anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI repeat, I\u2019ve just told you something of the history of the place. And of course, you are aware that centuries ago there were many people who did believe in the powers of witchcraft and that men and women could sign pacts with demons and devils. What happened in Salem, Massachusetts, in the United States was indeed tragic, but pales beside some of the executions in Europe, where thousands sometimes perished in a day for their practices.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNow you\u2019re making it sound as if it would be ridiculous for anyone to believe that there could truly be witches or other supernatural creatures\u2014 evil creatures\u2014buried in the ruins of an old church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is, Miss Adair, that years ago, many holy people did believe in the existence of evil in many faces. Often, thousands of innocents died because of fear, greed, politics, and religion. But fear was often very real. And if someone was greatly feared and considered evil and certainly no part of any church, that person was entombed in unholy ground. Such people were usually buried with all manner of rites and perhaps physical symbols so that they wouldn\u2019t rise again, or practice their evil again. History has shown us some very visible monsters, men such as Hitler, with such a cruel disregard for human life that they could be considered evil. There have been many\u2014not great leaders, but often nobility. Countess Bathory\u2014no one knows how many innocent young people she had killed to satisfy her blood lust and her search for eternal youth. She is but one of many cruel, wicked\u2014or evil, if you will\u2014people who have passed through the centuries. And ...\u201d he hesitated, leaning toward her. She leaned closer, fascinated with the power of his eyes. \u201cI am warning you, and I do with my whole heart. Stay away from the church. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Never let it be known that you were there at the time of the murder. Keep that cross that you are wearing around your neck on at all times. Trust no one. Never be out in the dark alone. I\u2019m afraid for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid for me. Should I be afraid of you?\u201d</p><p>She was startled, and yet didn\u2019t make a move, didn\u2019t jerk away, when he brushed his knuckles along her cheek. \u201cMiss Adair, I swear it, there is no need whatsoever for you to be afraid of me.\u201d No need? She was all but mesmerized. His touch had brought a sense of heat to her that seemed to stir senses and soul.</p> <p>She needed to be very afraid.</p><p>She needed to rise, and tell him to stay away from her, and from her grandfather. But then, she hadn\u2019t even mentioned Jacques, and there was no need to be afraid that he might know anything about an old man living in a quaint chateau, even if Jacques had acquired more than a following in his day.</p><p>She didn\u2019t manage to make herself get up. Or move away. She kept staring into his eyes. She didn\u2019t know if he was still touching her or not, because it seemed as if the warmth was still with her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t break away.</p><p>He could.</p> <p>He rose suddenly. \u201cExcuse me, some of my friends have arrived. I look forward to seeing you again.\u201d He pushed in his chair and walked away. She saw him greeting people, a couple, a very tall dark man and a slim, elegant, blond woman. They were dressed casually, as tourists, the woman in jeans and a denim jacket, the man in jeans as well, his jacket leather. They were an attractive, arresting pair, but then, Paris was filled with attractive people. She had the feeling that their intent was to blend in with the crowd.</p><p>They moved away, walking down the street.</p><p>They had gone a long way before she realized that she still hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>And that she still felt his touch.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>There was a new freedom in sleep.</p> <p>And freedom in dreams. Now, when she rested, she could fly.</p><p>Rise above the darkness, and fly in mist, in shadow. Concentration was essential, and she was glad of her chosen resting spot, for she felt completely secure, and therefore able to focus entirely on her task.</p><p>A flash of joy filled her as she felt the presence of another. Of course, they were guarded, all of them.</p><p>She was careful. Yet she felt elation and a whisper in the wind that surged around her as she soared through the world of darkness.</p><p>Is it you? The air, the darkness, spoke to her. And she replied, feeling glorious and powerful.</p><p>Yes! I am back.</p><p>I know. I meant to be there for you. Now, you must come to me.</p><p>The world has changed.</p> <p>The world will always change.</p><p>There is great danger. I sense it.</p><p>Yes. Come to me. We must be together. We can begin a new world once again.</p><p>I will come, of course.</p><p>There are others. You must beware.</p><p>Ah, but I am powerful. As are you!</p><p>Yes, but you must beware, there are others\u2014 and others who have changed. Who fear, who command that we deny the power we can wield.</p><p>They are cowards.</p><p>They are strong. And still, there are those of the Alliance...</p><p>Then they must be killed, and quickly. I am not afraid. I was always the strongest.</p><p>Ah, my love, you forget that it is I who have managed to free you. We know where to begin to create a world in which we can Hoe, revel, love. . . and be safe. I have planned long and carefully.</p><p>We will have with us those who would not cower before those weaker than we are. Come to me, and I will show you what this life can be. But come with care. You will laugh still more when you find what I have done in this world!</p><p>When Tara returned to the chateau, she found Jacques at work in the library. A large, ancient volume was open on his desk.</p><p>He looked up when she entered.</p><p>She set her purse on his desk and he arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cThe man from the dig returned it to me at the cafe in the village, across from the church.\u201d Jacques looked relieved. \u201cAnd everything is in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no papers missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My passport, ID, money, credit cards ... everything is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does, of course, know my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you now know his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrent Malone.\u201d</p><p>She watched her grandfather as she said the name. He looked down at his book. She put her hands on the desk, and made a point of staring at him so that he had to look up to her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange. He talked about all the evil buried in the crypt as well. I found myself saying many things to him that I said to you.\u201d</p><p>Jacques nodded, then indicated the chair in front of the desk. He tapped his reading glasses on the open book before him. \u201cPerhaps, when you see this man again, you will ask him to come here. I\u2019d like to speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sincerely doubt that I will see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I believe you will. You\u2019re familiar with the Sun King? You grew up in America, so your history had to do with Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Kennedy, and so on. Of course, every child in France learns all about the Sun King.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him evenly, gave him a rueful smile. \u201cI know about the Sun King. Louis XIV. Longest reigning French monarch. He came to the throne as a child, and as a young man, much of his policy and power was held by Cardinal Richelieu. He became a very great king, carefully balancing statesmanship and religion. His rather had built a small hunting lodge on the outskirts of Paris; Louis XIV determined to make it into a great palace. Versailles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs he aged, he determined as well that, after a life with a multitude of mistresses, he would be loyal to his wife. Alas, the poor thing died a year later. The king married again. He was supposed to have been a man of tremendous sexual prowess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t put a lot about that in the history books,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cThe point I\u2019m making is that he was known\u2014before his belated dedication to his queen\u2014for having dozens of mistresses. He was a decent man in that he had many of his love children legitimized, many went on to marry princes and princesses and other royalty and nobility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was a decent concession, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to the mistresses... there were many of them. Many. Naturally, the lady of the moment often held sway over him, received honors ... and was somewhat above the law.</p><p>\u201cAt one time, the mistress of the moment was a woman known as the Countess Louisa de Montcrasset.</p><p>She was supposed to be extraordinarily beautiful, and to have the most unusual power over the king. She was the daughter of a French nobleman, but had not grown up in Paris\u2014the records say only that she had been raised among nobility \u201dto the east\u201c She appeared at court one day, and as her father\u2019s daughter, she was duly welcomed. Within a matter of weeks she had usurped the place of the king\u2019s other favorites, and even at times when there were great matters of state to be decided, she could draw his attention.\u201d</p><p>Tara smiled at her grandfather. \u201cThe Sun Ring was ruling at the time when Charles II was welcomed back to England. The \u2018Merry Monarch\u2019 was loved by the good majority of his people. Cromwell\u2019s brand of dry government and total lack of frivolity was overturned by the king\u2019s love for the theater. And women. He had his decencies as well, of course, refusing to divorce his barren wife while going through a variety of mistresses. He did not legitimize his children, however. His beloved son was beheaded by his brother, James, then James was overthrown by his daughter and her husband, William of Orange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting ahead in history,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cYes, of course, Louis and Charles had much in common\u2014 they were monarchs with a love for the arts, building, learning\u2014and women. One woman in particular. Louisa de Montcrasset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe young beauty who suddenly appeared from the east. The daughter of the nobleman.\u201d Tara offered him a rueful smile, but felt a strange sense of unease. Her grandfather and the digger, Brent Malone, seemed to have far too strange a passion for the dead and the past.</p><p>\u201cThere were those at the time who doubted that she was who she said she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, and they attacked her relationship with the king, I presume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, her father had long been out of the country. He was a military man who traveled far and wide, and when he wasn\u2019t fighting on the king\u2019s behalf, he was a diplomat of sorts. He hadn\u2019t been seen in years. He had been a handsome Frenchman, so it was written, with dark hair and eyes, slender, aesthetic face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was so unusual about him having a beautiful daughter? Come on, I don\u2019t look a thing like you. Or Ann. Genetics can be very strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s written that she had something of an exotic face. And \u2018cat\u2019s\u2019 eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might have been a decadent woman, and from what you say, able to use her charms to get what she wanted. Very immoral, perhaps. But don\u2019t you think she might be hated for that fact alone, and therefore, many who wrote about her would make an attempt to demonize her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many of those who despised her wrote about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sixteen hundreds, my dear, was a time when witchcraft was greatly feared. It was suspected that she had joined a coven, that she had made a pact with the devil, that she gained her beauty through the sacrifice of others.\u201d</p><p>Tara leaned forward, arms folded on the table, posture serious. \u201cWe both know that the devil does not come with a forked tongue and tail and make pacts with people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know that whether the devil came or not, and that although surely, the many thousands of people who were persecuted were most surely innocent, there were those who did join covens, and who did believe that they could evoke the powers of darkness and do harm to others. In France at the time, as well as in many places in Europe, there were many who were executed for witchcraft. But it wasn\u2019t the suspicion of those around her that she had joined a coven that made her such a frightening entity. I just told you. People died. Soon after she came to court, dozens of people began ... wasting away. They would be tired at first, distracted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then they would take to their beds. Some died in those beds, too weak to open their eyes. And then there were others who ...\u201c</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho simply disappeared. It was a time of strange murders in Paris.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStrange murders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople were sometimes found dead in the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople have been murdering people since the beginning of time, sadly,\u201d Tara reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThese people were found in a particularly grotesque manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were all beheaded.\u201d</p><p>Tara felt a strange chill sweep through her again. Her grandfather was talking about history . . .</p><p>The worker in the crypt had been decapitated. A brutal manner of murder, no matter what the year, or century, in which it had taken place.</p><p>\u201cFrance is famous for decapitation, Grandpapa. The guillotine, remember.\u201d He sat back, staring at her through narrowed eyes. Jacques had loved his years in America. Few people were so ardently in love with the country, and so determined to speak up for her, no matter what the politics of the moment.</p><p>But he had been born a Frenchman, and he could defend his native land with a passion equaled by few.</p><p>\u201cThe guillotine,\u201d he repeated, shaking his head, \u201cwas invented to be a merciful device. Unfortunately, it made execution so quick that a rebellious people found it far too easy to use. However, that is a different piece of history. You are not paying attention to the point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust what is the point, Grandpapa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA case was finally proven against the evil of the Countess de Montcrasset that was so strong, the king had no choice but to recognize the fact that his mistress was a murderer. She was found bathing in the blood of her victims. The chambermaid who came upon her began screaming; church officials who had long been very wary of the woman came running, armed with crosses, with holy water. She was taken into custody\u2014 with the screaming chambermaid all but dead in her arms. She was condemned by the king, and sent to prison to await execution. Certain men, sworn to uphold goodness, brought one of the churchmen with them and broke into the prison. They arrived in time to discover that she had seduced her jailor into releasing her\u2014he was dead on the floor. They subdued her, throttled her, and then, when they believed that she was dead, they sealed her into a coffin with all the proper rites and symbols to keep her buried forever.\u201d</p><p>Tara shifted uncomfortably, remembering her conversation with Professor Dubois at the dig. He had told her that the history to be found in the crypt was invaluable, that maligned nobles were among those buried deep in the earth. He had told her that he was seeking a certain noblewoman, who had surely been buried with untold riches. Her coffin would have been sealed in a way that would have kept her dress, shoes, and jewels, and every item of her attire in a condition that would give historians incredible information. He had raved on about the historical importance of the woman.</p><p>He had not given her name.</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa, if this woman was a mistress of the king, and buried in all her finery, it makes all the more sense that a criminal would be willing to kill to steal the body. She might have been buried wearing an entire fortune in jewels. It\u2019s horrible, yet easy to see how a greedy cutthroat might have studied the excavation and broken in when the work should have been shut down for the day. But Jean-Luc was there. And so he was killed so that Louisa de Montcrasset could be stolen. The police will, though, I am certain, find out who the murderer is.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, sinking back in his chair. \u201cNo, they will not\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the murderer is Louisa de Montcrasset.</p> <p>\u201cI walked all night,\u201d Brent said wearily. \u201cI searched out every alley, every cafe, bar, restaurant, and whorehouse in the area. I attempted the Louvre, but...\u201d he paused, looking at Lucian. \u201cI\u2019m not quite as good as you are at sneaking past guards. Anyway, I searched the streets of Paris until this morning. Then I showered, and returned the purse to the American girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one with you at the table,\u201d Lucian said, his words more of a statement than a query.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept her away from the police, and out of the papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, well I have done so this far. She is as suspicious as a CIA agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a nice-looking agent,\u201d Jade said, a smile twitching at her lips.</p><p>Brent arched a brow at her. \u201cYes,\u201d he agreed softly. \u201cAnd I think she knows ... something. Though she is in complete denial. I\u2019m determined to find out more about her. She is staying at Chateau DeVant\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange coincidence,\u201d Lucian said, his brows knit in a frown.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Brent said. \u201cShe is the old man\u2019s granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may have more help than we know,\u201d Lucian mused.</p><p>\u201cBecause the girl is related to Jacques DeVant?\u201d Jade said. She looked at Lucian. \u201cI still find a great deal of this very confusing. I don\u2019t really understand what is happening here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve done a poor job of teaching relative history,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll get to an explanation soon enough. He looked at Brent again. \u201dThere was the body at the church\u2014but no other murders have been discovered?\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo. But then ... it\u2019s still only midmorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she is lying low,\u201d Lucian murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s what I think,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when she is most dangerous,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>Again, Brent said a soft, \u201cYes, so I understand. But then again, you know more, much more, than I about the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is not so much the past, but the present. Our enemies have been stirring here much longer than I have known,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cShe is not alone out there. That much is certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive are listed as missing in recent weeks,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cBut they have found no bodies ...\u201d Lucian mused.</p><p>\u201cNot yet\u201d</p><p>They had gathered around the dining room table at the small house Brent had rented for nearly six months. Jade suddenly stood.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all got to get some rest, that\u2019s imperative.\u201d</p><p>Lucian shook his head impatiently. \u201cEvery time she rests, she will gain greater power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do your best work when you\u2019re resting as well,\u201d Brent reminded him. \u201cAnd you are the one who has warned that there is far more to this than what we know.\u201d Lucian let out a long sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re right Rest is in order. Because I have nothing right now. Nothing but the sense ... the knowledge that there is a tremendous stirring... and a great deal of danger. Still, we\u2019re going to have to move quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery quickly. There are things that I can do. Starting now,\u201d Brent said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been up all night,\u201d Jade reminded him. \u201cYou need rest, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps some. I don\u2019t require a lot of sleep. And there are some things I must do today. I need to see what my new friend, Inspector Javet, is doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget, you have talents in your sleep as well,\u201d Jade reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid most of my talents come from more mundane sources\u2014such as libraries,\u201d Brent said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go hours and hours without sleeping,\u201d Jade said flatly. \u201cYou\u2019ll wind up being useless. Now, though, I can do some exploring.\u201d</p><p>The two men frowned, staring at her.</p><p>She smiled back ruefully. \u201cI slept on the plane. Listen, please, get some sleep. I\u2019ll see what I can find out. At least, perhaps, I can go to a library, read through the papers for the past several weeks, and find out more about the missing persons. But you two must get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can sleep,\u201d Brent said, raking his fingers through his hair. \u201cWhat happened is my fault.</p><p>I suspected... I just didn\u2019t know. And if I hadn\u2019t gotten as far as I had, Jean-Luc couldn\u2019t have opened the coffin. And now ... well, I\u2019m worried for all of Paris, and terribly uneasy about the girl. She is in serious danger, more than she can begin to imagine. Especially since she is a DeVant.\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou were there, Brent, when I hadn\u2019t the intuition to worry,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cLittle good it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps more good than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeVant knew,\u201d Brent said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he sent his granddaughter.\u2018</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s old and ill, but his mind must still be strong,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t suspect what did happen, or he wouldn\u2019t have sent his granddaughter. Though ... she has a cousin. Ann DeVant. And neither seems to understand what is really happening. They\u2019re in extreme danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as the girls go,\u201d Jade told him, \u201cthat problem can be easily solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how is that?\u201d Brent asked her.</p><p>\u201cWe simply get into Chateau DeVant. Sooner rather than later. It\u2019s something we must do anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally, we must get into the chateau. Get close, and become bosom buddies with the inhabitants,\u201d Lucian concluded. He rose, then looked down at his wife. \u201cTake care. Even by day, take care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know something about what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can rest, that I dare rest,\u201d Brent said. \u201c Tara Adair was at the crypt. She didn\u2019t want me going to the police alone. She\u2019s going to take steps with the police eventually, because she\u2019ll feel it\u2019s her duty. The police may be a danger. They may not. Who knows exactly who is out there right now. But if they get to her before we do ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t. Not yet. Not during the day. And though she may eventually go to the police, I believe that Jacques will stop her,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean to help her, Brent, you\u2019ll have to have your wits and strength about you,\u201d Jade reminded him. She was watching him curiously. \u201cOf course, perhaps there is one way you can sleep and still protect her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep with her.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p> <p>It was an incredibly busy day.</p><p>One ridiculous meeting after another.</p><p>It was nearly two o\u2019clock, and Ann had not had time for so much as a cup of coffee.</p><p>At two, she dropped the sheets of meeting memos on her desk, rose, grabbed her purse, and marched out to her secretary\u2019s desk. \u201cHenriette, I\u2019m going for coffee. I don\u2019t care who calls. I have to have a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014I will fend off all demons!\u201d Henriette, pretty, young, and loyal to her boss, declared with the strength of a lion.</p> <p>Ann smiled at her and hurried down to the ground level, then outside and across the street. She walked to the counter of the little cafe and ordered coffee and a croissant, though it was late and only one was left, and it was probably stale. The woman behind the counter was busy, and tried handing her everything at the same time while she was still struggling with her wallet for her money. She was startled when a man at her side suddenly helped out, taking the coffee and the croissant.</p><p>\u201cMerci,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She was startled when he answered with an accented, \u201cde rien.\u201d She glanced at him, but then found herself staring.</p><p>He was tall, blond and handsome, with a charming smile. Her hand froze in her purse.</p><p>\u201cYou looked as if you needed a little help,\u201d he said in English. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014do you speak English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I speak English very well,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cAnd thank you, thank you very much.\u201d The woman behind the counter cleared her throat impatiently. Ann shoved francs into her hand, then accepted the coffee and croissant from the American.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my table\u2014there. There are no more empty. Perhaps you\u2019ll join me.\u201d She had intended to take her coffee and croissant back to the office. No longer. Now, she was going to take her full ten minutes. Maybe fifteen.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the chair out for her. She sat, extended a hand to him, \u201cAnn DeVant. Thank you for your help, and for sharing your table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick. Rick Beaudreau. My pleasure, mademoiselle. I\u2019m sorry, is it mademoiselle? I\u2019m terribly rude, I guess. I\u2019m sorry, I just saw you standing there ... and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married,\u201d Ann told him. \u201cSo, you\u2019re obviously a visitor in Paris. Though your name is French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cajun,\u201d he told her. \u201cFrom New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, enjoy your croissant.\u201d He indicated the food she hadn\u2019t touched. She nibbled a bite. She\u2019d been starving. And now ...</p> <p>His smile deepened. He was a very handsome man. Striking blue eyes went with his blond hair. She hadn\u2019t met anyone so attractive since ...</p><p>Willem.</p><p>She felt a surge of temper. For a moment, it included all men. Well, this one was just a tourist But he was nice, and attentive. And very appealing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married either,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on vacation\u2014I assume.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIn away. I\u2019m in the midst of a healing process, you could say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in Europe quite a while. In fact,\u201d he said ruefully, \u201cmy French should be much better. I was in an accident a while back. A terrible fire. I\u2019m still doing a bit of recuperating.\u201d He leaned toward her.</p><p>\u201cParis seemed the place to be right now. I came to ... look up some people. But now ... well, I think I was just maybe called to be here for much more.\u201d</p><p>His appreciation of her was definitely a line. But a good one. And he was polite, his admiration in his eyes, and in his tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very flattering,\u201d she said, forcing her tone to be dry. She was French after all, and not in the least naive.</p><p>\u201cBut truthfully,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re just\u2014beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly, my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, nodding with a wry smile still in place. Then she glanced at her watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go\u2014 I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not on vacation. But it was lovely to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you come here every day?\u201d he asked, catching her hand.</p><p>She glanced down. He had great hands. Big. Slightly calloused. She could imagine ...</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to pull her hand away. She wanted to linger. She sighed inwardly. She had to get back to work. She grinned suddenly, forcing herself to extricate her hand. \u201cI go out at night sometimes, too. Tonight. With my cousin. An American. I believe we\u2019ll be going to a place called La Guerre.\u201d</p><p>With those last words, she pulled away, hurried out.</p><p>Though she was tempted to do so, she didn\u2019t look back. Her cheeks, she realized, were flaming.</p><p>So much for her sense of sophistication I No, she would not look back, and she would force the flush from her face.</p><p>He knew where she would be. If he was interested, he would be there.</p><p>Back at her desk, she started to work, then felt the presence of someone at her door. Willem was there.</p><p>Tall, suave as ever, perfect in a designer suit. Her heart leaped. He had been there a while, she thought with amazement. There had been a time when she would have known the second he had arrived. And now ...</p><p>She thanked God for the American. He had returned her confidence to her, and her poise. She was able to remain seated. She stared at Willem, without moving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the office,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgiveness.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI never forgive, and I never forget\u201d She tried to look down. But there was something about him. There always had been. She looked back up.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he told her. His voice was husky and thick. His expression was pained, so much so that she nearly jumped out of her seat to go to him. Somehow, she remained seated. \u201cI don\u2019t know.. .what I was doing. Maybe I was afraid at how deeply I cared about you. Or maybe I resented the fact that you\u2019d see me, but you\u2019d never bring me home, you didn\u2019t involve me with your family, with your life. I\u2019ve tried so hard to do what you wanted. I knew I was wrong. But since we\u2019ve been apart ... Ann, I know. I want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, shocked. Just a little more than a week ago, such words would have had her in a swoon, shaking, delighted, on top of the world.</p><p>And now ...</p><p>What a strange day. The American in the cafe, and now Willem ...</p><p>\u201cAnn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Let me think. Maybe we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>She looked back down. The words on the page before her blurred. She fought hard not to look back up.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have plans with my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour American cousin? Whom I\u2019ve not met.\u201d</p><p>The resentment was there. Maybe she had been too mistrustful. Maybe she owed him.</p><p>He\u2019d cheated on her!</p><p>\u201cIn a few days, perhaps, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>She felt it when he left her doorway. She heard him walk to her secretary\u2019s desk. They talked casually about a publication schedule.</p><p>Ann bit her lip hard. She wanted to stand, and race after him. No! Tonight, she was going out with Tara.</p><p>And perhaps she would see the handsome American again. And then, perhaps, know herself better.</p><p>Know what she really felt, and at the least...</p><p>Pay Willem back for what he had done.</p><p>Dubois was infuriated.</p><p>The police could be so incredibly annoying, especially Inspector Javet. The man apparently thought he was some kind of a solid wall of testosterone with the right to meddle in things that he knew nothing about.</p><p>For the third time, he was questioning Dubois. This time, Javet had come to his house. The last time they had spoken, he had been down at the station. Then, he had been introduced to special crime scene detectives from Paris who explained to him that his dig site would be closed for some time. Well, he had simply exploded.</p><p>Javet had patiently explained that a man had been killed.</p><p>Dubois had simply blown up. \u201cYou fools! This is history. This is a find in the scientific world, a find that is far greater than the loss of one man! Do you think Howard Carter never lost a worker when looking for the tomb of Tutankhamen? You can not, must not, stop my work!\u201d He shouldn\u2019t have blown up. He went on to say how very sorry he was about Jean-Luc. But it was too late. The gentlemen began to question him again.</p><p>Then, of course, he had tried to make them see that they were harassing the wrong man. They should have been after the American, Brent Malone.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, we are keeping up on his whereabouts, but I don\u2019t believe that your worker can tell us anything more than he has already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely, if he had murdered the man, he would not walk in and tell you so!\u201d Dubois was impatient that the police seemed like such fools.</p><p>They\u2019d had little to say. They had been entirely cordial. They had excused him.</p><p>And now, Javet was here. Dubois didn\u2019t ask him to sit, nor did he ask if he would like wine, water, or anything. He barely let him through the doorway. Again, Javet seemed impervious to his rudeness and the blunt fact that he didn\u2019t want the inspector in his house.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Dubois, I think you can give us a great deal of help with knowledge you may not even know that you possess. We\u2019d like to see all your notes regarding the dig. And especially, we\u2019d like to know about anyone you approached for assistance in financing, anyone to whom you might have suggested that the dig could provide incredible treasures with a current high monetary value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy notes ...\u201d He frowned and hedged. \u201cInspector, I made quite a large contribution to the present St.</p><p>Michel to be granted the right to the dig. And my work ... no, no, I\u2019m sorry. You cannot have my notes.</p><p>My work is private. My work is like an artist\u2019s canvas. I allow no one to view it until it is complete.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI must say, Professor, we were curious about that hefty donation. I\u2019m afraid we humble policemen rather thought of teachers and scholars being much as we believe ourselves to be\u2014woefully underpaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am capable of saving,\u201d Dubois said icily. \u201cI live very plainly, as you can see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is quite enchanting,\u201d Javet said, smiling casually as he glanced around.</p><p>\u201cThe house is quite old, and felling down around my ears,\u201d Dubois snapped back.</p> <p>\u201cAh, well, then, I had hoped there might be some help you could give us. If you think of anything, please call.\u201d</p><p>Javet nodded politely, turned, and left by the door which was just at his back, since Dubois had positioned himself in the entryway to keep the inspector from stepping in farther.</p><p>When Javet was gone, Dubois leaned against the door, his heart beating too quickly, his palms sweaty.</p><p>He swore. Javet was an ass. But he was trouble. Pure trouble.</p><p>As was the American. Dubois smiled. The American was a problem that could be solved. He just had to say the word.</p> <p>Feeling better with that thought in mind, he went into his kitchen and poured himself a large measure of good Russian vodka.</p><p>Yet as he stood at the window, his heart began to sink. His mouth and throat went dry, despite the liquor. In a gulp he finished off the double shot before turning.</p><p>He knew he was not alone.</p><p>His visitor stood at the door to the kitchen and stared at him contemptuously. \u201cYou fucked up, Dubois.</p><p>You fucked up\u2014and you\u2019re going to pay for it\u201d</p><p>Dubois\u2019s glass fell to the floor as his visitor took a step toward him.</p> <p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>At last, Jacques was sleeping.</p><p>Tara had done her best to listen, to pretend that she believed, that she understood. But he had seen her expression\u2014one that she hadn\u2019t been able to hide when he expressed his belief regarding the murder\u2014and he had immediately become upset. He had suddenly forgotten his English and switched to French, speaking so quickly and so wildly that she hadn\u2019t begun to understand what he had been saying.</p><p>And fear had set in.</p><p>Her grandfather was losing his sanity. He was such a wonderful man, and he had cherished his ability to think and reason all his life.</p><p>To think that his mind might be going ...</p><p>It was horrible.</p><p>But in time she did calm him. She convinced him that she would keep an open mind. She assured him that she could find out what the police were doing without ever having to say that she had been there when the murder occurred. She could be a concerned tourist, just trying to feel safe in the city of Paris, and in the little village where she was staying. She had sworn that though she found his words impossible to believe, she would keep an open mind. And he had gone to bed.</p> <p>Long after, she sat out on her balcony. She wondered whether or not to tell Ann about the incident, then knew that she couldn\u2019t betray Jacques. She had to pray that the police would find the murderer quickly.</p><p>That would set his mind at rest.</p><p>She worried that perhaps shell shock was setting in, now that he had returned to Europe after having been in the States so long. It had been on the front here that he had fought, a special Resistance fighter with the Allied troops. Perhaps he needed to talk to someone, a trained professional, not a granddaughter who doted on him and was involved so deeply and emotionally.</p><p>As she worried, Katia came to tell her that Ann was on the phone. Her cousin was bright and cheerful, swept away in the workaday world. \u201cMeetings, meetings, meetings! We have meetings about when to schedule meetings!\u201d Ann told her. \u201cBut do you know what? Despite what has happened, we\u2019re going to go out. I have one of those special little shock weapons, you know. Long ago, Grandpapa insisted I carry it And then I have mace, as well\u2014which your father insisted I carry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. He insisted I have it in New York, as well,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cThe really big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis is a pretty big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but we won\u2019t exactly be in Paris tonight.</p><p>We\u2019ll stick close to home, and be smart, watchful, and wary. You\u2019re not afraid to go out?\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! I need a few drinks. A few laughs. And maybe a few dances with a handsome man. Or, at least, a man. Come to think of it, just for a dance, any old geezer\u2014 or young one\u2014will do. Listen, I\u2019m working late, so I\u2019ll just breeze by, beep the horn, and you\u2019ll come down, if that\u2019s all right. We\u2019ll go to La Guerre\u2014it\u2019s just in town, not too far from the church. If you\u2019re not afraid of going near the church, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly think that the murderer is going to stick around the site of the murder,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right there?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then answered quickly, \u201cYes, fine. Grandpapa is sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBien! He won\u2019t mind that we take a night out together. He is always pleased when his family remains close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready when you beep.\u201d</p><p>Tara hung up from her conversation with Ann. She needed to go out. To a smoky, chatty, loud bar.</p><p>Where there might be drunks and lechers ...</p><p>But sane drunks. And ordinary lechers.</p><p>Sleep ...</p><p>Sleep too often meant dreams, and dreams too often meant nightmares.</p><p>Nightmares were often made up of the past.</p><p>He could almost feet the pain again. The agony that seemed to beat continuously against him, flesh and bone, outside, inside.</p><p>He could remember the men speaking, the doctors staring down at him. He could remember the needles, the way they injected him, tested his strength, his reaction to pain. He remembered the helplessness, the agony, the rage.</p><p>There was the doctor in charge, who saw to it that he was secured to the bed with steel clamps every time he would begin his experiments. The doctor didn\u2019t bother to make introductions, but he liked to inform the lieutenant that he could be referred to as the god of death at any time. The men called him either Doctor or General Andreson. Sometimes, when the lieutenant twisted and turned, damning him, Andreson would lean close, as if he listened to rhapsodic music rather than the screams and curses of a man in agony. Then he would touch the lieutenant\u2019s head almost tenderly and tell him, \u201cDamn me, if you will. By any name, for I use several. Damn me ... curse me, for your words are just a melody in my mind.</p><p>Your strength is quite incredible. You should be dead by now, but you are not Doesn\u2019t that make you the least bit curious? Ah, but it fascinates me!\u201d</p><p>Andreson was a master of torture and pain. And as long as he lived, the lieutenant would not forget him.</p><p>But he could remember Dr. Weiss as well. The man who would stand in still silence, hands behind his back, face grim, as so much went on. And he would never forget the way that the man came to him in those times when the others were gone. The cooling cloth on his head. The pills quickly placed under his tongue, antidotes to pain.</p><p>He knew that Weiss stole the pills. And he knew that Weiss risked his own life to help in any way.</p><p>When he tried to thank him, the man would redden and reply, \u201cWe are not all monsters. We are so many good people.</p><p>But we are afraid. And fear ... well, fear is the greatest weapon on earth.\u201c The lieutenant formed words with his lips. \u201cThank you. Thank you. I still believe there is a God, and he will bless you.\u201d</p><p>The slim little man with the wire-rimmed glasses reddened even more. \u201cIf you would thank me at all, please believe that there is goodness among my people. Those who love their children, who honor God, who abhor ... pain.\u201d</p><p>The pain pill began to work. He could almost smile. \u201cI know, Doctor Weiss. I know. I don\u2019t hate people, I hate rulers who have no regard for human life. Not that it will matter, will it? I will never get out of here alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think that you will live,\u201d Dr. Weiss said, and the sound was almost sad and bitter.</p><p>\u201cNo one else survived, did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one, no one among the Allies, and no one of our soldiers, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo strange ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you? You don\u2019t understand at all what happened, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were shooting, they were shooting, and suddenly, it seemed that every wolf in Europe was fighting its own war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor boy ...\u201d</p><p>Dr. Weiss smoothed back the hair from his forehead, looking to the windows. He stared back at the lieutenant uneasily.</p><p>\u201cThey want to know your strength. They want to use you. They want to know just how you have survived ... and if and how you will continue to survive. But you see, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how is that?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Weiss didn\u2019t seem to hear his question. \u201cSomehow, and soon, I must get you out of here. I must.</p><p>They will realize your strength, and they will be afraid, and they will destroy you. I must think ... must think.\u201d</p><p>He was drifting to sleep, but he could not help but think of Weiss. The man had showed incredible kindness at severe risk.</p><p>\u201cI am probably more than half dead already,\u201d the lieutenant said. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything foolish. Your country will need men like you, when this is over.\u201d</p><p>Again, the doctor wasn\u2019t looking at him.</p><p>He was staring out at the night.And he stared back at the lieutenant, his features contorted in fear. His words came haltingly. \u201cI pray... I pray ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d His words were beginning to slur.</p><p>\u201cI pray that it is not you who kills me.\u201d</p><p>He woke himself up with a jerk. Sweat was running down his back. Sleep, rest. Dreams, nightmares.</p><p>God, no more!</p><p>That night, La Guerre was hopping.</p><p>The bizarre murder was a topic of conversation, but not one that seemed to concern many people.</p><p>A band was already playing when Ann and Tara arrived. They were doing mostly American pop hits.</p><p>The tables were full. There were a few seats left at the bar and Ann and Tara took them. Ann instantly introduced her to Tomas, the bartender, as her American cousin. Tomas told them he had an especially good house wine that night, did they want to try it? They did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When their wine arrived, Ann almost instantly downed her glass. Tara was tempted to do the same. She was torn between wondering if her grandfather had gone crazy, or if the whole world had done so. She was ostensibly listening to Ann talk about her day at the office, how they had gone through meeting after meeting, but she was also listening to those around her.</p><p>\u201cI think the professor, that Dubois guy, has some explaining to do,\u201d a girl at the table behind them said.</p><p>\u201cDubois is all but foaming at the mouth at the police for closing down his site!\u201d one of her companions replied.</p> <p>\u201cWell, unless he\u2019s an awfully good actor, I think that lets him out as the murderer,\u201d the young woman replied.</p><p>\u201cNever can tell with those scientific types.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the worker who found the body?\u201d the girl said, her tone suddenly breathy. \u201cDid you see his picture in the paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone suspicious,\u201d one of her male companions replied.</p><p>\u201cOh, pooh! Who butchers someone and heads right to the police?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to publish a book on the gourmet treatment of dogs and cats as main protein staples,\u201d Ann said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tara demanded, realizing that her cousin was staring at her.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been listening to a thing I\u2019ve said,\u201d Ann complained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have been. Sort of. It\u2019s just been a long day. Grandpapa is still on his tangent I don\u2019t know why\u2014I was so tired\u2014but I barely slept last night. I kept having nightmares about wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, you thought you saw one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think I saw one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you, there are no wolves. Well, of course, there are human wolves. Like the guy coming in the door now. Ooh la, la. There is a hot\u2014hot\u2014wolf for you. Except, of course, you must always be very careful with wolves. They\u2019ll consume you, unless you stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe there was a circus in town. Maybe a creature escaped from the zoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would have seen it in the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when we have a local story like the murder at the dig!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. And is that why you have not\u2014in the least\u2014 noted my state of excitement?\u201d Tara stared at her cousin guiltily. \u201cYou are excited. What happened? I\u2019m sorry\u2014I should have noticed right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you should have done so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a day you would not believe! First\u2014it was so busy! I went out for coffee, and was struggling with cups and money and food and... then I met an American.\u201d Tara arched a brow. \u201cAn American in Paris. How novel.\u201d</p> <p>Ann made a face. \u201cAn American like this one is novel anywhere, I\u2019ll have you know. He was gorgeous.</p><p>Tall, blond, bronzed, so handsome. And he was all over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine that A handsome American sees a Parisian beauty and tries to pick her up!\u201d Ann laughed again. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you make a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less, but wait! Right after, I go up to my office, and out of nowhere Willem is suddenly at my office door. He is nearly in tears, wanting me to forgive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. A happening day.\u201d Tara sipped her wine, studying her cousin. \u201cSo, now there are two men fawning in your footsteps. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, a small secretive smile in place. \u201cWell, I really was shattered by what Willem did. And the American was... he looked like someone out of that old show ... \u201dBaywatch.\u201c I\u2019m going to see him, give him a bit of a chance ... and maybe, at some point, I\u2019ll talk to Willem. I was in love with him. But how can you stay in love with a man you don\u2019t trust? But then, again, in a week, you do not fall out of love.</p><p>However, in a matter of moments, you can fall into fascination and ... well, you know, lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLust\u2014in a matter of moments. Wow.\u201d</p><p>Ann laughed. \u201cOh, come, come! You\u2019ve never felt that before? I mean, just looking at someone and thinking, I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s great in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of guys as attractive without immediately wondering just what they\u2019d do with all that attractiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bar! You simply think you\u2019re far too discriminating for such behavior. We don\u2019t always act on these impulses, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of people are attractive. Should we sleep with all of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if the urge is really there,\u201d Ann teased.</p><p>She was facing the door. Tara was facing her cousin. \u201cNow,\u201d Ann murmured, \u201ctalk about your beautiful people! There are two of them coming in as we speak. One better looking than the next. Well, damn.</p><p>There\u2019s a woman with them. Nope\u2014don\u2019t turn! Bother. All the cute ones are always taken. And they even appear articulate. Well dressed. They must be married. One of the guys must go with the woman.</p><p>Still... don\u2019t look now, but, I repeat, wow. And only one woman ... can\u2019t quite tell which one she goes with. Unless she goes with both of them. No ... she doesn\u2019t look the type. But then again, what would that \u2018type\u2019 look like?\u201d</p><p>Tara laughed softly. \u201cAre you sure you need me to listen to you? You seem quite able to carry on a conversation all by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Ann made a face at her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen what I\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, I\u2019ll look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn around and stare! It will appear that we\u2019re out on the prowl, looking for men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you recall, we did agree that we both needed to meet new people. But then, that was before the American fell into your lap\u2014or into your cafe au lait\u2014and Willem made an appearance in your office. But then, what the heck, maybe there should be a third guy in the lineup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be crass. We would never pick up strangers in a bar.\u201d Tara started to turn around.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no! I said that you can\u2019t look now! We most certainly don\u2019t want to be obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not obvious. You just said that we would never be so crass as to pick up strangers in a bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not. We would become friends with them before we picked them up.\u201d Tara sighed, \u201cHonestly, Ann, I\u2019m not sure I want to create any new friends to pick up. I think I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m not involved with anyone at the moment. Jacques is going to have my entire attention while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went off on a tangent again, eh?\u201d Ann murmured. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d she breathed suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTall... nicely tall. Broad shoulders. Umm ... very sleek and agile. I could eat him up, just watching him walk across the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim\u2014who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTall, dark, and walking sensuality. Well, both of them are dark. And the one coming this way ... I think he\u2019s taller than anyone else in here. Lord!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, what?\u201d</p><p>Tara started to turn again.</p><p>\u201cNo! No!\u201d Ann pleaded. \u201cHe\u2019s coming here. He looked over this way, and now ... he\u2019s coming here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be someone you know and don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I would never forget that I knew him.\u201d</p><p>Tara let out an explosive little sound of impatience and tried to turn again.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ann caught her hands, preventing her from turning on the stool. \u201cDon\u2019t look around!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got to let go of my hands! We\u2019re going to look very bizarre!\u201d Ann drew her hands away.</p><p>\u201cFine, okay. What does he look like?\u201d Tara asked.</p><p>\u201cDark, rich dark hair, like sable, ooh, just shaggy enough to be very arty ... nice frame around his face.</p><p>Rugged face, but very nicely put together. And his eyes ... My heart is fluttering right now.\u201d With a sense of growing dread, Tara frowned at her cousin and spun around on her bar stool. She nearly slid off. Brent Malone was approaching her.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d He had a bottle of beer in his hand, and his smile was as casual as that of any friend greeting another in a public place. He offered Ann an inquisitive nod of friendly acknowledgment over Tara\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she replied, the sound of her voice as stiff as her neck.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Ann said pleasantly, awaiting an introduction. She nudged Tara. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrent, my cousin, Ann\u2014my French cousin Ann. Ann DeVant, Brent Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do, a pleasure,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cCertainly. I must admit, I didn\u2019t know that Tara had friends\u2014other than our old family friends, of course\u2014 in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just met,\u201d Brent said. \u201cBut the circumstances were such that...\u201d his curious golden eyes studied her with rueful amusement, \u201cwell, I do feel as if we\u2019ve known each other a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never mentioned Mr. Malone,\u201d Ann said.</p><p>\u201cBrent,\u201d he quickly supplied. \u201cI\u2019m with some friends. Would you care to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think that we can,\u201d Tara began.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to,\u201d Ann said.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re not staying long,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day, which means that I\u2019m not in a hurry to end a night\u2019s relaxation,\u201d Ann said.</p><p>\u201cThen do, please, come along.\u201d</p><p>Ann was off her stool quickly. Tara caught her cousin by the back of her shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood, you should never really trust any man,\u201d Ann whispered back, \u201cbut I\u2019m following that one\u2014with you or without you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn!\u201d</p><p>With little choice, Tara followed her cousin to the table Brent and his companions had somehow managed to find.</p><p>\u201cTara Adair, Ann DeVant, I\u2019d like you to meet Lucian and Jade DeVeau. Lucian, Jade\u2014Tara and Ann.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man rose, greeting them. The couple were the same people Tara had seen Brent meet at the cafe the other day. The woman was attractive\u2014very\u2014with sea-colored eyes and a length of beautiful hair that seemed a shade between brunette and blond. She had a warm, welcoming smile that seemed sincere. She didn\u2019t appear at all averse to Brent\u2019s friends coming to the table. She was apparently married to the tall man with the nearly black hair, since they shared a surname. He moved with an agile, sure, fluid power, even in the simple act of acquiring an extra chair; in manner\u2014and in an elusive quality Tara couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint\u2014he had a similar magnetism to that of Brent Malone. Perhaps that was what disturbed her the most There was nothing about either man that should be alarming, yet she had the feeling that their reflexes would be faster than the speed of light, and that something that she couldn\u2019t see or comprehend remained dangerous about them ...</p><p>\u201cNice to have you join us,\u201d Lucian said, taking his chair again as they were seated. \u201cSo, Ann, this is your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I work in Paris, but live in the village. We have an old family ... well, it\u2019s not a chateau in the grand sense of the word, but it\u2019s a lovely family home out here.\u201d Tara wanted to kick her cousin. She didn\u2019t want these people knowing where they lived. But that was ridiculous. She hadn\u2019t actually told him, but she was certain that Brent Malone knew where she was staying.</p> <p>\u201cYou must come and visit while you\u2019re here,\u201d Ann continued.</p><p>Tara kicked her cousin. Ann yelped involuntarily, then stared at her across the table. Tara knew that Brent Malone was watching her, knew exactly what had happened, and remained amused. She was certain as well that he had lured the two of them to the table specifically to get an invitation to the chateau.</p><p>Now, they had it.</p><p>\u201cA chateau, how lovely,\u201d Jade said.</p><p>Lucian summoned a waiter, his French seeming as perfectly accented as any Tara had ever heard.</p> <p>\u201cAre you French?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>Jade answered. \u201cI\u2019m originally from the New Orleans area,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York,\u201d she said, turning her attention pointedly back to Lucian. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian likes to consider himself a citizen of the world,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not French, but I have lived here,\u201d Lucian told her. \u201c I\u2019ve called the States home for some time now.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze hard on Brent to realize that he had never stopped watching her. \u201cAnd me? I thought you would never ask. Originally, I come from Virginia,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of French spoken in New Orleans, of course,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Tara said pleasantly, but turned her attention to Brent Malone. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t heard of it being such a commonly spoken language in Virginia.\u201d</p><p>His eyes didn\u2019t waver from hers. \u201cI happen to be a student of linguistics,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cMy French should be better,\u201d Jade said. \u201cBut in New Orleans... I haven\u2019t the purity of Lucian\u2019s accent, because I\u2019m afraid we have a patois. I guess, over here, it\u2019s kind of a Southern-slash-French accent\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, you speak the language, comprehend what is said,\u201d Ann told her. Tara saw that her cousin was flushed, and with the blush on her cheeks, she was even more attractive. She was chatting away at the table, but she seemed to be watching the back of the room. Tara tried to see what she was looking at, but the bar had gotten very crowded.</p><p>Now and then, Ann stared at her with amusement, and seemed to nudge her chair closer to Brent\u2019s.</p><p>Tara couldn\u2019t help it; she didn\u2019t like it a bit.</p><p>She understood it; but she didn\u2019t like it, any more than she liked the fact that the man at her side was too close\u2014and closer with every move Ann made. In truth, he was a normal distance away, sitting as they were in such a tightly packed establishment But it was as if she could feel the whole of him. The stretch of his legs beneath the table, perfectly correct, yet if she shifted, she would brush against him. She hated the feet that a strange heat seemed to emanate from him, compelling her to move closer, as if she were cold.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t cold.</p><p>His scent... whatever the aftershave or soap he wore ... remained compelling as well. Subtle. There was nothing overt about him at all. But it was there ... something that beckoned at a subliminal range.</p><p>And while it lured, it also sent lightning into her system, tremendous flashes that warned her to be wary.</p><p>A man was dead.</p><p>She knew he hadn\u2019t done it.</p><p>Ah, but what if there had been a conspiracy? What if these \u201cfriends\u201d of his who had just arrived had been in the tomb, what if they were the murderers? Surely, none of this talk of evil and vampires had been true, even though Jacques\u2019 mind and the minds of these strangers were traveling along similar courses. Maybe they even knew something about Jacques, knew that she had been in the tomb because of his beliefs, and they were playing upon them?</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d Ann said.</p><p>She jumped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a thousand miles away. I\u2019m off with that tall fellow over there. We\u2019re all going to dance. Brent has just asked you to join him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I, uh, I think I\u2019ll beg off,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lucian and his wife were already standing. Ann was practically running\u2014pushing and shoving her way\u2014</p><p>heading toward the rear of the room. What tall fellow? Tara still didn\u2019t know who her cousin had been watching.</p><p>\u201cTara?\u201d Brent was watching her. There was a definite humorous edge in his eyes, and perhaps a challenge. His hand was stretched toward her.</p><p>She wanted to jump up and knock his hand aside. But suddenly, his long bronzed, work-roughened fingers lay on her arm.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want to join them?\u201d</p><p>She tried to find her cousin on the dance floor. She couldn\u2019t see her, and, perhaps unreasonably, she worried about her.</p><p>She stared down at Brent\u2019s hand on her flesh.</p><p>She wanted to draw her arm back, but she didn\u2019t. She felt her heart drumming.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you any farther than I could throw you,\u201d she told him flatly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m worried about my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like an open book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should know that I\u2019m thinking this as well\u2014I want you to leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin looks happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she shouldn\u2019t be. There\u2019s something ... something slimy about all of you.\u201d His lashes lowered over his curious eyes for a long moment. Then he stared at her again.</p><p>\u201cSlimy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best word I can summon to fit the feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlimy? Wow, I am ... crushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I possibly crush you? You barely know me. You\u2019re an exaggerator. And a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve lied to you,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd I also don\u2019t believe that you feel that you barely know me. Are you always this cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I meet a man while another is being brutally murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I swear to you, we\u2019re not slimy. But let\u2019s see ... in that moment when you were lost to us, you were thinking that one of my companions might have slipped in and killed Jean-Luc while I was chasing after you in the tomb.\u201d</p><p>She was so startled that he had divined her thoughts so accurately that she gasped aloud.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to check their passports and airline tickets,\u201d he said, removing his hand from her arm and leaning back. \u201cThey have just arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really, and the authorities will give me that information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can find a way to learn exactly what time\u2014and from where\u2014they arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I am going to speak with the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell them you were there,\u201d he said. The words were even. They were still a command\u2014and a warning.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you at all. You\u2019re a fool. I could completely clear you.\u201d He leaned forward, very close, and very intense. She was overwhelmed again by a strange sense of warmth. She told herself that she was not pulling back because she had no intention of giving in to such fantasies.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let your name become involved with what happened,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me as far as you can throw me\u2014well, I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t trust Dubois. And we both know there is a murderer out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my grandfather, or something about him, don\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou know his reputation as a writer, and you think he will be an ally of yours in insisting that there is pure evil in the ground. Well, there\u2019s not There\u2019s a murderer out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara, whether the murderer is human\u2014or superhuman in some way\u2014the danger would remain if you were to let your name become involved in the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name is surely involved\u2014and here you are, out on the town, enjoying life with your friends.</p><p>Although how you managed to be in this part of town, I\u2019m not at all sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do need to see your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very old, and ill, and I\u2019m not going to allow you to hurt him.\u201d Steady eyes, appearing pure yellow, stared into her own. Despite herself, she found that she believed him when he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt your grandfather for the world. In fact, I would defend him with my dying breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to defend him. He has Ann, and he has me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if you find that you do need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if\u2014-just what if\u2014some of his talk\u2014or mine\u2014proved to be legitimate? Calling the police might not be the answer you need. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up against.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found Jean-Luc\u2019s body, you\u2019ll recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what If it comes to that, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never asked for my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He started writing on one of the cocktail napkins. \u201cHere, my number, just in case you need it\u201d He passed the napkin to her. \u201cPlease, it\u2019s just a phone number.

You\u2019re very suspicious, but I intrigue you, and I think that you like me just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather sure of yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see, I met you in a crypt at the exact time a man was being murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.

Perhaps it\u2019s just in the back of your artistic mind, and maybe it\u2019s more than that, but I don\u2019t believe you really think I could cause you any harm. But all that aside, just what do you think I could do out there on the dance floor? Come on\u2014we\u2019re appearing extremely antisocial. Be really daring, come dance with me.\u201d He gave her no choice. He had risen, and taken her hand.</p><p>There was nothing tight or fierce about his grip at all.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all certain that she could have broken it</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>That time between sleep ... and the rush of power upon waking ... could be the most wonderful.</p> <p>And that was when she heard him.</p><p>My love . . .</p><p>The words, so soft at first, growing louder. Faint, a dream, imagination, longing, desire. And then ...</p><p>I can feel you, speak to me, where are you?</p><p>She longed to reply. Longed with every fiber of her being. The fact that he was near ... that he remained, that he was out there. Jubilation swept through her, and her reply came without thought or effort.</p><p>But then she held back.</p><p>There was something else out there. Someone. Another entity.</p><p>And when she replied, she did so carefully, already bitter, feeling a new rise of hate and determination.</p><p>Once ...</p><p>But once had been long ago.</p><p>She inhaled the sweet smell of ancient earth. She felt the power of the new life, the new blood, filling her veins. Felt the warmth of that life, real, solid, strong.</p><p>I will find you . . .</p><p>Her name again. Soft, yearning.</p><p>And then the realization on his end. Silence.</p><p>They could be found.</p><p>Yes, we will find one another.</p><p>She closed off, purposely, and yet...</p><p>It was still out there. That hint of danger. Strong ...</p><p>They were many around him. Many who had rallied to him. These thoughts came to her mind, and she was bitter. Because she could sense there was more behind him than even the strength and powers with which she was acquainted.</p><p>She rose. It was night now. Darkness had descended.</p><p>And it was her time to rule the earth.</p><p>Ah, well, start small. She didn\u2019t need to rule the earth.</p><p>Just Paris.</p><p>Ann was having the time of her life.</p><p>Once they were on the dance floor, Tara decided wryly that Ann might have been right\u2014perhaps she had really seen a large shepherd dog the night before\u2014but Paris, and the surrounding villages, were full of wolves.</p><p>They all seemed to be in the bar.</p><p>Once they had begun dancing, she didn\u2019t have to worry long about being too close to Brent Malone.</p><p>And she was close. They were bumped into every other second, it seemed, and with each bump, she was thrown hard against him. Then she realized that she had been sadly mistaken if she had thought him slim or wiry. He was lean, but must have been made of pure muscle.</p><p>No matter how hard she tried to prevent it, her mind kept going back to her cousin\u2019s words earlier that evening: Hadn\u2019t she ever met someone with whom she fell into instant... lust? Didn\u2019t she ever just wonder</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Yes, yes, yes. She almost wanted to scream. Each crush against him, slide of his hand, brush of his chest or thigh, was a sensual experience. She was warm, roasting, blood rushing through her, betraying her thoughts in the rise of color in her cheeks . . .</p><p>The crowd on the floor seemed to be in a collective good mood, and having fun, and men were cutting in on one another constantly. She didn\u2019t dance with Brent long\u2014not more than two minutes and sixty bumps\u2014 before he was forced to give way to a bearded fellow who in turn, handed her over to a young blond man.</p><p>At one point, she saw that the Lothario with the slick mustache who had just cut in on her latest partner was apparently sending his own date down the line\u2014she had seen him with the short-haired mini-skirted redhead who was now with Brent when they had first come out on the floor.</p><p>When the song ended, she saw that he was coming across the floor for her.</p><p>But Lucian stopped him and said something to him that made him frown and pause. The two spoke for a few minutes, then he continued on his way to her.</p><p>\u201cThe others have to leave, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch up with them later.\u201d He hesitated. They were both slightly damp from exertion. They weren\u2019t more than an inch apart. She realized that she had been having fun ...</p><p>And wanting more.</p><p>She had been hoping that he was going to come back for her, each time their partners changed. She was as suspicious and wary as it was possible to be, but she knew that she was attracted to him, that, in fact, she had never felt so compelled by anyone at any time before in her life. She wished that she had met him differently. She wished she was elsewhere with him. Like a deserted island. A warm deserted island where clothing was minimal, and she could reach out and touch the nakedness of the chest she had been crushed against so frequently tonight.</p><p>Staring up at him, a flood of warmth swept over her. She didn\u2019t know his exact fantasy. It might not have been a beach. Maybe somewhere in front of a roaring fire, but wherever it was, flesh was the main thing, touching flesh, and getting closer than they had been on the dance floor.</p><p>She took a step back. Sometimes, she thought that she was a single sane person in a world gone crazy.</p><p>She knew friends who met guys at bars, never learned their last names, and slept with them. Intimacy for her had always taken time; in her life, she could count only three relationships that could be considered affairs.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want time. Nor did she want the truth. She wanted to know nothing about his background.</p><p>She just wanted a single hour to sate the curiosity and sudden hunger that had plagued her from the first time she had seen him.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t accustomed to giving way, and she forced herself to step back, blink, and assess the man in her mind\u2019s eye. She forced her eyes to his, and away from his hands, and her mind from the fantasy about what those hands would feel like if he were to touch her. Really touch.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay because of us. We can get home okay. After all, we came out alone tonight, and we\u2019re both armed with mace. We didn\u2019t expect to run into an escort\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ann?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She turned and searched the dance floor at the rear of the bar. She could barely see her cousin through the crowd, but she saw the man. He was tall, and sandy haired. He might have been a linebacker from a football team. Her cousin was on her toes with her arms around him as she kissed him on both cheeks.</p><p>Very French.</p><p>But then the man pulled her back for a moment in a long hug, his face buried against her neck, her dark hair spilling over his features.</p><p>The two pulled apart. Her cousin was flushed and smiling. As Tara stared, Ann left the man and came hurrying to the front door to say goodbye; she had apparently realized that the DeVeaus were leaving.</p><p>Ann did the kisses on the cheeks with the couple, encouraging them once again to come and see the chateau.</p><p>Tara somehow refrained from throttling her cousin. Lucian and Jade both smiled and waved to her. She forced a smile and wave in return, then turned to Brent.</p><p>\u201cYou are free to go with them!\u201d she repeated, disturbed that words meant to be casual but firm came out in something of a desperate whisper.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t mind following you two home, I honestly don\u2019t mind,\u201d Brent said. He grimaced toward the dance floor. \u201cWolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not the worst wolf of the bunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he told her softly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a chance to reply. Ann was suddenly between them.</p><p>She came close to speak, her voice rising above the sound of the music and the crowd as she told Brent,</p><p>\u201cYour friends are lovely.\u201d</p><p>The dark fellow with the mustache came up behind Ann, catching her hand, speaking in rapid French and drawing her back to the dance floor.</p><p>Tara stared at Brent, then pushed past him, making her way back to the table. He followed, taking a seat beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely, you can read my mind,\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cActually, I believe you are suspicious, wondering what business dragged them out of a bar at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrevious commitments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>She turned suddenly, wondering why she had come to the table. She couldn\u2019t see Ann from here.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to watch your cousin, we\u2019ll have to dance again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to watch her,\u201d she lied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about her.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Ann isn\u2019t the suspicious type. I wouldn\u2019t want her to be too trusting\u2014of anyone here. And she doesn\u2019t particularly believe in evil or things that go bump in the night\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were far too logical to believe in what you couldn\u2019t see yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can be very suspicious.\u201d</p><p>She was startled when he didn\u2019t reply. It was suddenly as if she wasn\u2019t there. His eyes were on the dance floor. He didn\u2019t rise at first, but he was tense as he might have been if thugs armed with repeating rifles had just walked into the place.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get your cousin out of here,\u201d he said, standing then.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me. We\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, startled by his sudden change.</p><p>He looked down at her, features taut, yellow eyes an intent blaze. \u201cFor once, trust me.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what power of force or sincerity lay in his gaze. She found herself rising\u2014trusting him, and just as anxious as he to leave the bar.</p><p>Trusting him ...</p><p>For once.</p><p>They hurried out to the dance floor together, weaving their way through to Ann. While Tara talked to her cousin, she noted that Brent was studying everyone on the dance floor.</p> <p>\u201cSo early? Why must we go now?\u201d Ann shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s the best night I\u2019ve had in ages. Oh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not taking any of these wolves seriously, Tara, but I am having a very good time. All right, well, maybe there is one wolf I\u2019m taking seriously. Revenge. God, is it sweet. Tara, you could let Brent take you home, and I\u2019ll come along within an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not leaving you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Tara, I\u2019m out alone, meeting friends or whatever, all the time when you\u2019re not here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go,\u201d Brent interrupted. He was staring at Ann.</p><p>Ann suddenly smiled and shrugged. \u201cSure. If you say so.\u201d</p><p>Tara was perplexed and amazed at the instantly acquiescent tone in Ann\u2019s voice. Linking arms with Tara, Ann started straight for the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, the bill!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLucian covered it before he left,\u201d Brent said curtly. \u201cLet\u2019s go, now.\u201d When they were out on the street, Tara noted that he was staring at the bar, still tense, and perhaps, still trying to determine exactly what it was in there that he had suddenly found so disturbing that they had to leave.</p> <p>\u201cThe fellow with the very blond hair was quite nice,\u201d Ann said, walking along in the direction of the car.</p><p>The girls remained together. Brent was behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhich fellow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, let\u2019s see ... I think he must have been about six feet two or three. Great, sculpted features. Nice shoulders... different\u201d She was smiling as she watched Tara. \u201cIt was the same man, Tara, the American I met today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you introduce me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely know him,\u201d Ann said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure he would come, though I had thought that he might And guess what? Willem was there ... at least I think he was there. I\u2019m almost certain I saw him sitting at a corner table. I like the blond. I hope to see him again. He is ... very handsome. And macho. I like broad shoulders and muscles.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder to see if Brent remained several feet behind him.\u201cI mean, really, I\u2019m quite old enough to judge a man for his mind and his manner, but... well, voila, there it is, I cannot help but be impressed with good muscle as well. But this man, Rick, ah, he\u2019s courteous as well. With such a sense of humor! And his accent! When he speaks English, and when he speaks French!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe French hate American accents,\u201d Tara said absently. She paused, looking back at Brent</p><p>\u201cTara! I never look down my nose at an American accent! All right, well, maybe now and then. But for this man ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrent, where\u2019s your car?\u201d Tara asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the lot. And so is yours.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a great distance between the bar and the lot where people parked for La Guerre. But once they had left the neon glow of the bar behind, the street suddenly seemed very dark.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the center of Paris, where lights burned brightly at all hours of the day and night.</p><p>Old buildings, some ancient, and some only a century or two old, mingled with a few modern structures.</p><p>By day they were businesses, some with apartments atop them, but by night...</p><p>They were closed. And dark. And the street lamps here were few and far between. Only a few pale lights\u2014 quite beautiful, actually, Art Moderne, from perhaps the nineteen twenties\u2014stood guard over the parked cars.</p><p>The lamps should have created an area of light and safety.</p><p>Instead, they helped create a world of shadow and shifting dark shapes.</p><p>Brent had paused. He was listening. And watching the shadows.</p><p>Tara looked around, as he was doing. She felt a strange dread growing in her, seeming to make her muscles heavy, constricted.</p><p>Shadows shifted.</p><p>They appeared as giant wings, dark sweeps in the night that played from building to building. The breeze suddenly seemed to stir, cold, though they were barely into autumn.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Brent said suddenly, and very softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. Nothing, there was nothing around them. It was just a shadowy street.</p><p>The weather was changing, the seasons were shifting.</p><p>And the shadows . . .</p><p>Were nothing more than shadows.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>She could still feel that sensation. That prickling at the nape of her neck. The heaviness of fear, the paralysis of terror.</p><p>Terror.</p><p>Of shadows!</p><p>She tried to get a grip on herself, to let her usual common sense and logic slip into place. Her certainty that the dangers in the world were known.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Ann suddenly gripped her arm. She realized her cousin was feeling the same inexplicable sense of dread that had seized her.</p><p>Brent looked at her, and gave her an odd, disarming smile. \u201cGo on, please, and quickly. I\u2019ll be by later, just to make sure you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllons-y!\u201d Ann insisted, her fingers digging hard into Tara\u2019s flesh.</p><p>Then she didn\u2019t know what force galvanized her into action. She grabbed her cousin\u2019s hand and started running. They could see Ann\u2019s car, ahead.</p><p>Ann had parked under the lights that gave off a gloomy yellow glow.</p><p>Tara had never run so fast in her life, and as they streaked across the walk and the grass and onto the asphalt again, she didn\u2019t look back. She feared that, like Lot\u2019s wife, she would be turned to salt.</p><p>Or she would see something that she didn\u2019t want to see. Something that she could deny, as long as she didn\u2019t turn ...</p><p>Into the night, into the glow by the car, she saw the sweep of the shadow. She heard something behind them, close behind them. The soft fall of padded footsteps, moving with a greater speed and force than that which drove them.</p><p>Overhead, a great wing of darkness was rising ...</p><p>She heard ... something.</p><p>A shriek.</p><p>A sudden cry of the wind that had been nothing but whispering ...</p><p>Ann was rattling her keys in her hands, trying to find the key for the car door.</p><p>\u201cThe clicker!\u201d Tara shouted.</p><p>For a split second, Ann stared at her, horrified at her own stupidity in forgetting that she could beep her locks open. She hit the clicker. The girls both jumped into the car, and slammed the doors.</p><p>They both shrieked, as something hit the roof of the car.</p><p>They stared at one another.</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d Tara said.</p><p>With shaking fingers, Ann inserted the key into the ignition. The car roared to life.</p><p>Another thump came. Ann stepped on the gas. They heard the sounds of whatever had been on top of them falling from the car ...</p><p>And yet...</p><p>They didn\u2019t truly hear the sound of anything falling.</p><p>lips taut and serious, Ann stared ahead at the road. She jerked the car out onto the street, and they sped down the length of it.</p><p>Tara turned back. There was nothing behind them. Nothing at all. The neon glow advertising La Guerre continued to burn softly. Cars remained in the lot.</p><p>Shadows were just shadows.</p><p>There were no people just outside the door, nor were there any on the street. Not even Brent Malone.</p><p>\u201cWhat did we hit? What was on the car?\u201d Ann demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>Ann stared at her incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing back there, nothing back there at all,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you\u2014Ann! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Her cousin had nearly braked, and was turning the car around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to see. I don\u2019t know why I was so panicked back there. But I heard... what if I hit someone, something? What if I\u2019ve wounded a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there!\u201d</p><p>But Ann was determined. They drove back down the street, hesitating near the bar and the parking lot.</p><p>Ann drew to a halt, laughing, leaning her head on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cAnn, what is the matter with you? Let\u2019s get the hell out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ann demanded. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here! We let the darkness and shadows make silly little geese out of us.\u201d Her laughter faded. She swallowed hard, and suddenly rubbed the back of her neck. \u201cI don\u2019t feel really well. It\u2019s bad to drink wine, smoke cigarettes, and run like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn, drive,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>It seemed that the shadows were moving again. And the gloomy light beneath which they\u2019d parked suddenly made a popping sound.</p><p>The shadows fell like a cloak of sweeping vengeance all around them.</p><p>\u201cDrive!\u201d Tara said.</p><p>Ann didn\u2019t hesitate. She hit the gas again, and didn\u2019t let up until they had reached the chateau, roaring past stop signs and red lights.</p><p>In front of the chateau, she put the car in park and sat still for a minute. \u201cAre we crazy? Are we letting Grandpapa get to us?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tara said. \u201cYes, wait, I do know. At the least, there is a cold-blooded murderer out there somewhere. Naturally, we\u2019re nervous. So let\u2019s get into the house.\u201d Ann stared at her and nodded solemnly.</p><p>Then, as one, they opened their doors and started to bolt for the house. As they neared the entry, they saw that the door was open.</p><p>\u201cWhat... ?\u201d Ann murmured.</p> <p>Tara saw that Katia was blocking the doorway. And even at the chateau, where light was always shining on the drive at night, shadows seemed to have crept in.</p><p>Tara felt the breeze again. Cold, penetrating. Evil.</p><p>A breeze was not evil! It was autumn, and days could still be warm, but winter was coming, and a cold breeze simply hinted of the season to come . . .</p><p>\u201cHe is sleeping, I tell you!\u201d</p><p>Katia was speaking in French, but she was determined, and enunciating each word.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot let you in ...\u201d</p><p>Tara blinked and saw what she hadn\u2019t seen before. A woman was standing in the entrance, next to the outer wall, and framed by ivy. Shadows fell over her from the balconies above, which was why they hadn\u2019t seen her at first</p><p>\u201cBut then again ...\u201d Katia said suddenly, amazingly changing her mind, ready to pull out the red carpet and beg the woman to enter.</p><p>The breeze ...</p><p>It seemed to grip her again, as if it could paralyze her.</p><p>Ann wasn\u2019t moving at all.</p> <p>The woman was nearly in the house. Tara suddenly knew that she couldn\u2019t allow it. She raced to the door, spinning to stare at the woman.</p><p>For a moment, she was speechless herself. And dear Lord, she didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>The woman was a well-dressed, startling beauty. Hair almost pitch black. Eyes as green as emeralds.</p><p>Her suit was impeccably tailored, the latest fashion. It was fitted, and she wore it very well. The skirt was short. Her heels were spikes.</p><p>She extended a hand toward Tara. Automatically, Tara accepted it</p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m from the social services department at the hospital. I\u2019m just doing a checkup on your grandfather. It\u2019s something we try to do with all our patients, especially when they are elderly. We like to make sure that they\u2019re doing well in their home environment\u201d like Katia, Tara was strangely tempted to invite the woman in. Her smile was so sincere.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>Tara\u2019s hand, when she shook that of the other woman, felt like ice.</p> <p>And yet...</p><p>At the same time, it burned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s far too late to visit my grandfather,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cHe sleeps at this hour. If you wish to see him, you must come by during the day.\u201d</p><p>In a flash ... and only for a flash\u2014so quickly that Tara might have imagined it\u2014the woman\u2019s face vanished. The pleasant, hypnotic smile vanished. She betrayed a fury, a hideous expression of anger so deep and vile that Tara fell back a step.</p><p>And then ...</p><p>She was smiling again, so pleasantly, her eyes on Ann, who had nearly reached the door.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry, it is late. I hadn\u2019t realized how late myself. You can\u2019t imagine the hours we work. It\u2019s just dreadful. There\u2019s not really much I need to do. Perhaps, if you were just to invite me in, I could take a peek at your grandfather and see that he was sleeping in comfortable surroundings. I\u2019m aware of his family history, of course, and I\u2019m well aware he has good and loving relatives. It would be such a relief to have one patient off my list\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps\u2014\u201d Ann began, falling under the same spell.</p><p>But the woman suddenly straightened.</p><p>It was as if she had suddenly become aware of a touch of ice in the air.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. It is not a big thing. I will be back.\u201d</p><p>She started down the steps.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Ann called after her.</p><p>The woman swung back to stare at the two of them. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. I will be back.\u201d For a flash, a subliminal second\u2014Tara saw the horrid mask of fury on the woman\u2019s face again.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t there. She was smiling. And assuring them.</p><p>Yes, oh, yes, she would return.</p><p>Katia suddenly sprang to life and began scolding Ann and Tara.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in, come in! I don\u2019t know what possessed me to open the door! It\u2019s a strangely cold night, suddenly. And we\u2019d been having a renewed burst of summer in the midst of fall! In the house, in the house, in the house! Come, come, girls. There is a maniac out there. The police have done nothing yet\u201d</p><p>They were ushered in. Katia closed and locked the door firmly.</p><p>Inside, it was warm. A fire was burning in the hearth in the hall. \u201cGirls, would you like hot chocolate?\u201d Tara gave herself a shake. Inside the house, everything seemed different Everything. It was not just warm, it was ...</p><p>Normal.</p><p>Ann seemed to be feeling the same. She gave Katia a rueful smile. \u201cChocolate, lovely. If you don\u2019t mind though, I\u2019ll take mine up to bed. I\u2019m suddenly exhausted. And you\u2019re so right, Katia. I hope the police find the killer soon. This is quite ridiculous. We were both terrified out there tonight Walking under lights that seemed more like dark clouds, yet armed with our mace! I hate being this nervous. The police must catch the killer. We were so frightened tonight! And so silly ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly?\u201d Tara said suddenly. She looked at Katia.</p><p>\u201cHow long was that woman here before we arrived? I mean, that was absurd. Coming to visit an elderly man at this time of night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that she did not realize the hour,\u201d Katia told her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe\u2014no one doesn\u2019t realize it when it\u2019s late at night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s gone, and good riddance,\u201d Katia said.</p><p>Katia started for the kitchen. As Ann walked on into the hall, dropping her handbag, Tara followed Katia to the kitchen. \u201cKatia.\u201d</p><p>Katia turned and smiled at Tara. \u201cYou know, you are here a day, and already, your French is getting so much better. You forget, and you get rusty, because you are gone so long.\u201d Tara nodded. \u201cKatia, the woman said that she was coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy daylight!\u201d Katia said firmly. She sniffed, as if expressing her opinion that the woman had really had an incredible gall coming at that hour.</p><p>\u201cKatia, listen to me. No matter what time she comes, you\u2019re not to let her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Katia asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. But for some reason, I don\u2019t trust her. I don\u2019t believe that she is who she claims to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? We do have many social services\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the hospital tomorrow,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>Katia had the milk heating on the stove. Tara took a quick second to remember how much she loved Katia\u2019s chocolate. Made from scratch. The sweetest milk. The best cocoa.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think she left so suddenly?\u201d Katia asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe Ann was about to say that it was all right for her to come in, get it all over with,\u201d Katia went on, reaching into the cupboard for chocolate shavings. \u201cIn feet ... she had worn me down.\u201d Katia looked perplexed. \u201cSomehow,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cBut then you two came home, and you told her she could not come in, which was, of course, completely right. Perhaps she is not who she claimed to be! Ah! She could be an autograph hound! Jacques lives in relative privacy here, but he has been stalked by his fans for his autograph, you know. That\u2019s it! She must be a determined fan. Well!\u201d Katia waved a wooden spoon at Tara. \u201cShe will not come in.\u201d Again, she frowned. \u201cStill, so curious that she left... !\u201d Tara frowned suddenly. \u201cHow did she leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Katia asked.</p><p>\u201cI mean, how did she get here? And how did she leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I assume she had a car!\u201d Katia said.</p><p>\u201cWe came into the driveway, and I don\u2019t remember seeing a car in it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must have been,\u201d Katia said.</p><p>\u201cWe would have noticed a car in the driveway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are a bit out\u2014surely, she didn\u2019t walk!\u201d Katia said. \u201cPerhaps her car was out on the road.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIf she did walk, I can see why she was so upset when we refused to let her see Jacques. But she could not have done so. She must have left her car up on the road. Perhaps she was not even sure she was in the right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Tara said with no conviction.</p><p>Katia handed her a cup of chocolate, and placed Ann\u2019s on a tray. Tara followed her. Ann was staring into the fire. She did look beat. Strange. At the bar, she had seemed to possess endless energy. Now, she was almost ashen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Katia. I think I\u2019ll go right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn,\u201d Tara said, halting her as she took her chocolate and turned.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see a car in the drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA car?\u201d Ann frowned. \u201cNo ... I don\u2019t think so. But then again ... well, I still felt shaky when we drove back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, so did I, but... that woman who was here. One would have thought that her car would have been in the drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have left it on the road,\u201d Ann said.</p><p>\u201cWhere else?\u201d Katia asked.</p><p>\u201cRight Where else?\u201d Tara murmured.</p><p>Ann gave her a wave. \u201cI\u2019m off to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night\u201d</p><p>Ann walked on up. Tara stared into the flames then, sipping her chocolate.</p><p>The warm drink, the fire ... the house. Everything that surrounded her was warmth, life as usual ...</p><p>She suddenly turned and walked to the front door. She hesitated, then threw it open, afraid that the woman would still be standing there, staring at her with the vengeful mask of hatred she had seen so briefly.</p><p>Or imagined.</p><p>There was no one there.</p><p>She chided herself, closed and carefully locked the door. When it had been double-bolted, she pulled on it, making sure it was tight.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the house is locked up?\u201d she asked Katia. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTara! Of course. Roland and I see to the lower floor as soon as it gets dark!\u201d Katia assured her. \u201cJust as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Tara said. Actually, she had never thought about making certain that the house was locked up.</p><p>\u201cThank you! Bonne nuit!\u201d she said, and started up the stairs herself.</p><p>She looked into her grandfather\u2019s room, feeling a surge of protective uneasiness.</p> <p>The curtains were open; the doors to the balcony were ajar as well, allowing in a touch of fresh air.</p><p>Tara closed them, and locked them, and paused by her grandfather\u2019s bed.</p><p>His chest rose and fell in the deep breathing of relaxed sleep.</p><p>She leaned down over his forehead. She came close, but didn\u2019t quite touch him, leaving just the hint of a kiss upon his brow.</p><p>In her own room, she yawned. Like Ann, she was exhausted. She took a moment to survey her reflection in the mirror. Drawn. Haggard looking. Luckily, she wasn\u2019t as pale as Ann.</p> <p>Her cousin worked long, long hours. Tara was ostensibly on vacation, but she loved what she did. And she hadn\u2019t so much as stopped anywhere to buy canvas and paints.</p><p>She left the mirror, drew back the covers, kicked off her shoes, and paused. A sense of unease had filled her again.</p><p>It suddenly seemed all-important to make sure that her room, like the main door, had been securely locked.</p><p>She walked to her balcony doors. Her drapes were closed. She didn\u2019t open them, but drew one aside.</p><p>She checked her doors, and felt a strange sense of relief to find them securely locked.</p><p>Then she stared through the panes at the night.</p> <p>And there, in the strange pale glow of a half moon, she saw the wolf again.</p><p>The animal stood, as if it were a rigid sentinel, guardian of the night\u2014or a creature at the portal of Hades.</p><p>Perhaps it had three heads, like the demon dogs of legend.</p><p>It did not She could see the animal clearly silhouetted in the pale glow. It was massive. \u201cThat\u2019s no shepherd!\u201d she muttered aloud.</p><p>As she did so, she suddenly heard a howl.</p><p>Deep, chilling. A howl to the sky, the heavens, the moon ... or hell itself.</p><p>Tara started to shiver.</p><p>She closed the curtains, and turned, but had to look again.</p> <p>There was no wolf on the road. There was nothing...</p><p>Nothing but the shadows of the night</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>The dreams were back, worse than before.</p><p>Twisting, turning, remembering. The hours of being watched. The different drugs. The shots that sent an unbelievable burning sensation streaking through his limbs, causing him to cry out with agony and strain against the steel bonds that held him to the bed.</p><p>Then sometimes, Dr. Weiss. Slipping him different drugs, drugs that ended the agony.</p><p>Nothing had impaired his hearing.</p><p>His comprehension of the language grew, and from bits of conversation, he began to glean more and more of what was going on.</p><p>For so long, the tyrant had held an advantage, but now the tide was turning.</p><p>And in the midst of agony, there was comfort to be had in that.</p><p>In another time, in another place, he had sat with his father by a stream. A man who had fought a different war, survived, and learned in time the value of peace and freedom, he had taught his son that there were many things worse than death. And from that kind and sage old man, he had gained a certain strength. He didn\u2019t fear death. Far too often, he would have welcomed it.</p><p>Weiss gave him the will to survive. Weiss, who told him stories about his people. Those who risked their lives to save others, and those who were not so lucky as to escape detection, who had given their lives for others. He met men among those who should have been his enemies; a few guards who stood with their eyes averted when Weiss helped him, and a woman, the mistress of one of the worst of the officers, who smiled in the man\u2019s face, and did her best to help prisoners escape. Weiss would often whisper to him late at night. He would hear about the war, and about the world, and about people. People who might be judged badly.</p><p>There were those who were passionately against the regime, but were afraid. Not so much for themselves. For their wives, their children, their loved ones. But one day, the world would know that there had been heroes among those thought of as the enemy, heroes against insanity.</p><p>And he believed. It was easy, because he knew Weiss.</p><p>His will to live grew, because of Weiss\u2019s constant flow of news, and because of the bits of conversation he began to hear, and comprehend. The great tide was turning. Every day. Fighting had bogged down in Russia, and this new enemy was learning what so many had learned in agony before\u2014the landscape itself was often more than the most powerful force could endure. Frigid temperatures, mountains of snow. The earth herself protecting her sons, a people battered by brutality and discrimination. There were other places where the great effort was crumbling, places where the people in the greatest danger began to take heart, and fight back.</p><p>In those days he learned that he would never judge any man, or woman, by their nationality. By their color, their religion, their sex. Goodness came in many guises, including this man, his friend, Weiss, and the others, whose humanity continued to override their fear.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how long he had been there; it felt like years. Pain could make a moment an eternity.</p><p>But there was a change. And one night, and when the others were gone, Weiss sat next to him and he spoke about the collapse of the empire, and that the commanders, beginning to realize their own brand of fear, were planning to raze the camp.</p><p>The gas chamber would work around the clock; the crematorium likewise. Prisoners were to be killed, rather than left to be found. Credence could not be given to what the world suspected.</p><p>\u201cI have to get you out... out... and yet, you know nothing yet Nothing. Nothing of what you are, of what you have become, of what you must do, how it must be.\u201d The doctor was distracted. The lieutenant thought that the pressure had at last unhinged his mind.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll come for you. They\u2019ll want you to disappear, they\u2019ll make you nothing more than ashes, and there will be nothing to know, nothing to speculate upon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuard yourself, my friend,\u201d the lieutenant said softly. \u201cYour people will need men like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people\u2014no people\u2014will ever believe that I did my best in my small way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what you say is true, and the war is lost, there will be trials. You will stand trial, and there will be those who have survived who will speak for you.\u201d</p><p>Tears fell down the doctor\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI have not done enough. Like others, I have been too afraid for myself.\u201d</p><p>They were both startled when the door suddenly burst open. The head \u201cphysician,\u201d Andreson, strode in, followed by four of the guards. They were gaunt, tense, angry and\u2014as customary\u2014armed. There was an aura of something more about them today. It was visible in the way that their eyes flicked around nervously. In the way they wet dry lips far too often.</p><p>\u201cWeiss!\u201d Andreson said coldly, eyeing the good man. \u201cWell, I knew you were a traitor! I knew all along. Not that it mattered. You did nothing that I didn\u2019t allow. But the time has come for change, and well, I didn\u2019t really intend that you should survive the war at any time.\u201d Weiss suddenly found a great deal of courage. He stood with tremendous dignity.\u201cNo, sir! I have not been the traitor, never to my land. Never to her true heart And never to my God. And I have never expected to survive the war.\u201d</p><p>Andreson turned to the men who followed him.</p><p>\u201cKill him,\u201d he said flatly, but raised a hand. \u201cSlowly. Shoot where he will feel the pain long before he dies.\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant didn\u2019t know what it was that surged into him. But it was power unlike anything he had ever felt before in his life.</p><p>Adrenaline.</p><p>Fury.</p><p>Suddenly, his rage was such that he was able to break the bonds and shackles that had held him prisoner for so long. He didn\u2019t struggle.</p><p>He merely burst free.</p><p>Andreson shouted out orders that his men must fire quickly. He fell back.</p><p>Yet none of it was to any avail.</p><p>The lieutenant could move with a speed to match his strength. Bullets were fired, yes, he could feel them tearing into him, but they did not stop him.</p><p>He reached for Andreson. The man who had tortured him day after day. Who had threatened and attempted to humble and kill Weiss.</p><p>Reached for him ...</p><p>He remembered that much.</p><p>Then he saw that Andreson lay before him, in a pool of blood, as if he had been wrapped in barbed wire. And the others were shouting something, words in their language that he didn\u2019t understand. They were taking aim again, and trying to kill him, trying to kill Weiss. He knew only that he had to stop them, and that, amazingly, he was still able to move as their bullets ricocheted wildly around the room.</p><p>The first two ...</p><p>He grabbed both by the throat Slung them together, dropped them. Then the second set of men stood before him, white as sheets, still trying to kill.</p><p>like Weiss, they fell to the floor.</p><p>Like Weiss, they were torn to shreds.</p><p>And the sounds of bullets striking walls, floor, glass vials, bedding ... came to an end.</p><p>All was silent.</p><p>Someone was touching him. Weiss. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here. Now. You\u2019re bleeding, you\u2019re ...\u201d Weiss stared at him. He was breathing hard. \u201cCan you still hear me? Do you recognize me? Come, come, I have to get you to safety.\u201d</p><p>He realized he was hurt. Half dead, probably. He\u2019d been riddled with enough bullets. Weiss was pulling on him ... strangely. He was crawling along on all fours, sliding along the blood-spattered floor. He looked back at the tangle of dead men. He blinked the blood from his own eyes, thinking he had seen movement</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not... dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes, they\u2019re dead!\u201d Weiss told him.</p><p>There was a roaring in his head. The lieutenant was afraid he was going to pass out Weiss led him from the building, toward the rear, and the break in the back of the high, barbed wire fence.</p><p>He knew why the break was there without being told.</p><p>It was the path through which the bodies of the dead were taken for disposal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGuards,\u201d he managed to say.</p><p>Men started to cry out, to come rushing toward them. To the lieutenant\u2019s amazement, they started shouting hoarsely, and backing away. Shots were fired, but they were panicked and hurried, and horribly off aim.</p><p>The lieutenant didn\u2019t understand why. He was surely a bloody pulp of a mess, but he didn\u2019t know why that would make the guards stop in horror, making strange signals with their hands, and crying out that they must leave. They seemed in more fear than they would have been of the American army\u2014or even the Russians.</p> <p>\u201cCome, come, come!\u201d Weiss kept on urging him.</p><p>He looked back. Prisoners, gaunt as skeletons, barely able to stand, were looking on.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave them,\u201d the lieutenant muttered. But what could they do, the fragile old doctor and himself, barely hanging on?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come back,\u201d Weiss assured him. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back. In just a few hours. When the moon is full.\u201d The lieutenant would have smiled if he could have done so. In a few hours! He could see the trail of blood he was leaving behind.</p><p>In a few hours, he thought, he would be dead.</p> <p>And that was before they came at last to the stream, and he saw his own reflection.</p><p>She was exhausted and furious.</p><p>The evening should have been swift, and sure, but it had not been, and she had barely escaped. And the fact that she, Louisa, should have been frightened and on the run, was galling.</p><p>And yet, she thought, trying to soothe herself, she would have her revenge. She would take it slowly, and it would be delicious. She had to remember that, when dealing with a similar power, it was best to have numbers on her side. But then again, she hadn\u2019t even suspected that she might come across such a danger.</p><p>It would be met.</p><p>And obliterated.</p> <p>And as to the inhabitants of Chateau DeVant... those women...</p><p>They, too, would be made to suffer.</p><p>Where was Claremont? She closed her eyes, and tried to concentrate. But again, she felt the presence of danger, and she closed her mind.</p><p>She walked through the streets, aware that too soon, dawn would come.</p><p>Anger churned, and with it came raw hunger. Desperate hunger.</p><p>As she traveled, senses heightened to a peak, she became aware of a presence that was near. She allowed her instinct to take flight, moved like the darkness, and like shadow.</p><p>She found the prey she had sensed.</p><p>Bearded ...</p> <p>Filthy, lying against a wall in an alley, a paper bag with a liquor bottle in it by his side. He was not awake, and not asleep. He sang softly.</p><p>She came close.</p><p>He blinked, eyes still half closed.</p><p>His song stopped.</p><p>She moved in.</p><p>The man\u2019s stench was overwhelming. Louisa thought that the drunk had not bathed in years. His clothing was caked with mud. He wore jeans that were all but stiff from dirt, spilled alcohol, and from being worn day in and day out, for however long. Bits of leaf and dirt streaked his hair and beard. It didn\u2019t matter, she told herself. In fact she would unintentionally be doing humanity a service by ridding the streets of such trash.</p><p>But as she moved in ...</p><p>No.</p><p>No, he was simply too filthy. The smell was not bearable. He was unbelievably disgusting.</p><p>Despite her rage, she began to move on.</p><p>A second later, he was singing again. His song was interrupted by words as he laughed at himself for his folly in fearing the shadows.</p><p>Again, Louisa concentrated. The darkness still surrounded her, and she became a part of it Then ...</p><p>ahead of her, laughing, talking, passing a bottle of wine between them as they ambled down the streets, was a threesome. Two men, one woman.</p><p>Her hunger, heightened by that rage that still burned within her, suddenly filled her anew.</p><p>And yet, she knew, rage would not serve her well. It did not matter so much with a drunk in an alley, but finesse was more enjoyable.</p><p>She walked behind the group, then quickened her step, passing them ... by just a few feet, and walking as if she had somewhere to go.</p><p>\u201cAh, mademoiselle! Bonsoir!\u201d one of the men called to her.</p><p>\u201cPieter!\u201d the woman chided. \u201cLeave her be!\u201d</p><p>Louisa allowed herself to turn slightly, to survey the group. Hardly la creme de la creme of society. The woman\u2019s skirt was too short, her blouse was low cut, and her breasts all but spilled from it. And there was something about the way she moved ...</p><p>Ah, well. A lady of the evening. Louisa did not really judge this at all; a woman did what she did to get by. But alas, this one was somewhat coarse. The breasts were there, and so were the hips. In time, she would be quite large. Not the one to be courtesan to the rich and mighty. And not smart enough, not in the least educated, she would not even know that what she sold so cheaply could have been refined and improved ... and used for power.</p><p>And the men ...</p><p>A bit coarse as well. Past their first youth, but not yet old. Married? They wore no rings. Yet they had the look of men on the prowl for illicit pleasure. And still drinking, and looking for their place, at this hour.</p><p>Cheap, oh, yes, very cheap, perhaps, if they could only afford one woman between them.</p><p>Not at all the type she would really choose ...</p><p>But then, they had, at least, bathed during the past decade.</p><p>\u201cMarie, you sound jealous, the more the merrier!\u201d the second man said.</p><p>Louisa allowed herself to slow down. The first man, Pieter, matched his stride to hers. \u201cMademoiselle ...</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to disturb you, but you are walking alone, and there is a murderer loose in the environs.\u201d She took a moment to look at him. Ah, yes. A fellow a bit old before his time. Too much drinking. Too much debauchery.</p><p>So many entertaining men went this way!</p><p>She shuddered slightly.</p><p>He took it as a sign that she was afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou must have some wine. It will keep you warm. I didn\u2019t mean to frighten you, only to protect you.\u201d She accepted the bottle of wine and took a long drink, watching the man\u2019s dark eyes. She saw the light of cunning and pleasure that touched them. Ah, yes, big fellow, he had made another conquest.</p><p>\u201cThere is a hotel straight ahead. Perhaps you could spend a little time with us there, until it grows light, and you are not walking alone in the streets.\u201d</p><p>She took another swallow of the wine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Pieter. My friend is Jorge. And our companion is Marie.\u201d Louisa nodded in the direction of the threesome.</p><p>\u201cI know where else we can go,\u201d she said, her voice silky\u2014and just a touch tremulous.</p><p>Pieter looked her up and down, at the obvious fine cut of her clothing. And surely, that of her figure and poise. He must be thinking that he had struck gold.</p><p>\u201cYou know somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do.\u201d</p><p>She could see him calculating the money he would save if he did not have to rent a hotel room for his few hours\u2014no, no, with these wine-sodden fellows, it would only be a few minutes\u2018 pleasure\u2014with his whore.</p><p>He smiled broadly, his face appearing all the more fleshy and bloated. Was he married? If so, she\u2019d be doing the poor wife a favor.</p><p>\u201cLead on!\u201d he told her. \u201cJorge, Marie, this lady has a place for us to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMais oui!\u201d she murmured. \u201cCome, come ...\u201d</p><p>The house was not far from the ruins of the old St Michel. She had seen the signs upon it, but she had known it once ... long ago.</p><p>They followed her. Pieter remained beside her. From behind, Jorge ribbed him, apparently unhappy that it now appeared he had the chubby Marie while his friend had the newfound beauty. Louisa smiled. She could almost hear Marie\u2019s pout.</p><p>They came to the house.</p><p>\u201cIt is condemned,\u201d Pieter said.</p><p>\u201cAh, but I\u2019ve been in!\u201d she told him. \u201cThere is a problem with the roof, and an upper room where a storm has weakened the supports. You must trust me. The grand salon remains ... quite grand.\u201d She pulled off the boards that had sealed the entrance with so little effort that Pieter talked about the carelessness of the village in sealing a place so poorly. Louisa smiled. He must think what he liked.</p><p>\u201cWill we find more wine in there?\u201d Marie whined.</p><p>\u201cWell, for me, I can say that there will be plenty to drink,\u201d Louisa assured them. She looked the three over. \u201cPerhaps it will not be the finest vintage, but__\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least,\u201d Jorge said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Louisa agreed, \u201cI guess that it does not. We must all... stoop beneath us a bit now and then, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for a reply, but slipped through the door she\u2019d opened. The others stepped in. They looked around at the remnants of the beautiful old place, and did not notice that the door closed firmly behind them without being touched.</p><p>\u201cThis way ...\u201d</p><p>Louisa led them first to the ladies\u2019 salon, a small room off the entryway. There was a delightful couch, and a cart with a crystal decanter of brandy upon it Cobwebs clung around the crystal, but the stopper remained firmly in place over the contents of the bottle.</p><p>\u201cJorge ... Marie, perhaps you would enjoy the splendors of this room for a moment. I think that I must get to know Pieter on a more personal level... first.\u201d</p><p>Marie clasped her arms around Jorge\u2019s waist, laughing with pleasure. \u201cThe brandy must be fine, Jorge!</p><p>And see that little settee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen how I can manage furniture as yet!\u201d Marie insisted.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy.\u201d</p><p>Louisa beckoned Pieter with a crook of her finger. He followed her out, eyes filled with anticipation. She closed the door to the salon and led him across the foyer to the men\u2019s smoking room. A huge leather sofa faced a fireplace. Pieter did not notice that a fire burned within it, awaiting them.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who owned this place?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d she said.</p><p>Another cart held a large choice of liquors. Pieter went to it, prowled among the bottles, and poured himself a large scotch. He drank it down in a swallow, then turned to her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what you have.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She arched a brow delicately.</p><p>\u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not disappoint you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you will not. I know what I am getting,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled, kicking off his shoes, sloughing off his jacket, then practically tearing off his shirt. He slid from his pleated pants.</p><p>He wore some sort of underwear in a ridiculous flag pattern. Tight, skimpy little underwear, designed, apparently, to increase the size of his bulge.</p><p>\u201cPieter ...\u201d she purred, coming toward him. \u201cYou must show me what you\u2019ve got Everything you\u2019ve got\u201d His grin deepened ridiculously and he made a point of thrusting his hips as he skimmed away the last garment. He spread out his arms. \u201cNow, belle dame, you come and show me what you\u2019ve got,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, certainly.\u201d She walked deliberately toward him. She slid off one shoe, and then the other. She made an elaborate display of removing her beautiful new clothing, piece by piece, as she came near him.</p> <p>Of course, it was not necessary, but she did love her beautiful new contemporary designs.</p><p>She stood before him, smiling, running her hands down the length of her body, pausing at strategic places. \u201cI have got this ... and this ...\u201d</p><p>She paused, certain that he was going to pop on the spot</p><p>\u201cAnd this ...\u201d She rubbed her hands low over her abdomen, pressing with slow eroticism against her mound. \u201cThis ... and ...\u201d</p><p>She walked the last step toward him, just out of arm\u2019s reach.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have got these,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>She opened her mouth wide. For a moment, his winesodden mind was so befuddled that he did not grasp what he saw.</p><p>She heard the inhalation of his breath. And she knew that he was about to scream.</p><p>She did not allow him to do so. Her assault was instantaneous. Rich, warm nourishment flooded into her body. She gripped her prey as he shook spasmodically in her grasp. He never let out a sound, for she had dealt with his windpipe.</p><p>She allowed herself the luxury of sinking to the floor. Of drinking slowly and surely, savoring every drop, lapping up each tiny bit, all but writhing in ecstasy at the luxurious meal, taken at her full leisure. It didn\u2019t hurt at all that this drink was so heavily ... spiked.</p><p>When she had finished, she tossed the remains aside. She would deal with them later.</p><p>She stood, and walked with a smooth, sure sway out of the room, closing the door behind her. In the full beauty of her nakedness, she returned to the ladies\u2019 salon. She opened the door.</p><p>Marie, Marie! She did not speak the words aloud, but thought them with grave disgust. The chubby prostitute was pumping away on poor Jorge with no rhythm, no finesse, no ... joie de vivre whatsoever.</p><p>She was sweaty, and in a hurry. And poor Jorge ... well, the alcohol had the best of him.</p> <p>He looked up at Louisa, standing in the doorway.</p><p>And he practically threw Marie to the floor. Maybe he did not throw the woman, but she wound up on the floor on her fat backside.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Jorge breathed. Ah, there! He was rising to attention, Louisa thought with some amusement.</p><p>She did, at times, enjoy playing with her food.</p><p>She walked into the room, breasts and hips swaying.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Pieter?\u201d Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cOh ... well, he is down, I\u2019m afraid. No life in the poor fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Jorge breathed. \u201cThere is lots of life in me!\u201d he boasted.</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ...\u201d He paused, licking his lower lip. \u201cThen you ... you do enjoy a threesome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I love a threesome,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She knelt on the floor between Jorge\u2019s legs, and next to Marie. She thought that the woman might have protested, so she reached out and touched her, smiling, and locking her eyes upon the woman\u2019s own. A breath escaped Marie. Louisa let her hair fall over her face as she bent low. A little sound escaped Marie as she teased her flesh ...</p><p>A louder sound escaped.</p><p>Jorge let out something coarse and guttural, reaching for her.</p><p>Which was fine. Marie had already slumped on the Persian carpet. Jorge dragged Louisa on top of him.</p><p>She smiled, meeting his bright-eyed eagerness, hoping that he did not drool.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby ...\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Then she moved in.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, she was sated, laughing, delighted, and feeling ridiculously powerful. Euphoric.</p><p>Glutted! The two lay next to her on the carpet, eyes staring to heaven.</p><p>\u201cOh, my pets, my pets!\u201d she said, stroking the hair back from each cold face. \u201cI do, I do, I do enjoy a good threesome.\u201d</p><p>She was thus engaged when she heard her name called. And sharply.</p><p>\u201cLouisa!\u201d</p><p>She looked up, startled, instinctive fear clutching at her heart.</p><p>A man\u2019s form was silhouetted in the doorway to the ladies\u2019 salon.</p><p>Brent awoke, startled and still, yet uncertain of where he was.</p><p>He cursed himself silently, realizing where he slept.</p><p>He stood, dusting himself off, angry with himself, and yet asking at the same time just what else he could have done.</p><p>Morning light had not yet come.</p><p>So much for standing sentinel...</p><p>He stared through the darkness, toward the house. All seemed well, and when he closed his eyes and concentrated, he felt nothing but the stillness of the night.</p><p>But something had to be done. Today.</p><p>Chateau DeVant held the key.</p><p>Look at what you have done! At the mess that you have made!</p><p>Safe. She was now safe. And would be powerful again. But his words were still ringing in her ears, and she felt a greater Jury toward him than she had toward any of the silly creatures who had not known her, and had not known who she was. He knew. And he had treated her as if she were an errant child.</p><p>Look at what you have done. The mess that you have made.</p><p>After the plans that I have made; everything that I have done.</p><p>At first, she had simply laughed. Risen in all her glory, slid her hands over her breasts and the length of her torso, relishing the delicious feel of the coat of red she created. Triumphant and amused.</p><p>You\u2019ve found me, at last. I felt you so strongly, and now . . . Come darling, I\u2019ve not left much, but you are welcome to what little remains. I would have saved more. . . I could have kept the girl.</p><p>She was not much, but. . .</p><p>Her sultry, teasing words had meant nothing. Nothing.</p><p>He had walked in impatiently, ignoring the richness of the beauty and the bounty she offered.</p><p>I\u2019d have thought you\u2019d have more sense!</p><p>She\u2019d felt as if she\u2019d been slapped. And she had drawn herself to her full regal height.</p><p>You forget to whom you are speaking!</p><p>And you don\u2019t realize to whom you owe your life!</p><p>Then . . .</p><p>Nothing but impatience, irritation. There was a mess to be cleaned up. There were not many he could trust. There was danger in the city, extreme danger, and he had expected to get so much further before they were discovered, and already, with her carelessness, so many knew.</p><p>And what would they do? She wanted to know. What could they do?</p><p>She didn\u2019t begin to understand, and what a foolish woman. After all that had occurred before, she should have known. They had to go, there was no time; perhaps there were a few things that he could do . . .</p><p>And then, of course, there were the servants. But not as they used to be. She must understand that.</p><p>And still, he did set about doing all that he felt must be done.</p><p>Then, they were away.</p><p>And safe.</p><p>Her temper somewhat ebbed. He had made great plans. They had gone so much awry, and one of the reasons they must be so careful was that those who had caused her return to be less than magnificent must be dealt with quickly. Surely, she had realized that. He was aware of her movements, he had been just steps behind. But so had the others.</p><p>Ah, but, indeed, he had planned, because here she was, in safety, in comfort.</p><p>And when she had lain down to sleep, he had at last knelt by her side, and touched her with the reverence and adoration she deserved.</p><p>Rest.. . and our night will come.</p><p>Rest. .. we are together now, and together. . . we form our own alliance.</p><p>Lips upon her forehead. Tender fingers upon her cheeks. Ah, yes . . . adoration.</p><p>My dearest beauty, we form our own alliance. And there are others, others who are working with us, it\u2019s just that I cannot lose you again, and we must take such care as we gather our strength.</p><p>You must give me time to implement all that I have planned.</p><p>By morning\u2019s full light, Jacques DeVant was awake, and feeling strong.</p><p>He had awakened very early, having been troubled by nightmares. Life had taught him competence and speed in all natural functions, and he was showered, shaved, and dressed in a matter of minutes, and down in his library.</p><p>He pulled down book after book, and he realized, considering himself a dolt, that he had not imagined the scope of what had been going on.</p><p>With his books surrounding him, opened to different pages, he then logged on to his computer.</p><p>Ah, what a wonderful invention!</p><p>The books gave him the past.</p><p>The computer gave him the present.</p><p>He might be an old man, and many of his cronies wanted nothing to do with the confounded machines, but he had avidly learned everything he could about many programs, and about the Internet itself. He could break many codes, enter into many records where the various institutions would assure their clients that their information was totally safe, secure, and confidential.</p><p>Jacques searched very carefully through all the records that he accessed.</p><p>He read them all over slowly, twice.</p><p>Katia knocked on the door and stuck her head in, offering him coffee. He thanked her and agreed.</p><p>Back at work, he made a number of notes.</p><p>Katia brought his coffee, and he sipped it, staring at his information again. He was certain that he was right Yes, yes, he was right.</p><p>He knew what had happened, what had been happening. He could see it all now\u2014the how, the where, the when, the why ...</p><p>Just not the who.</p><p>He needed help. He was old. The Alliance had been weakened by time and the modern world. The new generation didn\u2019t believe. Because they didn\u2019t know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The new generation, ah ...

It was time to get a better grip on what was really going on.</p><p>She was going to the police.</p><p>She showered and dressed, thanked Katia for the cafe au lait and croissant she brought to her room, and determined to leave the house and head for the station in the village.</p><p>Ann had left for work already, Katia informed her.

She had brought him breakfast, and he looked very well and industrious.</p><p>In fact, he looked hale and hearty.</p><p>Katia loved Jacques, and she was pleased.</p><p>Tara warned her again that she was not to let the strange woman in, and Katia informed her that she was not to worry, she had no intention of doing so.</p><p>Tara knocked on the library door. She had to knock twice to get her grandfather\u2019s attention. He bid her enter.</p> <p>She poked her head in. \u201cI have a few errands in the village. Do you need anything?\u201d His computer was open and a number of books were piled around him. He stared at her, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to the village?

She didn\u2019t want to tell him what she was really doing; she didn\u2019t want to be dissuaded from going to the police.</p><p>\u201cWe really need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am always happy to talk with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo talk with me, yes, but as to believing me ... but, this afternoon will do. You will not be gone too long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, I will not be gone long.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, apparently very absorbed in his task. \u201cYou will be very careful, and you will come right back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Grandpapa, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She fought the temptation to tell him that she was over twenty-one and she lived in New York City, had been on her own quite a while, and was very capable.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, barely aware when she closed the door. She called to Katia that she was leaving, but would be back. She hurried to the door then and threw it open, then stopped short with surprise and a bit of dismay.</p><p>Brent Malone was standing at the door.</p><p>\u201cBrent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Tara.\u201d</p><p>She stepped outside, forcing him back on the steps. The door to the chateau remained open, an escape route should she feel she needed it. She meant to be entirely challenging, and was alarmed to feel a warmth churning from somewhere deep inside her. There were a million things she wanted to shout at him. She was equally tempted to reach out and touch his face. He appeared tired, and yet, more compelling than ever. He had not worn a jacket that morning. He wore a long-sleeved black silk shirt and chinos. Showered and shaved, hair tied at his nape, bronzed features grave and arresting. Even when she walked away\u2014which she assured herself she would do\u2014his scent would linger in her memory, and the temptation to touch would remain.</p><p>She forced her voice to be level and determined. \u201cWhat the hell went on last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a few toughs in the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you took care of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did we suddenly have to get out? And why did it seem that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat... I don\u2019t know. That we ran over someone. That someone had jumped on the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And we went back, and we didn\u2019t even see you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m quick.\u201d</p><p>Today, his green-gold eyes seemed veiled.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t come to see you.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back, startled, and admittedly, somewhat dismayed. Was he hoping to see Ann?</p><p>\u201cMy cousin isn\u2019t here. She works, you\u2019ll recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to see Ann, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see Jacques.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply. \u201cNo. No, you are not going to go in and upset my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be upset if he does not see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this talk about vampires! All right, so perhaps you believe that you are among their number. Well, then, you must be invited in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a vampire. And, if I were, Ann invited us all in last night. But that\u2019s far beside the point I need to see Jacques. And I assure you, your grandfather wants to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not let you in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d</p><p>She was startled when her name was spoken sharply from within the house. She turned to see that her grandfather had come to the entry.</p><p>\u201cTara, there is no need to be so rude. Invite Mr. Malone in, please.\u201d Brent Malone arched a brow to her, his expression one of superior amusement. She wanted to hit him.</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa, I didn\u2019t think you should be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense, invite Mr. Malone in. Sir, please, you are very welcome.\u201d Brent extended an arm courteously, indicating that Tara should precede him inside. She shook her head angrily, but her curiosity piqued.</p><p>\u201cI have business in the village,\u201d she said curtly.</p><p>Brent\u2019s face hardened. He looked for a moment as if he would argue.</p><p>\u201cMy granddaughter is insistent upon doing her errands, Mr. Malone. And this time of the morning is definitely the best to be about such business, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Brent Malone stared at Tara and nodded slowly. \u201cFine, sir, we shall speak alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara will be back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, and Mr. Malone will be gone then,\u201d she said. She was irritated with herself as she heard the slight wobble in her words. Yes! She wanted him gone. Since she had first seen him, everything had seemed crazy.</p><p>And nothing was more crazy than her desire to throw herself against him, no, much more than that. She wanted to cast a quick apology to her grandfather, she wanted to forget that she should know anything, that she should be suspicious, afraid, and protective. She simply wanted to take Brent by the arm, insist that he shut up, just shut up about evil and danger, shut up completely, and take her somewhere, anywhere, well, hopefully, private, and just. . .</p><p>Touch her. Consume her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d she said curtly. \u201cMr. Malone, I do assume you\u2019ll be gone when I return!\u201d She marched out to her car.</p><p>As she did so, she knew that Brent Malone entered her house.</p><p>A cold chill swept through her.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Jacques said, staring at Brent. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve known that I was here,\u201d Brent said softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d thought you might be.\u201d Jacques kept staring at him. Then he said sharply, \u201cYes, you are here, and there are others. How many, I don\u2019t know.\u201d An inadvertent spasm shook him. Jacques hoped it wasn\u2019t obvious. Then he realized that his visitor saw everything there was to see.</p><p>But Brent made no comment about Jacques\u2019 evident frailty.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Malone said slowly, \u201cthere\u2019re more here, I think, than we begin to fathom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe years have been kind to you, Mr. Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe years have been long,\u201d Brent said, his tone flat \u201cYears spent... waiting.\u201d There was a note of pain in his tone, and perhaps even hopelessness and confusion. He shook it off sternly, and perhaps, to regain his own sense of strength, he made note of the state of Jacques\u2019 health. \u201cAnd you, my friend,\u201d he said, his tone then soft, \u201cyou have not fared so well.\u201d</p><p>Jacques stiffened. \u201cI\u2019m quite well, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man\u2019s family worries about him. I am stronger than I appear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there more of you?\u201d Brent asked him.</p><p>Jacques waved a hand in the air. \u201cPerhaps. Maybe. But time, you know, the world rushing on. I moved to America. I wrote books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, so I\u2019ve heard. Very good ones. Fantasy, science fiction, the occult. All with a message for humanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve read my work?\u201d Jacques could not help but be pleased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time on my hands.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly the compliment Jacques had expected.</p><p>\u201cThere was not much contact after ... the end. Perhaps the writing was my way to stay in touch with the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... there is none of the old guard about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am afraid not And yet... well, I cannot say right now. Somewhere, the Alliance must still be strong.</p><p>There were more. But the threat was ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe threat has never ended. It has been low, stirring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not as gifted with communication as your kind.\u201d He felt defensive. \u201cBut you\u2014you were there.</p><p>You were late.\u201d</p><p>Brent arched a brow. \u201cYou forget that I was working on an assumption. A hunch, if you will. But there is more here than we\u2019ve seen as yet. I believe that the situation in the crypt was a plan, long and carefully conceived, and that we must find the orchestrator of the plan.\u201d Jacques waved a hand in the air. \u201cCome into the library. I\u2019ll tell you everything I know.\u201d Tara found herself ushered into a small office and seated before a French detective. He introduced himself as Inspector Javet, in charge of the murder case, and asked her to sit. He started speaking in French, but aware of her accent, slipped easily into English. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was a big man, not in the sense of armchair-big or youthful muscle gone to fat. He was simply big.</p><p>Not exceptionally tall, but well muscled and trim, with a surprisingly lean, aesthetically attractive face, dark hair, and very deep, dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cI understand that you have some information to give me about the murder at the crypt, Miss Adair,\u201d he said, folding his hands on his desk and staring at her.</p> <p>\u201cInformation?\u201d she repeated. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ve come here because I\u2019m worried about what happened at the crypt.\u201d</p><p>If he was disappointed that his direct question gave him no aid, he kept the emotion from registering in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle, everyone is worried about what happened in the crypt I\u2019m afraid that if you\u2019ve come here for assurance, you are wasting time for us both.\u201d As she stared back at him, he sighed softly. \u201cI am working on this case full time. We have brought in a man from Paris. Every possible piece of forensic evidence is being collected and analyzed. We are living in modern times where science is most helpful.</p><p>Have you been to the ruins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d The question took her by surprise, and she found herself remembering, vividly and annoyingly, that Brent Malone had repeatedly warned her to keep her name out of the situation. Her grandfather had warned her as well.</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been in the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few days. I have family here.\u201d</p><p>He shuffled through papers on his desk, then stared at her again. \u201cYou are staying at the Chateau DeVant\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques DeVant is my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>That brought another long stare.</p><p>\u201cOld Jacques,\u201d Javet murmured. \u201cTell me, did he send you to the crypt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d she lied quickly, and hoped that her protest was not so strong it betrayed her immediately. \u201cNo, I have always been interested in the history of the area. I\u2019m American, as you\u2019re well aware. We like to go back and find our roots, that kind of thing, you know. We seldom just say we\u2019re Americans, you see.</p><p>Because we all have a background somewhere else. Except, of course, our Native Americans. But most of us say that we are something. You know, Hispanic-American, AfroAmerican, Irish American, French American ... you know.\u201d</p><p>She was babbling. Great And her cheeks were growing red.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Javet said. She wondered if he had grown suspicious. She wondered what he would say if she were to break down and tell him that her grandfather was convinced that evil had been dug up, that vampires were streaking around the village, probably intent upon the great feast offered not just here, but just a shade farther west, in the great populous city of Paris. And that, in her short time here, she had met the strangest people, also convinced of evil, one of whom had been in the crypt at the time of the murder.</p><p>Where she had been as well.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said impatiently, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for wasting your time. But I\u2019m here for an extended stay. My cousin is a young woman who travels in and out of the city daily. Naturally, I am very worried. The papers have done little except describe the murder. Yes, I was hoping to come in here and find out that the police were hard on the case, and that you did have suspects, and perhaps, that an arrest was imminent.\u201d</p><p>Javet smiled at last \u201cPassionate, impetuous, and determined that justice must be done! Yes, you are very American\u2014and somewhat French. I wish I could tell you that an arrest was imminent. I can tell you that we do have suspects. And that we do not intend to rest until the perpetrator of this horrible crime is brought to justice. Now, are you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happier to hear that you have the murderer in custody.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Javet said, \u201cand I\u2019d be happier, of course, if I didn\u2019t feel that there is more that you\u2019re not telling me.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI wish that there was more that I could tell you. My cousin and I went out last night and when we were leaving, I thought that\u2014that we were being followed. That we were, perhaps, intended victims of... some kind of an attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Guerre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what made you feel that you were under attack?\u201d</p><p>She realized just how ridiculous she was going to sound before she spoke. \u201cShadows,\u201d she said despite herself.</p><p>\u201cAh, shadows. A dark street, fear in your hearts,\u201d he pointed out, not unkindly. \u201cWas there any more than just... shadows?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated again.\u201cWe thought we hit something\u2014 or someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? There have been no reports of bodies found in the street this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... we drove back. There was nothing in the street.\u201d</p><p>Javet kept staring at her. She felt her cheeks reddening again. She wondered if she should tell him that they had not left the bar alone, and that their companion had held back, telling them to run. But then he\u2019d want to know who the companion had been, and she would tangle herself further and further into the events in the crypt. It had been foolish for her to come.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have taken your time. I suppose that I did want some kind of assurance. I needed to know that the police were ... doing something.\u201d Javet shrugged. \u201cYou thought we were a poor provincial police, and that we hadn\u2019t the knowledge or capabilities of dealing with such a horrible crime, because we are accustomed to ticketing people who do not come to a full stop at the signs in the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I have said, we have an excellent man in from Paris, a man who is accustomed to this kind of work.</p><p>And we are not so poorly equipped as you might think. We are small, on the outskirts of a great city, but even here, there are things that happen. There is a great deal of countryside. We have dealt with the pathetic remains of murders before.\u201d</p><p>Time to compliment the man, she thought \u201cFrom the moment I met you, sir, I could see that you were a serious law-enforcement officer.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Flattered or not, she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>She decided to move in. \u201cI understand that one of the diggers at the site is the man who reported the crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume he is a suspect.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Javet looked a little uncomfortable. He quickly masked his unease. \u201cHe has been questioned, and is being ... watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is not under arrest\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he may be? Soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that he could have committed the crime, Miss Adair, and as to exactly why, I am not at liberty to say. He has been told, of course, not to leave the area. And I know that he has not done so because we keep tabs on his whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>She wondered just how good the inspector\u2019s information could be on Brent Malone\u2019s whereabouts, since he was at that moment, she assumed, still at her own family home.</p><p>But then, again, she was the one person who knew for certain that Malone was not guilty.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Professor Dubois?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDubois,\u201d Javet said, shaking his head. \u201cTrust me, mademoiselle, we have spoken with Dubois. He calls daily. His concern is not for the man who died; he is anxious to get back into his dig. He has no intention of leaving the area. He hounds me on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were witnesses who saw the professor leave the crypt. And witnesses who saw him reach his home. We are following every lead, and cannot let out every scrap of information that we have\u2014if we ever expect to find the killer, we can\u2019t have him aware of what clues we have found. And naturally, Miss Adair, and this, of course, is no more than you can read in the papers, we believe that someone entered the tomb for the purpose of robbery, and that they did not expect to find a worker still on the site.</p><p>Therefore, he had to the. So I assure you, we are investigating the professor\u2019s acquaintances, though it is true as well that a scholar who has committed his own funds to research may not be aware of the greed of others who allow him to lead them to a treasure trove, and then steal the treasure from beneath his nose. Rest assured, we are investigating.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, feeling that she had been dismissed. She started to rise. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m sorry for having taken your time.\u201d</p><p>He rose as well, and smiled at last. \u201cIt was a pleasant break. Perhaps you will join me again for coffee, and I can keep you up to date on the events when I am not on duty.\u201d His words startled her. His manner had been not just professional, but almost impatient. She found herself nodding in agreement \u201cYes, coffee. That would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will see you out.\u201d</p><p>He escorted her through the office, opening the door for her. His eyes were very dark and unfathomable as he asked her, \u201cIf your tremendous concern for Mr. Malone comes from the feet that you two have met, I would suggest that you be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Miss Adair, that he is a man we are watching. Did you meet in the tomb when he was working, or was your first encounter with the American man at the cafe down the street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him when he was working, of course. We didn\u2019t really meet until I saw him at the cafe the following morning.\u201d That was very close to the truth, and her voice was even, considering the fact that the inspector had taken her so completely off guard. She smiled. \u201cAnd yes, of course, since I have met the man, and read in the paper about his discovery of the body, I am concerned.\u201d Javet nodded. \u201cMiss Adair, you should have mentioned that fact from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re aware that we\u2019ve met, you should understand my concern.\u201d Again, he gave a slight inclination of his head.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should inform you as well that your grandfather\u2019s interest in the tomb is also suspect\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur records indicate\u2014along with the testimony of Professor Dubois\u2014that Jacques DeVant had a tremendous interest in the tomb before it was opened.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy grandfather is in poor health, Inspector. He could hardly hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a man of some means, Miss Adair. And he was adamant about that site not being disturbed. He wrote many letters of protest, to the church, to the government, even to the police station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a scholar, a man of history, and also a very religious man. With sound convictions. But my grandfather is not at all a violent man!\u201d</p> <p>Javet studied her for a long moment \u201cYour grandfather came to be known as a hero of the Resistance, Miss Adair. I assure you, he must have known some violence at one time of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a soldier in a war, Inspector. All men must do their duty at such a time.\u201d Javet shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m merely explaining to you that your grandfather loathed the very idea of the dig, and that he is definitely a wealthy enough man to have had influence on others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would never hire a killer. Ever. And you can bring in every expert from Paris and around the world, and you\u2019ll still never find anything to suggest that he would!\u201d Javet smiled, then stiffened suddenly. \u201cAh, well. Miss Adair, perhaps this gentleman will make you feel a bit better about the situation.\u201d He inclined his head toward someone coming their way, footsteps landing softly on the pavement.</p><p>She swung around to see a pleasant looking, light-haired man with deep eyes and a hard chiseled face.</p><p>Taller than Javet, broad-shouldered, with the look of a long-seasoned police official.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Adair, this is Inspector Trusseau, from the Paris office. Inspector, Miss Adair. The young lady is an American visiting French relatives. The DeVants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d the Inspector murmured. Low-toned, charming voice. He kissed her hand, as if he were a prince rather than a policeman. She smiled, nodding, drawing her hand back. Smooth. Definitely smooth. Very charming smile. Too... suave for a policeman. Maybe not He had very direct eyes, and she found that she couldn\u2019t easily draw her own gaze away.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do, Inspector Trusseau?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWonderful, thank you. How nice that we have met now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, sir? Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, naturally, I intend on paying a visit to your grandfather.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he is such a scholar, of course,\u201d Trusseau said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that he can give me some insight into the crime.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Javet</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told her that Jacques DeVant could come under suspicion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve already told him that suspecting my grandfather of any evil is insanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would go to him simply for help,\u201d Trusseau said politely, smiling and inclining his head in a gesture that acknowledged her defense of her grandfather. Trusseau shot Javet a hard stare that suddenly made Tara uneasy. Yes, the man could be charming, but he could also be hard as nails. Well, that was good. He was here to find a murderer.</p><p>\u201cInspector Javet has suggested quite plainly, I think, that my grandfather paid someone to kill the worker in the crypt, and spirit away the body in the casket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not quite true,\u201d Javet said, his tone irritated. \u201cWhat I meant for you to understand is that all leads are being followed.\u201d</p> <p>Someone called Javet\u2019s name from within the office. He turned, nodded to the officer hailing him, then gave his attention back to Tara. \u201cYou\u2019ll excuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall see Miss Adair to her car,\u201d Trusseau said. He took her arm. There was strength to his hold, and an electricity about him. He was well suited for his job.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really quite fine. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m headed straight home,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall, at the least, bid you a pleasant day, mademoiselle. And may I say that I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll meet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you come to question my grandfather?\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled.\u201cAh, my dear! Just like Lady Liberty, standing tall, protecting the shores of her harbor! Truly, I have heard about your grandfather for ages. Don\u2019t begrudge me this chance to talk with him. When I come, I pray that you\u2019ll be there, and that you\u2019ll invite me in with warmth, and join in the conversation.\u201d She held very still, imagining this hard-core man listening to her grandfather\u2019s tales about vampires.</p><p>Jacques would definitely wind up locked away.</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather is very ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that We\u2019ll not take much of his time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you that when he is resting, we let no one disturb him. No one.\u201d Could she say that in France? Tara realized that she knew little of French law. In the States, of course, they would need some kind of a warrant to insist on speaking with an aging and ailing man. Here, she wasn\u2019t certain. But Ann would know.</p><p>\u201cBonjour, mademoiselle. A pleasure,\u201d he repeated softly.</p><p>He turned to the station.</p><p>Tara found herself alone on the street She had gained nothing, she thought, except greater fears and exasperation.</p><p>Jacques!</p><p>The police were investigating her grandfather! They knew about his interest, and they knew that she had become acquainted with Malone.</p><p>She suddenly hated the man! He\u2019d done nothing but bring trouble and danger into their lives.</p><p>And her grandfather had not really told her everything; he had given her stories about legends and fantasy. And if the police kept investigating Jacques and he talked about vampires and evil, he would surely wind up in a mental institution. Especially with a man like Inspector Trusseau insisting on speaking with him.</p><p>She stared down the block and across the street The doors to the present St Michel had been repaired.</p><p>A few people were entering and leaving, intent on their daily prayers.</p><p>The outer entry to the site remained roped off with yellow crime tape.</p><p>There had to be something more that she could do. There had to be a way to protect Jacques. She felt lost, angry, and a little more than afraid.</p><p>She started toward the cafe, thinking a cafe au lait and a few moments\u2019 thought and reasoning might stand her well. How on earth could she get Malone and his friends away from her household?</p><p>And more disturbing, why was it that, when she was near him, she wanted to forget the basic facts she knew and the sensible, logical thoughts that should be prevailing in her mind? He intrigued her, he had informed her with complete confidence. And, of course, the frightening thing was that it was true, and he did far more than intrigue her. He seemed to have some kind of a mesmerizing hold on her that went far beyond intrigue.</p><p>When she was away from him, she was fine. The closer he came ...</p><p>As she stood there, someone opened the police station door and emerged behind her. She started to murmur an, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d and step away. The greatest sense of cold swept over her. A chill that went far beyond the touch of the breeze.</p><p>And there was no one there. No one at all.</p><p>She frowned, staring at the door that still seemed to be closing. An overwhelming sense of fear seemed to come crashing around her, like a cold wave.</p><p>Why not? Javet and Trusseau both seemed to be after Jacques.</p><p>They were the cops! she reminded herself. Out for justice.</p><p>Malone was the one who had brought fear into her house.</p><p>She decided suddenly that she didn\u2019t need coffee or time to drink.</p><p>She needed to get back to the chateau.</p><p>Brent Malone was there. Alone with her grandfather.</p><p>She should have never left</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Ann stared at the piles of manuscripts on her desk, and sighed. She allowed her head to fall on her desk.</p><p>She was exhausted! They had not stayed out so late last night\u2014in fact, she could have stayed much longer. She had enjoyed herself until...</p><p>She almost laughed aloud. Why had they been so afraid when they left La Guerre? Shadows! How silly.</p><p>Fear had bred fear, and they had then thought that they\u2019d hit something, that something had been on the car, that...</p><p>Malone had stayed behind. Such a good looking fellow. And Tara was all but rude to him. Ah, well, the American from the cafe had been there. Very sexy. Not that she was really ready to tumble into a deep relationship again so quickly, but... well, the fellow was American. And he was giving her the courage and conviction to stay away from Willem.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even know how long Rick Beaudreaux intended to stay in the area. And yet ... um ... he might be just what she needed right now. The attraction was there. Sparks, delicious little tingles of electricity swept through her when they talked, danced, moved together. And that was the thing, of course. It was either there, or it was not It was possible to know a man forever, a man with all the right qualities, virtues, whatever, perhaps even good looking, well employed, mature, kind ... and it would not matter in the least if an attraction was not there.</p><p>The American might not live in Paris, he might not even be gainfully employed, she didn\u2019t even really know.</p><p>But...</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure that she cared. She wanted to see him again. Or, she would want to see him again if she weren\u2019t so ridiculously tired. She could imagine a night teaching him about French wines ... and then time alone. Yes, quite frankly, she didn\u2019t need a dinner, more dancing, or anything. She would love just one night alone with him. And then ...</p><p>Well, she wouldn\u2019t allow for a heartbreak. She would indulge herself because she was out of a relationship, because he had that very sexy quality and the right sparks, and she was a woman with the right to desires and an affair if it was her choosing.</p><p>And, of course, she wanted Willem to know. She wanted him to know that she had forgotten him, could truly live without him, and could be adored and swept into a brief but passionate, absolutely fiery relationship with another man. Even as he tried to make amends.</p><p>But she was tired. So, so, tired ...</p><p>\u201cAnn?\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked up. She blinked.</p><p>The man of her thoughts had suddenly materialized in front of her desk. He was wearing a business suit.</p><p>Well cut, it enhanced his height and his shape. The suit was dark, Armani, perhaps, or Versace, very simply cut, clean, and appealing. He appeared very blond and bronzed in it. And he smelled ... divine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To her dismay, since she did consider herself a logical and businesslike, competent and assured woman, she stuttered.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur Beaudreaux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2014how did you get in here? Without being announced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke to the receptionist outside. Told her that I was trying to surprise you, take you to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch,\u201d she murmured, afraid that she sounded a little stupid, as if she didn\u2019t comprehend the word in English.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, maybe a surprise wasn\u2019t such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s lovely that you\u2019re here,\u201d she said, quickly collecting herself. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about going to lunch. I have stacks of work, and I\u2019m afraid that it hasn\u2019t been my most productive day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe a break will get you going.\u201d</p><p>She stood up. The hell with work. She gave her job eighty hours some weeks.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you are right\u201d</p><p>She collected her purse. The weather was beautiful, a little cool, but sunny. She didn\u2019t need a jacket She walked around her desk. He took her arm, smiling. A warm, wonderful smile.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWherever you would like to go.\u201d</p> <p>A discreet hotel room, she thought. But she didn\u2019t say the words out loud. His smile deepened, as if she had.</p><p>She was delighted as they passed by the outer offices of the very contemporary Paris high rise. The receptionist and a few workers were about They watched her with envy.</p><p>She paused by the receptionist\u2019s desk. Henriette, young, pretty, and now, somewhat bug-eyed, apologized quickly. \u201cAnn, the gentleman said that he was an old friend and wished to surprise you. I should have rung through...\u201d She paused, looking a bit perplexed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I didn\u2019t, and I hope ... I guess ... that it\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Henriette, it\u2019s all right\u201d She glanced at Rick. \u201cMy old friend and I are going to lunch. I may run a bit over. But I\u2019ll be back for the art meeting this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Henriette,\u201d Rick said. He smiled at the receptionist Ann could almost see Henriette\u2019s heart flutter.</p><p>Then Beaudreaux took her arm. The electricity shot through her arm.</p><p>They walked to the elevator. Others were leaving for lunch. She felt their eyes, and knew that she and the American made an attractive and appealing couple.</p> <p>They reached the street.</p><p>Rick looked down at her. Dear God, what wonderful, powerful blue eyes he had. She couldn\u2019t have looked away if she had desired to do so.</p><p>He asked softly, \u201cSo, where would you like to go?\u201d</p><p>She met his eyes, and answered simply and honestly.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere ... anywhere ... with ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She\u2019d meant to say, with a nice salad and warm bread.</p><p>Somehow, those words eluded her.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere with ...\u201d he prodded in a warm whisper.</p><p>She let out a long breath, her eyes still locked with his.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere with a bed,\u201d she said.</p><p>The library door was closed when Tara returned. She ignored the fact, and, without bothering to knock, walked in.</p><p>Her grandfather was behind the desk.</p><p>And, as she had surmised from the battered old BMW in the driveway, Brent Malone was still with him.</p><p>He stood, leaning over her grandfather\u2019s shoulder, as Jacques made marks on a map of the area.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cStudying a map of Paris and its environs,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Her grandfather was looking up at her, too. He didn\u2019t appear particularly frail\u2014rather, his cheeks were flushed, and his excitement in his work was apparent</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave,\u201d she told Brent</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d Jacques said firmly.</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather has been very ill lately. If you tire him, he could well have a relapse of pneumonia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d Jacques repeated.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is time that I left,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cI have told her exactly what is happening,\u201d Jacques refuted firmly.</p><p>\u201cYes, but she doesn\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms over her chest and walked to the desk. \u201cIf you have come here to further encourage my grandfather in his belief in vampires, you are certainly not welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t believe,\u201d Brent said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhether she believes or not, they exist,\u201d Jacques said, \u201cand she must not interrupt our work.\u201d Malone gave her a shrug. \u201cWell, then, I guess you\u2019re the one who has to pitch in and help\u2014or leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you actually believe in vampires? In real demons that rise from the dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome are demons, and some are not,\u201d Jacques said.</p><p>\u201cHowever, Louisa de Montcrasset may definitely be described as a demon,\u201d Brent told her. His eyes were level on hers. He might have been agreeing that there was definitely going to be rain in a day or two, or that, yes, winter always followed autumn.</p><p>Infuriated, and more than a little unnerved, Tara turned on her heel and walked out of the room. The temptation had been to grab Brent Malone by the hair, drag him out of the room, and throw him out of the house.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have the capability. And she was afraid that touching him would be dangerous.</p><p>As she left the room, slamming the door behind her, she nearly tripped over Eleanora. The shepherd had come to the door. She didn\u2019t try to slip past Tara and run into the room; she stood still, as if she were an ancient Egyptian guard dog, sensing the death of the Pharaoh.</p><p>\u201cEleanora, come, let\u2019s get away from here,\u201d she said, stooping to pat the dog.</p><p>But though she didn\u2019t growl or protest Tara\u2019s touch, she didn\u2019t move, either. And she didn\u2019t jump all over Tara with excitement, as she was prone to do, remembering her every time she came and left, no matter how long she stayed in the States.</p><p>\u201cEven the dog has gone mad!\u201d Tara muttered, striding across the hall and heading for the stairs. She continued to her room, needing to be somewhere she could pace and explode without making matters worse for her grandfather.</p><p>She entered her room, slammed the door, then locked it. She began to pace, and tried to make herself slow down. She had just done the worst thing possible. She had come home and lost her temper instead of sensibly explaining to them both that corpses didn\u2019t rise up and kill the living. Greedy people, those with their own agendas, committed murder. And some people were cruel, heedless of human life, and some were psychotic and very sick. That\u2019s why terrible things happened. She should have humored them, she should have kept a level tone and a level voice.</p><p>She threw herself down on the bed, pounding the mattress in sudden fury. She closed her eyes tightly, shaking her head, wondering what the hell to do.</p><p>Did she go back down and have another fit, force Malone out of the house? Or did she go back and try to be calm, rational?</p><p>As she lay there, she became aware of a peculiar odor. Looking up, she saw that garlic bulbs had been hung over the doors to the balcony. For a few moments, she just stared at the new adornment in her quarters. This is too much! she thought.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been in my room!\u201d she exclaimed aloud.</p><p>That was it. Tara jumped to her feet and ran back down the stairs. Eleanora remained before the door.</p><p>When she strode toward it, the dog rose. To her amazement, the massive shepherd growled at her.</p><p>\u201cEleanora! It\u2019s me, Tara, what on earth is the matter with you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The dog held her ground, proud brown eyes razor sharp.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re guarding Grandpapa, you\u2019re guarding him from the wrong person!\u201d And still, the dog refused to move. Tara took a step to reach over her and pound on the door. The dog began to snarl with a warning sound once again.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she yelled furiously.</p><p>A moment later, the door swung open. Brent looked at her, and at the dog. \u201cSilly girl,\u201d he told the shepherd, patting her head as if he were the animal\u2019s master. \u201cIt\u2019s Tara. She wants to come in. It\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>As gentle as a kitten, Eleanora moved aside, sliding down for a nap by the wall. \u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to join us?\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to wring your neck! What the hell were you doing in my room? Why is there garlic over the doors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in your room,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t put garlic over your doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two whispering about?\u201d Jacques called out.</p><p>She passed by Brent, standing before her grandfather\u2019s desk. \u201cThere\u2019s garlic over the doors to the balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou put it there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not. Katia put it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. So Katia believes in vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatia has an open mind, and knows that the world in its entirety is not always plain and visible to the naked eye,\u201d Jacques said.</p><p>She turned away, flinging herself into the ancient armchair between her grandfather\u2019s desk and the large hearth. She made a steeple out of her fingers, staring at her grandfather. \u201cJacques, a man was brutally murdered in a tomb. A tomb that you didn\u2019t want opened. That you went to great pains to keep from being excavated.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her.</p><p>She leaned forward, ignoring the fact that Malone was in the room.</p><p>\u201cJavet! Inspector Javet. Do you know that they suspect that you might have paid someone to kill that worker to keep any more work from being done at the crypt?\u201d Jacques was not in the least concerned. \u201cJavet!\u201d he said, dismissing the man with annoyance.</p><p>\u201cAnd not just Javet! The inspector from Paris may be questioning you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you went to the police,\u201d Jacques said. He was angry. He shook his head with tremendous disappointment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe police are the ones who investigate murders,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>Brent sat on the edge of her grandfather\u2019s desk, neither angered nor amused. \u201cThey investigate disappearances as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cAs of today, up to seven people have disappeared in the past few weeks, reported to the main station in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisappearances\u2014of who? And what do the disappearances in Paris have to do with a brutal murder here, in the village? Jean-Luc didn\u2019t disappear. His body was butchered and left for discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaula Denton, British student, a beautiful young woman, last spoke with her family over two weeks ago, telling them she\u2019d be leaving Paris for home that night Next, reported about ten days ago, John Bryner, an American. He was due at a school in Nice, and never showed up. Jillian Grieves, a Parisian prostitute, hasn\u2019t been seen in nine days. Barbara Niemes, another prostitute, has now been missing nearly a week. The list goes on\u2014the known list. God knows how many people have disappeared who don\u2019t have family members who track them\u2014or street sisters who are still able to prove their love by looking for their friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStudents have disappeared\u2014young students, running around Europe. And prostitutes,\u201d she said.</p><p>Brent raised a brow. \u201cOh? They don\u2019t deserve your concern?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd!\u201d she lashed out. \u201cNaturally, they are human beings, and deserve everyone\u2019s concern.</p><p>But students roam through Europe all the time. And prostitutes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cProstitutes with drug problems always return to their supply,\u201d Jacques said with a sigh.</p><p>She stared from one man to the other. They both stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get it. They\u2019ve all disappeared because of\u2014 vampires.\u201d Neither one of them said anything or moved a muscle.</p><p>\u201cVampires are supposed to drink blood, they don\u2019t consume every inch of a body,\u201d she said. \u201cIf vampires had taken these people, their pathetic, blood-drained bodies would have been discovered.</p> <p>Their grieving families would have buried them, and then, they\u2019d have risen again and there would be more vampires, and more vampires, all coming out of the walls like cockroaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires drink blood, yes,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cThere, you see?\u201d she told Jacques.</p><p>\u201cThey also mean to survive, and therefore, they don\u2019t leave discarded bodies lying about They\u2019re also territorial, and seldom fond of competition. They rarely create new members of their own kind. There is actually a code by which they survive,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cA code. A rule book. The Vampire Rule Book. Sorry, I haven\u2019t read it yet\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a book, Tara, and you can\u2019t read it But there is a society, and it\u2019s ancient and there are codes and laws by which the creatures exist\u2014and have existed throughout time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you dug up this countess, and now she\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a vampire before I dug her up. But yes, now she\u2019s loose,\u201d Brent said.</p> <p>She stared at him, then lowered her head, shaking it \u201cYou knew my grandfather before you came here today,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara\u2014\u201dJacques began.</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cYou came here, Malone, way before any of this, and you filled my grandfather\u2019s head with a lot of rubbish. You got him to lodge protests about the dig, and because of you, the police are going to wind up questioning him. You are the instigator of this nonsense, this fantasy, you\u2019ve convinced him that he\u2019s part of some kind of an alliance, and what you\u2019ve done is dragged an ailing man into a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not an ailing man who has lost his mind, young lady!\u201d Jacques said with level dignity.</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t look at Jacques. She thought she was beginning to piece it together. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your game is, Mr. Malone. Maybe you\u2019re a writer, too.</p><p>Some kind of a critic, out to malign Jacques, or make your own name somehow through him. Whatever your game is, though, it is over. I\u2019m going to go straight back to the police and tell them everything I know.\u201c</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that, Tara,\u201d Brent said. His voice held either a soft menace, or a simple promise.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill me? Do you, perhaps, think that you\u2019re one of them? That you\u2019re a blood-sucker yourself?\u201d</p><p>Staring at her, he blinked, but his eyes didn\u2019t fall from hers. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, thank heavens for that, at least What a relief. I\u2019ve yet to see one of these creatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have seen one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the other night. Countess Louisa de Montcrasset was here, at this door, when you and Ann returned home. And you must sense far more than you\u2019re willing to admit, because you weren\u2019t foolish enough to let her into the house.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to protest instantly, to assure him that she simply never let unknown visitors in to see her grandfather.</p><p>But something had settled over her ...</p><p>A chill.</p><p>And she was afraid that, somewhere, deep inside herself, she was going as mad as they were. Because somewhere, deep inside, she was almost believing the insanity.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m right,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cListen, Tara,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to tell you about this, to make you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d She stared at both of them.</p><p>Then she flew out of her chair. \u201cNo!\u201d she cried angrily. \u201cNo! I will not believe any of this absurdity, and Mr. Malone, I will get you out of this house!\u201d She stood before her grandfather\u2019s desk. \u201cJacques, how can you let this man play with your mind this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not be a part of it,\u201d she said, and turning, left the room.</p><p>Ann lay with her eyes closed, sleek and sated as she had not felt in... all her life. She curled into the pillow, so aware of the man at her side, and smiling because her thoughts were so cliched: she felt as if she had died and gone to heaven.</p><p>They had chosen one of the loveliest hotels in Paris, despite the feet that she had come out only for her lunch hour.</p><p>Luxurious. Clean sheets, drifting white curtains, windows that led out to a beautifully planted courtyard, the slightest touch of an autumn breeze ...</p><p>She turned, burrowing against the formidable wall of his chest, running her fingers over the mat of fine, golden blond hair. They had sated the initial urge for simple appeasement, taken things slowly, swiftly, slowly again, and now\u2014far later than she had ever imagined and still not at all willing to rise and leave and return to work\u2014she was fascinated by exploring the man who had walked into her life like a cataclysmic shift in the earth. She frowned, noting as she ran her fingers down the length of his arm.</p><p>Though well healed and barely visible, she realized that there seemed to be a great deal of scar tissue on his body.</p><p>\u201cThe accident,\u201d she murmured softly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She rose over him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, and yet so glad that it brought you here, to Paris.\u201d He smiled, putting an arm around her, pulling her closer. \u201cIt was quite a while ago now,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was caught in a fire. Um ... let\u2019s see, I was out with friends. And while they escaped it, I was trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey left you?\u201d Ann said, indignant that anyone would leave a friend to such a fate.</p><p>\u201cIt was a strange situation,\u201d he told her, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s over now.\u201d His tone was light, but it seemed that there was something in his eyes. Maybe a deep-seated bitterness, one that he didn\u2019t intend to forgive. She could hardly blame him.</p><p>\u201cYou must have been burned very badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m healing, and have been healing.\u201d He ran a finger down her arm, bringing a tremor to her limbs. \u201cTell me more about you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell. You know where I work, what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but... what about your personal life? This has been a rather mad rush of a lunch hour, don\u2019t you think? Is there ... anyone else out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live with my family,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His magnetic smile deepened. \u201cI meant, is there someone else in your life. Another man. I have to admit to being head over heels, and jealous as all hell, and yet I can\u2019t imagine that a woman such as you wouldn\u2019t have a lover in her life somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t pull away from him, but withdrew a little into her thoughts, amazed that not a single thought of Willem had come to her until Rick had specifically asked. She had thought herself so wounded by Willem so deeply in love, and so determined to be strong against him....</p><p>Rick inched a shade closer, as if he were trying to assure her that he meant to give her so much more than the taste of flesh against flesh. \u201cThere is someone?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere was, just as I\u2019m sure there have been many others in your life,\u201d she said with a wry shrewdness.</p><p>He merely smiled. \u201cThere is no one now, I can assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can say the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about this man you were seeing?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cWillem. He\u2019s the head of sales for my company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Scary for me. You see him on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, only for meetings. And it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Rick said, his gaze sweeping over her. Then he added, \u201cNo ... that\u2019s far too indefinite. I intend to make it so.\u201d</p><p>Ann relished the husky sound of passion in his voice. \u201cReally?\u201d she teased. And added a bit breathlessly,</p><p>\u201cI am just dying to see what you do with your\u2014intentions!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, I intend to keep you a bit longer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should go back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet...\u201d he said.</p><p>And within seconds she was convinced that she needn\u2019t go back at all.</p><p>There were other signs that the household was far from a sane one. As Tara went by the front door, she noticed that the little basket on the old oak stand near the front door, which was customarily filled with flowers, now held numerous small bottles. She paused to pick one up, studying it.</p> <p>They had come from Notre Dame, and were filled with holy water. Exasperated, Tara set the little bottle back in the basket and continued out of the house. She walked to the stables, but realized when she entered that old Daniel had been let into the pasture. Even as she stood deep within the structure, staring at Daniel\u2019s empty stall, she felt Brent\u2019s arrival. She turned to find that he had come in after her, and seemed to be blocking the exit.</p><p>It was as it had been that first day in the crypt. At first, he seemed just a shadow, a silhouette. Far larger than real, a presence that eclipsed the entry, the daylight beyond, the world. And she felt again the same sense of fear, and she almost closed her eyes, as if she could hear the scream from within the tomb once again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to the police, you know,\u201d she said from her distance. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them that I was in the tomb, and that I saw you there. I\u2019ll be honest, of course, and tell them that I know you aren\u2019t the murderer. But I\u2019m going to make sure that they know you are a very frightening and dangerous man, and that you\u2019re the one urging my grandfather into ... trouble and madness.\u201d He didn\u2019t reply. He walked in. He was no longer a dark silhouette against the daylight. He was a man again. He seemed no less menacing.</p><p>She had meant for her tone to be certain, hard, and a sure warning, but she could hear her own words echoing back at her and they were uncertain and halting.</p><p>She took a step back.</p> <p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re dangerous. And you think you have some kind of hypnosis or magnetism and that people will believe your ridiculous words and lies. But we\u2019re not all so easy.\u201d He was still walking toward her, lean, smooth, agile, and now, as the silence in the stables and the shadows seemed to surround her, he didn\u2019t seem as lean and lithe. In her mind, his shoulders grew with each step. He was coming to slip his hands around her throat and throttle her. He\u2019d been charming at first, more than intriguing, as she had admitted to herself. But he had some strange agenda, and now, he was simply going to kill her.</p><p>There was a pitchfork stuck into a pile of hay bales behind her to the left. She saw it clearly from the corner of her darting eyes. As he took another step, she dodged back, dragging the tool-to-be-a-weapon into her hands, and before her, a warning that she would strike if he came any closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to use this!\u201d she said, and managed to make the threat a real one.</p><p>Still, he merely smiled, but actually paused for a minute. Then he told her, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to skewer me with a pitchfork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will\u2014I swear that I will. Now, I want you off this property, and away from my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, Tara.\u201d</p> <p>He kept coming toward her. Though she now held her weapon, and knew that she did have the strength to use it, she backed away, watching him with wary, narrowed eyes as he slowly, confidently, took each step.</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit that you\u2019re insane. You need help,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She could use it, would use it...</p><p>\u201cYou know that I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat there are vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that I\u2019m telling the truth, because you were there. You heard the cry in the tomb. And you knew when you left La Guerre that something was following you. You knew it. You knew that there was danger in the shadows. There was something that you couldn\u2019t see, but you could feel it And when you came home, and that woman was at your door, you knew there was something wrong. You stopped her from entering.\u201d</p><p>He was just feet away. She cursed herself, but felt the strange magnetism he exuded, and she denied.</p><p>Felt his gaze, the strange gold color of his eyes that was really just hazel, but seemed able to touch and burn as surely as any yellow flame of fire. She willed herself to move, mentally arguing against every word he had said to her. A killer was loose, it was natural to be wary when a killer was loose, she hadn\u2019t been feeling any supernatural warnings of danger beneath the surface of light and shadows . ..</p> <p>\u201cGet away,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He reached out a hand. \u201cGive me the pitchfork.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the wooden handle. She bit her lip, desperate to hold on, to prove him wrong. But she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from his. Her heart was hammering, and it seemed that every breath was an effort.</p><p>\u201cYou are definitely your grandfather\u2019s descendant,\u201d he said very quietly. \u201cAnd you are stubborn and strong-willed. But you are going to give me the pitchfork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not all that wonderful,\u201d she whispered in return. \u201cDon\u2019t think that you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am right, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to give it to me.\u201d She didn\u2019t intend to do so, but as he took the last step, when she should have pulled her arms back and tensed her arms to strike, she found that her limbs did not seem to be obeying the commands of her mind. Rather, her hands began to tremble, her arms to shake, and slowly, slowly, against her will, she began to extend the weapon to him.</p><p>His hands grasped the handle, and the pitchfork was his. For one wild moment, she thought that he meant to turn it on her, to strike and send the tines of the tool shooting into her abdomen and chest.</p><p>He flung the weapon far from him. She saw that strange glow of fire and gold in his eyes, and he came closer, now reaching out for her. She wanted to scream. The sound froze in her throat.</p><p>She had completely forgotten about work. As Rick Beaudreaux lay next to Ann DeVant, he propped himself easily on an elbow, and watched the woman at his side.</p><p>Such a beauty. And so easily his.</p><p>Ann DeVant. A woman so very important And so ...</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Time had fled, minutes to hours. And yet...</p><p>Still time before dusk. She did need to rouse, and return to work. He glanced at his watch, reckoning the arrival of dusk. Twilight. And then the night.</p><p>He ran a finger down her arm, leaning over her. His whisper delicately touched her ear. \u201cI hate to say it, but it\u2019s late, you know. I... want more of your life, so much more, but... I don\u2019t want to cost you your job.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, rolling, moving against him again. Her arms locked around his neck. \u201cI know, and I\u2019m such a practical person. Why is it that I hate to leave you so much?\u201d He smiled, holding his weight above her. \u201cI promise you, I will be around,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIn fact, you\u2019ll be amazed. You won\u2019t be able to get rid of me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled beautifully in the contours of her face. He drew his fingers gently through her hair.</p><p>As he bent to kiss her, he smoothed a lock from her face.</p><p>There ... on the side of her neck, usually hidden by the fall of her dark hair, were two little marks.</p><p>Just pinpricks ...</p><p>Barely visible to the naked eye.</p><p>He stared at them a long moment...</p><p>\u201cRick?\u201d</p><p>He drew her into his arms.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>That evening, Yvette Miret was off duty at five.</p><p>And at five, she was definitely ready to go home.</p><p>Paul had come by at three that afternoon. They had been planning to go to a rock concert in the city that evening.</p><p>But now, the rock concert was off, mainly because Paul was such an ass.</p><p>Yvette had known Paul since she was a girl. He\u2019d lived down the street in their little village. He was a friend.</p><p>But Paul didn\u2019t see any farther than the borders of his father\u2019s farm. Yvette didn\u2019t intend to spend her life working with sheep, or feeding the men who herded them, at the crack of dawn every morning of her life.</p><p>Though she had encouraged Paul at various points in their stormy years together, she had also told him several times that she did not intend to settle down in the village. She was going places, and she didn\u2019t particularly care what she had to do to get there.</p><p>There had been a group of British students by that day, too; handsome men on holiday from their university. She had been flirting, laughing, and dropping napkins on the table with her phone number.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized that Paul was across the street, just outside the police tape that still roped off the outer entrance to the old church dig, and that he was watching her. Just as she delivered a second round of drinks to the table, he had come storming over, gripped her arm, dragged her to the wall and called her a whore and a slut. At the end he shouted to her, \u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry! You\u2019ll be so sorry for the way you behave toward me\u2014 you bitch!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d longed to slug him, really hard, right on the jaw. She could feel the blood rising to her cheeks.</p><p>But then, the owner had come out to yell at Paul. He had been duly chastened, but she had been threatened with losing her job.</p><p>And worse than anything, the whole scene had been distasteful to the British boys, and they had departed without so much as an extra franc left on the table. The cocktail napkins with her phone number remained beneath their cups. It was so humiliating she could have cried on the spot, but she\u2019d also been furious.</p><p>Paul had called almost exactly an hour later, apologetic. But then he told her that she would wind up becoming a prostitute right on the street if she didn\u2019t watch herself; he knew about the many times she had picked up customers, and met them at their hotel rooms late at night She would come to no good, and it hurt him, really hurt him, because he loved her so much. She thought of him with his wild brown hair and eyes, his endearing face. Somewhat of a handsome face, but too young, too naive for what she really needed from the worlds.</p><p>And he was wrong\u2014she was attractive to other men, really attractive, and they didn\u2019t all just use her and walk away. She refrained from asking him how he thought she acquired her designer coats and boots, and the earrings and jewelry she sometimes wore. He would only have worse things to say about her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone call left her even more furious. \u201cNo, Paul, I do not forgive you,\u201d she told him, \u201cand we will not be going to the concert together. We have to end it all now, right now. I do not love you. You stink of sheep, do you understand? You stink, stink, stink, of sheep, and I can\u2019t stand it!\u201d She had hung up. Of course, she was upset all over again, because customers\u2014and her boss\u2014heard the conversation.</p><p>She begged pardon from Monsieur Francois, who had been patient with her many times, she knew, because she was so popular with the customers. He grunted, and she explained that she\u2019d needed to be cruel to be kind\u2014 she hadn\u2019t wanted young Paul living with illusions and coming to make a scene at the cafe again.</p><p>Monsieur Francois did not fire her. She wondered if any of her regular customers would stop by, anxious to see if she needed company when her work shift was over.</p> <p>No one stopped by. Feeling irritable and annoyed, she rued the fact that she hadn\u2019t brought her car that day, and that she had a very long walk home.</p><p>As she started out, she felt the nip of a wind. She hadn\u2019t brought a coat, only a little cashmere sweater.</p><p>She hugged it around her shoulders, and started walking.</p><p>Darkness came so early! she thought It was fall, of course, but not yet winter. Yet as she walked, it seemed that a true winter chill settled over the road. She hadn\u2019t worn her good work shoes, either, but had worn little heels today, planning to change into the low-slung jeans in her bag for the concert in the city. The roads in the village were rough, and twice, she stepped down hard on stones and nearly twisted her ankle.</p><p>She cursed Paul as she walked.</p> <p>Then ...</p><p>From the darkness, she saw the glare of headlights, coming along the road.</p><p>She moved aside, certain that after a day like today nobody would be kind enough to give her a ride.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>The car drove up beside her.</p><p>She hesitated, remembering that there had been an awful murder right across the street from the cafe.</p> <p>But then, what did she have to do with a silly dig in an ancient crypt? She walked over to the car and looked in as the passenger window was rolled down.</p><p>Her heart leaped.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you out here. All alone. It\u2019s cold. Why are you walking alone in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I broke up with my boyfriend today,\u201d she said with a sigh. Her cheeks were flushing. A bold sense of excitement was growing inside her. The day was not so bad after all. She had not imagined that he, this incredible man, would come by. And he liked her. He found her cute, naive, charming. He didn\u2019t really know her, but then, did it matter? She knew that he was attracted to her.</p><p>And she was more than a little attracted to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that Come in, and I\u2019ll give you a lift\u201d</p><p>Thrilled, she opened the door, and slipped into the car. A nice car. She should have known that he would have a new model automobile. Sexy, smart</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for stopping,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He pulled onto the road immediately, waiting a bit before replying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure\u2014my extreme pleasure,\u201d he told her. Her hand lay on her knee. He covered it with his own. \u201cYou\u2019re such a lovely young woman. That fellow is a cad to have left you to walk home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was best,\u201d she said softly. \u201cReally. This has been coming ... we just aren\u2019t... well, we just aren\u2019t going in the same direction in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor girl,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMy house,\u201d she told him, \u201cis about a mile down, on the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You\u2019re not going to go home and cry all night alone, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, it was actually better that this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>They passed the road that led to her house.</p><p>\u201cYou missed the turn,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did so on purpose. I think I should take you for a glass of wine, cheer you up.\u201d She tried to keep her eyes on the road ahead, and not to show her absolute elation. \u201cThat would be lovely. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>The countryside could be very dark at night Yvette frowned, wondering where they could be going.</p><p>They had driven so far that she could think of little that was out here. Mainly, ruins of places abandoned after World War II, countryside, and more countryside.</p><p>And sheep.</p><p>It seemed that everywhere one went in this wretched place, there were sheep.</p><p>The car moved onto a rutted dirt road. She was thrown next to him. His arm came around her, then his hand fell on her knee to steady her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWith you ... well, I feel just fine.\u201d He flashed her a white and fascinating smile. She stared at him, wondering if she was falling in love. He could have taken her anywhere, done anything. She\u2019d never felt such a rise of fascination and excitement</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked after a moment She didn\u2019t feel the slightest fear; she was merely puzzled.</p><p>\u201cRight here. Come along.\u201d</p><p>He parked the car.</p><p>They were far past the pasturelands, she saw with relief. Into the forest At first she couldn\u2019t see anything at all. Then she saw an edifice in old stone rising before her. Once, the place had been a chateau, something fairly grand, she thought, but it had been abandoned long ago. There was muted light from within, but she had barely seen it at first, the windows were so overgrown with shrubbery and ivy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really quite nice inside.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get out of the car, but stared ahead, a faint unease suddenly coming to her. But he stepped out and came around, politely opening the passenger side door for her. He reached in and took her hand.</p><p>\u201cCome, my lovely little Yvette.\u201d</p><p>She still felt the unease. But she was so aware of his hand, the way it felt where he touched her, and she was completely fascinated by his voice. She allowed him to draw her from the car. And as she stood before him, he drew her close, holding her to him gently, the suave lover of her dreams. His fingers moved over her hair. \u201cMy lovely, lovely, little Yvette,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She leaned against him. She could have stayed there forever. Had he wanted her to strip then and there in the dirt, she would have done so.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She looked up at him and nodded. His hand moved then, over her face. His knuckles brushed her chin.</p><p>She realized that she was staring up at him like a complete novice, lips parted, breath coming far too quickly ... she warned herself not to be a dolt. That she must be mature with this sophisticated man, that she must not seem too easy, and too eager.</p><p>Apparently she stumbled. They moved through the overgrown path to the house together, he supporting her. He opened the door, and they entered.</p><p>It was indeed beautiful within, if somewhat dark. A fire burned in a large hearth, and candles glowed from numerous tables about the large entry. The place was old, very, very old. She stood still, looking around her.</p><p>The candles created massive waves of shadows. They seemed to whisper, to dart about, to change angle, substance, and form with each flicker of the flame in the large fireplace.</p><p>The slightest unease touched her again ...</p><p>But then, his hand fell to the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d he told her.</p><p>The hallway loomed dark before her. Alarm still rang somewhere within her, but she was equally convinced that she could do nothing but keep going. If she willed her legs to turn her around, to run, they would not do so. But she didn\u2019t will it. She longed for the seduction of his whisper, his words, his touch.</p><p>\u201cHere, my dear, my lovely, lovely, Yvette.\u201d</p><p>They turned from the hall through a doorway. The room was magnificent. A huge carved bed was in the center. Another fire burned in a smaller hearth. Shadows played with little spurts of flame against the walls. A silver tray with a decanter of wine and crystal glasses awaited.</p><p>\u201cWine, my dear?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He walked away, pouring from the decanter into a glass. He brought her the wine, and she drank.</p><p>As she swallowed it, she closed her eyes.</p><p>And as she did so, a sense of panic suddenly filled her. For when her eyes closed, she still saw the place around her. And it seemed that it was filled with winged creatures. Demons with horns, with forked tongues and tails, and all in shades of flame red.</p><p>She opened her eyes, ready to discard the wine, to scream, to run at last...</p><p>But he stood before her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here, beautiful Yvette, because we hunger,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSoon, you\u2019ll know what is wanted of you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. His hands were on her shoulders. He stared into her eyes, then turned and moved toward the fire. She was hot, so hot, and knew what was wanted of her. She shed the horrible shoes and then bit by bit, the cashmere sweater, her silly underwear. It might be strange here, even scary, but she had never wanted anything more ...</p><p>She crawled atop the massive bed with its mound of pillows on silken sheets. She stretched out on it luxuriously, a feeling of her own sensuality sweeping over her. This was so different, so exotic, so unlike anything she had ever known before ...</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment to experience the smooth sensation of cool sheets and roaring fire.</p><p>But she was afraid she would picture eerie things in her mind once again and so she quickly opened her eyes.</p><p>And he was there, as magnificent and beautiful as he had ever been, far more real than the tricks of her mind, and coming toward her, standing before her.</p><p>Then, he stepped aside. There was someone else there as well.</p><p>Yvette started to scramble back on the bed, puzzled, horrified, and then angry.</p><p>What had he expected of her?</p><p>But he was ignoring her, his total concentration on the third party who had so silently joined them in the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI had thought we\u2019d dine in tonight,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>Then he did look at her.</p><p>Yvette started to scream.</p><p>And scream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And strangely, the last thing that crossed her mind was the rueful reminder of what Paul had said to her today. \u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry, you\u2019ll be so, so sorry!\u201d</p><p>Javet was hard at work, studying the lab reports from the Paris office on the forensic studies done in the tomb. Despite the incredible advances science had afforded law enforcement, there were times when science could still offer nothing, because there was nothing to offer science.</p><p>Every drop of blood tested had belonged to the victim. Not that there had been many drops of blood left. And there was the first mystery.</p><p>That\u2019s when intuition came in. A police officer\u2019s gut intuition.</p> <p>There had been dozens of people in the tomb\u2014 workers, onlookers. Footprints in the dust and fingerprints could mean everything\u2014and nothing. Javet hated Dubois, but hating a man didn\u2019t make him guilty of murder.</p><p>He drummed the desk, then let out a long sigh.</p><p>Two things: Dubois needed to be questioned more strenuously.</p><p>And it might be time to arrest Jean-Luc\u2019s coworker.</p><p>\u201cInspector!\u201d</p> <p>He looked up from his desk. Millette, one of the his finest officers, was standing at his door, looking in.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a report just in from Edouards, sir. We\u2019ve found a body by the Eau Gallie stream.\u201d Millette\u2019s tense appearance told him there was more to it than that</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Javet said. \u201cMan, woman, child? Is there an evident cause of death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman. The coroner has just been called. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe victim was decapitated.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to die, Tara determined.</p><p>Not then, at least.</p><p>And with the pitchfork cast aside, she suddenly found herself moving forward, drawn inexorably toward her enemy, practically throwing herself against him. She was shaking still, ready to scream or cry and again deny every bit of nonsense this man was telling her.</p><p>But she was glad as well to feel the steely heat and security of his arms as they came around her. A voice of warning still screamed within her, but it was overshadowed by instinct and desire; since she had first seen him, this was where she had wanted to be. She was like a moth who had flown straight into the burning flame, but after a moment of being there\u2014feeling enwrapped, ridiculously safe, and more than willing to simply melt into the fire\u2014she drew away, staring at him again.</p><p>\u201cYou used me to get to my grandfather,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I would have come to your grandfather no matter what after the night in the crypt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to him before the night in the crypt\u2014 you\u2019re the one who convinced him that there are vampires lurking around Paris.\u201d</p> <p>He angled his head slightly, watching her. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk to him before the night in the crypt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met\u2014before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long time ago. Having nothing to do with the current situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is my grandfather\u2019s part in this travesty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a member of the old Alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this Alliance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an organization that\u2019s very, very old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. The members of this Alliance are like Freemasons\u2014who believe in vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re guardians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuardians of... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumanity, the sacred right of life. Good over evil. However you wish to phrase the terminology, that is the role of the Alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when was this Alliance formed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has been mention of the Alliance\u2014sometimes obscure\u2014in writings that go back to the Dark Ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, hearing his words, denying them still in her heart, and forcing her tone to be as rigid and scathing as any law official might utilize. \u201cAnd you\u2019re part of this Alliance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is your role here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the outside,\u201d he said softly, then shrugged. \u201cI had heard rumors about the dig at the church, and through various legends and tales, I knew the rumors about Louisa de Montcrasset. I\u2019ve studied a great deal of French history. I took the job with Dubois to make sure that I would be there when the coffin was opened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you ran into me instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She started to walk by him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel compelled to hound and protect me because I happened to be there at the time\u2014or because of my grandfather.\u201d He caught her arm.\u201cI am compelled to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t, not yet, anyway. But the fact that you feel I\u2019m hounding you ... well, that has nothing to do with your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>She stood very still, torn between her desire to cast him off, to run away, and to throw herself against him once more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Once again, she paused. Then she could pause no longer. Outside, the day had gone. Within the stables, the shadows were misting and thick, yet they offered no hint of menace. She slowly took a step toward him, and even more slowly, reached out to touch him. Fingers and palms coursed over the shape and structure of his face. She edged ever closer to him. He held very still, allowing her the exploration. Then she found herself pulled into an embrace so close that it defied the thin barrier of cloth between, found that she was being kissed with an open-mouthed passion that rendered her instantly reeling, blood rushing hot to every extremity, hunger suddenly something that shuddered and thundered with every throbbing beat of her pulse. She kissed back, lips and tongue aggressive, nearly desperate. His mouth drew the total focus of her attention, his kiss in the shadows, in the midst of the stables in the growing mist of the night She was heedless of her own reckless movements, drawing ever closer still, fingers upon his shirt, seeking buttons, shoulders shrugging from the constraints of her own silk blouse. Then there was a moment of total, staggering awareness when his hand first fell upon her naked flesh, at her waist, fingertips traveling along her rib cage, palm and touch molding over her breast She made little sounds, desperate little sounds. She wasn\u2019t sure when she lost everything else\u2014 shoes, jeans, undergarments-\u2014only that there was a trail along the scattered hay and grain on the stable floor, leading to the soft stacks of hay. Shadows and mist... both of which had been tinged with shades of danger just the night before, now seemed like a surreal blanket of the sweetest privacy. He threw horse blankets over the bed of hay, and as she came down upon it, she felt as if she had never known a softer mattress, never lain upon a surface so welcoming. He was everything she had sensed from the beginning, smooth, sleek, agile, so tightly drawn and hewn, flesh searing, each movement vibrant, every brush against her body by every part of his like an awakening of fire and need and more, a coming together destined by eternity. Something she had waited for all her life.</p><p>He was a practiced lover.</p><p>His mouth moved over the length of her. Subtle, seductive, aggressive. She drifted on waves of sensation, inhaling the rich clean scent of hay, and that of the man. There were moments so intense and acute she lost all thought except that of the carnal pleasure, and there were those brief seconds when she thought she had lost her own mind, because nothing would ever be the same again, she could never be touched so again, so completely that the liquid spiraling heat could enter and touch what was ethereal as well as flesh and real, and that she was desperate for cataclysmic union with a madman, and no one could ever make her want or hunger in the same way again. And yet, in those brief moments of sanity, there was something deeper as well. The birth of her own madness, for she knew as well that, somewhere in her heart, in the depths of her soul, she was very, very afraid that she believed ...</p><p>Then all thought was gone again. She burned from the center of her being to every extremity, felt the red flame of hunger lapping at her ferociously, intimately, lips, breasts, thighs, sex, stripped, bare, throbbing, waiting. Then they were together at last, in shadow, in shades of fog. She was entwined, tight, surging, close, shuddering, trembling, straining. He seemed to fill her, a part of her, hard and strong, and she longed then never to let go, hungering and desperate, yet ruing the very explosion she sought so fervently with every twist and surge.</p><p>In the end, the night itself seemed to conclude with them, shadows burst to light, darkness to implode, mist to shatter into crystalline motes. Again, the rich scent of the hay came to her, along with the dampness of her own flesh, and at last, the prickles of the hay piercing through the blankets here and there. Reality. The stables, the night, her nakedness, her arms twined around the bare muscled torso of a near stranger.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter. There was no going back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say then.</p><p>That didn\u2019t matter either. He was the one who spoke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s full dark,\u201d he said, and kissing her forehead, he rose. \u201cI have to go.\u201d Ann stopped back into the office for only a moment. Henriette had gone, and most of the workers were leaving. She didn\u2019t care that she might face a severe reprimand from the publisher for missing the meeting.</p><p>She spent extra hours in the office every week. She took work home every night of her life. She was good at her job, and she knew it, and she would defy anyone who said differently.</p><p>The art director popped his head in her office. \u201cYou missed the meeting,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014we decided on the plain design and coloring for the new American novel that had been your suggestion. It was no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Ann said. \u201cThat sounds great. lam sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI think it\u2019s the first meeting you ever missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He walked away. Ann moved around her desk and pulled open her top drawer, looking for a rubber band to bind a manuscript to take home with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere the hell were you?\u201d</p><p>She looked up.

Willem hadn\u2019t been part of their meeting today anyway\u2014unless he had decided to horn in on it just to make her miserable.</p><p>\u201cIt is my business,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014because I love you. And because there is a crazed murderer out on the streets of Paris.\u201d She snapped the rubber band around the manuscript. \u201cYou don\u2019t love me. Certainly not as much as you love yourself. You\u2019re merely aggravated because you\u2019re not so wonderful that I\u2019m willing to take you back after you\u2019ve made a fool of me. And because I might have other interests in life. And there is a greedy murderer out there who wanted to steal the riches from a corpse,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cExcuse me.</p> <p>I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you must wait.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhy, Willem, why must I wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t be led astray right now, Ann. This is a dangerous time in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem, it is dangerous for me to care for you. And the amazing thing is that as much as I loved you, I\u2019m over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn, I am begging you to forgive me a moment\u2019s folly that meant nothing, that was nothing. The girl asked for help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cWell, you see, I\u2019m afraid there may be so many more women out there who might need your help in the future! Now, I\u2019m tired. I want to go home. Excuse me.\u201d For a moment, she felt real fear that he wasn\u2019t going to allow her to pass through her own doorway.</p><p>Then he stepped aside slightly. She meant to march by him, head high, indifferent. She was afraid, though, that he was going to be like a bridge\u2014closing upon her just as she crossed it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t exactly \u201cclose\u201d upon her, but he did stop her, his fingers closing around her upper arm.</p><p>\u201cWillem\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn, you are a silly little fool. And you don\u2019t realize that you are mine, and that I will prove it to you, very soon.\u201d</p><p>Absently, she drew her fingers over her neck, thinking that a stray strand of hair was irritating her flesh.</p><p>\u201cLet me by.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head toward hers. \u201cNo, my love, you\u2019ll see. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood night, Willem,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>As she walked out of the office, she was afraid. She knew that he remained where he was, watching her, until she had left the reception area, and closed the door behind her.</p><p>She quickly pushed the button at the elevator, looking over her shoulder, more afraid of him than she wanted to let on.</p><p>The elevator door opened. She entered the little cubicle, leaning against the back wall. The door wasn\u2019t closing.</p><p>She stepped forward to hit the lobby button once again. But as she did so, Willem stepped into the elevator.</p><p>She backed away. The door closed.</p><p>\u201cSo, Ann,\u201d he breathed softly. \u201cHere we are. Alone.\u201d</p><p>There were things that he could touch in the twilight period between sleep and wakefulness, when day gave way to dusk, and dusk to full night.</p><p>Things he could see.</p><p>Images.</p><p>That night, he saw her, walking along the street, aware, and yet still seeking those who had called her.</p><p>Hungry.</p><p>He saw her ... saw the two men and the woman in the street, and her smile as she joined them, taking the bottle of wine, and then taking the lead. He could even see the street signs as she led her companions through the city.</p><p>He saw the old house, saw her work her will as she prepared it, and saw her practice her art of seduction, amused, and yet...</p><p>Thirsting.</p><p>He saw her tease and play ...</p><p>And then he saw her as she came in to kill.</p><p>And kill again.</p><p>The images faded as he felt something else. A call, a warning. Words that came to him through the channels of his mind.</p><p>They have touched her, reached her.</p><p>Who?</p><p>Ann. Ann DeVant. But I will follow. I will follow.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Katia was serving her grandfather dinner in the library when Tara returned to the house. The housekeeper busied herself getting another setting for Tara, bustling about as she did so.</p><p>Tara stood quietly waiting for Katia to be done, watching her grandfather, not speaking. Then she frowned suddenly, remembering the time.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Ann? She should be home from work by now.\u201d</p><p>Jacques shook his head. \u201cShe called and told me not to worry. She took a long lunch break today and had to clear up a few things in the office before coming home.\u201d Katia smiled at Tara, seeing her frown. \u201cMais oui, Tara. She is just running late. She wanted to make sure that Jacques went ahead without her. He must eat. He must keep his strength up!\u201d Katia touched her on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tara. Roland and I have the house and grounds all locked up. We\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Katia left the room. Tara kept her eyes on her grandfather as she took a seat by the side of his desk where her plate had been set. She started to speak, but Katia knocked on the door, bringing in a bottle of white wine to accompany their fish.</p><p>When Katia left again, Tara at last spoke. \u201cI still believe that this entire thing is insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsane, perhaps, but true,\u201d Jacques said firmly. He took a bite of his fish and seemed to savor the taste.</p><p>\u201cKatia is an excellent cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques, excuse me, but I have to tell you. There is a vampire loose in the Paris area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, pausing for a sip of wine.</p><p>\u201cThere is no vampire loose in Paris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. There are vampires loose in Paris,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cI thought Louisa de Montcrasset was the vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is indeed a vampire. But we are quite certain now that it was not happenstance that she should be dug up after all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014that would be you and Brent Malone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And of course, there are others. On the side of good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d she murmured, still watching him. \u201cHis friends, of course, are on the side of good.\u201d Jacques nodded solemnly, as if he was relieved that she was understanding the situation at last.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI do believe that there are very strange things happening. And your friend, Brent, has something of a quality about him that is very ... that induces trust But I still don\u2019t really understand the connection. You didn\u2019t see him here, in Paris, before you became so worried about the dig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do know him. I mean\u2014you knew him ... before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She felt as if she was trying to pull teeth. \u201cOkay, so when did you meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jacques frowned. \u201cHe followed you out to talk to you, to try to make you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014he had to leave. Rather quickly,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met years ago, here in France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... you were living in the States years ago.\u201d</p><p>Jacques shrugged, giving his attention to the fish. \u201cFrance has always been my home, I\u2019ve always come and gone,\u201d he said, his eyes not meeting hers.</p><p>\u201cBut years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may be a bit older than he appears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet?\u201d</p><p>Jacques waved his fork in the air. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now. But yes, you see, I knew him before. Just as I knew before that vampires did exist. But the last time there was real trouble ... in which I was involved, was long ago. Around the time of the war. And back then ... there were many in Europe who believed, who knew, and there were many who were part of the Alliance. But the war ended, the world went on.</p><p>New wars came with new weapons and the world became so sophisticated and high tech that people forgot I forgot. And those I knew... those I knew well are gone now. But there will be a new generation, and times change, things change, people change. Even the undead change,\u201d he murmured thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cBut Jacques\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am to help them with the country, you see. There is a lair, somewhere. And they have keen senses, of course. But there are so many ruins in this area. So much abandoned and left to return to nature! The Alliance has always been there to know, you see. At one time, there were no powers on the darker side who could really be trusted. But as I said, the world moves on. And the sanctity of life, all life, or existence, whatever it might be, has surfaced, oddly enough, even among the technical mumbo-jumbo of the world today. Even above the fanatics and the insanity of some people who are human\u2014and merely evil. You were right the other day, you know. There are human beings more evil than any imaginable demon. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the dark powers aren\u2019t out there, and that they aren\u2019t cruel, careless, and brutal as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques, you\u2019re still not making any sense to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe important thing is that you believe we\u2019re in danger. That no one is allowed entry to this house.</p><p>Katia knows in her heart that there is evil. She doesn\u2019t ask questions; she secures this home where we live. We\u2019ll move forward with our own investigation, and take care while we are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques, what I told you earlier is true. The police are suspicious of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are welcome to question me. I am a good and innocent man.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhat they need to do is incarcerate Dubois. I am willing to bet that he bears more guilt in this\u2014oh, he\u2019s not the murderer.</p><p>But he is working for the vampires. Bribed, he will serve them, believing in the rich rewards they will give him. The man is a fool, and always has been a fool. His reward will be death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tara broke off as there was a tap at the door, and Ann stepped in. Her cousin seemed more ashen and gaunt than ever, yet she was smiling and seemed cheerful. \u201cI\u2019m home\u2014I just wanted to let you know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m going straight to bed.

You have hay in your hair.\u201d Tara reached instinctively for her hair, seeking the hay, as she felt her cheeks burn. \u201cI, uh, yes, I was out at the stables.\u201d</p><p>Ann was too distracted to do more than nod. \u201cThere\u2014you\u2019ve got it. Hay all gone. Oh, well, love you both, I\u2019m going up to bed.\u201d</p><p>She blew them kisses, then turned away.</p><p>They heard a growl.</p><p>\u201cEleanora! Bad dog. It\u2019s me, Ann!\u201d she heard her cousin say.</p> <p>She turned to her grandfather, frowning. Jacques had put down his fork. His hand, resting on the table, trembled.</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa?\u201d Tara said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, I\u2019m all right But I think I must get to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Roland for me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away.\u201d</p> <p>Tara went out and found Katia who immediately called for Roland who came and smiled and gently assured Tara that Jacques was fine, just worn out It had been a very long day for him.</p><p>She promised her grandfather that she\u2019d be in to say goodnight.</p><p>She helped Katia pick up the plates in the library, then wandered up the stairs, thinking she would check on Ann before saying goodnight to her grandfather.</p><p>She tapped at her cousin\u2019s door, and when there was no answer, she opened it, popping her head in.</p><p>Ann\u2019s room was dark. Her cousin was already in bed.</p><p>Tara silently walked into the room.</p><p>The balcony doors were open. The garlic bulbs had been impatiently cast into a pile in the corner of the room.</p><p>Tara hesitated, trying to discern her cousin\u2019s features in the darkness. Ann was definitely and soundly sleeping.</p> <p>Tara decided that it couldn\u2019t hurt to close the balcony doors and replace the garlic. She did so, then tiptoed out.</p><p>She went into her grandfather\u2019s room. He was in bed, and like Ann, appeared to be sleeping. His eyes were closed. Tara thought of his great age, and his tenacity and passion for life\u2014and determination that he was part of the Alliance, a Resistance fighter for good against evil.</p><p>She kissed his forehead, checked his balcony doors and the garlic hung above them, then crept out.</p><p>She was tired herself, but restless, and her mind was moving with incredible speed. Aware of her afternoon, longing to go back over each moment, yet not wanting to think and analyze tonight, she drew out her easel and pad, and sat with pencils to sketch.</p><p>Disturbing pictures flew from her fingers onto the page.</p><p>Images ...</p><p>A churchyard, stones askew, graves split open. She stopped. Another sketch. A wolf. Huge, snarling, teeth gleaming, massive, hard.</p><p>A bat... flying like a shadow overhead.</p><p>The shadows then covered a Paris street, the path they had walked on the night she and Ann had gone to La Guerre.</p><p>She paused, then began to sketch again.</p><p>A man\u2019s face ...</p><p>She frowned. She had drawn someone she had met. She couldn\u2019t quite place the image she had created with her subconscious mind.</p><p>She glanced at her watch. Late. Time to shower and get some sleep. The tension that was tightening within her seemed to warn that the day to follow would be long and hard. She went in to shower.</p><p>Bits of hay still clung to her clothing. There were a few more fragments in her hair. The scent of him seemed to linger about her.</p><p>She went to bed thinking that it was still true that she barely knew the man. And yet, if he were to walk out of her life as suddenly as he had appeared in it, she would be disconsolate.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to walk out of her life so quickly. He believed in vampires. Believed that vampires were killing in Paris ...</p><p>She tossed and turned, and at last fell into a fitful sleep.</p><p>Lucian drew the car to a halt. \u201cNear here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Brent got out on the passenger side. \u201cLooks like a lot has been abandoned in this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Lucian pointed to a street sign. \u201cI saw that sign. Clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>Lucian did. They came to a house set back from the street. A fallen board stated one French word for condemned: CONDAMNE.</p><p>Brent followed as Lucian crawled over the sign.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re too late, of course. Way too late.\u201d</p><p>They stood in a foyer. Before time had rendered the structure dangerous, the place had been beautiful.</p><p>There were delicately carved wall panels. The ceilings were covered with now peeling and fading frescoes.</p><p>They were both quiet for a moment, listening, waiting. Brent nodded toward Lucian, and moved to the left.</p><p>He came to a room where a recent fire was down to cold ash. He stood in the center of the room for a moment, then moved toward the once ornate sofa. He stooped down.</p><p>Droplets ...</p><p>Possibly wine.</p><p>But not He reached out and touched one of the tiny stains. Dried blood.</p><p>A sense of danger seemed to grip him. He rose quickly, striding back through the elegant foyer to the other side of the house. Lucian was there, black-coated back toward him as he inspected the contents of a desk.</p><p>Brent didn\u2019t know what he had been sensing. He started to walk toward one of the draperies.</p><p>A sudden scream of rage tore through the dark silence of the house.</p><p>The creature, naked, wild-haired, wild-eyed, lips snarling and fangs barred, came shooting from the draperies like a whirlwind from hell. Brent was still at a distance. The creature was flying toward Lucian.</p><p>Brent took a step forward, pulling the sharpened stake from beneath his coat. The dirty, grotesque figure that had once been human could move like lightning. And still, he could move faster. His speed was natural, honed through the years.</p><p>Lucian turned. The vampire was but inches away, intent on slashing and biting, when Brent impaled it from the back. The thing wasn\u2019t dead. Caught on the wooden spike, it thrashed and screamed in a frenzy. Brent pinned it to the floor, and bent down, avoiding the teeth. He gripped the hair. And ripped.</p><p>The head came free.</p><p>There was no blood.</p><p>Lucian crouched down, studying the body. He looked up at Brent \u201cThat was quite clean and neat. I was really all right, though, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to destroy your own kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose were the old rules,\u201d Lucian said bitterly.\u201cThe world, and the rules, have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there are any more here,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Lucian held still, then shook his head. \u201cThey wanted us to be here\u2014they meant this one as a sacrifice.\u201d Brent squatted down at Lucian\u2019s side, studying the face on the dismembered head.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, the features are so distorted ... but there\u2019s something familiar about this man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope he wasn\u2019t a friend,\u201d Lucian murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not an old friend. But still... there\u2019s something familiar about the face. Or would be if... I don\u2019t know. Hopefully, it will come to me.\u201d</p><p>Lucian looked around the room. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t exactly a setup, but I have a feeling this fellow was left here on purpose. They know we\u2019ll track them down eventually. Maybe they\u2019re hoping to at least wound us, take us off guard. Rather insulting, however, to think we might be taken by such a raw and stumbling new recruit\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t have much else,\u201d Brent suggested.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be someone behind this who has known and tasted power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about your enemies. There must be a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few? Hundreds, I would imagine,\u201d Lucian said. He studied Brent. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only think of one, and that was a very long time ago and he is dead. But you\u2019re right. There\u2019s nothing else here. We need to start moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Ann was hot. She tossed off the covers. The room suddenly seemed stifling and filled with a wretched and horrible odor.</p><p>She sat up and looked around. The damned garlic was back at the windows. And the balcony doors were closed.</p><p>Impatiently, she got out of bed and walked to the doors, throwing them open. She pulled the garlic from the top, wincing as it seemed that the bulbs had thorns, as if they were roses, and they hurt her. She threw them as far from the open doors as she could and stepped out on the porch.</p><p>Ann.</p><p>She heard her name. Or didn\u2019t hear it She felt it Ann...</p><p>It was like a caress. The breeze, oh, it was the breeze! So good against her skin. It felt as if she were being held again, teased again, kissed and touched, all over her flesh.</p><p>Ann...</p><p>Yes!</p><p>There were fingers in the wind. Fingers that moved over her. They seduced and beckoned. And each time the breeze whispered her name, she felt it anew.</p><p>Ann...</p><p>Yes, yes.</p><p>Come! Come to me.</p><p>Yes, yes, of course . ..</p><p>Officers Surrat and Martine were driving down the street, cursing the lack of light, when they saw the pair.</p><p>\u201cGeorges!\u201d Martine said to his partner. \u201cThere\u2014 two men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see them,\u201d Michel Martine replied, and he depressed the gas pedal further, then jerked the patrol car up on the curb, cutting off the two men on the street</p><p>\u201cIs it him?\u201d Georges Surrat asked his partner. Martine was an older man who had worked in Paris for years before being transferred to the village a decade ago. Surrat was young, and just learning the ropes.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s him. Brent Malone. The American digger. Javet wants him. Careful, he might be dangerous.</p><p>Remember the corpse in the crypt?\u201d</p><p>Georges nodded grimly, reaching for his side arm as the two simultaneously got out of the patrol car.</p><p>\u201cBrent Malone!\u201d Michel Martine spoke, his voice hard and determined. He\u2019d dealt with a hell of a lot on the streets of Paris. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And not even all that had prepared him for the corpse in the crypt at the church, the headless torso they had discovered that day.</p><p>\u201cBrent Malone! You\u2019re under arrest.\u201d</p><p>The two men had stopped. They stared at one another, and then at the officers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the charge?\u201d Malone asked.</p><p>Martine felt strangely unnerved. Neither man appeared armed\u2014but then, they were wearing ankle length coats. They were both big men, very tall.</p><p>\u201cMurder,\u201d Georges said. His voice sounded quavery. Not good, he thought They were the police.</p><p>Though the pair they accosted were impressively sized men, they had made no outward moves to suggest danger or resistance.</p><p>\u201cJavet knows that I\u2019m not guilty of murder,\u201d Malone said, frowning.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a warrant out for your arrest, Malone, and that is that. The bodies are piling up, so if you\u2019re innocent, perhaps you can prove it in jail.\u201d</p><p>Malone stepped forward. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry. I can\u2019t afford for you to arrest me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Martine drew his side arm up, aiming for Malone\u2019s heart \u201cMonsieur, you are under arrest for the murder of\u2014\u201d</p><p>He suddenly found that he had stopped speaking. He found himself looking past Malone to the other man. Then he lowered his gun, dizzy. He was going to black out!</p><p>He stumbled back, falling against the patrol car. He shook his head, clearing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMichel!\u201d Georges called out frantically.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold still, close your eyes, take a breath!\u201d</p><p>Michel had done so already. He blinked, and was greatly relieved to realize that he had vision again.</p><p>Vision ...</p><p>With nothing to see. The street was empty.</p><p>All around them, he saw nothing but shadows.</p><p>From somewhere, however, came a chilling sound. A deep, elongated cry in the night.</p> <p>A howling ...</p><p>The night\u2019s chill suddenly surrounded him. The shadows seemed to be encroaching, like something alive.</p><p>\u201cGet in the car!\u201d he commanded Georges. \u201cGet the hell in the car!\u201d Later, back in the light and bustle of the main square, he felt sheepish. He looked at his partner. \u201cWe never saw anything tonight, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Georges stared straight ahead at the road. \u201cNot a thing, sir. Not a damned thing.\u201d The strangest thing about the dream was that she knew she was sleeping, that she had entered a nightmare realm, and that nothing here could be real.</p><p>But it felt real.</p><p>She was moving from darkness into light, but the light would never become really bright. The dark, she believed, was the safe realm of sleep, where, if she did dream, it was of moments gone by\u2014simple things, strolling down a country lane, walking along the streets of New York, doing something so mundane as trying to capture the exact mood and feeling she wanted for a canvas, with the paint perhaps disappearing each time it seemed she had touched the paper with the perfect tone. The darkness was deep sleep, restful sleep, a place that was safe. Strange that a shadow realm should promise such a land of peace, while the light...</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t sunlight, not the light of day, or even the friendly light of a street at night flooded with neon.</p><p>It was different. Muted, eerie, yellow light tinged with something that threw everything within it askew.</p><p>And there was a breeze. Not a soft, gentle breeze that wrapped around the flesh and touched with an air of freshness, not a breeze that lifted the hair as tenderly as a touch. The breeze had a chilling element Not like the wind, not like the cold of winter. It was a chill that seemed to reach with hard and bony fingers, and close right around the heart, and perhaps the soul.</p><p>She was walking, walking forward from the safety of the darkness into the unknown dread that would be so readily visibly in the odd and evil light She didn\u2019t want to go, and indeed, tried to turn back. And it wasn\u2019t so much that the evil reached in and dragged her out, but rather that she knew she must go forward. It was imperative that she see whatever horrors were to be discovered in the realm of the macabre; she knew only that she must move forward.</p><p>For the longest time she simply moved, aware of the chill, aware of the evil. She moved with caution, yet wondered why. She could see her bare feet take step after step, but there seemed to be nothing beneath them. She could feel the silk of her nightgown wrapping around her with the breeze, the fabric itself made cold by the touch of the unlikely wind. Her hair pulled behind her, blown out around her, tangled and whipped, and she could feel each strand as it touched her face. Her fingers were cold, her hands knotted and unknotted with tension, and she could take note of each and every sensation around her. Color ...</p><p>the color of her nightgown was light blue, almost ethereal in the yellow glow. Her toenails were painted ochre.</p><p>And the house ...</p><p>At last, she stood in the woods, and the glow was coming from a house. There was ground beneath her feet now, earth, grass, stones ... a path. A little trail, heavily overgrown, that led to the door.</p><p>Her feet hurt as she moved forward. She could hear her own exclamation as she stepped on stones and cried out softly in pain. Then, it seemed as if she first stood some distance from the house, staring at the thick, heavy old door.</p><p>Before she realized she had taken a step, it suddenly loomed before her. She was there. She wasn\u2019t certain she had come willingly, but she was there.</p><p>The knob was cold in her hand as she reached for it Brass. Rounded. More than cold. It was icy.</p><p>The door seemed to move, to shudder inward, then outward, as if the house itself were breathing.</p><p>Whispering...</p><p>Come in, do come in, please . .. we\u2019ve been expecting you.</p><p>The voice of sanity in her mind called out with valiant, determined, effort. No, no, no! It\u2019s what they want you to do! Don\u2019t go in, don\u2019t go in . ..</p><p>She stilled the voice, because there was another. I have to go in. I have to go in, and find out what is behind the door. I have to go in for Jacques. I have to go in, because ... the truth is within the house . . . somewhere.</p><p>And it\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right if I go in, because it\u2019s only a dream.</p><p>Her fingers closed tightly over the knob. She twisted, pushed the door open, and the squeaking, creaking sound it made was like the sound of fingernails raking across a blackboard. She could hear it so clearly.</p><p>And then ...</p><p>Candles ... oh, Lord! Candles burned everywhere. They were tiny accents to the fire in the hearth that seemed to roar as loudly as the door had creaked. The warmth was intense, and yet, oddly enough, it seemed that the breeze had followed her in, and she was chilled and warmed, all in one. The flames in the hearth flickered blue, green, yellow, gold, and intensely red. The large flames leaped and danced in a frenzy, as if bowing to the breeze. And all around her, the candles burned with flutters, leaps, and bows, as if they too danced to the same whispered beat.</p><p>Gargoyles and grotesques lined the hearth, sat upon the newel posts to the staircase at the end of the room, and graced the arch over the long hallway that went off to the side, where the yellow light seemed to dim with shadow. Not a welcoming shadow, not the warm darkness of safe sleep, but a shadow that wavered and played in strange shapes.</p><p>She found herself walking toward it. She paused, staring up at the archway. A horned grotesque seemed to escape its inert stone boundaries and come to life, hissing and spitting down at her as she moved along. She looked up at it, and knew that it could not come down for her, yet neither did she dare come too close to it. From the hearth it seemed that she heard more\u2014 spitting, cawing, harsh, cackling laughter that was suddenly only a whisper, a sound that might have been the breeze, or the dance of the fire ... but was not.</p><p>But was not.</p><p>She looked down. The hardwood floors had been strewn with woven runners in shades of crimson, black, and gray. Battle scenes were depicted. Tartar armies defeating their foes, slicing them down in a frenzy of death. As she walked, the characters beneath her feet seemed to come to life. The victims shrieked and wailed.</p><p>Blood curled beneath her toes.</p><p>She looked up, and straight ahead. The runner was playing with her, creating fear. She had to look ahead, straight ahead. The night was illusion, she thought The house was a house. The gargoyles were fashioned of stone, and they did not move.</p><p>Yet still...</p><p>There was that laughter. Deeper than any whisper. It became a pulse, a beat... like a heartbeat. A heart that beat too hard ...</p><p>The hallway beckoned.</p><p>She walked.</p><p>Doorways creaked open as she trod through the hall. She heard the eerie creaking sound as they parted, as the little rays of evil light seemed to escape from each. She came to the first It was barely ajar. She didn\u2019t want to look in, but she knew that she must. If she didn\u2019t look, it had made no sense that she had come.</p><p>She had to do it She had to know. There was truth here, somewhere.</p><p>She pushed the door open.</p><p>And she saw ...</p><p>There were bodies ... body parts ... torsos... heads ... limbs. Strewn about As she stood there, they seemed to form together, as if drawn by unseen tendons or ligaments. Furious arguments began to take place in whispered anger. Let go, you\u2019ve got my foot! That\u2019s my hand! And then, one of the heads rolled to connect to a neck, and the lips moved in the mottled, bony, gray, sexless face. Give me what is mine! Give me what is mine!</p><p>The eyes of the creature suddenly locked upon Tara. The lips began to move. The tongue was swollen and black, and as it moved, blood began to trickle down the decaying chin. Why, Tara, you\u2019ve come!</p><p>Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m right? He must give me my own legs. I was never fat before, and I\u2019ll not take his fleshy little knees when my own are right there... where are my arms? I must have my arms.</p><p>The better to hold you, my dear, the better to draw you to me. I must have my hands, the better to touch you. To stroke your neck. What a lovely, lovely, neck ...</p><p>The thing was almost all together. limbs danced and angled awkwardly across the room, intent on completing a full body. And the eyes ... the eyes were still on her, the lips were still moving, whispering her name. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Almost, Tara, almost . . . oh, Tara, Tara, I\u2019m close, so close, you can almost feel my breath against your flesh, your long lovely throat. . .</p><p>She stepped back into the hall. The thing was quickly, quickly, melding together. She turned to back down the hallway, return to the great room with the hearth, find the door and escape, but there was something there. Something enormous and dark, winged, clawed, taloned, and more evil than anything she had thus far witnessed. She knew that she could flee into that shadow, and it was the shadow, not the light, that had beckoned her.</p><p>Called her, to trap her. The huge winged shadow began to whisper. Oh, yes, my dea r, you\u2019ve been trapped. That ancient mind</p> <p>has fallen prey to self-confidence, and you have come. You have come, when you should not have done so. You have left that place where you should have been, a guardian, a sentinel. And so now, you, too, will lose, don\u2019t you see? I will have those you love, no, actually, I have them now, and in the end, you will come as well. . .</p><p>She started to scream, as loud as she could, hysterically, somehow aware that she had to be loud, louder than the fire and the wind, louder than all the cackling, and the whispers like drumbeats. She had to close her eyes tight against the darkness, force herself to know that it was a dream, only a dream, and that she could awaken. She had to awaken, had to awaken ...</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d</p><p>She was jerked up, suddenly aware of pain, very real pain, in her upper arms. Her eyes flew open.</p><p>There was no house. She was in her own room.</p> <p>She blinked. She had thought she was in her own house, but she was staring into Brent Malone\u2019s golden hazel eyes, eyes that burned with an intensity like the flame in the house of evil. His fingers were wrapped so tightly around her flesh that she\u2019d be bruised in the morning. And she was screaming, had been screaming, was still screaming, and wildly trying to fight against him, to free herself from his hold, lash out again and strike him, flail against him, anything.</p><p>\u201cTara, stop!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the command in his tone, but the very softness of it that brought her to a trembling rationality.</p><p>The sound faded.</p><p>She had ceased to scream.</p><p>A nightmare. It had all been a nightmare, because all they talked about was vampires, and the Alliance.</p> <p>\u201cTara ...\u201d He moved a hand tenderly against her hair to soothe her.</p><p>She stiffened, mistrustful, even as she felt the urge again to throw herself against him. \u201cIt was a dream,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly a dream.\u201d But she was still trembling fiercely. And he was there. She closed her eyes, and leaned against him, and felt the comfort and warmth of his arms around her.</p><p>Then she stiffened again, drawing back. \u201cHow are you here? How are you in my bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came back,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important. You have to tell me about the dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she insisted angrily. \u201cHow did you get in?\u201d</p><p>He let out an impatient sigh. \u201cI knocked on the door. Katia let me in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201d she charged, but then, looking past him, she saw that Roland, Katia, and her grandfather were standing in her doorway, ashen, looking in on her.</p><p>\u201cOh ...\u201d she breathed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ve awakened you all ... and it was just a dream.\u201d Jacques, looking frail in his pajamas, his feet bare, pressed past the other two and came to her bedside.</p><p>\u201cTell us about the dream, Tara.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. It was fading, but it was still too vivid. \u201cI was at a house. In the woods, I think. I didn\u2019t want to go in, but I felt that I had to. There was a huge fire, there were gargoyles that came alive.</p><p>And there was a hallway, and I knew that I had to go down the hallway. Then there was a door, and there were body parts in the room, but they weren\u2019t parts, because they started to come together, and the lips in a head were moving. The thing was talking to me, and I was afraid of what would happen when it all came together. So I backed into the hall, but the shadow was there, and it started laughing and telling me that I was trapped, and the shadow was saying that...\u201d She broke off, staring from Brent Malone to her grandfather, and then to the door where Katia and Roland were standing.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ann?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Brent stared back at her.</p><p>Then he jumped up, racing for the hallway.</p><p>Tara, as well, leaped to her feet. She flew after Brent.</p><p>He had already reached Ann\u2019s door.</p><p>Crashing into his back, Tara looked beyond him.</p><p>Ann was not in her bed. The balcony doors were open.</p><p>The breeze was blowing in ...</p><p>As chill as that which had colored her dream with fear.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Henri Javet ruefully looked in the mirror.</p><p>The five o\u2019clock shadow could be easily solved. He kept a razor at work. He had stayed at the station many times before on the cot in one of the holding cells.</p><p>But the dark shadows and bags beneath his eyes ... la, la. They were not so easily concealed. Years of hard work had brought him to his position here, but in such a short period of time, he had come up against something that seemed to eclipse all but the most heinous crimes he had encountered before.</p><p>What should have been a case of greed and murder was becoming much more. The body found in the water was not going to be the last.</p><p>Javet shaved, washed his face well, noting again that the shadows and bags could not be washed away, and walked back to his office. He glanced at his watch, frowning. The inspector from Paris had gone out to bring in Dubois. He and the men sent had not returned.</p><p>He looked at the notes he had taken during the task force meeting, calling out to the desk sergeant to let him know the minute the inspector returned. As he did so, the outer door opened. A young man, slender, his clothing rumpled and his hair wild, came barging in.</p><p>\u201cI must see the inspector!\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou must explain your business first,\u201d the sergeant said sternly, but not unkindly.</p><p>\u201cShe is gone, she is missing. I waited all night by her house, I had to let her know that I would be her friend, no matter what. But she never came home. She is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, monsieur, slow down,\u201d the sergeant said.</p><p>But Javet stepped forward. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Clavet,\u201d he assured the sergeant, and turned to the young man.</p><p>\u201cI am Inspector Henri Javet, in command here. And I am glad to hear your story. But in order. Your name, young fellow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Paul Beauvois. From this village, the far outskirts, the farmland. And I... I have, for years, been a very good friend to Yvette Miret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl at the cafe?\u201d Javet said, knowing the name. A feeling of dread slipped to the bottom of his stomach. He had seen the girl many times, as had most people in the area. Unfortunately, he had often feared that she would come to a bad end. She had used her position at the cafe far too often as a stepping-stone for another sort of business.</p><p>She had never been arrested, because she did have a paying job, and because, anytime she had been asked about her business with visitors and tourists, she had enthusiastically talked about the \u201cfriendship\u201d she had formed. What she did could not be labeled illegal, especially since no one had ever lodged a complaint against her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Javet said. It might be the most natural thing in the world that the girl had slept elsewhere. Though she had a look of purity, she was anything but innocent. That nagging feeling at the pit of his stomach remained. \u201cShe did not come home last night, and you watched and waited for her, and so you are very worried.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded. \u201cWe had a fight, a terrible row. I was angry, so I went into Paris without her, but then ... I had an uneasy feeling. I was worried, so I left the concert we had planned to attend together, and went to her house. Her parents are gone; she lives with an old crone of an aunt who cares little about her, but the woman is not a liar. She was impatient, telling me that Yvette had not come, and that\u2014\u201d He hesitated, looking at Javet, then continued, \u201cShe said that Yvette could find men, real men, and that she did not need to rely on a boy like me who offered nothing when there was so much more in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Javet said.</p><p>\u201cI sat outside her house all night. She did not return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is a bit early to consider the young lady as missing,\u201d Javet said. And it was. The likelihood was that the girl had found someone more intriguing with whom to spend her time. But under the circumstances, with so many missing ...</p><p>And a headless body to be identified . . .</p><p>\u201cBut, monsieur,\u201d the young man protested, close to tears. \u201cI am afraid\u2014\u201d As he spoke, the door to the station burst open. Big, gruff, curly haired Francois Vaille came in like a whirlwind. He stared at Paul, and Javet thought with a frown that the man had followed him here.</p><p>\u201cMy girl has not shown up for work. She was to take the early shift, and she has never promised to open the cafe, and then not appeared. And that\u2014fellow!\u201d he spat out contemptuously. \u201cThat fellow came in yesterday, swearing, ranting, and raving\u2014and promising that she would be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Francois!\u201d Javet said. \u201cCalm down, and we\u2019ll take things one by one. The girl has not shown up for work, but young Paul here says that she did not return to her home last night. He has come in to report her missing.\u201d</p><p>The cafe owner, gone to fat over the years but still a formidable man, lunged at Paul. Javet quickly interceded, stepping past the lad.</p><p>\u201cFrancois!\u201d Javet warned.</p><p>Francois wagged a finger around him at Paul. \u201cHe has come in to report her missing, because he knows that she has met with foul play. He should be arrested on the spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancois, we all know that Yvette has many friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYvette likes her job with me as well. She has always had her many friends, but she never makes the mistake of missing work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will begin a search for her right away,\u201d Javet said. \u201cThough it isn\u2019t customary, under the circumstances, we will look for her right away.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cWe have discovered a body by the stream,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI shall have some officers take you both by the morgue, and see if you can identify the girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d Paul exclaimed, burying his face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cA body! And now I am to go, too?\u201d Francois Vaille demanded. \u201cBut what about my cafe? I will lose money as it is, since I do not have Yvette working the sidewalk tables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour concern for your employee is admirable,\u201d Javet said dryly. \u201cThis must come first. Sergeant Clavet, call in an escort to take these men to the morgue. As quickly as possible. I know Yvette myself, and will see that there is a bulletin sent out.\u201d</p> <p>He turned back toward his office, then paused, instinct warning him that Francois was about to strike out at Paul again.</p><p>He swung back, his voice bellowing out \u201cOne more move, Francois, and I\u2019ll have you locked up for the day, which will not do your business any good at all!\u201d</p><p>That would halt Francois, he knew.</p><p>In disgust, he entered his office again. He had barely drawn out the proper paperwork before his door opened again.</p><p>Inspector Trusseau, the Paris man, was there. Naturally, Trusseau thought himself above knocking. He considered himself superior to any of his village coworkers, though his instructions had been to work with Javet</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Javet asked somewhat irritably. \u201cDo you have Dubois?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not,\u201d Trusseau said. \u201cDespite the hour of our arrival, Professor Dubois was not in residence.</p><p>A neighbor, rather temperamental after being awakened in what she considered the middle of the night, informed us that she hasn\u2019t seen him in at least a day, maybe two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the American, the digger, Brent Malone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA strange coincidence. Mr. Malone has not been seen at his apartment in quite some time, either.\u201d Javet nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He looked back to his desk, ruing the fact that things seemed so out of control. He would find the men, of course. He had waited too long to bring them in.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Javet?\u201d Inspector Trusseau said, a certain mockery evident in his words, and in his lack of courtesy in eschewing Javet\u2019s title.</p><p>\u201cSo, you should be back on the streets, searching for the men,\u201d Javet said. He stared pointedly at the man sent from Paris. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other things that should be done\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will do them. Thank you, Inspector.\u201d</p><p>His door closed. Javet picked up his pen and began to write on the forms that sat before him. He picked up the phone as he wrote, informing the morgue that he was sending men in who might be able to identify the headless corpse.</p><p>\u201cAnn!\u201d Tara burst through the room, rushing to her cousin\u2019s bed, and then on to the balcony. She stopped short, breathing hard, heart thundering, as she saw that her cousin was standing there, staring at her as if she had lost her mind.</p><p>A noise behind them alerted them to the fact that others had come in behind Tara. Ann\u2019s delicate brows arched high. \u201cMy goodness, what is this, a party in the middle of the night? Mr. Malone... my goodness...!\u201d Her eyes traveled from Tara to Brent, and a slight smile played at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you join us for the evening, Mr. Malone? I go to work one day, come home a bit worn out... and it seems I have missed a great deal.\u201d She was teasing, but there was a still a perplexed look in her eyes as she added, \u201cGrandpapa!\u201d</p> <p>That was said sternly. \u201cWhat are you doing out of bed? And no slippers, no robe! You will catch your death of cold, you will wind up with pneumonia once again, and you must not Roland! What is Jacques doing up so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing back to bed,\u201d Jacques said wearily. His tone was relieved, but still laced with a certain concern.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I need bother to try for a little more sleep or not,\u201d Ann said, yawning. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly time for the alarm to go off, and I really shouldn\u2019t be late.\u201d She walked in, going to Jacques. She kissed his cheek. \u201cI love you, Grandpapa,\u201d she said.</p><p>He kissed her back, holding her face between his hands. \u201cChild! You are as cold as ice! You will catch your death of cold. You must get back in bed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, as soon as I see that Katia and Roland have you back in bed,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Jacques nodded. Tara saw that his eyes met Brent\u2019s then, over Ann\u2019s head. She saw assurance touch her grandfather\u2019s expression. He seemed to relax enough to be able to go to sleep.</p><p>The three left, and Ann stepped forward, shutting her door, leaning against it, and staring at Tara and Brent.</p><p>\u201cWhat are earth are you doing?\u201d she demanded angrily of Tara. \u201cI never, never bring anyone home to sleep here! It is the most disrespectful thing you can do! There\u2019s no reason, of course, that you two shouldn\u2019t have your little liaison, but not under Grandpapa\u2019s nose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t sleeping here,\u201d Tara informed Ann.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Ann remained angry. And skeptical. \u201cWell, I now know why Tara was wearing hay in her hair yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happened to arrive very early,\u201d Brent said evenly, staring at her.</p><p>Tara was surprised when Ann\u2019s eyes fell.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Ann,\u201d Brent said. \u201cWhat were you doing out on the balcony at such an hour?\u201d She arched a brow. \u201cIt is my balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have your doors open like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept my doors open many a night for years,\u201d Ann informed him. She sniffed and waved a hand in the air. \u201cI had to get rid of that ridiculous garlic\u2014the heat and smell created between the closed doors and the garlic was unbearable! What is going on here? Grandpapa has lost his mind. If this continues... I fear he may really need care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques is doing fine,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Our house is riddled with garlic, and our grandfather is doing fine,\u201d Ann said. She yawned again, slumping against the door. \u201cI am so tired! I sleep and sleep, and still ... \u201d She stared at the two of them. \u201cWell, this has been fun, but... I may have a half hour left to sleep. You were leaving, weren\u2019t you, Brent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying for breakfast,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cRight, breakfast,\u201d Ann muttered. \u201cFine, do whatever the hell you like. I have to be at work this morning, there\u2019s so much that I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to do that\u2019s so important?\u201d Tara asked her.</p><p>Ann frowned, as if trying to remember. \u201cOh, yes, it\u2019s the American novel. I must decide if we\u2019re going to buy it, and if so, what kind of a bid we\u2019re going to put in. And I haven\u2019t read the damned thing through once yet, much less given it serious thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have it here? I can read it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014you\u2019re not an editor or a critic, Tara. You\u2019re an artist\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can still read!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe ... no, no, I have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall in late,\u201d Brent suggested.</p><p>Ann\u2019s lashes flicked low over her eyes. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t I really shouldn\u2019t Not after ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a long lunch yesterday,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cStill, you should call in late,\u201d Brent told her.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it wouldn\u2019t be good,\u201d Ann murmured.</p><p>Tara was surprised when Brent walked across the room and took her cousin\u2019s face gently in hand, meeting her eyes. Ann didn\u2019t pull away from his touch. She listened as he said, \u201cThey value you very much, where you work. You can call in late. Tara can glance through the book, and she can tell you whether it is good or not. If you can get some sleep, you must\u201d To Tara\u2019s astonishment, Ann agreed. \u201cYes, I will sleep, if I can,\u201d she said. She yawned again, and walked by Brent, then came to Tara, smiling at her. \u201cI am so tired.\u201d She touched Tara lightly on the shoulder with affection. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>With the two of them still in the room, she crawled back into bed, pulled the covers to her shoulder, and closed her eyes. It seemed that she was instantly asleep.</p><p>Brent walked over to the bed and looked down at Ann. He touched her hair, smoothing it from her face, and seemed to study her very seriously. A sound like a weary sigh, barely perceptible, seemed to escape him. He walked to the balcony doors, closing them, locking them. And he replaced the garlic bulbs Ann had discarded.</p><p>With all arranged, he came back to Tara, eyes hard on her, strange, both defiant and commanding.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave her to sleep now.\u201d</p><p>Tara stared at Brent as he opened Ann\u2019s door, indicating that they should leave. Tara preceded him into the hallway. He closed the door quietly behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d Tara asked him.</p><p>\u201cShe really needs her sleep.\u201d</p><p>She kept watching him. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that she paid such serious attention to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe anything yet, no matter how many signs stare you right in the face,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cSigns!\u201d she murmured, and started out ahead of him.</p><p>He caught her by the shoulder, pulling her back. She wished that she didn\u2019t feel his slightest touch so acutely. She stared at his fingers upon her silk clad shoulders then to his eyes, but if he noted any kind of a withdrawal within her, he gave no sign.</p><p>\u201cThe time is coming when it\u2019s going to be very dangerous for you not to believe,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou with your logic\u2014and your fear that anything you can\u2019t taste, feel, or touch is mad and insane, fantastical. And, of course, if you were to accept the fact that there were things beyond your realm of understanding, well then, you would be giving in to madness. There are such things. What do you think that dream was, Tara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare? Or a warning?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow as imperiously as her cousin. \u201cA warning\u2014about Ann? Ann was fine, just cooling off out on the balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooling off? Her skin was like ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re very hot,\u201d Tara said with aggravation, \u201cit feels good to get cold!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou brought her in, Tara! You called to her, just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time for what?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hold on her shoulders and walked by her, heading for the stairs in disgust. Katia was just coming out of Jacques\u2019 room, and she stopped, speaking to him on the stairs, her French so rapid Tara wasn\u2019t sure what she was saying.</p> <p>But Brent responded to her and Katia smiled pleasantly. They walked down the stairs together.</p><p>Everyone trusted him. She had trusted him. So much so that she had fallen into his arms, and more. If she didn\u2019t care so much about him, if she didn\u2019t feel such a need to know him better, deeper, keep him near her ...</p><p>If she didn\u2019t care so much, she might not be so distrustful.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>Something about him just wasn\u2019t right. He had told her that there were vampires, and that the Alliance was true and real. He had denied that he was a vampire himself when she had accused him of being one.</p> <p>Her grandfather seemed to know him very well, and hadn\u2019t shown the least surprise or alarm when he had found him not only inside his house at night\u2014or the morning\u2014but in his granddaughter\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>She watched the stairs for a moment, thinking, then turned and quietly entered her grandfather\u2019s room.</p><p>She walked to the bed. His eyes were closed, but he felt her there, and his eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in danger,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut then, we\u2019re all in danger.\u201d He fumbled his hand free from the covers, seeking hers. He found it and wound their fingers tightly together. \u201cTara ... it is you, you know. It is you, and you must be strong, because I am not the man I once was, and no matter how we are protected, we are in danger. It is my fault, of course, because of what I am, which once brought me such great pride, and now fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacques, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to trust your senses, your gut feelings!\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, smoothing back his white hair, growing very worried. \u201cGrandpapa, please, if I really understood just a little bit more. When\u2014when exactly did you meet Brent Malone?\u201d Jacques closed his eyes. \u201cA long time ago,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa! When?\u201d she said.</p><p>But his eyes didn\u2019t flicker. He had either fallen asleep again, or he was determined to pretend that he had done so.</p><p>Tara left him. She started down the stairs, certain that Brent was still in the house. She meant to accost him herself.</p><p>He was there. She found him as soon as she reached the landing. He was standing in the open doorway, staring at the newspaper, which had just arrived along with the first pink streaks of dawn.</p><p>\u201cAnother body has been found,\u201d he said.</p><p>With anger, he threw the paper to the floor, and stepped out the door, slamming it behind him.</p><p>Paul stood next to the towering and angry Monsieur Francois and stared at the video screen. They were informed that they were not to see a body;</p> <p>they were going to be shown the clothing and jewelry that had been found on the woman.</p><p>He waited, tense. A cart was rolled before a camera somewhere else in the morgue.</p><p>He stared at the screen, blinked and stared again.</p><p>His knees wobbled, he felt feint, like jelly.</p><p>He slipped to the floor, sobbing.</p><p>He was aware that, next to him, Monsieur Francois was swearing.</p><p>In the depths of a nether region, images of the past swirled in a field of mist.</p><p>That day... so long ago.</p><p>He was weak, incredibly weak. There had been so little food for so very long. With no nourishment, they had been put through backbreaking labor.</p><p>Now, they were all together in the camp. The religious and ethnic prisoners, the dissenters, the political prisoners, and anyone that the regime had any reason whatsoever to dislike. At the beginning, it hadn\u2019t been that way.</p><p>But then he had seen Andreson.</p><p>And Andreson had seen him.</p><p>It was as if they had known from the very beginning that they recognized one another.</p><p>But Andreson had held the power from that very beginning, due to the circumstances. He had been certain that Andreson would see to his immediate execution, but amazingly, it hadn\u2019t been that way.</p><p>Instead, Andreson had set out to break him.</p><p>Eventually, of course, he would kill him. He would disappear one night, as so many others had done.</p><p>Andreson liked a more subtle form of torture, just as much as he enjoyed his own more physical pursuits. He liked the feet that the man he so loathed was left to go to bed each night, wondering, fearing, dreading what might come when the sun went down. There had been times, at the beginning, when the prisoner had found strength, when he had tried to explain to the others that they were harboring a monster more evil than they imagined, but his words fell upon deaf ears, and they were surely brought to Andreson, who enjoyed such complete and total power that they were only a greater form of amusement.</p><p>There had been the morning when he managed to escape en route to the brutal road work, the time when he had so nearly come upon Andreson, had nearly done what must be done.</p><p>Except that Andreson was in charge of a different kind of monster, a corps of men who had been specifically chosen for their inhumanity. And he had been stopped. Then had come the days in solitude.</p><p>The nights when he lay awake ...</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>But toward the end, Andreson had, perhaps, begun to fear for his own future. Not that he feared death himself, but he was about to lose all that he had gained, lose his force of absolute power. He could feel it inside when Andreson lost his keen amusement in his subtle torture. And he knew, of course, that the end was coming. The only question was whether the Americans or the Russians would come first.</p><p>There may have been other places where the promise of damnation made other men relent, and want nothing more than to desert and run, leaving prisoners as they were.</p><p>But not here.</p><p>Not at this place.</p><p>Crowds were drawn to the firing ranges. Men worked night and day to dig ditches.</p><p>Crematoriums never ceased to burn ...</p><p>His time was coming. He knew that he was in the lot to go the next day.</p><p>But then, a whisper arose in the camp. There had been an escape from the medical buildings, where the experiments were done.</p><p>The numbers to the the next day were increased. The guards, unnerved for some reason, were more brutal than ever, making sure their prisoners knew what their fates would be. Soon. So soon.</p><p>Yet other whispers abounded as well. Rumors.</p><p>There was a rumor that guards\u2014well-trained, crack-shot guards\u2014had been killed. And there was a rumor that Andreson had been wounded.</p><p>And that night...</p><p>They had formed a tight, close-knit group. It included men who had been incarcerated for their birth and their beliefs, Resistance fighters, and even a few so-called \u201cmadmen.\u201d They drew close that night, determining any chance of trying to overpower the guards, and, if they sacrificed their own lives, perhaps, allowing others to escape.</p><p>They were huddled in the dark, discussing what they knew of positions and weapons, when the first shots rang out.</p><p>They all leaped to their feet, listening.</p><p>Then they heard it. More rapid fire. The guards shouting, arguing ...</p><p>A few screaming, as if the earth itself had come to life to gobble them up, bit by bit, blood, flesh, bone ...</p><p>The door burst open.</p><p>It was dark within, while there were pools of light outside, blinding light. And all he could see was a silhouette at the door. An unbelievable silhouette. He cried out.</p><p>But a moment later, there was a man inside, and shackles and chains were being keyed and released.</p><p>Someone shouted that they had weapons, taken from the fallen guards.</p><p>He staggered out into the night. The place had gone mad.</p><p>Guards... bloodied, broken, littered the yard. Those who appeared now, streaking out into the night, shocked by the commotion, were quickly mowed down by those prisoners who had seized weapons...</p><p>and who had the strength remaining to use them.</p><p>He found a new burst of power within himself. Quickly, they shouted to one another\u2014some men carried on the task of freeing others, of going for the women and children. Others had taken up the fight to finish off their brutal captors.</p><p>He ran from building to building, remembering everything he had learned in the streets in what seemed like another world and another place. He used the buildings for a shield, learned that he could listen, and discern the footfalls of the guards. Learned that he could still use his weapon.</p><p>Building by building, inch by inch, a handful of ragtag men who were little more than walking skeletons began to find victory.</p><p>It was when he came to the medical buildings that he was taken by surprise. Backed against the doorway, crouched low, he was astounded when a hand\u2014a hand more like an iron fist\u2014descended on his shoulder.</p><p>He nearly cried out.</p><p>Nearly lost control, and let his automatic weapon pour fire into the night But then ... He knew.</p><p>Paul was so relieved that he sat on the floor, sobbing.</p><p>The clothing did not belong to Yvette. She was not the corpse that was so hideously disfigured that it could not be shown.</p><p>He was so happy that he hugged Monsieur Francois\u2019s leg. Monsieur Francois was overcome with relief, but he was impatient He was angry. He had lost time at the cafe.</p><p>The police were kinder. They helped Paul to his feet He was vaguely aware that the police were saying something about fingerprints and perhaps DNA, but since \\vette had worked at the cafe, they could, and would, make certain that the body was not hers. Paul already knew.</p><p>Those were not her things.</p><p>No, they were not.</p><p>The police drove them back to the village station. Monsieur Francois huffed and puffed and was nasty to everyone. He hurried back to his work, swearing that he had lost a lot of money. He left the station swearing that Paul himself should be questioned relentlessly\u2014 the police could not begin to imagine just how bad the quarrel with Yvette had been. Monsieur Francois made certain that the officers knew that Paul had threatened Yvette.</p><p>But perhaps the police felt sorry for such a pathetic fellow, tears streaming down his face. They did not detain Paul.</p><p>He came out of the police station and made it down the street. He felt weak. Very weak. He slipped to the curb, unable to stand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he sat there, shaking, he became aware that someone was standing before him. Someone tall. He shaded his eyes against the sun, and looked up, far up.</p><p>The man standing above him squatted down to his level and said, \u201cPaul? I\u2019m a friend. I mean to help you. And I need your help as well. We both want to find Yvette, right?\u201d He nodded, staring at the stranger.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Paul,\u201d the man said.</p> <p>And Paul rose, amazed that he found new strength to do so.</p><p>He had seen the man before.</p><p>He was desperate to find Yvette.</p><p>There was nowhere else to turn, and ...</p><p>There was something about the man.</p> <p>He had a power.</p><p>And Paul believed.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Tara had assumed that Brent would still be there, that he had just stepped outside to have a few minutes alone, that he wouldn\u2019t have left the house.</p><p>But he had.</p><p>Something else was incredibly disturbing. When she had first decided that he probably needed those moments alone, she had determined that showering and dressing and being prepared for the day were important things to do, and she had made a truly odd discovery.</p> <p>Her feet were dirty. The bottoms looked as if she had been walking barefoot through dirt. There was a blade of grass stuck between her third and fourth toes on the left foot. An unease crept over her that felt like the wash of a tidal wave. She fought it down, assuring herself that there was a logical explanation somewhere. Perhaps there had been dirt on the balcony, blades of grass and dirt tossed high by the night breeze. She knew for a fact that she hadn\u2019t actually left the house, so that was the only possible explanation.</p><p>She was still trying to deal with logic, trying so hard that she refused to accept the fact that the dream had been a continuation. The nightmare had begun before she arrived here. Just as real. But she hadn\u2019t known then what she had been searching for, or what she had feared.</p><p>She still wasn\u2019t sure what she was looking for in the forest.</p><p>She knew why she was afraid.</p><p>She knew whose help she had been calling for ...</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t been there, as he wasn\u2019t here now.</p><p>She bit her lip. So much for her feelings. .. for falling in love with a stranger she had met in a crypt. For believing, even now, that she had been waiting. For this point in her life, and ...</p><p>For Brent.</p> <p>Back downstairs, she went into the kitchen expecting to find him there. She drank the coffee Katia had prepared, but Katia hadn\u2019t seen Brent since she had spoken with him on the stairs; she assumed that he had left. Tara decided to look for him outside.</p><p>Eleanora had taken up a stance at the front door to the chateau. Tara wasn\u2019t certain that she still trusted the dog, but Eleanora was affectionate and sweet, though vigilant, licking Tara\u2019s hands, whining for attention. She didn\u2019t follow Tara to the door, but stayed where she was, sentinel at the door.</p><p>Tara looked for Brent outside, but couldn\u2019t find him. There were no extra cars in the drive. The newspaper lay where he had thrown it in the entryway. She picked it up and began reading about the police discovery of the headless body. Scanning to the bottom of the page, she was startled to see that the police were \u201clooking for\u201d Brent Malone for questioning in regard to the murder in the ruins, and their latest discovery.</p><p>\u201cBrent, where the hell are you?\u201d she muttered aloud. Determined, she walked to the stables, anxious to see if he had gone there. But there was no sign of him.</p><p>Old Daniel was out in the pasture. She called to him and he trotted slowly over to her. Again, she thought that the horse seemed agitated, eager for the soft, crooned words of assurance she gave to him.</p><p>\u201cI feel it, too, old boy,\u201d she told the horse.</p><p>And she was suddenly angry. Now that she had given her trust to Brent Malone\u2014careful trust, but trust at that\u2014he had gone. She felt amazingly vulnerable, even by the light of day.</p><p>Giving Daniel a last pat, she went back into the house and looked in first on Jacques, and then Ann.</p><p>Both were sleeping soundly and peacefully.</p><p>She came back downstairs for more coffee, wondering what she should do, deciding that she must do something, and then making a firm decision. She wasn\u2019t sure at all about \u201cvampire rules,\u201d and she still couldn\u2019t quite force her logical mind to believe that any of it was true. If the myths and stories were at all true, vampires either had to sleep by day, or were at the very least much weaker then. They couldn\u2019t enter a house unless they were invited in. Garlic, holy water, and crosses were deterrents.</p><p>Katia seemed as willing to take care against uninvited supernatural guests as she was to make sure that their high-tech alarm system worked. Tara could safely leave the house. It was important that she find Brent The police were saying that they wanted him for questioning.</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe it. They wanted him so that they could arrest him.</p><p>Tara prepared to go out to find Brent Malone. Calling last minute instructions to Katia to make absolutely certain that she didn\u2019t let anyone\u2014anyone in at all\u2014she threw open the front door.</p><p>To her amazement, she found Inspector Javet standing at the entrance to the house.</p><p>\u201cMiss Adair, bonjour,\u201d Javet said.</p><p>Her heart sank.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, monsieur.\u201d She stood firmly in the doorway, though she felt there was little she could do. He was the head of the police. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid you can. I\u2019d like to see your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see him now, he\u2019s sleeping, and he had a very rough night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. Why was his night so rough?\u201d Javet inquired.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s old, and has been ill, and he sometimes has a bad time, Inspector. That should be fairly simple to acknowledge.\u201d</p><p>Javet nodded slowly, and told her very softly. \u201cYou know, Miss Adair, it\u2019s ridiculous for you to stand there so defensively. I only wish to question Jacques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be questioning Professor Dubois.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to have seen more of the man. However, he seems to have disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDubois has disappeared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Adair, that\u2019s what I just said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll be finding the good professor\u2014 minus his head, Miss Adair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, Inspector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Miss Adair. Perhaps if I were to come in, you could offer me some coffee, and in a bit, your grandfather might be awake.\u201d</p><p>Tara stood there staring at Javet, feeling wary. Far too wary to let anyone in, not when she could help it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was on my way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are legal steps I can take to speak with Jacques, you know,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to take them. I have to go out, and I\u2019m not letting anyone to see my grandfather while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Miss Adair,\u201d Javet said, and turning, he started to his car. But then he turned back. \u201cYou should trust me. I don\u2019t intend to hurt Jacques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone, Inspector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s true. I hope that you\u2019re not leaving the house hoping to find your new friend, Mr.</p><p>Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInspector Javet, I\u2019m leaving because I have errands to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Miss Adair, I wanted very badly to trust Brent Malone as well. Such an intelligent man, well-read, such a fine face\u2014and even his French is excellent.\u201d He hesitated on that, as if considering the fact that a man who had been taught English as his first language managed to speak such excellent French. \u201cBut no matter what techniques we have used, no matter how we have tried, we can find no proof that anyone else was in that tomb at the time of Jean-Luc\u2019s death. And now ... so many young people disappearing, and another corpse found\u2014minus the head once again\u2014 I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s difficult to clear Mr. Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely know Mr. Malone,\u201d she said evenly, meeting his eyes without blinking.</p><p>\u201cYou should bring me in on everything that\u2019s going on here, and trust in me, Miss Adair,\u201d Javet said softly. He looked at her a long moment, then shrugged. \u201cI will be back, you know, with the legal papers necessary. It may all be much more difficult for Jacques then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t a thing on my grandfather, Inspector Javet,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cHe has done nothing, nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>He was still watching her. She turned and locked the door to the house, facing him.</p><p>\u201cI really won\u2019t let you in to see my grandfather,\u201d she told him firmly, but she realized that there was a note in her voice that begged him to understand.</p><p>\u201cAll I want to do is help you,\u201d Javet said.</p><p>\u201cFind the real killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find the killer if I can\u2019t get closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Looking past Javet, as she spoke Tara was certain that she had seen the area around the house change. If it weren\u2019t for the fantastic theories plaguing her, she would have thought that the sun had just gone behind a cloud, that the light had faded just a bit.</p><p>But as she stood on the steps with Javet, she found herself beginning to believe everything that had been said to her, that there were supernatural forces in the world, and they were coming down upon Chateau DeVant, like a flock of black-winged crows.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, will you?\u201d she murmured. She stepped past Javet, walking toward the stables. She entered, and looked around and saw that nothing was unusual. Javet had followed her, she realized.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing. Just shadows on the sun.\u201d</p><p>She still felt the unease. But look as she might, there was nothing in the stables.</p><p>She walked back out into the muted sunlight, again followed by Javet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help you,\u201d he repeated again.</p><p>She stretched out a hand to him, smiled, and said, \u201cThank you, really. But there\u2019s nothing that I can tell you, nothing I can help you with right now. And I have errands to run.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will find Malone,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou are an officer of the law.

At last he started for his car.</p><p>Tara did the same.</p><p>She waited for him to turn on his ignition, and start down the drive before gunning her own motor and following him out to the road.</p><p>As she drove, she tried to tell herself that Brent must have read the entire article. He would know that the police were looking for him, that they were after him. He wouldn\u2019t be walking around the village or sitting casually at the cafe. As she drove, she felt the same sense of a deepening dread that had seized her before.</p> <p>It was real. What they were saying was real.</p><p>Her dream ...</p><p>Was somehow real. She had never really left the chateau ...</p><p>And yet, she was certain that the place she had gone to was out there, somewhere.</p><p>Somewhere near.</p><p>Sleep ... deep sleep was so wonderful. Ann felt the comfort of her bed, and the sweetness of real rest But even as she lay, certain that sleep without dreams was wonderful and healing, she felt the incursion into her realm of soft floating clouds and security.</p> <p>Her eye movement was rapid, and though she couldn\u2019t wake up, she was aware that she remained in a nether region. And she was equally aware that it had been entered.</p><p>Ann . . .</p><p>She heard her name, and he was calling to her.</p><p>Ann . . . you know that you are mine.</p><p>Her mind fought the words whispered so tersely within it</p><p>You are mine, and you will let me in. You will open the doors for me, and I will be with you. You know that\u2019s what you want, what you crave, what you need.</p><p>No...</p><p>Shadows filled her sleep. Great sweeping wings, like those of a giant blackbird, hovering over her, folding around her. Encasing her ...</p> <p>There was a staggering heat within the caress of shadows. She twisted and turned, and knew that she was surrounded.</p><p>No...</p><p>It occurred to Paul that he was making a serious mistake, trusting in a stranger. He might well be following the same path that Yvette had taken, and yet, it was all that he could do. He loved Yvette.</p><p>Loved her more than he did himself, more than his own life, no matter how callously she had played with his feelings.</p><p>And so he went with the man, and he found himself answering questions, talking about those men Yvette met at the cafe.</p><p>\u201cShe is not a bad girl,\u201d he said, defensive lest anyone think that she should deserve a sad fate due to her promiscuity. \u201cYou must understand, there are many who live here who travel into Paris to work, there are families here, so many who have come since the city is so large, and space so very dear. But there are those who have been bom here as well, and those who wish to escape, and maybe they haven\u2019t the education for a fine job in Paris, and they have known so little other than the countryside, and the growing fields and the livestock, and they ... they simply want more. That is Yvette, she wants to fly above our little village, and she hasn\u2019t the wings to do so, and so ... and so ...\u201d The man was looking at him, watching him, and he couldn\u2019t tell if a small smile curved the fellow\u2019s lips, if he was amused, or if he was merely understanding what Paul was trying to say.</p><p>\u201cYvette has sought to fly by catching on to the coattails of others ... of other men,\u201d he said, finishing lamely.</p><p>A hand fell gently on his arm.</p><p>\u201cWe will find Yvette,\u201d he was told softly.</p><p>They kept driving. Very far. Paul had grown up here, run in the fields as a child, sought out every little place of mystery, but he was unfamiliar with the trails that they traveled through now. The car drove over grass and roots, and circled through trees and more.</p><p>At last they came to a halt.</p><p>They entered what must have once been a place of riches and great charm. Still, a certain alluring ambience remained. Darkness and shadow, however, seemed to abound, as if the inhabitants shunned daylight and the sun.</p><p>\u201cCome, Paul, we need to know what you know. Everything there is to know about your Yvette, and her</p><p>... friends.\u201d</p><p>At the doorway, he felt a strange hesitance. Then he entered within. And he met those waiting to greet him.</p><p>Tara drove to the village. Though she didn\u2019t expect to see Brent, she parked near the cafe, found a table, and ordered cafe au lait.</p><p>She picked up another newspaper, and spread it before her. She wasn\u2019t really reading; she was trying to appear as if she was not watching everything that was going on around her.</p><p>But there wasn\u2019t much going on.</p><p>The cafe was quiet. The waiters were whispering among themselves, and when she ordered her second cup, the man who served her spilled some of the hot liquid. He apologized, and she quickly assured him it was nothing. When he smiled ruefully, she wondered if she couldn\u2019t get him to talk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed ... you all seem a bit distant today,\u201d she said, encouraging him to talk.</p><p>He was about twenty-five, slim, with something of a buzz cut that was becoming to him, since he had a fine face and deep, dark eyes.</p><p>He hesitated, then indicated her newspaper. \u201cSuch things simply don\u2019t happen here.\u201d He leaned closer, mopping up the spilled coffee. \u201cOne of our girls has disappeared now. Monsieur Francois, the owner, went into the morgue in the city to identify the corpse, but it isn\u2019t Yvette. At least, she is not the body that was discovered. But... we are a small village. It\u2019s unnerving to have people disappear, to have bodies found. It was one thing when it was the man at the dig. We could all believe that he was killed because someone wanted the riches from the corpse. But now ... there are others who are gone\u2014and there is the one corpse that has been discovered. We have not seen this kind of trouble here in ... in hundreds of years! So naturally, we are afraid. But,\u201d he added quickly, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to be afraid here. We are at the cafe, on the street, in broad daylight, and the police station is right down the street.\u201d He was trying to reassure her after saying for more than anyone dependent upon tourist francs should have said. But he hadn\u2019t frightened Tara, certainly not any more than she was already. He had, however, said something she was anxious to pursue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve not had this kind of trouble\u2014in hundreds of years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there is a lot of legend here, you know. Back in the days of the Sun King, there were all manner of things going on. I\u2019m not a great student of history, so I\u2019m not all that up on the particular events that occurred. But of course, you know, the body that was stolen from the dig was that of Louisa de Montcrasset She was a mistress of Louis. She had the king wrapped around her little finger, so they say, and she was able to practice great atrocities because the king was so infatuated that he refused to believe ill of her. They say, though, that she kidnapped poor young people\u2014men and women, she was not particular\u2014and used them in strange rites. She bathed in blood, drank blood, lived in blood, so they say, in the belief that it would help keep her young and desirable forever, and add to her amazing hypnotism over others. But at one point, the king could no longer be fooled, but he would not allow her to be humiliated before the people. She was the daughter of a great knight who had fought long and hard for France, and also, no matter what she had done, the king could not completely rid himself of his love for her. He refused to see her, however, after proof was brought against her. Proof of her misdeeds, as well as proof that she had been cuckolding the king with another man. He was not so protective of her lover\u2014 it\u2019s said that he ordered his men to burst in upon the fellow, stab him to death in his bed, and have his body cut to pieces and cast into the Seine. The king was helped in all these discoveries, forced to see the evil and death perpetrated on the people, by a strange sect composed of a group of religious men who had gathered together for the sole purpose of bringing down Louisa and her evil companion.</p><p>But even at the end, the king would not agree to Louisa coming before the public, or having her beauty destroyed. By his command, she was buried and sealed into her coffin, and then the terror that had raged in Paris and the village came to an end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard the legend of Louisa de Montcrasset,\u201d Tara said, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t heard that she\u2019d had a lover other than the king, or that he had been killed when she was buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t find any of it in the history books,\u201d the young man told her. \u201cIt is all local legend\u2014but of course, we know that it\u2019s mainly true, since her coffin was discovered. Or, should I say, at least it\u2019s true that she existed. If, indeed, she was the corpse in the tomb. Hard to be certain, now that she has disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d Tara murmured.</p><p>\u201cWould you like another coffee?\u201d the young man asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cJust the check, please.\u201d</p><p>He brought the check, and she put the appropriate number of francs on the tray. As she did so, she felt a presence near her, and she looked up.</p><p>\u201cMiss Adair, how are you?\u201d</p><p>Inspector Trusseau was standing there. She definitely didn\u2019t want to get into a conversation with him.</p><p>She had gained nothing at the cafe, and it suddenly occurred to her that there was something she should be doing\u2014 something practical.</p><p>She should get Jacques out of the house.</p><p>\u201cInspector, hello, how are you?\u201d she said, standing quickly.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite well.\u201d</p><p>She stood there for a moment, feeling awkward as she stared at him.</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019ll be visiting you quite soon,\u201d Trusseau said. He was a smooth, tall, and attractive man. He didn\u2019t fit the mold of a forensics expert, but then again, perhaps he was excellent at his work. He had a handsome appearance and apparently the social graces that might get him what he wanted when brash authority might fail.</p><p>\u201cYes, I understand Inspector Javet wants to speak with my grandfather.\u201d Trusseau nodded. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Javet is convinced that your grandfather knows something about the murder in the crypt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm\u2014and do you think that my very aged grandfather can also be guilty of decapitating a body and leaving it in the river to be discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Adair, I\u2019ve read about your grandfather for years.

I am aware that he is an old and failing man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019m glad to hear that you will make the session as gentle as possible,\u201d she murmured, anxious then only to leave, find a hotel room, and get her grandfather out of the house.</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course, you\u2019ll be glad that I accompany Javet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>Trusseau smiled. \u201cI shall see you soon, then, Miss Adair, at the chateau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have some errands to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I didn\u2019t mean to delay you. It\u2019s a pleasure to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you, of course. Au revoir.\u201d</p><p>Tara hurried to her car. She dug in her purse for her cell phone as she drove, cursing as the phone rang and rang.</p><p>Louisa slept restlessly, waking fitfully when she should have been calm and in a deep state of relaxation, gathering strength. She needed this time.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, my love?\u201d he asked her. He never left her for long. He was up against those whose minds he could not touch, and he trusted no one. There were things, of course, which he must do during the day, but he returned to her, always.</p><p>She turned to him, sighing as she found some comfort in his embrace. \u201cIt is ... this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place is safe,\u201d he told her firmly.</p> <p>\u201cAh, but there is so much else in the world, in Paris, I want to live!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time ... you forget who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you forget that the world is large, and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the power to take charge of the world around me,\u201d she said, her tone both imperious and petulant</p><p>\u201cIn time,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhen those who would fight us are removed.\u201d She drew back. \u201cYou should have destroyed them long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouisa, I could not. I dared not create a disturbance before you had awakened. There are many forces out there today that you do not understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore powerful than a king?\u201d she said, insinuating that he was weak.</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cThe population is far more vast today than you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVast\u2014and stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany are ignorant, but not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery soon, you will feast on our enemies, and then you will have the strength you seek, and the freedom you so long to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cI will find you prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that you would bring me prey before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe time wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t strong enough to lure her here.</p><p>Either that, or... you have a greater interest in the girl than you pretend.\u201c</p><p>\u201cThere is not, nor has there ever been, anyone but you. There were years while I pined, hating what you did, who you were.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cYou never pined, mon cher. You have always taken your amusements where you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I waited,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She reached for him. Elegant perfection, sheer carnality. There seemed no reason not to indulge. And yet, at the end, when she had driven him to distraction, she whispered against his ear, \u201cTonight. I want her here tonight And I want it finished. And if you will not, or can not, bring her, then I will see to it all myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will bring her!\u201d he roared in return, and then she gave in to him, and far above them, the fire roared to life in the old hearth, and in their maddened embrace, they were consumed.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell us everything, everything that you can,\u201d the tall man informed Paul.</p><p>He had been taken to an elegant apartment in the city and given wine to drink, offered food, which, of course, he was far too nervous to eat.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many men at the cafe. And I do not spend my days there, watching her. I wish I could, but a farmer\u2019s life is not an easy one,\u201d Paul said. He looked longingly at the door, wishing he had not come so easily.</p><p>\u201cThink, tell us about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there are the officers from the police station, of course,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThere have been students, but she seldom agrees to meet them ... she prefers to see men with ... with ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d the second man suggested softly.</p><p>Paul hung his head. \u201cYes, of course. Those who can buy her presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, have you seen anyone at the cafe who appears to be affluent?\u201d Paul stared at the man speaking to him, then pointed nervously. \u201cYou have been at the cafe. You ... are supposed to be a laborer. But you look as if you have money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did not go with me.\u201d</p><p>Paul frowned. \u201cThere ... has been someone else. I have seen him frequently. He is tall, a blond man, well built ... I am not sure what he does. Perhaps I have seen him at the police station. But everyone has been at the station, frightened, asking the police what they are doing ... you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tall blond?\u201d The dark haired man looked at the lighter one. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d the second man said. \u201cPerhaps ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, can we get you water, more wine, coffee?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you must stay,\u201d she informed him softly.</p><p>He was afraid.</p><p>Tara reached the chateau as quickly as she was able. She came running through the front door, calling for Katia.</p><p>Katia just stared at her when she said that they must pack up a few things, and go to a hotel.</p><p>\u201cThey are coming with the correct papers to insist on entry and question Jacques!\u201d she told Katia.</p><p>By then, however, Jacques had come out of his library. \u201cSo\u2014they will come and question me!\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t listened to me at all, Grandpapa,\u201d Tara said. \u201cThey think you had something to do with the murders. And if you tell the police that there are vampires out there ... well, they\u2019ll ... they might...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will try to lock me up with the insane? \u201dJacques said.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you mustn\u2019t worry, Tara. They will come, and they will talk to me, and I will not mention the Alliance, or vampires, and I will make them understand that I have not hired any contract killers. And since I did not, they will have no proof against me, and they will not be able to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jacques, listen to me. Be rational. We will simply go and spend a few days at a hotel, and we will be safe.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and she was tempted to scream at him that he was a stubborn old man. \u201cTara, my books are in this house. We are secure here. Katia has seen to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara, I will not go,\u201d he said with a soft insistence that was absolutely final. \u201cKatia, we\u2019ll see to it that the windows and doors are truly sealed, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMais oui,\u201d Katia assured her.</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa, the police are not afraid of garlic,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAnd some vampires actually enjoy it, but they are usually the Italians,\u201d he told her, smiling. \u201cTara, I am joking here, please smile for me, laugh a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have such an arsenal here! Stakes, crosses, so many crosses! Holy water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And the Italian vampires won\u2019t mind the garlic, and perhaps, if they are Hindu, Muslim, or Jewish, they will not mind the holy water in the least!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there, at last, a sense of humor!\u201d Jacques said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the point, Jacques. The police are coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let them come. And you, young lady, you should get some rest. Look at you! You are drawn, haggard, there are huge shadows beneath your eyes. Quite frankly, my dear child, you look like hell!\u201d Tara frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overtired, and don\u2019t know it. Ann is still sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn is still sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I am fine, and you should rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check on Ann,\u201d she said, then stared from Jacques to Katia. \u201cBoth of you, pay attention to me now, because if you don\u2019t ... if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll throttle you both. If the police come, you must get me before you even open the door. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Jacques sighed, dismayed that she was behaving as if he were a child. But he said, \u201cNaturally, Tara, I promise that we will get you before we open the door. Now, I am working. I can\u2019t make you rest, Tara, but it\u2019s important that you keep up with your sleep, and be alert and aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'll see to Ann,\u201c was the only commitment she would make.</p><p>He shrugged, and headed back to the library.</p><p>Katia looked at her, grimaced, and asked, \u201cWould you like some warm milk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said sharply, then quickly added, \u201cNo, no, thank you.\u201d Katia headed for the kitchen. Tara started for the steps, anxious to check on Ann.</p><p>Her cousin was still sleeping soundly. She appeared somewhat ashen, but her breathing was deep, and restful.</p><p>The balcony doors were closed, and garlic remained around them.</p><p>Tara closed her door, frustrated, and went to her own room.</p><p>Her easel drew her. She looked at the sketches she had been making, and started another, not sure what she was drawing, then realizing that she was shading in a man\u2019s face. She had sketched him before, and now, with some light and shadow added, he was beginning to appear very real. She knew why she was drawing him. She was coming to know him far too well.</p><p>Yawning, she suddenly set her pencil down. She was tired. She decided that Jacques was right, and perhaps she had some time before Javet and Trusseau actually arrived. She stretched out on the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes closed, and before she knew it, she was drifting.</p><p>She was there again ...</p><p>The place in the woods. Deep, deep woods. This time, as she walked, her footsteps were being followed. She could hear the movement against the ground, a fraction of a second behind the sound of her own feet against the earth. She would stop and turn back, time and time again, and there would be nothing but the shadows, still shadows that swooped like wings, that seemed to have a whisper within them. Shadows that constantly darkened and changed.</p> <p>She looked forward, knowing that the old house was ahead. She kept walking. Once again, she heard that hint of sound, a whisper of movement. She stopped, but she didn\u2019t turn around. The danger was there. She could it feel like hot breath against her neck. A warning. It was close, so close, as close as the shadows that seemed ahead of her as much as they were behind her.</p><p>She ran toward the door. She nearly reached it when she heard the whisper take form.</p><p>Almost here, you are almost here, I have told you, I have her, and I will have her, come, yes, come toward the door, come to me, I am waiting. . .</p><p>The shadow was lengthening, widening. In seconds, it would be all-encompassing; she would be engulfed ...</p><p>Wake, wake, wake up! she told herself in the midst of her dream.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t screamed; she hadn\u2019t moved. Her eyes were wide, unfocused. She blinked, and bolted upright.</p><p>Ann.</p><p>Tara leaped out of bed, and went racing to Ann\u2019s room. She was insane, she told herself, her heart thundering. She was simply insane. Ann was sleeping. The balcony doors were closed, and covered with garlic, she had checked them herself.</p><p>She threw the door open with a vengeance.</p><p>It nearly flew back at her. There was a strong, chill breeze rushing through the open balcony doors.</p><p>The garlic had been tossed into a corner of the room.</p> <p>Tara forced the door open again and stepped in, anxiously looking to where Ann should be sleeping in the bed.</p><p>Her cousin was there.</p><p>And so was a man.</p><p>Tall, blond.</p><p>Bent over her cousin, touching her ...</p><p>He was so close to her, fingers brushing aside the tangle of dark hair around Ann\u2019s face. Stroking her throat. Lips nearly against her cousin\u2019s flesh.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Tara shrieked.</p><p>He straightened, looking at her. She knew him.</p> <p>She\u2019d seen him before.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted again, and went flying across the room, pulling at the large, ornate cross Jacques had insisted she wear, not ripping it from her neck, but twisting it to use as a weapon.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d</p><p>She threw herself against his form. It was like hitting steel. It didn\u2019t matter. She curled her fingers around the cross.</p><p>Fingers curled around hers with a brutal strength, and the man began to swear.</p><p>\u201cI will kill you!\u201d she vowed desperately. She found that her own teeth were baring; she meant it. No matter what his strength or his power, she would not let him harm Ann.</p><p>She felt an incredible rise of power and strength, and believed that she could kill him\u2014because she had to. She had heard that faced with impossible situations, parents could save children, siblings could rescue one another, lift cars, break down massive doors, and do all kinds of amazing deeds, because of adrenaline brought on by sheer desperation. She was desperate to save her cousin. She would break free. She managed to jerk a hand from his hold and lift the cross high, ready to bring it down against his face, his eyes. If she hadn\u2019t the power to really down him, she hoped, at the least, to wound him, blind him, hurt him badly enough so that she could begin a new offense with him at a disadvantage.</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d</p><p>At first, she was barely aware of her name being called.</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d</p><p>It might have been coming from elsewhere, a voice in her mind, from far away, but a voice calling out to her, louder as she struggled.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d The word escaped her lips.</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d</p><p>It was Brent. It was as if he had been far, far away. As if, perhaps, he had heard her from a distance, had sensed that she was in trouble.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t far away. He was there now, in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cBrent! Thank God, help me!\u201d</p><p>She was shaking, caught in a deadly game of wrestling, in which, still, amazingly, she was managing to hold her own, yet...</p><p>Weakening.</p><p>\u201cBrent, help me!\u201d</p><p>He came striding into the room, steps long and sure and determined. She thanked God. He had come to help her, she wouldn\u2019t have to try to bring down this deadly giant of a monster alone.</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d The word, her name, was harsh. It seemed to scratch down the length of her flesh.</p><p>Then ...</p><p>He had her.</p><p>He ripped her from the tall blond man, held her in an iron grasp.</p><p>A grasp she couldn\u2019t break.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>His arms seemed to squeeze tighter. She couldn\u2019t see, for shadows seemed to burst before her eyes.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe, she could only hear the thunder of her heart, slowing ...</p><p>Tara...</p><p>It was as if she heard his voice, a deadly whisper at her nape. And she knew ...</p><p>He hadn\u2019t come to help her. To save her life. He had come to kill her.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>They had brought Paul to a wonderful hotel room. The furniture was old, but grand. They had left him with everything that he could desire\u2014coffee, wine, fruit, cheese, bread, crackers.</p><p>The men had left. The woman remained.</p><p>She was in the other room, her attention riveted on a computer. What she was doing, he didn\u2019t know, but it seemed very important to her that she find whatever it was. She was beautiful, and very kind to him, checking on him now and then.</p><p>At first, the novelty of the hotel suite kept him fascinated. He had walked around and around, running his hands over the polished wood furniture, sitting on the plump sofa, rising, sitting again. He adjusted pillows, picked at the fruit, enjoyed a glass of wine. He liked playing with the remote control and the television, but as time wore on, he grew restless. He walked over to the balcony, opening the windows, and looking out at the streets below. It was a wonderful view. He had never really seen the landscape this way. He saw it from working the land most of the time. But here, where the hotel sat on a little hill, the view encompassed much of the countryside, in many shades and colors. Those colors changed as the afternoon waned, and he was fascinated by each subtle variation in tone. It was all very beautiful.</p><p>The woman came out briefly to smile, say hello, and make sure he was all right. Or perhaps she was making sure he was still there.</p><p>He smiled in return, and told her that the wine was very good.</p><p>At last, he tired of wandering and watching the view. He even tired of playing with the television and the remote control. There was no show on that could hold his attention.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help thinking about Yvette.</p><p>He wondered why he loved her. But he did, and he had, forever and ever, so it seemed. He was the one who had been there for her, so many times. Through the years, there were times when he had been angry and indignant, but she had told him over and over again that she was a free spirit, and would not be tied down, and if he was going to try to hold on to her, like a giant brick around her neck, she simply wouldn\u2019t talk to him at all. And they wouldn\u2019t be friends. And there wouldn\u2019t be those times when she had no other great interest in life, and spent hours with him, doing things that all but made him stop breathing, that escalated life to such wild fields of pleasure that it made the agony of her constant betrayals all the more complete. But still, all in all, in the end, he believed that she would tire of her hunt for adventure and riches. She would remember the times that he had been there for her, rock hard and steady, always waiting. Always. No matter how she turned from him. He had always thought that he would be there for her under any circumstances. He had fantasized about occasions when she had been in trouble, when he had stepped in, swung a practiced right hook at some abusive fellow, and become her hero.</p><p>And now ...</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been the headless corpse at the morgue, he reminded himself.</p><p>There was hope.</p><p>He lay upon the sofa, legs sprawled over the elegantly carved end of it, and let the remote control fall to the floor. He listened with half attention to the sports channel that was on, but found himself drifting off as he did so. He dreamed about Yvette. He should have been so much angrier with her. She had certainly emasculated him frequently enough, not with her words, but with a look. Why, why, did she have to run around with other men? Money did not mean so much in life. The way she looked at him with her beautiful eyes, so pityingly ...</p><p>No one would ever love her the way he did.</p><p>As he drifted, she came into his dreams. Yvette. So pretty. She was in one of her playful moods, and a sensuous mood, strolling toward him slowly, hips swaying, shoulders somewhat back. There was that look in her eyes that he hadn\u2019t seen very often ... not in the last many months, at least. A look that was all for him, that said she wanted him.</p><p>Paul, silly boy, there you are. Such a silly squabble we had. I need you now, you know. I know I\u2019ve been bad, but you\u2019ve forgiven me so many times. You\u2019re the one I really want, the one I\u2019ve always wanted in the end. And you know, Paul, I want you now . . .</p><p>I want you now . ..</p><p>It was such an incredible dream. She was swathed in some gossamer stuff that seemed to lift and swirl around her as she walked. He knew that beneath it, she was naked. There were hints of flesh to be seen, hints of color at her breasts, shadows at the juncture of her thighs. His mouth went dry as he traveled through the dream, a silly grin on his face, he was certain. He shouldn\u2019t smile so. He should be like so many of her other lovers. Suave. Sophisticated. Lying back, waiting, musing, assessing, making her play out the full game, tease and taunt as if she was desperate for once ...</p><p>For him.</p><p>It was a dream, of course, which made it far easier not to move. And it was strange. The closer she came to him, the more he felt certain that it was Yvette. Really Yvette. She was in trouble somewhere, and she was reaching out to him. The words formed in his mind.</p><p>Yes, Yvette, I love you, I\u2019ll save you, I\u2019ll come... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she moved, ever closer, that gossamer fabric flaring around her as if it were caught in a strange wind tunnel within the hotel room, he felt the strangest uncertainty. It was Yvette, yes ... Yvette, yet she was different At times, there would be flashes of something else, and he would think, that isn\u2019t really her face. It isn\u2019t really Yvette\u2019s face, and yet. ..</p><p>Paul, I need you.</p><p>Where are you?</p> <p>Silly boy, come closer, closer. I need you, open your arms to me, Paul, help me, Paul, save me, Paul, let me love you, ask me to love you. I am close, and afraid.

Come, Paul, please, I need your arms around me now, I need your warmth.</p><p>She was so near. He was sleeping, he thought, and it was a divine dream. He saw some ethereal part of himself rise to meet her. She was there, framed in the falling dusk, that shimmering fabric still all around her.</p><p>Come, Paul.</p><p>The breeze swept away the slender threads of material. Yvette, his Yvette, yes, she was there, she had come to him, because she had been lost and afraid and lonely, and now she knew what was to be found in his arms.</p><p>He hesitated suddenly, coming forward. Because he had that strange feeling again. Yvette, and not Yvette. A flash of something now and then that was so confusing. The face, in certain fractured sections of time, seemed to be that of someone ...</p><p>She was real. Flesh and blood and real. He could see the pulse beating at her throat. He could even see the moisture as she wet her lips. She was cold, she did need him, her breasts were swollen, the nipples hard. He started to reach for her.</p> <p>He blinked, wondering how she could be so very real in a dream. How he himself could be standing where he was, and feel the floor beneath his feet, when he was sleeping on the couch. Of course, it was a dream. The balcony was high above the ground. But she was here. And real, real, real ...</p><p>He stretched out his hand.</p><p>He touched her flesh ...</p><p>He trembled because he could feel her. He could pull her to him, bury himself against her, smell her, taste her, drown in the woman he loved, such an expert, so much more experienced than he, and though he resented it at times, she was such a lover that he felt time and time, he could die in her arms.</p><p>Yvette, oh, Lord, Yvette . . .</p><p>Paul...</p><p>The draperies began to blow in the breeze, surrounding her, wrapping around them both. His trembling fingers reached for her, through the line of the balcony doors. His hands came around her waist. He began to pull her to him.</p><p>\u201cPaul!\u201d</p> <p>It was the woman. Her shout was loud, anxious, warning.</p><p>He turned, a sudden anger filling him. Here was Yvette, naked and waiting and wanting him, and she was interrupting. His dream would fade, his beautiful love would vanish.</p><p>\u201cPaul, get back! Quickly!\u201d she commanded.</p><p>\u201cToo late!\u201d Yvette called to her.</p><p>He turned back to Yvette. Yes, of course, this interloper didn\u2019t matter. He had only to hold more tightly to Yvette.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in, come to me, Yvette!\u201d he cried.</p><p>He heard a throaty laugh.</p><p>And then he saw her face. Really saw her face.</p><p>And he began to scream.</p><p>\u201cOne of these ... one of these ... right here, in this area,\u201d Jacques explained to Lucian. They were poring over the map of the area that lay on the desk. Jacques had X\u2019s marked in various places. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to remember now where everything lay... it was an occupation, of course, and so much of the city survived, yet here, in the countryside, so many places were abandoned after the war ... left to rot and ruin. And so many men didn\u2019t come back. Families left, never to return. The chateau survived, of course, and here is the Dupre house, which still stands as it was... there is a new development here, but as you moved into the country farther and farther here to the outskirts ... there was some heavy fighting, and much was lost, and to this day, the ruins remain. And many of the places were hundreds of years old. If only I had followed more closely at the end ... but you see, I was ill then. By the time it was all over, really over, I was in such a fevered state that I wound up in the hospital, I was in a coma, I met my wife... and I moved to America. There were years when I couldn\u2019t come back, and with the illness, there were so many years when I believed that everything in my life, the war, the camp, and anything else that occurred, had been a nightmare. So now ...\u201d</p><p>Lucian laid a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve remembered everything when it has mattered,\u201d he told Jacques.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Jacques said unhappily. \u201cThere are many more dead now ... many more dead. I wasn\u2019t ready when I should have been. The old Alliance ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old Alliance faded years before your time, Jacques,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well. Look, we have been here, here, and here. And you are right\u2014it is somewhere here. When there is a disturbance, I know it. And there are times when I need nothing more than concentration, and I can reach out and know exactly where someone is ... I can enter their thoughts, bring them right to me. But Louisa isn\u2019t alone\u2014and she isn\u2019t even the real danger. She is with someone who knows that I am still alive, and very aware. Very old, and powerful, and they are able to block a great deal. I have been able to follow Louisa, but I seem to get where she has been once she has left. She rose alone, uncertain, and traced her old paths first. Though she came into a new world, she went first to what she had known in the past. I believe she traveled first to the Louvre, and from there, she went out to Versailles. She was on her own, but not for long. She was back here...\u201d he pointed to the map, \u201cand here. And I know now that their lair is in this area, where you have shown me the places that can be found in the overgrown forest areas. We have gone over much of it, and still, there has to be something that we haven\u2019t discovered. You have done more than you can imagine, but we must find them quickly now, before she grows more powerful, like her mentor, because then, between them, they will have tremendous strength.\u201d Jacques stared at Lucian and let out a breath, his shoulders slumping. \u201cI was just thinking of the old days. There was a time ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA time when we would not have stood together so,\u201d Lucian said flatly. \u201cBut that was before. When the world was different And there was a time, of course, when it was the disputes among my own that were brought before me, and when my kind were only handled by the old rules when they were so besotted with their power that they endangered us all. But that was the old world, and this is the new, and survival has become even more difficult War is open, and sides have been drawn. And so, Monsieur DeVant, we are together in this, as we were when we met\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are all strange bedfellows,\u201d Jacques said.</p><p>\u201cLive long enough, and the world is strange indeed,\u201d Lucian agreed.</p><p>\u201cThe full moon is coming too soon,\u201d Jacques said glumly.</p><p>\u201cYes, but of course... that gives us distinct advantages as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost night,\u201d Jacques said.</p><p>\u201cIt is night,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cNight again.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, stiffening.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jacques asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cSomething is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>Lucian shook his head. \u201cNo, there is something very wrong... with my wife.\u201d He turned, long strides taking him to the door. \u201cTell Brent... never mind. Brent will know. Stay tight, stay in the house, let no one in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this, of course,\u201d Jacques said somewhat impatiently.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Lucian was gone. He had been there, and then he was gone. Jacques wasn\u2019t sure how he had left. He had blinked, and the man was gone. He sighed softly.</p><p>And it was then that the screams began to tear through the chateau.</p><p>\u201cTara, calm down, stop it!\u201d</p><p>The serious shake that she received, and the fact that she couldn\u2019t breathe, caused Tara to pause in her struggle, gasp desperately for breath, and meet Brent\u2019s eyes, her own laced with hatred and determination.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Rick, Rick Beaudreaux,\u201d he said.</p><p>As if that should mean something to her!</p><p>\u201cMy cousin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is one of us, one of us, Tara!\u201d</p><p>She looked from Brent, who still held her in an iron clasp, to the other man. He was still breathing heavily, looking at her, wiping at the wounds she had inflicted on his face. He offered a grim smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we haven\u2019t met. Really sorry.\u201d He cast Brent something of a reproachful stare. \u201cBut you were suspicious. You didn\u2019t want to believe. And someone needed to watch your cousin. And it was rather amazing when I met her ... I swear to you, I would guard her with my life ... my life as it is. I have been guarding her.\u201d</p><p>Tara stared at him, still speechless, feeling as if her mind had been completely numbed, encased in ice, frozen to the core.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she waking then?\u201d Tara demanded, \u201cShe is there, still sleeping, she is there ... almost as if she were ... dead.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized until that moment that Brent had let her go. She stepped back, rubbing her lower arm where it still hurt from the force of his hold. She looked from Ann, still an inert form on the bed, to the blond giant introduced as Rick, and on to Brent.</p><p>\u201cSomeone else has been to her,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, someone else?\u201d Tara asked angrily.</p><p>Rick started for the bed. Tara flew to it, standing between him and her cousin. \u201cDon\u2019t touch her! Don\u2019t you dare touch her!\u201d</p><p>Rick paused, ignoring Tara\u2019s fierce hold on his arm. He pulled back the covers and shifted Ann\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cThe marks, see the marks, Tara. I believe it must have begun some time ago. It was begun slowly and carefully. But someone else has gotten to Ann.\u201d</p><p>Tara saw the marks on her cousin\u2019s neck. So tiny ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>and yet there. She felt as if she were crumbling within. As if she were in a nightmare, and it was real, and there was no waking, and no escaping.</p><p>\u201cThen Ann is... dead?\u201d she whispered. \u201cDead, gone ... lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not necessarily,\u201d Brent said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to see that they don\u2019t get to her again,\u201d Rick Beaudreaux said. He looked at Brent</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Brent told him, watching Tara. \u201cShe\u2019s seen so much, suspected so much ... and still she doesn\u2019t want to believe anything I say.\u201d</p><p>Tara answered that by going to the balcony doors and closing them. She arranged the garlic around them again. She went to Ann\u2019s bedside, fighting tears, assuring herself that her cousin was breathing, that her heart continued to beat</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ill, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Tara asked.</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t come to soon, she will need a hospital, a transfusion,\u201d Brent said. \u201cAnd we have to keep her safe and\u2014here. And away from the force that has taken her, and certainly has some control over her now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are different ways that vampires kill,\u201d Rick said. \u201cThey feast\u2014and usually destroy the remains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecapitate their victims?\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the old stake in the heart?\u201d Tara demanded harshly.</p><p>\u201cGood, but decapitation is better. It\u2019s the only way to be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand this. How did you get here?\u201d she asked Rick.</p> <p>\u201cAnn let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn has been sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe let me in\u2014as she slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, Rick is a vampire,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Tara felt again as if black clouds were surrounding her, as if the world had become surreal, it was all a dream again, but she couldn\u2019t wake.</p><p>\u201cThen we need to destroy him, don\u2019t we?\u201d she asked harshly.</p><p>\u201cReal world 101,\u201d Brent said impatiently. \u201cThere are forces out there, have always been, will always be.</p> <p>There are those who are fighting for a realm of normalcy, for life for all, for peace if you will, for all good things. And there are forces out there where power is sought by some, where needs and selfish gains outweigh all else. Once, and actually still, always, in some place, for some reason, battles are waged.</p><p>Long ago, tribes fought for space. In the Dark Ages, tribes were constantly shifting and moving. Death and destruction were the general way of life. And later, when the civilized world encroached, warfare generally ruled. Battles have always existed for land, and for power. And in the midst of that kind of death and destruction, more death and destruction was not much noted. Even into the past century, men went to war around the globe. And into this new century, men still fight their battles in their different ways, with death and destruction still the result. So in all this time, it has been easy for many to survive on the spoils of war. But if you will, it isn\u2019t exactly true that a vampire is a shell of evil, a soulless entity.</p><p>Vampirism is like a disease, an ancient disease. One that cannot be cured, but can be controlled. And for some, the true soul remains, and a hunger for something different\u2014eternity, if you will\u2014along with the rest of humanity, a belief in a greater being, something beyond ... respect for life. Over the centuries, things change.</p><p>And now ... those who come over, who do \u2018die,\u2019 who are not slain but \u2018turned,\u2019 if you will, can be as they were in this life. Those who were prone to bloodshed hunger for greater bloodshed\u2014and power.</p><p>Everyone \u2018turned\u2019 faces the hunger. Just as we are born with free will to seek peace or vengeance, so is the change.\u201c</p><p>Tara stared at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cI was a cop,\u201d Rick said ruefully.</p><p>\u201cA cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cop in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Tara demanded.</p><p>Rick shrugged. \u201cNot so long ago,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t brought forth from some musty tomb?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m a very young vampire,\u201d he explained. \u201cUnlike Lucian.\u201d Tara\u2019s eyes shifted to Brent. \u201cSo your friend Lucian ... is an old vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery old, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was he brought from his tomb?\u201d</p><p>Brent smiled. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. He was born a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he was turned when the world was in a constant state of raids and warfare, and he has been as he has been ... since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his wife, Jade?\u201d Tara asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rick said softy.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was never \u2018turned,\u2019 \u201d Rick explained, as if that should make sense.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be real!\u201d Tara said, in a whisper of exhalation.</p><p>\u201cBut it is real, Tara,\u201d Brent said, and he waved a hand impatiently in the air. \u201cJust look at history, at the things that have gone on, at the legends that have been around forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are a vampire as well?\u201d she demanded, staring at him. \u201cYou lied to me, you said you weren\u2019t, but you\u2019re among them, and you are one of them!\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a long moment. \u201cI\u2019m not a vampire,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d She lifted a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t tell me how you\u2019re part of my grandfather\u2019s great... Alliance. I don\u2019t think that ... that ... oh, God! This is so ... insane! This woman, this one woman, came out of a tomb.</p><p>Because she wasn\u2019t destroyed completely, the king loved her, so he didn\u2019t take off her head. And now she\u2019s been dug up ... and she\u2019s running around the countryside, and the police don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re up against\u2014 except Rick here, who used to be a cop in New Orleans\u2014so some other vampires are here to stop her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Brent said. \u201cShe isn\u2019t alone. She was extremely powerful in her last life, because she had the king. She had him in her power, but she didn\u2019t kill him, because she needed him for the life she was living. But your grandfather\u2019s Alliance was alive and well back then, and the king was forced at last to do something with her. And the Alliance saw to it that at the least, she was contained, with the proper materials, lead, brass, silver, copper, and gold. And she was held fast with these materials formed into the cross on the coffin, and sealed with the molten metals. But she was brought back on purpose, by someone who decided that they must have her. There is another force at work, one that is old and very powerful, and what we haven\u2019t managed to discover is exactly who this is, and where they have created their lair.\u201d</p><p>They were crazy. It was all crazy. The thought struck Tara again, along with a need to be away from them for a moment, to be alone.</p><p>She turned and walked blindly into the hallway and then headed for her room.</p><p>She closed her door.</p><p>It opened immediately.</p><p>The two men had followed her. \u201cTara, you can\u2019t run away from any of this,\u201d Brent said. \u201cYou have to listen to me, I\u2019m trying very hard to explain, completely, why you have to do everything I say, and exactly who I am, and why\u2014\u201d</p><p>He suddenly broke off, staring across the room.</p><p>Tara looked as well, and could see nothing, just her room, bed, chairs, desk, balcony doors\u2014closed, garlic around them\u2014her suitcases in the corner, her easel, set up where she had been sketching.</p><p>She looked at Rick, who appeared as puzzled as she was herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe drawing,\u201d Brent said harshly.</p><p>She walked over to the easel. \u201cWhat? The shadows on the building? The wolf? The... sketch of the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man,\u201d he grated out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just Inspector Trusseau, the forensic specialist in from Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d She was startled when her name was called from the doorway by a soft, feminine voice.</p><p>Ann\u2019s.</p><p>She was amazed to see that her cousin was up; she was a classic, fabled beauty, pale and gaunt, clad in a flowing nightgown, holding on to the door frame.</p><p>\u201cAnn!\u201d She started to hurry to her cousin, afraid that she would fall, she appeared so ashen and fragile.</p><p>Ann waved her away.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t Inspector Trusseau,\u201d Ann said impatiently. \u201cTara, don\u2019t you ever pay attention? Don\u2019t you remember? I pointed him out to you at the cafe! That\u2019s Willem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem?\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s Willem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brent said, and she had never heard his voice harsher, or seen him so tense, for he stood there, his fists knotted at his side, his eyes transfixed upon the paper. \u201cIt isn\u2019t Trusseau, and it isn\u2019t Willem. It\u2019s Andre-son,\u201d he said, and the word spit from his lips as if the man were the greatest abomination ever to walk the earth. Evil incarnate.</p><p>He didn\u2019t explain further. He suddenly stiffened as if a bolt of lightning had traveled through him, let out an expletive, and turned, heading for the door.</p><p>Tara raced after him, catching his arm. \u201cBrent, wait! What are you talking about?\u201d He shook her off as if she were an annoying raindrop, but his eyes fell upon hers. \u201cI can\u2019t wait, I\u2019ll explain later. Your grandfather ... something is happening. Now!\u201d CHAPTER 17</p><p>Sick with worry, hurriedly Lucian entered the apartment.</p><p>Instinct informed him that whatever had happened, whatever evil had been there, was gone.</p><p>\u201cJade?\u201d He called her name, silent prayers filling his heart and mind and he looked around.</p><p>He found her, slumped on the ground, by the balcony doors. The open balcony doors. He stooped down, hands shaking as he reached out to shift his wife\u2019s hair from her face, to find her throat, feel for a pulse.</p><p>She groaned softly as he did so, rolling onto her shoulder and her back, looking up into his eyes, blinking, half rising.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Lucian! I failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSh, sh!\u201d he said, drawing her carefully into his arms, eyes searching over her for any sign of injury. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s important first is that you\u2019re all right.\u201d There was a catch to his voice, concern as he lifted her hair, ran fingers gently over her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, Lucian. I do have experience ... and I was so certain, so sure of myself. I just knew that I could protect Paul, and I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJade, it\u2019s all right. We\u2019re going to make it be all right,\u201d he amended. \u201cWhat happened? I knew ... I knew you were in trouble. I couldn\u2019t move quickly enough. I can\u2019t get into the minds of these abominations. They know I\u2019m out here, and they\u2019re using tremendous strength to block me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI kept checking on him, I kept checking on Paul every few minutes. He seemed to be doing fine. He was restless, but he seemed to understand that we had to sit tight. It was so sad, in a way, Lucian. He loves that girl so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was watching television. I was on the computer, bringing up everything I could find on the area immediately surrounding Le Petit Chateau DeVant. Anything around the church and the village. There was so much destruction there at the beginning of the Occupation. Resistance fighters had been holing up there ... and the enemy went after them. I was trying to find the exact sites of the ruins ... but I kept coming out to check. Paul fell asleep. A few minutes later ... I felt uneasy. I came back and... Lucian, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it There was someone ... something... there. But the face kept changing. I didn\u2019t know the cafe girl, I\u2019m not even certain I saw her the day we met Brent at the cafe. But, of course, it was her, because Paul was going for her, and I screamed at him to stop, and then, it seemed that it wasn\u2019t the girl ... then it was again ... and I don\u2019t know who was out there. I went rushing to the window with the holy water, and tripped in my haste and fear ... but I sprayed the creature, whoever or whatever it was...managed to enrage it, but not stop it! Suddenly there was nothing but black, a huge black shadow, or a shadow wing, and it swept out at me and sent me flying ... I was dazed ... I felt it coming again ... but it paused above me, and couldn\u2019t come closer. I have my cross, of course, and I think that I spilled half the holy water on myself, but... I heard Paul scream. I tried to struggle up, and I was knocked back down by the wing of the shadow ... and I knew that Paul was gone ... and then you were here.\u201d Lucian sat on the floor, pulling her against him. He held her tight, his chin resting lightly on top of her head.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re shape-shifting,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Yvette, the girl from the cafe. It was either Louisa ...</p><p>or whoever it is that brought her back, who is guiding her, caring for her. He has to be someone old, someone I have encountered, and someone who knows what forces to use against me, and against others who would stop him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has to be the lover,\u201d Jade said.</p><p>\u201cThe creature she was seeing when the king finally realized he was being mesmerized by a monster?\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lucian was silent a minute.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposedly he was destroyed by the Alliance, with the blessing of the Sun King.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut perhaps he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Jade said. \u201cYou knew him, and about him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew ... and at the time ... the world was different,\u201d he said.</p><p>At that time, the ancient rules had been followed, she knew. And seldom, if ever, did they destroy one of their own kind. Often, perhaps, they led mortals to the strongholds of their enemies, but the destruction of one\u2019s own kind was completely taboo.</p><p>\u201cHe might have survived,\u201d Jade repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, he might have survived. He was to have been killed, dismembered, decapitated, and thrown into the river. The king\u2019s command. But...\u201d</p><p>Lucian stood, drawing her to her feet, meeting her eyes. He lifted her hair again, worried.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t bitten,\u201d she assured him softly.</p><p>\u201cBut you were before,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAnd didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause, if I had entered your world, it would have been fine with me. I\u2019m afraid of life, of the years that will pass, as it is,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Lucian hesitated, then kissed her on the forehead. The world was a strange place. Life and death were stranger still. He had come to a point amid the centuries himself when he knew exactly what his role would be.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if the end would bring eternal damnation. And he would not risk such a fate for someone he loved with every fiber of his being. She had become more than his lover and his wife, she was his very soul.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get to Chateau DeVant,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWait I have all kinds of printouts for Jacques,\u201d Jade said.</p><p>Lucian waited while she collected the papers. He got her coat, placed it tenderly around her shoulders, then led her toward the door, but there, when he looked worriedly at her again, she spoke with a determined confidence.</p><p>\u201cHe has the answers, I know that Jacques has the answers, as soon as he is able to get through the tangle of possibilities,\u201d Jade said.</p><p>He nodded, but they both knew what lay unspoken between them.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>Lucian was afraid for her. He hadn\u2019t doubted that his presence in the area would be known. That didn\u2019t matter. He intended to make himself known.</p><p>But now ...</p><p>Besides the urgency of keeping the DeVant household safe, there would be another worry.</p><p>Jade.</p><p>She placed a hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019ve been through this. I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not,\u201d he told her, and admitted, \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to end this. Quickly,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Lucian murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that it\u2019s the old man\u2019s granddaughter who actually has the answers,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cAnd she just hasn\u2019t realized that she has them, that they\u2019re there, in her mind ... or in her dreams.\u201d He locked the door as they left the room. And he wondered why.</p><p>It was like locking the stable door after the horse had been stolen.</p><p>Louisa stood by the great hearth, leaned against the stone, watching as the flames rose and danced. As he walked into the room, she turned to him, a smile on her face, arms crossed over her chest. \u201cAll is well,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done, where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... I picked up this evening\u2019s supper, that\u2019s all,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cFrom\u2014where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ... well, I picked up a young man. From under the very nose of our enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich enemy? From where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked up a young man, from Lucian DeVeau\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, his heart leaped.\u201cAnd Lucian\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>Louisa\u2019s lashes flicked over her eyes and a look of irritation crossed her beautiful features. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring her here?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him coolly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we had her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Louisa inquired. \u201cDid you do as you said you would? Where is the DeVant girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be coming,\u201d he said. Then he reminded her, \u201cIt\u2019s the old man who must die. And it\u2019s the other granddaughter I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... as I see it, you haven\u2019t the old man, or either grandchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you managed to be a little subtle upon arising, I would have taken care of everything.\u201d Louisa smiled, and waved a hand to indicate the home he had chosen so carefully. \u201cLook around you.</p><p>Since I have come... well... we are well-guarded. We are safe. And each day, our strength grows. You cannot bring them here\u2014while they spend their days and nights searching for us! Don\u2019t worry, my love. I have arranged for such power here, you can\u2019t imagine. I have done so. So... you mustn\u2019t instruct me further. I will instruct you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou little fool! You are remembering nothing!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need to remember,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou were sealed away,\u201d he reminded her curtly. \u201cWhile I... the suffering, the healing... were agony.\u201d She lifted her chin.\u201cAnd what of the years in between, my love? You did take your time coming for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was almost impossible, you know.\u201d His irritation died suddenly. \u201cThe years in between ... were nothing. Practice for the changing times.\u201d He walked over to her, taking her into his arms. \u201cI learned how and when to use power,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAlways ... waiting for you.\u201d She smiled, stretching like a cat within his arms. \u201cI feel so very well... our little army serves me when and where and how I command. And now, night again, hours ahead, more to do ... but more time together.\u201d He bent to kiss her. Her words stopped him. \u201cYou were her lover,\u201d she said softly. He was impatient. \u201cI needed to know her.\u201d \u201cYou cared about her, you enjoyed yourself.\u201d \u201cI enjoyed myself. I did not care. I was waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe dies, the second she comes to us.\u201d \u201cShe does not die; she is bait, for the other.\u201d \u201cI will manage the second girl,\u201d Louisa said icily. \u201cI\u2014alone. Do you think I have never traveled by daylight? That I am so weak I could not follow in your steps on occasion? Did you think at all that I might not see you, as you pretended to be who you were not, as you spoke, so reasonably ... watched her as well ... hungered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is the one,\u201d he said simply. \u201cThe one who must be stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will stop her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been the one laying the trap. I will stop her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealousy has no place here,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cNeither does your lust,\u201d she replied.</p><p>He let out a sigh of impatience. \u201cLouisa! I plotted, I planned, I crept low and carefully in these surroundings, seeking to release you, longing to be with you, to rule and reign with you again, in our secret world. A dangerous world, which must be solved now ... before we move on. Let\u2019s finish them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then ... I have always loved the Caribbean in winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Caribbean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIslands, my love. With gentle breezes. And warmth. And ... no Alliance,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cThose fools, even the village police, will figure out soon enough that I\u2019m not an inspector from Paris. Of course\u201d\u2014he gave her a broad smile\u2014\u201cit might be a while, because it will take them some time to find the real Trusseau.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed, the sound husky, and in her throat</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time, then, as well, to take the offensive?\u201d He stroked the flesh on her throat \u201cPerhaps ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, then, if you wish. If you wish ... when the shadows of night have fallen, fallen really deeply.\u201d She smiled. She allowed his kiss. The fires burned, the passion between them roared to life along with it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other one?\u201d she inquired. \u201cThe\u2014 outsider.\u201d</p> <p>He was silent. She heard his jaw working. \u201cHe is part of this, don\u2019t you understand? Dogging every step, ruining your re-entry to this world. He is the enemy and that is part of why the DeVants must not die too quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew him before, didn\u2019t you? You have met, and tangled, before.\u201d He was bitterly silent for a long moment, staring at the flames. \u201cOh, yes, I knew him. And he should have died then. Just as the old man should have died. But they will die now. I will make certain. They will die now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing of this man,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than the fact that he ... he wounded me, when I was determined on entry to the DeVant house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will die a worse death, for what he has done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will not die easily,\u201d she said, reflecting on her encounter with the man in question.</p><p>\u201cYou forget\u2014I know what he is. And I know how to kill what he is\u2014so actually, when I choose, yes, he will die easily enough. This time. I am prepared.\u201d</p> <p>They were both somewhat startled by a thumping sound. They stared at one another, and then Louisa laughed.</p><p>\u201cDinner is growing restless, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said.</p><p>She stood in all her beauty before the fire, and reached her hand to him. \u201cCome love. Shall we dress for supper? Or be casual tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasual, I think,\u201d he said.</p><p>For a moment they locked together in an embrace. She drew away.</p><p>\u201cCasual it is,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI confess, childish though it may be, I do so love to play with my food.\u201d Though she ran in his wake, Brent was down the stairs long before Tara. And when she came down to the great hall and entry, he was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Jacques, however, was there, standing at the open door.</p><p>Javet had come.</p> <p>Tara raced up behind Jacques, putting her arm around his shoulder, staring indignantly at the police officer. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have all the necessary papers, Miss Adair. And I am not here alone. I have six patrolmen with me.</p><p>Now, you will let me in.\u201d</p><p>She stood her ground. \u201cYou are not coming in. You have been fooled, Inspector, and this is not where you should be looking! Your man from Paris isn\u2019t who he says he is at all. If you want answers, go question him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Javet demanded.</p><p>\u201cInspector Trusseau isn\u2019t who he has said that he is. He\u2014he works at my cousin\u2019s publishing company.</p><p>He\u2019s not even a salesman. He took that job only to be around, to watch what was going on. He is some kind of a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA monster,\u201d Javet repeated, shaking his head. He looked at Jacques again. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to start talking, Monsieur DeVant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavet, if I told you what I know, you wouldn\u2019t believe me,\u201d Jacques said wearily. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about this Inspector Trusseau, but if my granddaughter says that he is not who he claims to be, then he is not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is rubbish. He came with all the proper documerits. If he had been lurking in the village, I\u2019d have seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in the village most of the time\u2014the publishing company is in Paris,\u201d Tara said with aggravation. \u201cHe is an imposter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA monster?\u201d Javet said again.</p><p>\u201cYou are up against monsters,\u201d Jacques said, and hesitated. \u201cMonsters ... murderers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about this, this ... this plague upon us! Knew about the murder in the crypt before it took place,\u201d Javet said angrily.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cThere is nothing I can tell you that you would believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jacques. But I have the papers and authority to arrest you. Unless, of course, you know where the American is. Perhaps, if you were to turn him over to me ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tara said in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather is under arrest, because I am going to get somewhere with this investigation. Too many people are dying or disappearing! Now, no more excuses or fairy tales. You\u2019re coming to the station with me, Jacques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He is not coming with you\u2014\u201d Tara protested.</p><p>\u201cI will use force, if I have to do so,\u201d Javet said. \u201cDamn you all, there has been another headless body discovered, and the investigation in the city has come up with even more missing people. You know about this, and whatever is going on here, it must be stopped. Jacques, you are under arrest At the station, we may get to the bottom of this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t know where Brent had been, but now he walked in the door. He stared at Javet \u201cTake me in.</p><p>You wanted me, Javet? Here I am. Bring me in. Let him alone.\u201c</p><p>\u201cHell, yes! I\u2019ll take you in. I suspected that you were lurking here,\u201dJavet said. \u201cYes, yes .. .Jacques can have a reprieve. I will bring you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll confess to the murder\u2014to any murder. Just leave Jacques alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not guilty of any murder!\u201d Jacques said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cI can arrest you both,\u201d Javet told him.</p><p>\u201cLeave Monsieur DeVant,\u201d Brent said. \u201cTake me. I will talk to you until you are weary of listening.</p><p>Javet, Jacques is ill. If he dies in your custody\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Javet said. \u201cYou come with me.\u201d He stared at Tara and Jacques. \u201cBut if Monsieur Malone cannot convince me that he\u2014and he alone\u2014is a killer, I will be back. And then, there will be nothing to stop me until I get to the absolute truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrent can\u2019t go,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cIt is better if you take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not bartering here, or choosing straws!\u201d Javet exploded.</p><p>\u201cJacques,\u201d Brent said, placing a hand on his shoulder. \u201cIt will be all right.\u201d Tara was frightened. What would happen when he left? She would be alone then, with these terrible things going on, with a stranger who had been introduced as a vampire, who had been bending over her cousin, who was now ashen and failing.</p><p>But as she stood there shaking, desperate for something to say or do, he turned his eyes on her. And she was startled by the gold fire in them, filled with both emotion and strength, and the assurance she needed.</p><p>\u201cIt will honestly be all right,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>She moistened her lips, trying to nod. Javet took Brent by the arm, leading him out, calling to one of his men for handcuffs. When they were nearly at Javet\u2019s car, she ran after him. She ignored the other officers and came before him, placing her hands on his shoulders, rising on her toes. \u201cI believe in you,\u201d she whispered softly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you ... I don\u2019t know why you left us ... I love you... rather asinine, since you walked away this morning ... I\u2019ll do something ... I\u2019ll get you out, quickly, somehow.\u201d She was startled by the smile that curled his lips. \u201cYou were never alone. Rick was always watching.</p><p>And you\u2019re actually more important than I am. And I love you, too. Don\u2019t worry about me. Lucian will come ... and I will get out myself. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Javet asked with aggravation. \u201cMiss Adair, I\u2019m about to arrest you, too. And you won\u2019t be in the same cell, I can assure you!\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. She watched as they got into the police car. Then she realized that her grandfather stood alone in an empty doorway, and she rushed back. He was shaking. \u201cCome on, Grandpapa, come on, let me get you into a chair, get your feet up, get you some brandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2014she\u2019s okay. A friend is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the new one ...\u201d Jacques murmured. \u201cRick. Another American.\u201d She frowned. Even Jacques had known about the man.</p><p>She paused, closing and locking the door, placing the garlic around it She walked slowly with him back to the library, wondering why Javet had chosen a time of darkness to come and make an arrest at the chateau.</p><p>She had to admit to being very afraid. She couldn\u2019t let Jacques know.</p><p>Katia came running in from the kitchen then, aware that she had missed something, and at a loss as to know what. \u201cHelp me get my grandfather back to the library, please,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cI will get brandy for him,\u201d she assured Tara, once Jacques was seated. When Katia returned with the brandy, Tara found herself uneasy about the two upstairs. She asked Katia to stay with Jacques for a moment, swearing that she\u2019d be right back. She raced up the stairs, going first to her room, but neither man was there. She went running back to Ann\u2019s room. Her cousin was back in bed. The tall, blond, muscular American was seated in a chair by her side, his hands folded prayer fashion as he looked at her.</p><p>He gazed at Tara as she entered, gave her a grim smile. \u201cShe is all right,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut she mustn\u2019t be left alone. Not for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve taken Brent in\u2014the police have taken him in,\u201d she said.</p><p>Rick nodded. \u201cI know ... I saw some of what happened, but I couldn\u2019t... didn\u2019t dare leave Ann. He\u2019ll be all right, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u2014he isn\u2019t a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Rick seemed to skip a beat before answering her. \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing. He\u2019ll be all right. He\u2019ll manage on his own, or Lucian will step in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian isn\u2019t here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s old. Very, very, old. And can sense trouble. He can enter into minds ... he\u2019ll know, trust me.\u201d She stared at him. She didn\u2019t even really know him\u2014 and she was supposed to trust him. But these bizarre things were growing easier. Because, she had, of course, gone completely to the flip side of sanity.</p> <p>She believed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe wait. See to your grandfather. I\u2019m watching Ann.\u201d</p><p>As Tara started back down the stairs, there was a knock at the front door.</p><p>Katia came rushing out from the library. Tara shook her head at her. She walked to the door herself and looked through the peephole.</p><p>She exhaled, fought with the demons of logic and sanity still lurking within her mind, and opened the door.</p> <p>Lucian and Jade entered.</p><p>Tara opened her mouth to speak, to explain the current situation, but she didn\u2019t need to do so.</p><p>Lucian spoke. \u201cThey left just minutes ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJade will stay here. I\u2019m going. Listen, it\u2019s imperative that you all be incredibly careful. Every window, every door, must remain sealed. Don\u2019t leave. You understand?\u201d She nodded.</p><p>\u201cRick is here, of course,\u201d Jade reminded Lucian.</p><p>Lucian glanced at his wife. \u201cRick needs to stay in, too. He\u2019s got incredible courage and spirit, but he\u2019s still so young... inexperienced,\u201d he added, looking at Tara. He smiled. \u201cIt will be all right. I\u2019ll be back with Brent And while we\u2019re gone, just sit tight. Get in there with Jacques, and... Tara, I think that you can perhaps find what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJade will explain. I\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said.</p><p>He turned, and was gone. Jade closed the door behind him. She looked awkwardly at Tara, shrugged and smiled. \u201cWell... what we need to do is find their lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir lair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian can ... feel where others are. But, naturally, they\u2019re blocking him. Probably setting all kinds of traps, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. We have to find them. We\u2019ve spent a great deal of our time here looking. Following their trail. But... we haven\u2019t found the right place yet. It\u2019s going to be what appears to be an old ruin, but is actually sound. And hidden, far off the beaten path ... hidden by nature, trees, vines, foliage. Do you know such a place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I think I know of several. When we were children, sometimes we\u2019d take turns riding our horse, Daniel, into the woods. We\u2019d come upon all kinds of places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in with your grandfather. And start studying the maps again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tara said softly. She led the way to the library door, and they entered together. Jacques looked gaunt, but determined. He already had maps spread out on the desk. He greeted Jade with a question in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLucian has gone for Brent,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m sure he would have been fine on his own, but ... it\u2019s important that we\u2019re all together. Lucian will bring him back quickly.\u201d Jacques stretched out a thin arm, curling his fingers around Jade\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd you\u2019re all right?\u201d She nodded. \u201cHumbled, but unhurt,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI\u2014I lost one of our witnesses,\u201d she said sorrowfully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Tara told them both.</p><p>Jade explained what had happened at the hotel, whom she had been guarding, and why. And how she had failed.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we can save him yet,\u201d Jacques said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Jade said.</p><p>Jacques looked up. \u201cNow that my granddaughter has joined us, I know that we will find the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa, how can you be so certain I can help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you ... I\u2019m old and failing now. And there is always one in the family who is meant to come ... and the new strength in the Alliance. It is you, Tara.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI ... I don\u2019t think so at all, Grandpapa! I barely believe any of this, as yet!\u201d He smiled and shrugged to Jade. \u201cTara, look at the map. What do you think? Tell me what you know, what you remember, from the time you were a child.\u201d</p><p>She came around his shoulder and pointed. \u201cThere\u2019s what we all called the Giant Rock. It really isn\u2019t giant at all\u2014it\u2019s just what we called it as children. Here, here are ruins,\u201d she told them. \u201cBut truly crumbled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been there,\u201d Jade said. \u201cAnd the basement is caved in.\u201d Tara looked at her.</p><p>\u201cI looked it all up on the Internet Found the owners, the date when it was condemned, and the original blueprints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tara said. \u201cHow logical.\u201d She looked back at</p><p>the map. \u201cHere ... this ... if I remember correctly, this is the old Dupre House. We couldn\u2019t even reach the house itself on the horse, the area in front is so overgrown.\u201d She fell silent, closing her eyes, as a rush of ice seemed to envelop her.</p><p>The Dupre House!</p><p>Suddenly, childhood memories combined with the haunting images of her dreams. The shadow wings had thrown her off ... she had only ever gone there in daylight as a child. They\u2019d never been allowed to stay out with the horse in the countryside when it was close to dusk.</p><p>She started to open her mouth, to explain the past, and her dream, but she never got a chance. From outside, with the suddenness of a bomb explosion, noises began to rattle the night Eleanora began to howl as if she were a wolf pack in herself, baying, barking, letting out a cry to the moon once again.</p><p>And it sounded as if the stables had imploded; old Daniel was kicking at his wooden stall.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name ... ?\u201d Tara whispered.</p><p>Katia came bursting into the library, wringing her hands. \u201cI have told him no! I have told him no, but he ignored me! Roland grabbed the gun and went running out. And it\u2019s out there, I know it\u2019s out there ... I saw it! What do we do, Jacques, what do we do? Roland has gone out.\u201d Tara rushed to Katia. \u201cKatia, calm down, please\u2014 what did you see?\u201d Even as she spoke, Tara saw something ...</p><p>Something she couldn\u2019t describe. It was as if the room darkened. Lamplight flickered, and grew dimmer.</p><p>As if great shadow wings were sweeping over the house ...</p><p>\u201cKatia, please, what did you see?\u201d</p><p>Katia drew away from her.</p><p>\u201cEvil! I saw evil!\u201d Then the housekeeper clutched her shoulders. \u201cEvil, Tara, and you must feel it... I can feel it... it is as if it has entered the house!\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, the lamplight flickered.</p><p>In the hearth, the flames suddenly rose high ...</p><p>And then died.</p><p>At the same time, the flickering electricity gave a last faint glow ... and then went dead as well.</p><p>They were cast into darkness.</p><p>Just as the stygian night fell upon them, an ear-shattering scream sounded from the courtyard beyond the door.</p><p>And the dog began to howl and bay again ...</p><p>Until that sound, too, was suddenly silenced.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Brent sat quietly in the back of the police car, keeping still, offering no resistance. When they arrived at the village station, he followed along as he was told. He wasn\u2019t directed to take the chair in front of Javet\u2019s desk as he had previously done. He was led to a room with a table and chairs, no windows, and just one door. He was aware that the side with the one-way glass led to another chamber, where other officers could watch his movements and hear his words.</p><p>He was left there alone for a moment. Then Javet came in and sat across from him. \u201cCoffee, cigarettes?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Javet pushed a pack of his own brand across the table. He motioned for one of his officers to go out The man returned with coffee. Javet still stared at him.</p><p>At last he spoke.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Tell me what happened. Start with the night in the crypt. Or before, if you wish. But, perhaps it will be easiest if you begin with the murder of Jean-Luc. You had to have had an accomplice. That\u2019s the only way you could have gotten rid of the contents of the coffin that was excavated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contents of the coffin excavated themselves\u2014 and killed Jean-Luc,\u201d he said.</p><p>Javet paused in the lighting of his cigarette, looking over at him. \u201cThe contents of the coffin ... the corpse, after hundreds of years, rose and killed your coworker?\u201d Javet said with disgust.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou admitted to the murder. You are here to confess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you what I know.\u201d</p><p>Javet rose, swearing, knocking his chair over as he did so. \u201cThat is bull!\u201d The man was furious. Every vein in his neck stood out, and Brent was well aware that the police officer was doing everything in his power not to jump over the table and throw his fists against him.</p><p>But he was a good police officer; he found the restraint. Hands balled into fists, he turned away.</p><p>He spoke at last. \u201cFor tonight, we will leave Mr. Malone in his cell, and give him time to think about his answers. If he can\u2019t find more information than such ridiculous lies to give me, I will have to bring in the old man.\u201d</p><p>His back straight, he walked out of the interrogation room. A minute later, one of his officers took Brent\u2019s cigarette and coffee, and indicated he should rise.</p><p>That night, he was the only prisoner at the small station. His cell was spare, but clean and neat. Once he was inside, the door was locked. The officers left him.</p><p>He sat on the bunk for a minute, waited, leaned his head back, and hoped that Javet had left for the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t stay. He hadn\u2019t Lucian\u2019s powers, but even he was suddenly afraid that they were running out of time.</p><p>He lit one of his own cigarettes, smoked it, crushed it out.</p><p>Then closed his eyes.</p> <p>A moment later, a terrible sound erupted from the cell. In the anteroom, two of the skeleton night crew in the station, standing at the desk, stared at one another. Officers Deauville and d\u2019Artoine were both young, new to the force, thus drawing the late night hours.</p><p>They drew their weapons, and went rushing into the hall where the four small cells were situated.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d Deauville said.</p><p>\u201cNo ... no, there\u2019s something in there,\u201d d\u2019Artoine said.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the cot.\u201d</p><p>Deauville unlocked the door to the cell. Both men walked in cautiously, their weapons aimed. Deauville stared where d\u2019Artoine had directed. He saw nothing but...</p><p>Eyes. Gold. Glittering. Lethal. Like the eyes of a ... demon.</p><p>He swallowed hard, wetting his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cA ... dog?\u201d d\u2019Artoine said hesitantly.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s no dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the prisoner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscaped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot it?\u201d</p><p>As they debated, the creature in question suddenly sprang to life. All d\u2019Artoine knew before the thing landed on him, knocking his weapon to the floor, was that it was huge and powerful. He screamed, certain that he was about to be killed.</p><p>The weight lifted from him. He was aware of noise. It was Deauville, at his side, still screaming.</p> <p>He hit Deauville. \u201cIt\u2019s out!\u201d</p><p>They both leaped to their feet, rushing to the front of the station. Other officers were milling there, looking around anxiously.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d someone called.</p><p>\u201cA beast!\u201d d\u2019Artoine said, and realized how ridiculous he sounded. \u201cI don\u2019t know, some kind of an animal.\u201d</p><p>The door to the street suddenly opened. The men all straightened as the man from Paris walked in.</p><p>Trusseau. He looked around at them, contempt in his eyes. But then, he always seemed to have contempt in his eyes. He was from Paris. They were just villagers. Inept</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Deauville had accompanied Javet and his arrest warrant to the DeVant chateau. And he narrowed his eyes suddenly, remembering that the American granddaughter had been saying that Trusseau was an impostor.</p><p>And now, he wondered. It wasn\u2019t impossible, even if the girl had been saying anything to save her grandfather, and her lover.</p><p>Of course, it was the American digger, the woman\u2019s lover, who was now gone, and who had somehow left some kind of a beast in his stead.</p><p>Still...</p><p>\u201cWe are looking for a creature, some kind of beast, which has gotten loose in the station,\u201d he said to Trusseau.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Trusseau said. \u201cA beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It is here, somewhere. You must take care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will,\u201d Trusseau said.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a weapon, Inspector Trusseau\u2014that is your name, sir, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it my name?\u201d The man seemed amused, but he didn\u2019t reply to the question. Instead, he said, \u201cI carry my own weapon. Where is this beast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere ... somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Whether he was an impostor or not, Trusseau seemed willing to look for the beast. He drew his weapon, a gleaming silver pistol of a make with which Deauville was not familiar, and backed against the wall.</p><p>There was silence as they barely breathed, and waited.</p><p>There was a clanking sound from the far wall. They all spun around. Two men fired. Chunks of concrete and stone spewed from the wall.</p><p>Then there was a sudden burst of... something.</p><p>Something huge, moving with the speed of light It leaped over and past them, charging straight for the station door. They were all taken by such surprise that instead of firing too quickly as they had before, they fired too late.</p><p>All except for Trusseau. His gun went off.</p><p>The door, however, had gone down.</p><p>The creature was off in the street...</p><p>Leaving a trail of blood.</p><p>Trusseau smiled at them.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll hunt down your beast\u201d Deauville decided to take it upon himself to discover the truth. He kept seeing the American girl. Tall and slim, so beautiful, and so indignant and well spoken, even as she argued so passionately for her grandfather.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, sir. I think we can catch the beast on our own. You\u2019ve been accused of being an impostor, sir. I\u2019d like you to remain here while we give a call to the Paris office.\u201d Trusseau lifted a brow. He smiled.</p><p>Then he lifted his weapon, and aimed at Deauville.</p><p>\u201cSir, what the hell\u2014?\u201d d\u2019Artoine began.</p><p>Trusseau\u2019s bullet exploded in the night.</p><p>Tara fumbled at the fireplace, finding the long matches that lit the logs. As she did so, Jade DeVeau produced a flashlight.</p><p>\u201cRoland!\u201d Katia said in a wail.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m going for him,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve more experience,\u201d Jade said. \u201cI\u2019m going out You\u2019re too valuable here right now, Tara. I\u2019ll find Roland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Eleanora,\u201d Tara said softly. \u201cBut you can\u2019t go out there alone.\u201d They all jumped as a rich masculine voice with a deep Southern accent suddenly interrupted them. Rick Beaudreaux made his way into the room. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, I\u2019m going out. But Tara, get up there with Ann right away. And Jade, you stay here with Jacques and Katia.\u201d Both Tara and Jade were ready to argue.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m the best one for the job!\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going up to Ann right now,\u201d Tara told her grandfather. She cast Rick a glance, then went racing up the stairs. She tripped, trying to go too fast in the darkness. She had to catch herself on the stairs.</p><p>She stopped at the hall closet, feeling her way to open it, and finding the large battery-powered lantern they kept there for emergencies.</p><p>Her hands curled around it. She quickly turned on the light and headed for Ann\u2019s room. The door to the hallway was closed. She reached for it, then felt a sense of dread filling her. She paused, then threw it open.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need the lantern in Ann\u2019s room.</p><p>The balcony doors and drapes were open. Moonlight was pouring in.</p><p>The drapes drifted in a ghostly field of moonlight. The air that rushed in was cold.</p><p>The bed where Ann had lain was empty.</p><p>She walked to it disbelieving. \u201cAnn!\u201d she cried softly, looking to the balcony. But her cousin was gone.</p><p>Just barely gone.</p><p>There was a note on the bed. Next to several drops of blood.</p><p>It read:</p><p>She has perhaps ten minutes to live. Unless she is saved, of course. By the new Alliance. Such sweet blood. Perhaps I cannot wait so long.</p><p>He limped, cursing himself, gritting his teeth, praying for the strength he needed\u2014just for that night.</p><p>Well, at last he had seen him again. And while he hadn\u2019t known that Andreson had been behind the evil in the village, Andreson had definitely known that he was there. He had come prepared with the right weapon.</p><p>The only weapon ...</p><p>He slunk into a side street. After his escape, it seemed that all hell had broken loose at the police station.</p><p>Officers were running all over the street. The only thing he could do was find the darkest alley, and pray that he could stanch his own wound.</p><p>But as he sat against the wall, listening to the shouts and pounding footsteps all around him, he became aware of the shadows overtaking even the darkness. For a moment, he tensed. If Andreson were to find him now ...</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Lucian was there, kneeling beside him.</p><p>\u201cAndreson is here, and damned bold at that,\u201d Brent said dryly. \u201cWalked right into the police station\u2014and took a shot at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d done something yourself to rile them all up,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding like a stuck pig\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, he got me with a silver bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re slowing down, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get the damned thing out,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Lucian pulled a knife from his jacket pocket, flicked it open, and dug in. Brent gritted his teeth, nearly crying out at the pain.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cNone too gently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed it out, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Lucian sat back on his haunches. \u201cHe isn\u2019t around here anymore,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Brent struggled to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to the chateau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be about worthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... and anyway, about worthless isn\u2019t totally worthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that he isn\u2019t around here anymore. The chateau ... well, Rick is there, I know, but Andreson knows a hell of a lot more tricks than a young fellow like your Southern friend. We\u2019ve got to get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, take my hand.\u201d</p><p>Brent struggled to his feet. He swallowed hard. \u201cGo\u2014 ahead of me. I\u2019ll catch up. I don\u2019t want them there alone.\u201d</p><p>Lucian didn\u2019t argue with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is it? You know there\u2019s something wrong there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a sudden sense of darkness. I know the man as someone other than Andreson, but if he was here</p><p>...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she might have been at the house,\u201d Brent said. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>Lucian was already on his way.</p><p>Brent paused, bitterly resenting every moment it took to summon his strength. At last, he closed his eyes, and found the power to move. He went silently through the village streets, avoiding the prowling officers.</p><p>At length, he came to the outskirts beyond the square, started out along the road, and felt the light of the moon upon him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He began to run.</p><p>Tara shot back down the stairs, not pausing to find the others in the library, but bursting outside the front door, shrieking her cousin\u2019s name.</p><p>There was no answer. The driveway was locked in shadow; clouds covered the moon. She called and shouted. There was no sign of Rick, Roland, the dog, or anyone.</p> <p>She raced back into the house, bursting into the library. Jade stood guard, literally, straight and tall, posed behind her grandfather\u2019s desk chair.</p><p>She paused for a deep breath, wet her lips, and told Jacques, \u201cThey\u2019ve got Ann.\u201d She was so sorry. His entire face went gray, and seemed to sink within. He might have been a skeleton with leftover flesh, watching her.</p><p>\u201cLucian will be back; Brent will be back.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara, no!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill her if I don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going alone,\u201d Jacques said.</p><p>\u201cGrandpapa! You can\u2019t come with me. Then I\u2019d have to worry about your life as well as my own.\u201d Jade was shaking her head. \u201cYou know nothing yet, Tara. You know nothing at all. You haven\u2019t the experience\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better give me a quick lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. God knows where Rick is, or what happened with Roland, and I\u2019m still certain that Jacques is in terrible danger. And now ... now that we\u2019ve come to this, I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d It was the most preposterous lie she had ever told in her life, but she could see no other way to get her cousin back.</p> <p>\u201cLook, supposedly I\u2019m genetically primed to do this, to go after these people. So if you want to help me, tell me quickly what I need to know. Jacques\u2014I drew a picture upstairs. It turned out to be a man Ann had been dating, as well as the man who claimed to be from the Paris police, as well as someone Brent seemed to know from somewhere else. If you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>She had thought that her grandfather looked half-dead before. Now, he was the color of pure ash.</p><p>\u201cAndre-son!\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cAndreson ... who is Andreson?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA true monster. He was head of the medical experiments when I was in the prison camp during the war. He ran the place. Naturally, of course, I knew later. He was constantly glutted, there was a chance for such rich carnage during the war! No crueller commandant ever existed, no one, not even among a field of monsters, was so heinous. But at the end ... his cruelty brought about his death. Or so I had thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe war ... Jacques, how does Brent know about this man, then?\u201d Her grandfather looked at her.</p><p>\u201cBrent Malone was Andreson\u2019s favorite experiment, and there was nothing he enjoyed more than trying to solve the riddle of his survival, and what he had become.\u201d She felt ill. Brent had lied to her. It was impossible. If he wasn\u2019t a\u2014vampire, one among them, how could he have lived back during the war?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Tell me quickly. Brent couldn\u2019t have been in the war. He\u2019d be old now, really old now. He said that he wasn\u2019t a vampire, he told me twice that he wasn\u2019t a vampire\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not,\u201d Jacques said.</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d</p><p>Ann DeVant lay on the sofa, eyes open but unfocused. Louisa stared down at the woman, hating her.</p><p>She longed to strike right then and there. Slide her teeth deep into the woman\u2019s throat\u2014so white against that spill of dark hair\u2014tear into her, rip her to shreds, draining every last drop of blood from her body.</p><p>She forced herself to move away from the girl.</p><p>Gerard had said that she must live, and it was true\u2014 she was the bait to get the other, and now, Tara DeVant would have to come, of course. She was certain that Gerard would have killed the wolf by now.</p><p>And Lucian was busy seeking the body of the wolf...</p><p>It had all been so well planned. The only torture was now ... waiting. And hating the girl, of course.</p><p>She stood over her again. Jealousy was eating at her, consuming her. Actually, when the time came, she wanted to kill the girl in front of Gerard. Wanted to see that she meant nothing to him, that she could be drained, used up ... and discarded like refuse.</p><p>She felt his arrival. Sweeping black shadows that she knew long before they touched her.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, but there was a hesitation.</p><p>Louisa said angrily, \u201cDid you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, I struck him with a silver bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you saw his body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead! Don\u2019t you understand? I hit him with a silver bullet\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said, \u201cthat he was the one to ruin things when you should have been there to welcome me from the coffin. That he wormed his way into a job with Professor Dubois, and was watching, waiting, all along.</p><p>He was the one who summoned Lucian, and the one determined again to find Jacques DeVant and seek out what information he had ... and he is the one who has created so much trouble all along. And you did not see his body!\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt does not matter, I tell you. I struck him with a silver bullet\u201d She studied him for a moment. \u201cI thought you would have been more determined on being certain that he was dead. After what you tell me that he did to you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was ten years before my injuries even began to heal,\u201d Gerard said bitterly. \u201cHe tore me to shreds. He came back for the prisoners. When they were freed, they stabbed and shot me, hung me up like a slaughtered steer. DeVant knew that I should have been decapitated, and he would have seen to the deed himself, but that\u2019s when the fires began, and he was forced to run. To take that traitor, Weiss, and get the hell out. Weiss! I never found that sniveling little coward, either. He was never prosecuted\u2014prisoners defended him! He went to America and lived in peace and plenty and died at the age of ninety-nine. Yes, I loathe and despise Brent Malone! I should have finished him off when he was brought in, but he was the only one to withstand the onslaught of the wolves. There were many more then. They attacked both the Allies and Axis soldiers, heedless of their uniforms. They left a field of devastation worse than that of any bomb or slaughter. But he was alive. And I knew he\u2019d be one of them. And I wanted to know what caused it\u2014what made him stronger, what made him weaker. What caused him the most pain ... he is dead! I know that I hit him. And ...\u201d His voice trailed away. He saw Ann prone upon the couch. He walked over to her. Louisa was certain that he stared down at the girl with the greatest affection.</p><p>Louisa sat on the couch, running her fingers along the bare length of Ann\u2019s arm as she looked up at Gerard.</p><p>\u201cLet me kill her ... now. Watch me kill her ... now. We can share her, but I must confess. I tasted her blood when I shape-shifted to you, luring her to the balcony. Delicious. And I\u2019m still so hungry. But if you wish ...\u201d</p><p>He drew her to her feet. \u201cNot now!\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our chance to take them, one by one. Tara DeVant will come. She will have to come alone ... the others will be too far behind. You left the note\u2014as I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. So there is no reason to keep her alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is every reason. She may have real talent. An instinct deeper even than that in the old man. She\u2019s young\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t the least idea of her own powers. She doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may know if her cousin is dead, and then she may not come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that she is coming already,\u201d Louisa said, licking her lips, looking at Ann.</p><p>\u201cWe have all manner of creatures from which you may take greater nourishment\u2014or entertain yourself.</p><p>Leave her be. For now.\u201d</p><p>Louisa returned to the fire.</p><p>\u201cFine. But when Tara arrives, I will deal with her. You will wait for Lucian\u2019s arrival\u2014and he will arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she is not so easy as you seem to think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy love, we have a little army ready to greet her when she arrives. She will be half-dead when they finish. I will merely deliver the final blows.\u201d</p><p>Jacques had spoken quickly, almost tonelessly, trying to explain how he had come to know Brent Malone. How Brent Malone, under the care of Doctor Weiss, had survived, how he had returned to the camp to rip it apart before anymore prisoners could be executed, and how he and Weiss had, in turn, taken care of him.</p><p>Taught him the ways of the Alliance.</p><p>She had listened for several minutes, listened as if hearing an impossible fairy tale. Then she had glanced at her watch and said, \u201cNone of this matters. They\u2019re going to kill Ann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that Lucian will be here. Any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when he arrives, you must send him after me. You know now exactly where to send him. But I must get there first.\u201d</p><p>The argument had already been won, she knew. Katia had been useless\u2014she had taken a seat in an overstuffed chair where she sat and moaned and rocked to and fro, almost as if she were catatonic. But Jade had acquired everything her grandfather had said she needed, and she was ready. Her faith would always be her greatest protection, Jacques told her. Her faith, and her gold cross. Unless she had buckets of holy water, she could only burn and scald them with it, but not bring them down completely.</p><p>She was armed with a stake that Jacques had owned since his father had given it to him when he was a boy, and a newer weapon for backup. She was also armed with his army sword, sharpened to perfection, as apparently he had kept it, always. She had understood that heads must be removed, or that corpses must be burned beyond recognition.</p><p>Afraid, she set out, driving as far as she could.</p><p>Then she set off through the woods.</p><p>And it was her dream again ...</p><p>Darkness, incredible darkness. Shadows broken only by the light of the moon, and that disappearing far too often, as if the clouds were conspirators along with the vampires. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt the wet grass against her ankles. Felt the coolness of the air, which wasn\u2019t the natural coolness of the breeze. Something more.</p><p>Some part of the darting, changing, shifting shadows.</p><p>With each step, she felt a greater dread. She knew that the house lay just before her. That she was walking toward it, though she longed to run away.</p> <p>A silent plea escaped her.</p><p>Help me, please, come, help me . . .</p><p>She knew now, knew far too much. Knew what lay in the shadows, stretching before her. Knew to whom she cried for help.</p><p>But he was in jail. He had gone to jail to keep them from incarcerating her grandfather. She had realized, so late, that they hadn\u2019t just known each other. They had formed a bond. They had saved one another\u2019s lives. They had taught one another, they had learned to live through one another.</p><p>He had let them take him, so that they would not hurt Jacques. He had said that it would be all right, that he would be all right. . .</p> <p>But he wasn\u2019t here!</p><p>And she was walking. . .</p><p>Walking alone . . .</p><p>A strange birdcall sounded in the night. Not a birdcall at all. It was the breeze picking up. Growing stronger, colder, louder.</p><p>Her name came to her on the breeze.</p><p>Tara . . . Tara . . . Tara . . .</p> <p>Darkness descended deeper ... deeper ... deeper ...</p><p>There were footsteps behind her. Furtive. Stealthy. She walked, she stopped, she turned. And there was nothing, no one, just the fleeting shadows.</p><p>Cold, she shivered. She gripped the stake she carried fiercely in both hands, so fiercely that her fingers were knotting and cramping. It was harder and harder to walk, to make herself go forward. There was darkness ahead, and then light, and then shadow wings falling over the illumination, and laughter, and her name ...</p><p>Close, she was so close to the house.</p><p>She heard whisking sounds that chilled her, for it felt as if the shadows were real, real and cold, and they passed by her and touched her, an evil, menacing caress, calling to her, taunting her, teasing her.</p><p>Her dream, her nightmare, oh, God, she was living it. . .</p><p>She nearly stopped, ready to drop to the earth, throw her hands over her head, and do nothing but scream and pray for the light.</p><p>But Ann was in there.</p> <p>And so she kept following the footsteps ...</p><p>Of her dream.</p><p>She reached the house. Ivy hung around it, nearly obscuring the facade. But a fire burned within. A fire that soared in the hearth, ripping and tearing against the walls, and creating a new realm of shape and form and shadow.</p><p>As she neared it...</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>The breeze whispered her name again.</p><p>Tara, Tara, Tara . . . come in . . .</p><p>We\u2019ve been waiting. Waiting for you.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>The house was as she had seen it. Exquisite ancient furniture. Paintings on the walls. Paintings of depraved scenes and acts, executions, bloodshed, orgies... paintings in vivid colors, paintings with fires that seemed as real as that which burned in the hearth.</p><p>She looked around her carefully, for the strange noises and brushes of air seemed to sweep by her and touch her with an ever greater frequency. She knew that she had to go down the hallway.</p><p>Saw it.</p><p>Saw the dark, and saw the light.</p><p>And the first door that she knew she must open.</p><p>Her hand trembled upon the doorknob. The feel of her own flesh against cold metal was real. But everything in the dream had always been real as well. And still she knew that this was different, and for a moment, she stood trembling, seized with an absolute panic. She hadn\u2019t believed any of it ... and here she was, alone, facing fears beyond comprehension, and it was ridiculous that she was here. Ridiculous that such creatures could exist, that there could be vampires ... and werewolves, and that she was desperately praying that one of the two would arrive quickly, because it seemed that it was all true, and she was horribly afraid that she wasn\u2019t up to the task.</p><p>Jacques seemed to have faith. She was the one to inherit the strain of the Alliance. And what did that give her? A determination to die foolishly?</p><p>If she ran now, they would only come after her. Even if she escaped, she would fail, and her cousin would die.</p><p>Or worse.</p><p>She forced her fingers to twist the knob. The sound of the door creaking open was hideously loud, ripping and tearing her nerves.</p><p>She stepped back quickly, certain that something would spring at her, that the body parts would be waiting to form together, to come after her. But when she opened the door, she at first saw nothing.</p><p>Then, from beside the bed, a woman rose.</p><p>Young. Not Louisa. Tara had never seen her before.</p><p>She was naked. She looked at Tara as if it were the most natural thing in the world that someone had walked in on her. She stretched, lifted her long hair to let it fall back again upon her shoulders. Then she looked at Tara, smiling salaciously. \u201cHello ... shall we play? I love to play, love to play ...\u201d One sultry step after another, she came toward Tara. Tara stared at her, tense, afraid, wondering if she was a prisoner, poor, pathetic, needing an escape, or if...</p><p>When she was almost upon Tara, the girl opened her mouth. An eerie hissing sound escaped from her.</p><p>She had fangs... the size of a saber-toothed tiger\u2019s, or so it seemed. Tara prayed desperately that she wouldn\u2019t falter.</p><p>She slammed the stake into the girl\u2019s chest, bit her lip, nearly doubled over. She forced herself to take the sword into her hands. She had to look away to deliver the first blow.</p><p>It didn\u2019t sever the head.</p><p>She had to take another whack, and as she did so, she heard herself protesting. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d was coming from her own lips. A slow keening. And then ... the head rolled away.</p><p>She stared at her own handiwork, shaking once again. There was very little blood. She hadn\u2019t known what to expect That the body would become a pile of ash, and disappear in a sudden breeze? It did not.</p><p>It lay on the ground in its mangled pieces.</p><p>Even as she stood there, staring, she felt the tension, the cramping in her fingers, for she still held Jacques\u2019 war sword. She swallowed hard, bent down, and pulled the stake from the girl\u2019s torso. She had to tug hard upon it. It came free with a sickening sound.</p><p>Tara, Tara, Tara . . .</p><p>She heard her name being called again. The tone was soft, sultry, amused. She knew then that she had accomplished very little. The girl was just a piece of a shield. A foot soldier, not at all valued by the real enemy; totally expendable.</p><p>She stepped back into the hall carefully, trying to see in every direction. She couldn\u2019t allow her panic to take hold.</p><p>She looked down the length of the hall, wishing that she dared call out her cousin\u2019s name. She couldn\u2019t, she needed to move quietly, though she was certain that Louisa and her consort\u2014whatever his real name was\u2014 were well aware that she was here.</p><p>As she moved along the hallway, looking ahead, she became aware of a creeping sensation at the back of her neck. She paused, turning. At first she saw nothing.</p><p>The chill continued over her. Deep dread seemed to freeze her in place. Slowly, she looked up.</p><p>Flat against the ceiling was a man. He had curly dark hair, appeared young, and grinned down at her impishly.</p><p>\u201cHello, there.\u201d</p><p>Even as she stared up at him, he fell from the arched ceiling, like a spider dropping down upon its prey.</p><p>She fumbled with frozen fingers for her stake. She managed to lift the point just as he came down upon her. The impetus brought them both to the ground. Caught on the wood, his face was just inches from her throat as he suddenly began to snarl and snap. She struggled to force the point more deeply into his body, to throw his weight from her own. Saliva dripped from the fangs that nearly touched her throat Gasping, heart thundering, arms trembling, she at last managed to cast him to the side. She scrambled to her feet, shaking still. He lay on the ground like an animated figure with a faulty battery, arms and legs thrashing. She slid the sword from beneath her coat and lifted it high again, bringing it down against his throat. Sobs escaped her. It wasn\u2019t easy to sever a head. Once again, she had to strike several times. At last, the head rolled away. And this time, as she watched, the flesh seemed to wrinkle, then wither, turn gray ... slowly become ash and bone.</p><p>She fell against the wall, staring at him, fighting the hysteria that threatened to overwhelm her and the tears that rose in her eyes.</p><p>As she sat there, she became aware of the whispering sound again. A whooshing that made it seem as if a thousand voices were hissing in her ears. She forced herself to rise quickly, to look around, to rescue the stake from where it had fallen in the bone and ash upon the floor.</p><p>She was still being called down the hall by an invisible draw.</p><p>There were doors along the way, but she didn\u2019t pause. The door at the end of the hall, with the strange light emanating into a field of dancing shadow, was where she needed to be. Resolutely, she walked on.</p><p>She came to the door. Her fingers again tensed and froze on the knob. She forced herself to twist it.</p><p>The light was coming from a massive blaze that burned in the hearth. And at the hearth stood a woman.</p><p>The woman who had come to her house.</p><p>She was elegant in form fitting black with trailing, gossamer sleeves. Her features were classically beautiful, framed by a wealth of sleek dark hair. Her skin was pale, her lips were very red. She seemed pleased by Tara\u2019s appearance, those lips breaking into a slow, secret smile.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, ma chere!\u201d she said softly. \u201cWelcome ... you see, you are most incredibly welcome here, though you turned me away from your home. Ah, well, the Alliance has never been known for its diplomatic tact. But... what does it matter? You\u2019re here now. And such a smart girl, clever girl! You knew the way down the hall, and that every door was but a roadblock, before you came to me. Of course, however, I was calling you, but... that\u2019s because you\u2019re so very welcome. Isn\u2019t she welcome, mes amis?\u201d</p><p>Tara started. Her attention had been so focused on the creature at the hearth that she hadn\u2019t looked around the room.</p><p>People ... or creatures ... were all about. A young couple huddled together against a wall, pale, anemic looking. A bearded fellow in Victorian attire was seated in a wing chair, just to the left of the fire. Two women, the one resting upon the other\u2019s lap, were on the bed, while another man was lasciviously stroking the long blond hair of a teen-aged girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChildren, my dear children, look who has come! The newest member of the Alliance.\u201d Louisa moved away from the hearth as she talked, strolling casually in Tara\u2019s direction. Hands on hips, she surveyed Tara. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look the part, does she? A tall, slim blond ... not much muscle to her. Ah, and that face! Such a lovely face, fine features, excellent bone structure, actually. And what does she do for a living? She\u2019s an artist. An artist, can you imagine? Not a police officer ... a young service woman. Ah, well, your grandfather let you down. He might have seen to it that you had fencing lessons, or something in the new Asian methods of defense. Even some kick-boxing might have stood you well. But an artist ...</p><p>what are you going to do, dear? Paint us all to death?\u201d</p><p>Tara ignored her words. \u201cWhere is my cousin, Ann?\u201d</p> <p>She was amazed to see a look of annoyance briefly cross the woman\u2019s features. \u201cYou\u2019ll see her soon enough. But first...\u201d</p><p>Louisa had been purposely drawing her attention. In the nick of time, Tara realized that the couple from the bed had risen from their lethargy. Both of the women hovered behind her.</p><p>The stake wouldn\u2019t help her when it was two against one. She gripped her grandfather\u2019s old war sword in both hands and swung around in an arc. The razor sharp steel cut across the midriff of the first and the waist of the second. Neither was dead, but they both fell back.</p><p>The man with the beard had risen; he too was coming toward her. She held the sword at the ready as he approached her, her heart sinking. She had managed against them one by one. She had been methodical.</p><p>Stake the creatures, remove their heads. But she couldn\u2019t do it when they were coming at her from all sides.</p> <p>And now, her arms were burning. She was tiring. Muscles not accustomed to such movement were beginning to scream and groan. She had to ignore it, or she would not survive. As the man came toward her, she decided on the offensive, lunging forward to pin him in the stomach with the sword. She missed, and the sword struck bone, bringing a smile to the man\u2019s face. One of the women behind her, wounded but alive, and all the more furious for her wound, was coming back. Tara spun again, trying to inflict all the damage she could with the sword.</p><p>Arms suddenly slipped around her. The man who had been stroking the blond\u2019s hair had come up, and she hadn\u2019t been prepared. His fingers closed around her wrist, like hot iron biting into her flesh. She was desperate to hold on to the sword, but she couldn\u2019t. She let it fall, but as she did, she grasped quickly beneath her coat for the stake, ramming it backward with all her strength. She heard him hiss with fury and pain; he fell back from her. But in front of her, one of the others was already reaching for the sword.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, disarm her! Guillermo, don\u2019t whine so, you will survive, get the stake now, come, come... she mustn\u2019t be carrying those weapons when we go to find her cousin.\u201d The room suddenly seemed to become a rage of shadows. A great, rising, flapping sound began to fill the air, as if a host of giant winged creatures was descending. They were everywhere, all around her. Her hair was being pulled, torn. Wild breezes seemed to rip around her. She was surrounded, and they were touching her everywhere.</p><p>She saw shadows, faces, wings, hands, reaching, grabbing. She held on to the wooden stake as if it were a lifeline, but fingers were tearing at hers, forcing them one by one from her grip upon the wood. At last, the stake clattered to the ground. Both her main weapons were gone.</p><p>The flapping subsided. She stood alone, coat torn and ragged, hands empty.</p><p>Louisa approached her again.</p> <p>\u201cAh ... well, I think just a taste of your blood for the moment. Then, I\u2019ll bring you to your cousin. And you can watch ... while I watch as well, as she is finished. Consumed, of course. Such a delicious young thing. But then, I suspect, you will be even better.</p><p>Despite herself, Tara felt her eyes locking with Louisa\u2019s. The woman was smiling, so aware of her power. Coming closer, and closer.</p><p>Tara forced her mind to work. And as Louisa stood just before her, hands resting on her shoulders to pull her in and bare her throat, Tara reached quickly for one of her last weapons.</p><p>A small paint gun, loaded with holy water.</p><p>She brought it up to Louisa\u2019s face. And fired.</p><p>Louisa screamed and shrieked, the sound of a thousand banshees wailing in the night. Her hands flew to her face, and she shouted out in rage, \u201cKill her, kill her!\u201d The flapping sounded again. Rising in a cacophony. Surrounded, Tara began to spin around wildly, aiming the water wherever she could.</p><p>At best it was a stalling measure. She would lose ... the shadows hovered closer and closer. Screams rose and fell. Hands and arms were on her, tearing at her ...</p><p>Then, the first of them was wrenched away. She heard a thunderous noise as a body went slamming against a far wall. There was a second sound ...</p> <p>The body\u2019s head landing in the wake of the corpse.</p><p>She turned, her fingers still on the paint gun.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t aim it at me!\u201d came a command, and she turned quickly again, shaking.</p><p>She was no longer alone. Lucian had come.</p><p>He had freed her from the grip of the bearded man, who now lay in pieces against the wall. She had a brief moment to retrieve her sword as Lucian reached for the next enemy; she didn\u2019t watch, she didn\u2019t want to see, as he dispatched the woman.</p><p>Instead, she ducked and grasped the sword from the floor, and scrambled onward, desperate to procure the stake as well. As she did so, one of the women went flying above her head. She turned, there was someone else, stalking her like a zombie. She raised her sword. A hand caught her arm. She turned again in dismay and terror.</p><p>But it was Lucian.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward and sent a fist against the young man\u2019s face, causing him to crumple to the floor in a silent heap.</p><p>The room had gone still, except for one groaning figure on the floor. Lucian took the sword from Tara\u2019s hand. He looked down. With a single, forceful sweep, he lopped off the man\u2019s head.</p><p>Shaking, Tara stood still. Lucian looked around. \u201cShe\u2019s gone. She\u2019s managed to get by,\u201d he said wearily.</p><p>He started for the door. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>Jacques did not look well. Katia remained in her keening state. Jade DeVeau felt her muscles tighten and ache, but she remained at her post. She was ready. Vials of holy water littered the desk in front of her.</p><p>She had torches ready, should she need defense of fire. She had fashioned more stakes from pieces broken off chairs.</p><p>Regrettably, antique chairs, but then, their lives were in danger.</p><p>There was nothing for the longest time ...</p><p>And then ...</p><p>She heard a whining sound, coming from the front.</p><p>Jacques, white, tense, and gripping the arms of his chair, sighed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s Eleanora. The dog. She\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p><p>He started to rise.</p><p>\u201cSit, please, Jacques,\u201d she said softly. She grabbed one of the stakes, and slowly made her way from the library through the great hall, and to the door. She hesitated, still. Then she heard the soft whining again. She opened the door. Indeed, it was the shepherd. Bloodied, limping, yet wagging her tail. Jade smiled. \u201cGood girl, brave girl, come in, I\u2019ll bandage you.\u201d She bent down to pet the dog. Then she screamed, for a huge shape suddenly came lumbering toward her. She started to slam the door.</p><p>\u201cJade! It\u2019s Rick, for the love of God!\u201d</p><p>She threw the door open.</p><p>Rick was more beat up than the dog. And he was carrying the body of a man over his shoulder. \u201cLet me in, quickly!\u201d Rick said.</p><p>Jade did so, hesitating, looking out into the night.</p><p>\u201cJade!\u201d Rick said.</p><p>She felt the strange breeze that touched her face.</p><p>Quickly, she shut and locked the door, and turned.</p><p>Jacques let out a hoarse call.</p><p>Jade went flying back to the library.</p><p>Lucian DeVeau went through the door, heading for the hallway.</p><p>Tara, numbed, looked around her. She stared at the empty doorway, then sprang to life, scrambling over the fallen to follow Lucian.</p><p>She saw him moving, the sway of his leather coat, ahead of her in the hall. She quickened her pace, trying to catch up. One of the doors burst open and it seemed that a harpy flew from it, a scraggly, white-haired old witch of a woman, landing upon her like a giant chimp. She struggled against the strength of the creature, again desperately trying to avoid the slash of the snapping fangs. A second later, the creature was torn from her.</p><p>Lucian reached a hand down to her, pulling her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou have to expect things like that,\u201d he told her, and started walking again. She followed in his footsteps. As they moved along, a second door opened. She swung around with her stake in a death grip once again. A giant of a man stepped from the room, exceedingly tall, with long, gleaming blond hair. She gasped, getting ready to strike.</p><p>Lucian set a hand upon her arm and shook his head. \u201cThis is Ragnor, Tara. He\u2019s with us. What did you find?\u201d The question was directed to the blond man.</p><p>\u201cThree, novices, dug up and released, I\u2019m assuming. Mindless, unintelligent creatures; thugs from another century\u2014nothing much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe foot soldiers, more than expendable,\u201d Lucian said softly, echoing Tara\u2019s earlier thoughts to a T.</p><p>He started down the hall again, the tall man at his side. Tara followed, hurrying to keep up with their strides. \u201cThey\u2019ve got... like a nerve center?\u201d she asked, gasping for her each breath. \u201cAnd these...</p><p>people... or things ... are like the outer defenses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a room, another room with a hearth and a sofa and ...\u201d She broke off, stopping where she stood. \u201cIt\u2019s where they have Ann, and it\u2019s where they want us to come?\u201d Lucian glanced at her, a wry but grim smile beginning to curl his lips. He nodded. \u201cYes. You see, you didn\u2019t want to believe, but it is you, and you are ... Alliance.\u201d He stopped as well, staring at her. \u201cRemember, you have a strength you don\u2019t even know.\u201d She nodded, and moistened her lips. \u201cWhere is Brent?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWounded, but on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWounded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p> <p>They had started walking again. She raced along behind them. \u201cI don\u2019t understand all this. You all can be killed, of course ... and Brent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was he wounded?\u201d she persisted, following closely.</p><p>\u201cSilver bullet,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s still coining? He\u2019s only wounded? He can\u2019t come ... who had the bullet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGerard,\u201d Lucian explained briefly. \u201cWillem ... or Inspector Trusseau, as you came to know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he knows ... who ... what... Brent is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, he knows. He knows well,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cJust as we all know one another.\u201d She swallowed hard, following them. They returned to the great hall, and there, the fire in the hearth was burning with an ever greater intensity. Something about the room had changed, Tara thought. The shadows created by light and fire had shifted, risen somewhat. And then she knew why.</p><p>They were meant to see now.</p><p>A snap and crackle brought the fire burning ever higher, and she saw Trusseau\u2014or Gerard, as Lucian had called him. He was now by the fireplace. He held a rifle at his side. He smiled as the three of them entered, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, Lucian, here you are at last. I must say, since you\u2019re the great \u2018king\u2019 of our kind, it took you long enough to get here. And considering as well, that you have this fresh, young, vampire huntress at your side\u2014 and Ragnor! Of course. The Viking of old! And that\u2019s it? You didn\u2019t summon a host from around the world? Ah, well, I have always been underestimated. But then, you thought that you\u2019d have your friend, Mr. Malone here, with, perhaps, a few of his own. Ah, but sadly perhaps, his kind have been all but brought to the brink of extinction. Farmers do hate it when the wolves ravage their herds ... and that old fairy tale has certainly done a lot to keep the population of those predators down. Actually, it\u2019s so easy to kill a werewolf. All you need is a silver bullet. Now as to vampires... well, Lucian. Your command is a joke. You aren\u2019t supposed to be killing your own kind now, are you? What happened to the rules?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou broke them, Gerard. Freeing me to do the same. This is a new world. New rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so new, not really. Names, faces, and centers of power change. Luckily, human beings remain greedy, power-hungry creatures, so there are always pockets in the world where my kind can thrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrive? After the war, Gerard, you were in pieces.\u201d</p><p>A flash of anger crossed the vampire\u2019s face. \u201cAh, yes, and you see, I haven\u2019t forgotten. I even hope that wretched Malone is just limping along somewhere\u2014I didn\u2019t want a quick death for him, not after all that I suffered at his hands.\u201d He glanced at Tara, eyes sweeping her up and down. \u201cAnd here we have her!</p><p>Heiress to the old man. He was a harder nut to crack than I had imagined, but then, I\u2019d something more in mind for him than a simple coup de grace. The wretched old fellow. Once he and Malone got together at the debacle when the armies were closing in ... well, let\u2019s just say that I don\u2019t want either of them dying easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019ll oblige you in a bitter fight, Gerard,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cAnd consider this\u2014the extraordinary power Malone has is all thanks to you. All those steroids and such you pumped into him when he was in your power. He already suffered the tortures of hell at your hands. I think you should actually hope that you end your pathetic existence before he arrives,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cYou think that you will do that, do you?\u201d</p><p>A figure suddenly rose from the depths of the sofa, the back of which faced them, and had been hiding her. It was the elegant Louisa, with a skein of her long hair now covering her race. She moved it back to show the horrible blisters and burns caused by the holy water Tara had cast upon her. \u201cYou\u2019re all dying here tonight\u2014dying for good. If there\u2019s to be royalty among us, I do believe that I far better fit the role.</p> <p>You have created a travesty of what we are, Lucian! You would make us into a pack of lambs when we are, in truth, the greatest birds of prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have us survive, and live within our world,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cYour excesses, Gerard, brought about centuries of death for yourself and Louisa years ago, and caused hundreds of others\u2014innocent and defenseless\u2014to face execution as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are meant to rule over the weak, and slake our thirst on the blood of innocents,\u201d Gerard said coldly.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the weak!\u201d Louisa said. And she reached down, dragging Ann to her feet from where she had lain hidden on the old Victorian sofa. Tara gasped. Ann\u2019s eyes were open; she could see them all. But she didn\u2019t register their appearance. She simply stood in Louisa\u2019s hold, ashen, apparently sightless, listless, and ready to obey every command issued by her new masters.</p><p>As she stared at them, Louisa brushed aside Ann\u2019s hair, and smiled at Tara. \u201cSuch easy prey ... she fell for Gerard\u2014or Willem\u2014the moment he came to her. And she! The granddaughter of old Jacques. I think she might die now, no matter what else we do ... she is so very tired and, of course ... drained.\u201d Tara was startled to hear herself speak, grasping at the subtle hint Louisa had given earlier. \u201cAnn was weak?\u201d she inquired, taking a step forward. \u201cHow strange you call her weak. It seems to me that Willem fell rather hard himself, and still, no matter what the power, Ann would not invite a monster into her home, and she could resist him when she discovered simply that he wasn\u2019t a man she wanted in her home or in her life.\u201d</p><p>She had struck home. Louisa shot a glance at Gerard where he stood by the mantel. Her hold on Ann was weak.</p><p>Tara sprang forward, determined to seize her cousin. But even as she came close, Louisa turned, staring at her with a force that sent her sliding back, falling to the floor. Her hold on Ann tightened. \u201cNow, now is the time when I finish this wretched creature!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>Tara screamed, surging against the force, like a wind, that was holding her away. Lucian and Ragnor moved at that time as well, leaping forward, immune to the force. Lucian reached Louisa a split second before she could tear into Ann\u2019s flesh. As Lucian began to grapple with Louisa, Ann began to crumple to the floor. Tara reached her cousin, catching her, trying to hold her up. \u201cAnn, Ann, please, snap out of it, you\u2019ve got to fight what\u2019s happening!\u201d</p><p>She felt a hand upon her shoulder, drawing her upward. Lucian. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get her the hell out Now!\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked at him, and beyond him, then gasped. The room was filling. Gerard and Louisa hadn\u2019t begun to call on all their resources. Even as Lucian spoke to her, two men who must have once been bikers were striding quickly toward his back. \u201cLook out!\u201d she said, trying to hold Ann\u2014and fumbling for her paint gun at the same time. She brought it up, blinding the creatures over Lucian\u2019s shoulder, causing them to stagger back.</p><p>But Louisa was rising in all her fury, and the room had become pure bedlam. In the midst of it, Tara heard the explosion of a shot. And Gerard\u2019s mocking voice. \u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it? Mortal men\u2014and women\u2014can be killed by silver bullets as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet her out!\u201d Lucian repeated, heading toward Gerard. The gun exploded again, tearing into the fabric of the sofa, just inches from Ann and Tara.</p><p>Tara was no longer gentle. She grabbed her cousin by the arm. \u201cGet up and move!\u201d she commanded.</p><p>Dragging Ann, she headed for the door, staying as low as she could. An old man suddenly stood in her way. He looked like a bum off the streets of the city. But he smiled, and displayed his teeth, and moved toward them, arms outstretched. Tara found a reserve of strength she didn\u2019t know she had, seizing the hilt of the sword with her right hand as she supported Ann with her left. She gathered all her strength and aimed straight for his throat. She didn\u2019t sever the head completely, but he fell away, hands clasped to his neck.</p><p>She made it out the door. She shook Ann firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to run, run! Do you understand. We\u2019ve got to run.\u201d</p><p>Ann didn\u2019t seem to understand, but neither did she fight Tara\u2019s hold. Still, the going was not easy. They were trying to escape through a maze of trees and underbrush. The ground beneath Tara\u2019s feet was strewn with rock and bricks and old building materials. Branches and tree limbs seemed alive, tugging at her hair, her tattered clothing.</p><p>She screamed, thinking that one of them had come upon her, as a particularly prickly, bony-fingered, leafless branch tangled into her hair. She freed herself, pushing Ann along, and at last broke into an open field.</p><p>Yet even as she ran toward the place where she\u2019d left the car, she felt the eerie sensation that had come to touch her with danger.</p><p>With the presence of her enemies.</p><p>A great shadow seemed to fell over the night, and the sound of whooshing winds came again.</p><p>The shadow was behind her ... sweeping over her. She felt the darkness, felt the fear. And then ... the shadow loomed before her. Huge, giant wings, rising ... and then falling. And it seemed that the wings folded, and Gerard stood before her once again.</p><p>She halted, arms tight around Ann, staring at him.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSo ... here we are. I have both the lovely granddaughters of the learned and knowledgeable Jacques DeVant standing before me. Ah ... a bit like smorgasbord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will kill you if you come one inch closer,\u201d Tara told him.</p><p>He laughed, tremendously amused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure I want to destroy you at all, Miss Adair. So much spunk and fire! You can join with us, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Louisa will like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, I\u2019m not sure Louisa is going to survive the fight in which she is currently engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely. You left her to fight Lucian and Ragnor, and you came after two mortal women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are many ways to win,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI loved Louisa, truly. Yet, in all those years, I had forgotten how demanding she could be. And then, of course, in the midst of all, I am forced to recall that it was she\u2014trying to save herself\u2014who gave my name to the Alliance at the Sun King\u2019s court. I suffered cataclysmically. And yet...\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cNot quite so badly as I did at the hands of your grandfather\u2014and Brent Malone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tara\u2019s arms were aching. Ann leaned against her so that she was standing with her cousin\u2019s form weighing her down, and causing new aches in her muscles. Keeping her eyes locked with Gerard\u2019s, she eased Ann down into the high grass. She drew the stake from her coat</p><p>\u201cCome near me, and you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>He took a step toward her. She felt a sudden agony in her arm.</p><p>\u201cYes, a creature of spirit, courage, and beauty! But such a novice. Oh, yes, of course, you dealt well with the silly young creatures and dumb bandits I created and dug from graves to test your strength and skill. But you\u2019ve yet to be up against something like me.\u201d</p><p>He took another step toward her. \u201cI should make use of a much greater finesse!\u201d he said. \u201cBut... time ...</p><p>we\u2019re going to have to end your resistance here and now, I\u2019m afraid. We\u2019ll see where the future might lead once I have tasted your... deliciousness,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhen truly hungry, of course, we will dine on just about anything. But a young woman such as you... I\u2019m salivating already.\u201d The entire length of her shook. She could barely hold the stake. She wanted to reach for the last of her holy water, but she couldn\u2019t force her arms to move. She had to tear her eyes away from his. She could not, and he was coming closer, closer, closer ...</p><p>She prayed in desperate silence and willed herself to break his hold. At last, she tore her eyes from his, keeping the stake in her left hand, and reaching for the water with her right. But it was too late. Even as she tried to aim the gun at him, he reached her, and her bones were nearly broken as he forced it from her hand.</p> <p>Still, she struggled with the stake, but he wrenched it from her as if she were a child waving a tinsel wand.</p><p>Then he stared down at her, holding her shoulders. Smiled suddenly, and lifted the fall of her hair. She found one last inch of strength, and brought her knee up with a vengeance, wondering if she could move him in the least. He fell back, shrieking a guttural cry of pain and fury. But he was instantly up, instantly on his feet, ready to come after her again.</p><p>But then ...</p><p>They both heard it.</p><p>A baying sound. A sound that rose and rose into a cacophony, cries to heaven, a shrieking, a howling borne on the wind.</p><p>Beneath them, it seemed that the earth began to tremble.</p> <p>Gerard let out an expletive, reaching for Tara and his rifle at the same time.</p><p>And then, from the tangle of forest and trees, they appeared. There seemed to be a hundred of them\u2014</p><p>silver, huge, wolves, and not wolves, for as they moved, they couldn\u2019t truly be seen, they were like a spin of motion, film out of focus, a thunder of illusion that spilled across the landscape. Tara struggled wildly to free herself from Gerard\u2019s steel hold. She started to shout in warning. \u201cHe has silver bullets, he has silver bullets!\u201d</p><p>Gerard began to fire, wildly.</p><p>It seemed that the wolves were a wave. A wave of howling, baying, snarling death. They barreled on toward them. Gerard took aim. Tara used all her strength, forcing the gun up, the bullet to burst into the air.</p><p>And as she did so, the first of the wolves was upon them. Far larger than life, standing taller than Gerard, taking him down in a fleeting glimpse of time.</p><p>She could hear Gerard. \u201cDamn you, damn you, damn you, die!\u201d Tara, released, gasping, staggered away, trying to reach Ann, to cover her from the immense pack of wolves thundering over them. But though she heard the howling, growling, snapping ... tearing, gnashing of teeth and ripping of claws, nothing came near them. She kept hearing Gerard\u2019s curses, and then a gurgling sound. She closed her eyes, ducked over Ann, praying, and then ...</p><p>She realized that she heard nothing. Nothing at all. Except the soft whisper of the breeze, and a rustling of trees.</p> <p>She lifted her head, and rose slowly.</p><p>There were no wolves in the field.</p><p>Only a man.</p><p>The moon had risen high in the night sky. The clouds had dissipated. And against the natural shadow of moonlight and night, she saw him standing there, tall in his silhouette, reflecting upon something that lay in the grass.</p><p>The body of his enemy.</p><p>She swallowed hard, needing to speak. She was shaking. Sound wouldn\u2019t come to her lips.</p><p>Then at last. \u201cBrent?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, and started walking across the grass to her. He was limping. She found her own strength again, warmth to make her frozen limbs burst into motion. She raced across the grass and into his arms. He encompassed her in the strength of his hold, drew back, smoothed back wild tendrils of her hair, searched her face with his anxious golden gaze, and trembling himself, kissed her lips.</p><p>She leaned against him. For a moment, they held there, feeling the sweetness of the night air, the caress of the breeze, and of the moon.</p><p>Suddenly, the night was shattered by the sound of an explosion. Streaks of fire soared into the sky.</p><p>Brent\u2019s hold tightened around her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the house in the woods,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d She drew back. \u201cLucian,\u201d she murmured worriedly. \u201cAnd his ... his friend. Ragnor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right; they\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would know if they were not,\u201d he said simply. Then his arm slid around her shoulder and he lifted her chin. \u201cWe need to get Ann, and take her home now,\u201d he said.</p><p>And she nodded, for though fire filled the sky, the world seemed strangely right once again.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>They sat at a table at the same cafe on the Champs Elysees where they had come that first morning when Tara arrived in Paris.</p><p>There were three of them, though, this morning, Ann, Tara, and Jade DeVeau. Jade had been trying to make sense of everything for Tara, though she had gotten most of the story from Brent and her grandfather.</p><p>Brent had been attacked during the war, but discovered by the one enemy general who had known and recognized his exact condition the moment he had seen him. Calling himself Andreson at the time, Gerard was too impressed with his own power and superiority to fear the mangled man he had at his mercy. He had become fascinated with medicine during that phase of his existence\u2014and the human capacity to endure pain.</p><p>He\u2019d never realized he was creating the creature who would undo him, cast him into years of pain and healing.</p><p>Doctor Weiss had been a truly good and gentle man, and it was through him\u2014and the rescued political prisoner, Jacques DeVant\u2014that Brent had first been brought to a woman in Paris, Maggie Montgomery, a friend of Lucian\u2019s, and someone with knowledge and a healing touch. Brent had learned what he was, but Maggie had saved him from despair. He would be different, because of the things done to him in the prison\u2019s experimental lab. He would have greater powers. And perhaps, at times, greater agony, learning to harness the violence and needs that tore at his physical being. But such had been the case, and as such, he had, in his way, become part of the Alliance.</p><p>There were differences in the world beneath the known society, Tara learned. Brent could not shadow-shift, as the vampires could. But his strength went beyond that of even the oldest and most practiced and learned vampires. Nor was he prey to saltwater, which meant certain death to vampires.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t mind read, or focus, the way Lucian could, but he was learning.</p><p>The night had ended with a victory that went beyond expectations. Even the police had been satisfied.</p><p>Javet hadn\u2019t totally ignored Tara\u2019s words. He had been checking into his man from Paris. He had discovered that the specialist had not been who he said he was, and he was more than willing to believe that the false inspector had been the thief and the evil murderer who had brought his victims to the ruins in the woods, satisfied his sick needs, and tortured and killed them there. He believed that \u201cTrusseau\u201d had died in the fire, and even that he had been the one to kill Jean-Luc and steal the corpse\u2014for on a pile of bones among the rubble, incredible riches in jewels were discovered. Jewels that had belonged to the Sun King\u2019s mistress, Louisa de Montcrasset.</p><p>An even better note had been that not all had perished.</p><p>The cafe girl, Yvette, had not been killed. She must have endured terrible events at the hands of the two, but they hadn\u2019t killed her. Nor had they killed Paul, who had retained something of his sanity, his will to protect her and his love for her stronger than the power of his captors. The two, like Ann, had emerged from it all very ill, but getting better every day.</p><p>And, Paul had told them all proudly, Yvette had asked him to marry her.</p><p>Rick Beaudreaux had been in worse shape than Ann, ravaged in his fight with five of the \u201cyoung army\u201d Louisa and Gerard had created to be the front line of their battle. He had saved Roland, however, from certain death, with the help of Eleanora, even after she had been attacked by the creatures. Old Daniel had even helped out, Rick said, kicking the \u201choly shit\u201d out of two of the attackers.</p><p>Ann, though mending herself, let no one else tend to Rick. The two were actually quite adorable, not seeming to have so much as a single argument between them, ever.</p><p>Jacques, too, was doing well, gaining strength with each new day. The fact that he now had his family around him, believing in him, seemed to be the greatest medicine in the world.</p><p>Healing had been the first order of business.</p><p>And now ...</p><p>Tara leaned forward in an attempt to get Jade to explain more fully. \u201cI\u2019m trying really hard to make sure I\u2019ve got everything straight. The Alliance is as old as ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrganized civilization, I guess,\u201d Jade said. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure of that myself. It is, of course, a secret society. If it weren\u2019t, most of its members would be locked away for their own benefit. In years gone by, the society was more accepted. People had a greater belief that there could be more that went beyond the realm of the everyday senses. And of course, in past times, such beliefs have caused absolute horror as well\u2014look at the Inquisition, the witch burnings, more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lucian is very old, almost as old as the society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as old as the society. Just very old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not?\u201d Ann said curiously, joining in the conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jade shook her head ruefully. \u201cJust as old as you see me. I met Lucian a few years ago. He saved my life.\u201d She flushed slightly. \u201cHe believes that I saved his as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . ..\u201d Ann murmured. \u201cYou\u2019ll age, and he will not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve not really worried about that yet. He was deeply concerned at first, knowing that I wanted a family. But by happenstance ... we\u2019ve adopted a son. And he\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Tara said. \u201cEvery time I think I do, I get confused again. Lucian is a vampire\u2014a good vampire, a part of the Alliance now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really a part. He has known about it, and in our current times, it\u2019s a natural coalition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrosses don\u2019t bother either of them because at heart they still have a deep belief in an afterlife and the sanctity of God and man. If I have this right, it\u2019s kind of like hypnotism\u2014if you\u2019re not an evil person, you can\u2019t be talked into doing evil under the power of the hypnotist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d Jade said, \u201cbut the question of free will comes in often. A vampire can be driven by natural instincts, just as man can be driven. It\u2019s a question of what\u2019s right, and what\u2019s wrong, and learning to exist by a code that respects others. The world is always shifting\u2014our world is always shifting, new fears, new friends, new enemies. It\u2019s the same in the world we can\u2019t really touch. The rules have changed in the new order. But yes, I suppose it boils down to the classic fight man always wages within himself, a battle between the capabilities of doing good and doing evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Lucian change you then?\u201d Ann asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t know what the end brings,\u201d Jade told her. \u201cI\u2019m willing to take any chance. Lucian isn\u2019t. I was bitten once, but like you ... I healed. And he still doesn\u2019t really know about the immortal soul, and so ...\u201d</p><p>Tara plunged in then, asking frankly, \u201cWhat about werewolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they live forever?\u201d</p><p>Tara sipped her coffee. \u201cNo. But they age far more slowly than an average man. They have their weaknesses, and their strengths. And like any other creature, they learn with age. At the beginning, as I understand it, Brent had little control. He was subject to the pull of the moon, losing all power over himself when it was full, having little ability\u2014unless he was under extreme duress\u2014to change when there was no moon. But he\u2019s learned over the decades. He has tremendous abilities. And in his desire to inflict torture, Gerard endowed him with incredible strengths.\u201d She leaned forward, a slight smile curling her lips as she told Tara, \u201cWe all have to make decisions, and choices, you know. But then, I\u2019m not really sure that you do have as many choices as someone else. You must realize yourself now that you have been born to the Alliance. There are many more who are Alliance across the world. They may not all know it yet ... and usually, in times of need, they somehow find one another.\u201d She looked at Ann. \u201cYou have a choice. Perhaps it\u2019s already been made.\u201d</p><p>Ann shrugged and asked Jade, \u201cIs there... has there ever been a cure for vampirism?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo ... well, yes, but I only know of one case where a vampire returned to a mortal life. And that was rather a different case. Back home, in Charleston, where Lucian and I and our ... group is centered, there\u2019s a woman. Maggie. Brent knows her well. She was here, in France, after the war, and she was a great source of help for him at that time. And now... well, long story, but she\u2019s married to a cop in New Orleans, and I\u2019m sure that Brent will tell you all about her, except, of course, that you should all come and visit. There are really too many stories to try to explain by simple conversation.\u201d Tara stared at her, smiling suddenly. New Orleans. She loved the city. It would be wonderful to visit\u2014and understand.</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d she told Ann, \u201cto think that the last time we were sitting here ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was bemoaning the loss of a monster!\u201d Ann said with a shudder.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you came through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m debating a life with a different vampire,\u201d Ann said.</p><p>Tara laughed. \u201cAt least you know a little more ... Jade, you said that vampires can\u2019t have children. What about\u2014werewolves.\u201c</p><p>\u201cBrent Malone is really a man like any other\u2014with a few special abilities. Oh, there are so many arguments! Are these things all illusion, chemical changes? What are the true properties of matter?</p><p>Throughout time, I\u2019m afraid, no one has had the real answer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf my cousin marries Brent,\u201d Ann said with stern practically, \u201cis she likely to have a litter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn!\u201d Tara said.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ann said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be most likely to have lovely children,\u201d Jade said.</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t say any more. She could see that the men, who had been in the airline office in the middle of the block, were returning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all set,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid we leave now.\u201d Rick looked at Ann. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re coming?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cTime to say our goodbyes then,\u201d Lucian murmured.</p><p>And so they did. In a very natural way, hugs and kisses all around, American style, French style.</p><p>And it was strange, of course, because Tara was staying on in France for a few weeks while Ann was going to the States on vacation with Rick.</p><p>In the end, the promise was that they would all see one another soon.</p><p>Then the others were gone, and Tara was left at the table with Brent. He ordered a coffee, and smiled at her ruefully across the table.</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA werewolf, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>She was silent, watching him.</p><p>\u201cI can go away,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWalk away from your you, and your life, and leave you in peace.\u201d She leaned close to him. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about trying it. I\u2019m Alliance, you know. I\u2019d hunt you down to the ends of the earth.\u201d He lowered his head, but not before she saw the light that touched his eyes.</p><p>Shimmering. Golden. She loved it.</p><p>He looked up. \u201cSo what shall we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she mused. \u201cLet\u2019s see ... you don\u2019t actually fly, do you? I\u2019d kind of had this fantasy about being swept away to the highest spires in the city, and ravished there, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery uncomfortable,\u201d he told her, shaking his head. \u201cI could kind of fly with you into the deepest forests, up the highest mountains... but you\u2019re facing the same problems there. You know, stones, rocks, twigs, scratchy things. Not exactly what I had in mind.\u201d He was joking, speaking lightly, but he took her hands, looked down at them, and then into her eyes. \u201cActually, it doesn\u2019t matter to me where I am, if I\u2019m with you. But you\u2019ve had a tremendous amount to grasp and understand lately, and to me ... well, I\u2019m asking a lot of you. You\u2019re an incredibly beautiful, talented woman. You left a full life behind you\u2014it\u2019s waiting, if you wish to return.\u201d</p><p>She smiled slowly, choosing her words. \u201cMy old life is waiting ... but before then, I was waiting. I knew that there was something else out there, waiting for me. The Alliance, what happened here, yes. But something else. I never told you, but the dream began long before I came here. The dream, the nightmare, the premonition, whatever it might be called. And from the beginning, within it all, I was calling to someone. Brent, you\u2019re what I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life. And if you were to walk away from me, I\u2019d spend the rest of my life waiting for you to come back.\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou really do understand all about me?\u201d he queried. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time, you know. I wouldn\u2019t want to pretend. There have been others all along the way, but never ... never like this. I never felt ... all right, in all honesty, at first I was so afraid for you. There was the terrible need to be with you.</p><p>And then I knew that it was more than fear, the need to protect. It was, perhaps, the same. As if there could be nothing ... until I saw you that day in the crypt, and from then on, every move I made cast me deeper and deeper into longing ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that. Nice to hear I was really desirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that, yes. But longing for much more. It was the same ... as if I had been waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid that my appearance gave us serious problems. You might have stopped Louisa from ever rising.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t escaped that night, we might not have known about Gerard being here. I\u2019m not anywhere near as old as Lucian, so I didn\u2019t really understand what happened during the Sun King\u2019s day. Nor would I have envisioned that her legendary lover might have been the man\u2014the man who caused me such agony during the war. He had been so careful here, as well, kidnapping or seducing his victims, hiding the bodies ... until he grew careless. He could have gone on for months, years, undetected. I don\u2019t know ... I believe in the free will of man\u2014a free will even when the normal course of a man\u2019s life is disrupted.</p><p>And yet ... it\u2019s hard not to think that it was destiny, when you appeared in the crypt that day.\u201c She smoothed a finger over the top of his hand. \u201cWell, then, if it\u2019s destiny, we should accept the fact that we\u2019re meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then ...\u201d he murmured, repeating her words. And he met her eyes again with a rueful grin. \u201cRocky hilltop, elegant hotel room. Hm. My vote is for the Ritz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ritz ... sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA short stay, or extended?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtended, of course. Katia and Roland are with Jacques ... he\u2019s quite all right. And you seem to think that I need time ... and I do. Endless days, and nights, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife will never really be normal again, you know,\u201d he said softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is normal?

They lay on a gorgeous king-sized bed piled high with pillows and satiny-smooth sheets.\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo ... you really think I\u2019m extraordinary?\u201d</p><p>And she laughed. \u201cBeyond a doubt. Oh, my God, yes, beyond any doubt.\u201d Night fell, and a full moon rose over Paris. High atop the elegance of the landmark Parisian hotel, the balcony doors were open to the breezes of the night. Within the hearth, an electric \u201cfire\u201d burned. It might as well have been the real thing, for it seemed that the flames rose and fell, rose and fell, and burned with the fever of the night.</p><p>Burned . . .</p><p>And burned.</p> <p>After all, they had both decided ...</p><p>They had been waiting all of their lives.</p><p>For a sneak preview of Shannon Drake\u2019s next contemporary vampire novel\u2014</p><p>coming from Zebra Books in October 2003\u2014just turn the page ...</p><p>She was screaming.</p><p>In the terrible reality that was happening, she heard her own voice.</p> <p>In the darkness, she knew a spiraling fear that threatened to become overwhelming, to smother her. She had a sense of fatality, and she saw the shadow figure, saw him entering the room. Adrenaline raced through her, desperation, the sense that she must move, must fight for survival.</p><p>The sound continued, it was all she had, and she screamed and screamed, knowing the deadly menace that had come to her. She knew, as well, that she had said something, done something, to precipitate this.</p><p>She knew each step as it occurred, the figure appearing, the fear, the terrible understanding of what was to come. She felt the violence as he came upon her, his touch upon her hair first, her clothing, the blows against her as she resisted. The violation of her flesh, the hands around her throat...</p><p>Faceless, he was faceless, but she knew him, she had to know him.</p><p>Had to know his hands. Around her throat, then her hands, pressing her down, and she knew that she was going to die. She wasn\u2019t sure how ... would the hands so powerful against her flesh crush the life from her, or was this only to subdue, would there be a knife blade, a pressing against her throat, creating a rich spill of blood ... ?</p><p>Whichever, it was coming, she knew that it was coming, and she still couldn\u2019t see his face, only the darkness, and she was suddenly certain of a welling of sound, soft and low and underlying the chilling shrill of her screams, a sound of chanting, voices, many voices ...</p><p>Whispers, laughter.</p><p>Eerie laughter, evil laughter ...</p> <p>She screamed louder, fought more wildly, desperate now not just to save her life, but to still the cackling sounds that seemed to enter her very soul, wrapping around it, crushing the life from it, as the hands upon her seemed to be doing with flesh.</p><p>She kicked, tried hard to keep screaming, but she had no breath, no sound could come, no air could come . ..</p><p>Only the pulse, the thunder of her heart.</p><p>Fight, fight... even as a darkness deeper than night fell before her eyes. Kick, scratch, fight... claw at the hands ...</p><p>The hands. .. that slipped as she dug her nails hard...</p><p>Screaming, still the sound of screaming ...</p><p>\u201cMegan! Jesus, stop! Megan!\u201d</p><p>Hands, again, on her shoulders, shaking her. She struck out, hard, desperately.</p><p>\u201cMegan! Damn! Megan, wake up!\u201d</p><p>She awoke, stunned, still hearing distant screams, but they were coming from her.</p><p>\u201cMegan!\u201d</p><p>Finn, straddled over her then, his right hand was vised around her wrists; he was rubbing his jaw with his left. He stared down at her, his eyes as brilliant as twin knife blades, his face ashen.</p><p>\u201cMegan! What the hell is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, her screaming stopped.</p><p>She was drawn from the incredible reality of the world she had entered in her sleep to the true reality of life. And in real life, she was in a quiet bed and breakfast, in a quiet, historic town that only went a bit crazy during the month of October.</p><p>\u201cFinn! Oh, my God, Finn!\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull her arms free.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to sock me in the jaw again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry ... please!\u201d</p><p>He eased his hold. She reached up, curled her arms around his neck, shaking, nearly sobbing.</p><p>A dream. It had been nothing but a dream.</p><p>He didn\u2019t push her away, but his shoulders were as stiff as boards. When she drew back, the look in his narrowed green eyes was wary, distant, and accusing.</p><p>\u201cMegan, Jesus Christ, what the hell was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the most awful nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare\u2014and you had to scream like a thousand hounds were after you!\u201d He was interrupted by a hard banging on the door.</p><p>She bit her lip, wincing. Finn jumped up and reached for the terry bathrobe she had discarded before bed.</p><p>He opened the door. From the darkness of the room, Megan could see the dimly lit hallway. Mr. Fallon, the groundskeeper and jack-of-all-trades at Huntington House, stood grimly in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat goes on here, Mr. Douglas?\u201d he demanded sternly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It seems that Megan has had a nightmare,\u201d Finn explained.</p><p>Mr. Fallon gave Finn an up and down glare that implied he didn\u2019t believe a word of it. In fact, it looked as if he was about to call the police, and see that Finn was charged with some form of domestic violence.</p><p>\u201cSounded like bloody murder!\u201d Fallon said.</p><p>Megan couldn\u2019t just hop up and explain herself. She was naked. She called out weakly from the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mr. Fallon, really. I just had a horrible nightmare. I\u2019m so, so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re in this wing of the house,\u201d Fallon said brusquely. \u201cYou\u2019d be waking up the whole household, with such caterwaulin\u2018! Do you have these nightmares often, young lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no ... of course not!\u201d Megan called.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see,\u201d Finn told Fallon irritably, \u201ceverything is perfectly all right in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, young man, there\u2019s not all that much that I can see\u2014since it\u2019s darned dark and all. But we don\u2019t take kindly to folks fighting around here\u2014not in Huntington House. We\u2019re a fine establishment with a good reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Finn said.</p><p>\u201cThe Merrills have a reputation in these parts, too,\u201d he said, referring to Megan\u2019s family.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if the reputation her family had earned was good or bad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honestly sorry, Mr. Fallon. There were too many tales filling my head when I fell asleep, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a nightmare,\u201d Megan said, her tone quiet but firm. She resented Mr. Fallon. She was suddenly certain that he didn\u2019t think much of the Merrill family at all.</p><p>\u201cSee that you keep it down,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cThere can be no more such outbursts\u2014sir!\u201d He had started speaking to Megan; he ended with a word of warning for Finn.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Finn said.</p><p>Fallon nodded, and moved off. Reluctantly, so it seemed.</p><p>Finn closed the door. Darkness descended with the nightlight gone from the hall. But a second later the room was flooded with light as Finn hit the switch at the side of the door. He leaned against the door, crossing his arms over his chest, staring at Megan.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I was beating you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Finn, surely not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows that we\u2019ve just gotten back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Fallon doesn\u2019t know a thing about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he seems to know all about your family, and therefore, he probably knows that we\u2019ve just gotten back together, and he surely thinks you made a major mistake and that I was about to slit your throat before he arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn, stop it. Surely, somewhere in his life, sometime before, someone has woken up from a nightmare, screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think? I\u2019ve never woken up before next to a woman screaming loud enough to burst my eardrums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Finn, I\u2019ve said that I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t do it on purpose! I had a dream, a really terrible nightmare. Someone was going to kill me!\u201d she said, surprised to feel a hint of the fear rising within her again, as if it would choke off her her speech. \u201cIn fact, a little sympathy would be in order.\u201d He stood, still distant, staring at her for a long moment. Even the way he looked now, far too tall for the terry bathrobe, legs seeming impossibly long beneath the white hem, she loved him so much. From his tousled dark hair to his bare feet. Things were so tenuous between them now. Before ... once, before, she would have flown from the bed and into his arms.</p><p>\u201cFinn!\u201d she said, still shaky, and growing angry herself.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, you nearly dislocated my jaw, Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you understand? I was deeply sleeping. I had a nightmare. A really terrifying nightmare.\u201d A muscle twitched in his cheek. Hair wild, arms folded over his chest, wearing her robe, he was both imposing and appealing. He had a great face. Not too pretty. Classic, masculine structure, strong chin line, solid, denned, cheekbones, fine, full mouth, dead straight, aristocratic nose. Not small, not too prominent Deep green eyes set beneath a broad brow, beneath rich dark hair. He was a natural athlete, in good shape. Now, though they were in the cool autumn of October in Massachusetts, they had just come from a week in the Florida Keys, and he was solidly bronzed and sleek, and ever more appealing.</p><p>She turned, lying back on her pillow, facing away from him.</p><p>A moment later, he was at her side.</p><p>She felt his fingers feather down her back. \u201cAll right, Megan, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine it was the fireside tales,\u201d she murmured, still resentful but not wanting the argument to go on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wrong thing to say. \u201cYou\u2019re from here!\u201d he said with something that sounded like a snort. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with family around here. And you were frightened by stories about Salem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were different stories, not really about Salem, and certainly not in the historical sense,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, right, let\u2019s see, All Hallow\u2019s Eve is coming, and evil is something that grows, that feeds on the atmosphere, and clings to the places where man\u2019s cruelty to man has been strong? Get serious, Megan, consider history, and that would be almost any place on earth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re right,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cAh, but then, a full moon will be rising. And the fog and the mist will swirl, and there are those living today who believe in the dark powers, who mean to raise the dead from their unhallowed graves, and set dark winds of evil free to haunt the world.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, suddenly angry. \u201cFinn, contemporary Salem is a lovely place peopled by those who scoff at witchcraft, and those who believe in their pursuit of wicca as a real religion, those who have darling shops and make a nice income off history, and those who run great restaurants and couldn\u2019t really care less.</p><p>And yes, sadly, the victims of the persecution here were surely innocent of the crimes attributed to them, but do you know what? There always were\u2014and perhaps still are\u2014 those who believed in witchcraft, or not witchcraft, Satanism, or whatever you want to call it, and they do bad things in their belief. Damn, Finn\u2014think about it! Are there still bad people out there? Yes, I think so. So I listened to stories about the evil in men\u2019s hearts, in their belief in the powers of darkness and things that go bump in the night, and I had a bad dream. That\u2019s not so bizarre, or unforgivable.\u201d He lay back down, fingers laced behind his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have a cousin who operates a witchcraft shop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing evil about Morwenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say there was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t illegal to be a wiccan now. It was illegal to practice any form of witchcraft in the sixteen hundreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorwenna believes in earth and nature, and in doing good things to and for people, especially because any evil thought or deed is supposed to come back at a wiccan threefold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her freaking tall, dark, and eerie, palm-reading husband, Ethan, is a fucking pillar of the community?\u201d he said sarcastically.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are we fighting about my cousin and her husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m starting to think it was a major mistake to come here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to come,\u201d she reminded him curtly. \u201cThis was a good move for your career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come home and turn into a screaming harpy.\u201d She turned her back on him once again, hurt more than she could begin to say. A mistake? Had it all been a mistake?</p><p>From the moment she had first seen Finn, her first day of college, she had begun falling for him. She\u2019d never wanted anyone so badly in her life, she had just about chased him shamelessly, but it had been all right, because he had returned her mad obsession. In a matter of days, she\u2019d just about lost all thought of her classes, eager, anxious, desperate, to be with him at any given time. They\u2019d eluded their friends time and time again to spend their precious hours together. At first, there had been no arguments\u2014in truth, they hadn\u2019t talked enough to argue, they\u2019d wanted nothing more than to touch, to be in one another\u2019s arms, naked, making love. The unfailing flame of simple chemistry had been so strong that they\u2019d defied all advice and married one weekend, standing before friends and the priest in a small town in southern Georgia. For a few years, they had lived in the bliss of the young and innocent Finn had graduated, and scholarships and student work programs had ended. Megan had another two years to go, finances grew tight; music equipment was expensive. They\u2019d begun to struggle. There were arguments about what made money, what didn\u2019t, what was good, what wasn\u2019t The differences between them, which had at first seemed so charming, became points of friction. She had hunches and intuitions; he was entirely pragmatic. She was from Massachusetts, and other than her initial, abandoned adoration for him, she tended to a New Englander\u2019s reserve. Finn was from the Deep South, ready to plow into any situation and offer anything they had to anyone. She was close to her parents; his were divorced and remarried, and he made dutiful calls once a month, and sent cards and presents to his little half-siblings, but they seldom visited either of his parents. He loathed his stepfather, barely tolerated his stepmother, and had been on his own from the day he had graduated from high school. Then his father died of a heart attack, and he was torn between resentment that he hadn\u2019t even been remembered in the will, and guilt that he hadn\u2019t made more of an effort to communicate despite his unease about his stepmother. He\u2019d started spending long hours out when Megan thought he should have needed her most. He took more and more out-of-town work. Jealousy, doubt, mistrust ... the little enemies that came together to tear down a relationship began to flourish and grow. Then, slowly, little shadows of doubt and anger began, and then, for Megan, the final, agonizing, hateful straw, the flutist Finn brought into his group. She didn\u2019t leave right away; she was still too desperately in love. And arguments were too easily solved because anger was such a vivid emotion, and fights too easily solved by giving in to the heat and adrenaline of the moment, falling back into bed, and rising later to discover that nothing had been solved. At last, the doubts moved in too deeply, and she had no intention of losing all self-respect, or letting her own hopes for a fulfilling career become crushed by standing in the background, giving way completely.</p><p>She left.</p><p>But there was really no way to leave Finn behind completely. She had always loved the look of him, the feel of him, the deep quality of his voice, the sound of his laughter. The scent of him. Her folks had been living in Maine at the time, and she\u2019d gone home, and taken work with an old friend who was a guitarist, singing light rock and folk music at a coffeeshop. The pay hadn\u2019t been great, but the hours and perks had been wonderful\u2014great coffee, good food, and time to work on the songwriting that was her true love and passion in life\u2014 as far as her career went. Living with her parents wasn\u2019t difficult, their home in Maine was large, and she had an entire area of the place to herself, a carriage house that had been beautifully remodeled into an apartment.</p><p>But when she should have been working, she spent her time wondering about her estranged husband, and the flutist.</p> <p>Maybe the flutist was no longer with him. Maybe he had moved on to a keyboard player.</p><p>She had been away for six months, wondering whether or not to sign the divorce papers, when he had shown up one night at the coffeeshop. Civil at first, but cold. He had quizzed her about her friend, Harry, with whom she was working. She thought about letting him think what he wanted to think. Harry was handsome. Gorgeous. Dark haired, blue eyed. Really nice. So was his boyfriend. When Finn cast off his mantle of cool detachment, she found herself admitting that Harry would never be more than a friend, though a very good friend. And when they stood in the summer breeze outside the place, he told her very seriously that there had never been anything between him and the flutist, any other musician, or any other woman, period. She had suspected; he had denied, and then been angry that she had suspected, and ... it just hadn\u2019t been a good time. He couldn\u2019t live without her, and he wanted her back.</p><p>She could have melted on the spot, and in her way, she did, throwing herself into his arms, practically sobbing, ready to strip him in the street. She didn\u2019t tell her parents he was there that night; she was just grateful that her apartment was an annex, far to the left of the main house.</p><p>They\u2019d gone home to New Orleans the next week, where he\u2019d had great work lately, fronting a number of well-known groups at the House of Blues. Many of their friends had been skeptical. Mainly because of the bread episode.</p><p>In the midst of one of their arguments, he\u2019d backed her against a table on their balcony, which overlooked the street. She had been about to make sandwiches.</p><p>The bread was there, and she had furiously grabbed the loaf by its plastic cover, and struck him over the head. Naturally, they\u2019d been seen. Rumor spread. He\u2019d been pushing her around. She\u2019d struck him not with bread, but a bottle of wine. According to rumor, she\u2019d desperately attacked him with the wine because he\u2019d been about to use violence against her. No matter how many times she\u2019d tried to tell people it had been a loaf of bread, a bottle of wine made a better story. When they\u2019d split, it hadn\u2019t seemed to matter too much. Now, explaining the episode was tiresome.</p><p>Friends had called friends ... had called relatives... had called her parents. So naturally now that they were back, her folks were concerned.</p><p>It was possible to understand Finn\u2019s anger when she had screamed so ...</p><p>But he should have understood as well.</p><p>She wished she hadn\u2019t screamed here, in Salem.</p><p>She had actually grown up not in Salem, but in close-by Marblehead. And though she was able to see many members of her extended family, they hadn\u2019t come for that reason. Finn had come home one day to tell her that he\u2019d received a really top quality financial offer to entertain at a hotel in Salem for the entire week before Halloween. The money was truly impressive; the prestige of being offered such a solo gig was equally persuasive. First, they were going on a vacation, taking the honeymoon they\u2019d never had before, and spend time in Florida. Sunny Florida, and then spooky old Salem. While they were gone, the workmen could do some of the necessary repairs on their home in the French Quarter, and it would all be perfect Perhaps he hadn\u2019t realized just how far rumors had gone, and that her family members would all stare at him, wondering if he was a wife beater, if Megan shouldn\u2019t have stayed as far away from him as she could.</p><p>She turned, wanting then to make amends, wishing she\u2019d never touched that loaf of bread.</p><p>To her surprise, he was no longer lying awake. His eyes were closed, lips slightly parted, and he was breathing deeply and evenly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFinn?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Megan slipped out of the bed, frowning, but he still didn\u2019t wake. She walked over to the big, overstuffed antique chair by the fireplace and found her heavy velour robe, wrapping it tightly around her. She pulled back the draperies to the balcony door, hesitated, then slipped out.</p> <p>October in Massachusetts. A cool breeze was softly moving, but it wasn\u2019t uncomfortably cold outside.</p><p>The sky was beautiful and strange, a deep blue, almost black in places, and light, almost ethereal in others. As she looked down at the street below, she saw a slow whirl of fog, and she found herself remembering the words of the crusty old storyteller who had been at the fireside tale-telling earlier in town.</p><p>Ah, but though those caught, hanged, and pressed to death, as old Giles Corey, were most probably true innocents, those earlier guardians of justice might not have been so foolish in their fears of evil, though they were daft in their methods of discovery. Think my friends, when there is goodness, there must be evil, and evil is rooted in the very history of mankind. Throughout the years there have been stories of man, and of beasts, and of those creatures who fall somewhere in between them. As there have been angels, there have been devils. There is the Good Book and there are works of the greatest demonic frenzy, and there have always been, as there are now, those who seek the secrets of the Devil, of imps and demons from beyond, of the salvage of beings we remember only in the deepest, darkest, recesses of our hearts . . . it\u2019s said, you know, that on Hallow's Eve, it is the night when the dead may rise . . . especially if they are so bidden, if, perhaps, they are called from the fires of hell to walk upon the earth once again, to inhabit the lives and souls of man.</p><p>A log had fallen in the fire then; half the old man\u2019s audience had jumped and cried out, and then laughed.</p><p>Megan had done so herself. She hadn\u2019t imagined that she would come back to their rented room, dream of evil, and scream in the night.</p> <p>The fog below appeared to be blue. It seemed to spiral, puff, curl, and move like some living thing itself.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of fog ...</p><p>She felt the lightest touch against her nape. Fingers, lifting her hair, softy, gently. She closed her eyes and smiled.</p><p>Finn had awakened. He was behind her.</p><p>That was his ritual. He would come to her. Stand in silence. Touch her hair, lift her hair, press his lips against the flesh of her nape. She felt him touch her then. The hot moistness of his lips, the warm, arousing moisture of his breath. In seconds, his arms would come around her. He would tell her that he loved her.</p><p>And being Finn, he would bring his hips hard against her while he held her, and probably whisper that if she was going to scream, he should see to it that she was screaming for all the right reasons, because the things he could do to her were just so good that she couldn\u2019t begin to help herself...</p> <p>She felt his hands, sliding over the velour, under it, touching her flesh ...</p><p>His touch fell away. She thought she heard him breathing ... waiting. Waiting for her to turn into his arms, melt into them as she always did.</p><p>\u201cFinn ...\u201d</p><p>She spun around, ready to do just that.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>She was alone on the balcony.</p><p>The breeze suddenly turned colder. The eerie blue fog was rising from the street, moving quickly, coming higher, as if it were eager to engulf her. </p> </body></html>"]
