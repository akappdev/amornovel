Indeed, there are many who have never left the province in which they were born; contented crofters tilling the land, tending orchards, or raising sheep, never venturing farther than the nearest market.</p><p>Betimes, I envy them.</p><p>Already, as a young man, I have gone farther than I could have imagined as a boy daydreaming in the Sanctuary of Elua where I was raised. It did not begin by choice\u2014as all the world knows, I was abducted by Carthaginian slave-traders, sold into slavery in Menekhet, and from thence taken to the land of Drujan, ruled by a madman who consorted with a dark and ancient god.</p> <p>It was a short time ago as historians reckon such things, but a long time ago in my life. I will never bear those memories lightly, but I have learned to bear them. Since that time, since I was rescued and restored, I have ventured as far south as Jebe-Barkal and lost Saba; and as far north as Vralia, an unlikely kingdom arising in the harsh glory of the cold north.</p><p>I have been wed and widowed.</p><p>I have become a father, almost.</p><p>And I have fallen in love, which is somewhat altogether different. It was not with my wife, Dorelei, although she was worthy of such devotion and in the end I did come to love her. Love of my wife is what drove me to Vralia, seeking justice on her behalf. I found it, too, although it was not entirely what I expected. Still, the man who killed her is dead, and his skull lies buried beneath her feet in Alba.</p><p>But there is a difference between loving and being in love\u2014that maddening passion that expands the heart and exalts the soul, that shakes the heavens and roils the depths of hell. That, I have known but once. Betimes I wish it was with Dorelei and her thoughtful, gentle ways. Betimes I wish it was with anyone, anyone else. A crofter\u2019s daughter, a merchant\u2019s son. Anyone whose station in life would raise no alarms. Who would allow me to stay in one place, to live and love and be happy. Whose bedchamber would not become a political battleground, raising the unwelcome spectre of my treasonous mother and her eternal scheming.</p> <p>Anyone but Sidonie.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t, though.</p><p>And I knew it.</p><p>I knew it in Alba, when I was still bound by strange magics, struggling to shed my youthful self-absorption and fulfill my duties as a man. We hadn\u2019t been sure, Sidonie and I. Too young, too uncertain. What had begun between us was always more than casual dalliance, although I daresay she knew the stakes better than I did. My royal cousin, Sidonie de la Courcel, Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange, eldest daughter and acknowledged heir of Queen Ysandre.</p><p>The one person in the world I could not love without raising suspicion.</p><p>I knew it was love, real and enduring; we both knew it. When it began, Sidonie asked me, Imriel, tell me truly, she said. How much of what lies between us is just the lure of the forbidden?</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t answer it, not then. I didn\u2019t know. I knew I wanted her, fiercely. I knew there was a dark fire in her depths that fed my own desires. I didn\u2019t know about the aching abyss of tenderness and yearning that would open between us, unassuaged by time or distance. Nor, I daresay, did she.</p><p>We discovered it together.</p><p>And when Dorelei and my unborn son died, Sidonie and I both bore a measure of guilt for it. If we had been more certain, more courageous, it would never have happened. Love as thou wilt, Blessed Elua\u2019s precept commands us. We hadn\u2019t dared. We took the sensible route and waited. We\u2019d feared to throw the realm into turmoil.</p><p>Well and so, it happened anyway.</p><p>There was no triumphal reception in the City of Elua when we returned from Alba after overseeing the burial of the skull of the man who killed my wife and son. Still, D\u2019Angelines will do as they will. A great many of them turned out in support the day we rode into the City, cheering wildly. There were Tsingani and Yeshuites among them, too, for which I take no credit. For their part, it is Ph\u00e8dre they adore; Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay, Comtesse de Montr\u00e8ve, my foster-mother, a heroine of the realm. For as long as I live, deserved or not, I will coast on the goodwill she and her consort, Joscelin, have engendered among folk who long for heroes.</p><p>But there were others, too.</p><p>Not many, but enough. Knots of folk, here and there, amid the throngs. Men and women of middling age, sporting black armbands, eyes hard and faces grim. Where they congregated, the cheers were dampened. As we passed, they held out their hands, thumbs outthrust, rotating their hands to give the ancient signal of Tiberian imperators.</p><p>Thumbs down.</p> <p>Death.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked Sidonie as we rode. \u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><p>Her face was pale. \u201cFamilies of her victims.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cMy mother\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they reckon, yes. Families with loved ones who died during Skaldia\u2019s invasion.\u201d Sidonie met my eyes. Hers were dark and troubled. Cruithne eyes, the only sign of her mixed heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that your mother was condemned to execution and escaped it. They have a right to their anger, Imriel. No one said this would be easy. Are you willing to face it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I am. Are you?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cThe cost you bear is higher.\u201d</p><p>Somewhat shifted in the depths of her black eyes, a certitude settling into place. Her slender shoulders were set and squared. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I stand beside you.\u201d I kneed the Bastard. My speckled horse snorted and pranced, jostling alongside Sidonie\u2019s palfrey. I reached out to lay my hand over hers briefly. \u201cAlways. For as long as you will have me, and longer, I will stand at your side.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed my hand. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Neither of us knew for a surety what we would face upon our return. The Queen was opposed to our union, that much was certain. Whether or not she would actively seek to part us, not even Sidonie could say.</p><p>Our company parted ways in the City of Elua. Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, along with their loyal retainers Ti-Philippe and Hugues, would retire to Montr\u00e8ve\u2019s townhouse. I meant to continue on to the Palace with Sidonie and her personal guard. I\u2019d had quarters there, once. Queen Ysandre had granted them to me herself, delighted with my impending marriage to Dorelei, niece of the Cruarch of Alba. Of course, she\u2019d not known I was already in love with her daughter.</p><p>She knew now. I didn\u2019t know if my quarters still existed. I didn\u2019t even know if I\u2019d be welcome at the Palace. Still, there was no way to find out but to try.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Ph\u00e8dre asked, searching my face. \u201cYou could stay with us and send word to Ysandre seeking audience. It might be easier.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m too old to hide behind your skirts, Ph\u00e8dre. Or your sword,\u201d I added to Joscelin.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWhen did you ever?\u201d</p><p>It made me smile a little. \u201cWell, the cloak of your heroism, then. I need to face this myself. Anyway, I\u2019ve broken no law, committed no crime.\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre sighed. \u201cAs you will, love. I\u2019ll send word to Ysandre myself. Mayhap she\u2019s ready to hear reason.\u201d</p><p>They had been away as long as I had, Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin; bound first on a mysterious errand, then setting out in pursuit of me after learning I\u2019d nearly been killed in Alba and was hunting the man, the magician, who had done it, who had slain my wife and our unborn son. If anyone could make the Queen hear reason, I thought, it would be Ph\u00e8dre. She had been the one to expose my mother\u2019s treachery in abetting the Skaldi invasion, and she had been the one who gave the testimony that condemned my mother to death.</p><p>But when I thought about those folk on the street, their thumbs pointing downward in a stark reminder that Melisande Shahrizai had evaded justice, I wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>She hugged me in farewell. \u201cCome to dinner on the morrow and we\u2019ll talk. Everyone will want to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promised.</p><p>I turned in the saddle to glance after them as they rode toward the townhouse. If Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin could weather everything that fate had thrown at them, I reckoned Sidonie and I had a chance. Sidonie caught my eye when I turned back and read my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just politics,\u201d she said. \u201cNot hordes of Skaldi, shapeshifting magicians, or deadly madmen bent on destroying the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I said. \u201cThere is that.\u201d</p><p>As it transpired, I needn\u2019t have worried over our reception, which was cordial and proper. After all, Sidonie was returning from a state mission, representing her mother in Alba\u2014and it was true, I\u2019d done naught wrong. I was a Prince of the Blood in my own right, returning from avenging my wife, the Queen\u2019s own niece by marriage.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, your highness.\u201d The royal chamberlain greeted Sidonie with a deep bow. \u201cYour mother awaits you in her quarters as soon as you have had a chance to refresh yourself.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie inclined her head. \u201cMy thanks, Lord Robert.\u201d</p><p>The chamberlain accorded me a bow only slightly less formal, as was fitting. \u201cWelcome, Prince Imriel. Your quarters are in readiness. Her majesty will send for you at a later time to express her gratitude in person for your brave deeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thanks,\u201d I echoed.</p><p>Well and so. Sidonie and I glanced at one another. She tilted her head, smiling slightly. \u201cGo on. I\u2019ll send word to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>I watched her walk away, surrounded by her guard in their blue livery with the pale stripes. We\u2019d scarce left one another\u2019s side since being reunited in Alba\u2014truly reunited. We had years of lost time to make up. But we had agreed that once we reached the Palace, diplomacy and tact would serve us better than flagrant public displays of passion. So I watched her go, took a deep breath, and made my way to my quarters.</p><p>That was something, anyway. If Ysandre had maintained my quarters within the Palace, she didn\u2019t mean to accuse me of sedition.</p><p>They were pleasant quarters, nicely appointed, with a fresco of Eisheth gathering herbs on the ceiling, and a balcony overlooking one of the gardens. I sent a chambermaid to order a bath drawn, then wandered the rooms, waiting for the bath to be filled and servants to bring the trunk with my clothing and possessions that had been in our train.</p><p>I lingered in the bedroom, overcome by memory. The bed was larger than I remembered; I\u2019d grown accustomed to a smaller scale in Alba. I twisted the knotted gold ring on my finger without thinking, clenching my fist until it bit into my palm. It was here that Sidonie had given it to me. But in truth, this bedchamber held more memories of Dorelei.</p><p>Gods, I\u2019d been an ass to her!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love,\u201d I murmured. \u201cYou made me a better man in the end. I\u2019ll try to be worthy of it.\u201d</p><p>It had been Dorelei\u2019s last wish to send me back to Sidonie. I\u2019d done it, although I hadn\u2019t wanted to. She\u2019d been right to do it, though. If I hadn\u2019t, if I hadn\u2019t seized that bright thread of hope and joy . . . I don\u2019t know what would have become of me. I might have become a cold and bitter monster, like the vision I saw of our grown son. I might have died in the far reaches of Vralia, bereft of all reason to live. Such things are never given to us to know, and in my experience, it is best not to meddle.</p><p>That had been a year ago.</p><p>A year since Ysandre de la Courcel found me kneeling, heartbroken, in her daughter\u2019s embrace. A year since she burst into fury, speaking words that singed my ears. I\u2019d left the City of Elua that day. Two days later, I\u2019d departed on the trail of the man who killed my wife, the bear-witch who\u2019d nearly taken my life, too. But in those few days, Sidonie and I had done a fair job of overturning the entire Court.</p><p>Now I was back.</p><p>The servants brought my trunk. I unpacked my things myself. There wasn\u2019t much aside from clothing: a leather-bound book of love letters that Sidonie had given me, a wooden flute that had been a gift from Hugues, and a flint-striking kit. Everything else, I carried on me. My sword and dagger. The etched vambraces Dorelei had commissioned for me. Sidonie\u2019s ring. The gold torc that marked me as a prince of Alba. Drustan mab Necthana, the Cruarch of Alba, had given it to me himself when I wed Dorelei there. And in the purse at my belt, a smooth stone with a hole in the center; a croonie-stone, the ollamhs called it.</p><p>It had been part of the bindings that protected me from Alban magic, and I carried it for remembrance. I never wanted to be bound like that again, ever. The bindings had protected me, but they\u2019d severed me from myself, too.</p><p>Never again.</p><p>And yet if it hadn\u2019t been for that binding, I might have spent all my days with Dorelei aching and miserable, seething in discontent. I might never have learned to love her, and grown from a pining, self-absorbed youth to a man in the process.</p><p>Or she might not have been slain.</p><p>I would never know.</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel?\u201d The chambermaid appeared in the doorway, startling me out of my reverie. \u201cYour bath is ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I racked my memory. \u201cDelphine, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord.\u201d She bobbed a curtsy. \u201cI\u2019m . . . We were all very sorry to hear of Lady Dorelei\u2019s death. She was kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I repeated. \u201cYes, she was.\u201d</p><p>The chambermaid hesitated, sympathy and avid curiosity warring on her pert features. \u201cIs it true that you, that you and . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cWell, then . . . well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I agreed gravely.</p><p>Politics and gossip, the lifeblood of the D\u2019Angeline Court. I dismissed Delphine from the bathing-chamber, sinking into the warm water and enjoying a few minutes of luxurious privacy before I heard a familiar voice arguing at the door to the antechamber. I listened, smiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d I called out at length. \u201cYou may admit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName of Elua!\u201d My cousin Mavros Shahrizai strode into the bathing-chamber and glared at me, hands on his hips. His midnight-black hair was loose and rippling, his blue eyes vivid with emotion. We bore an unmistakable family resemblance. \u201cDo you never think to send word? We worry, you know.\u201d</p><p>I stood in the tub, dripping. \u201cHello, Mavros.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d He gripped my bare shoulders and gave me the kiss of greeting, then held me away from him, gazing with a critical eye at the pink furrows of flesh that ran at a raking angle from my right shoulder to my left hip. \u201cGods, it\u2019s worse than I reckoned. You didn\u2019t tell me that bastard nearly gutted you.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI lived.\u201d</p><p>His fingers flexed, digging into my shoulders. \u201cIdiot. He\u2019s dead now, right? You brought his head home in a bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd buried it in Clunderry,\u201d I said. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>Mavros let go of me, fetching a stool and dragging it nearer the tub. \u201cFinish your bath and tell me about it.\u201d</p> <p>For as long a journey as it had been, there wasn\u2019t much to tell. It had been a slow, plodding hunt. I\u2019d been shipwrecked on the EasternSea and lost weeks stranded on an isolated island while we salvaged and repaired our damaged ship. I\u2019d been mistaken for an ally of raiding Tartars in a Vralian village and thrown in gaol. I\u2019d managed to escape, and followed Berlik to the place where he\u2019d sought refuge, spending countless days attempting to find him in the trackless wilderness.</p><p>In the end, he found me.</p><p>\u201cSo he wanted to die?\u201d Mavros asked when I finished.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cTo make atonement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He thought about it while I dried myself and slipped into a dressing-robe. \u201cDo you reckon it worked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I knotted the robe\u2019s sash. \u201cWhat he did . . . as awful as it was, I came to understand it. He thought it was the only way to spare his people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom the future your son would bring,\u201d Mavros said slowly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I shivered, remembering the vision. A young man, his features a mixture of mine and Dorelei\u2019s, but bitter and cruel. Armies raging over Alba, blood-sodden fields. Women and children dragged from their homes, houses put to the torch. Men hunted like animals. The standing stones and the sacred groves, destroyed. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing, Mavros. I\u2019ll not defy Blessed Elua\u2019s precept again and I want nothing more to do with strange magics. All I want is to be left in peace for a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d His tone was wry.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cSidonie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it worth it?\u201d he asked with genuine curiosity.</p><p>I turned the gold ring on my finger. Despite everything, the love I felt for her was undiminished. The soaring exaltation, the inexplicable rightness of the fit. The shared laughter and talk, the common, ordinary happiness. And somewhere beneath it, a sense that this was important and needful. I couldn\u2019t explain it. I only knew it was true.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know House Shahrizai stands behind you,\u201d Mavros said. \u201cAlthough things being what they are, our support might not be terribly helpful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I noticed.\u201d I gestured, pointing my thumb downward.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d His face was introspective. \u201cYou and Sidonie . . . it raised old fears, opened old wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know I\u2019ve no aspiration toward the throne?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do.\u201d Mavros glanced up at me. \u201cBut I\u2019m not the one you need to convince. There are a few thousand of those, starting with her majesty the Queen.\u201d As though summoned by his words, there was a knock at the outer door\u2014one of Ysandre\u2019s guards, come to fetch me to audience. Mavros laughed humorlessly. \u201cWell, and here\u2019s your first chance.\u201d</p><p>After bidding Mavros farewell and donning clean attire, I accompanied the guard to my audience with Ysandre. It was early evening and the Palace was beginning to come alive with what revelries the coming night would hold: private f\u00eates, wagers in the Hall of Games, mayhap a performance in the theatre.</p><p>I endured the gauntlet of stares and whispers. I was used to it; it had been my lot since I had first returned to Terre d\u2019Ange as a child. I met the stares, returned them with a level gaze, trying to read the faces behind them.</p><p>Some were sympathetic.</p><p>A few were hostile and guarded.</p><p>Most were simply curious.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be a state reception or a private one. It turned out to be somewhere between the two. The Queen received me in her private quarters, but Lady Denise Grosmaine, the Secretary of the Presence, was in attendance, which meant whatever transpired would be documented for the Royal Archives.</p><p>I entered the Queen\u2019s salon and bowed low.</p><p>\u201cWe welcome you home, Prince Imriel.\u201d Ysandre\u2019s tone was even. Careful.</p><p>I straightened. \u201cMy thanks, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre de la Courcel had ruled Terre d\u2019Ange since before I was born. She\u2019d assumed the throne when she was no older than I was now, and she\u2019d had a long time to learn to school her features into a polite mask. But I was Kushiel\u2019s scion, and I could see a measure of what lay behind the mask\u2014hurt, betrayal, and anger. It hadn\u2019t gone away since I left. It had settled into a deep place inside her.</p><p>Still, she was the Queen, and a very good one.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014\u201d She paused, then continued, her voice firm. \u201cI wish to thank you for avenging the death of my husband\u2019s blood-kin. I wish to tell you that Drustan, that the Cruarch of Alba, sent a letter commending you for your courage and persistence. We are both grateful to know that the spirit of Dorelei mab Breidaia will rest peacefully thanks to your efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cShe was my wife. She would have been the mother of my son. I pray they are both at peace.\u201d</p><p>The Secretary of the Presence recorded our words, her pen scratching softly on paper. I gazed at Ysandre. Sidonie had inherited her mother\u2019s fairness, although Ysandre\u2019s hair was a paler hue. She had inherited her mother\u2019s cool, reserved beauty. But she had not inherited a kingdom on the verge of being invaded and conquered due to the treachery of Melisande Shahrizai.</p><p>Ysandre inclined her head. \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p><p>I spread my hands. \u201cYour majesty . . .\u201d</p><p>Her expression hardened. \u201cWe will discuss the other matter at a later date. There will be a Priest of Elua seeking an audience with you to discuss these things. I recommend you grant it.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to make a reply or an appeal, then thought better of it and inclined my head. \u201cOf course, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>With that, I was dismissed.</p><p>Outside of Ysandre\u2019s quarters, I leaned against the wall and exhaled hard. Ah, Elua! Love shouldn\u2019t have to be so hard.</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel?\u201d a cheerful voice asked. I squinted at the speaker. One of Sidonie\u2019s guardsmen, a short, wiry lad with dark hair. He grinned at me. \u201cThat bad, eh? Her highness sent me to fetch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve had all day,\u201d I said.</p><p>His grin widened. \u201cThought you might think so.\u201d</p><p>The guard, whose name was Alfonse, led me to Sidonie\u2019s quarters. It was the first time I\u2019d entered them openly as her acknowledged lover, and it felt strange. I half expected to be halted. But no; Sidonie\u2019s guard was loyal, and it seemed Ysandre wasn\u2019t minded to intervene, at least not overtly, not yet. I suspected it had little to do with tolerance for the situation, and more to do with fear of driving Sidonie into open rebellion.</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s rooms were larger and finer than my own. There was an abundance of candles lit against the encroaching darkness. Covered platters sat on the dining table, and the succulent aromas seeping from beneath the domes made me realize I was hungry.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Sidonie, seated on a couch, set down the sheaf of letters she was reading. \u201cI thought it might be nicer to dine in my chambers than face the gawking horde on our first night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m ravenous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She rose with deft grace. \u201cHow was Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordial.\u201d I caught her hand. \u201cHow did you find her?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie kissed my throat. \u201cFormal.\u201d</p><p>I ran a lock of her hair through my fingers. \u201cShe wants me to speak to a Priest of Elua.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI told you I\u2019d been working to gain the support of the priesthood while you were gone. If they\u2019re convinced that what\u2019s between us is genuine, it will make it harder for her to oppose it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m to convince them? Seems I\u2019m expected to do a good deal of convincing these days.\u201d I traced the line of her brows, so similar to my own. \u201cWhat of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve already done my part, at least with the priesthood.\u201d Sidonie turned her head to kiss my palm, then smiled at me. \u201cThey\u2019re sure of me. Now it falls to you to convince them that this isn\u2019t part of an evil scheme to gain the throne by seducing me and winning my heart.\u201d She took my hand in hers, kissing the tips of my fingers.</p><p>The pulse of desire quickened in me. \u201cAnyone fool enough to think that doesn\u2019t know you very well,\u201d I said, my voice sounding rough in my ears.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Sidonie glanced up at me, then slid my index finger into her mouth and sucked on it, just long enough to turn desire\u2019s pulse into a throbbing, thundering drumbeat. Her black eyes sparkled with wicked amusement. \u201cBut, then, most people don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I made a wordless sound, stooped, and scooped her into my arms. Sidonie laughed softly, looping her arms around my neck as I carried her toward the bedchamber, kissing her.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were ravenous,\u201d she teased.</p><p>I nudged the bedchamber door open. \u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>So began our life of uneasy stalemate at Court.</p><p>Sidonie and I neither hid nor flaunted our relationship. Everyone knew, of course. But since Ysandre had chosen, at least for the time, to treat it as though it didn\u2019t exist, it wasn\u2019t discussed openly, at least not in earshot of anyone who might report to the Queen.</p><p>It was discussed a great deal in private. It was discussed with glee by young nobles engaged in the Game of Courtship, many of whom were surprisingly supportive, reveling in a tale of tragic romance. They were too young to remember the Skaldi invasion, which had happened before I was born. Melisande Shahrizai was only a name, a story. She\u2019d been in exile for over twenty years, first in the Temple of Asherat in La Serenissima, and then vanishing to Elua-knows-where.</p><p>But there were plenty of others old enough to remember, and many of them discussed it with mistrust and suspicion. Not all of them. For every D\u2019Angeline who regarded me as the potentially traitorous spawn of Melisande Shahrizai and Benedicte de la Courcel\u2014who had only escaped being convicted of treason by virtue of dying before he could be tried\u2014there was another who regarded me as the foster-son of Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay and Joscelin Verreuil, undeniably heroes of the realm.</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre did meet with Ysandre. She had been the Queen\u2019s confidante for a long time, and she could be damnably persuasive. Not this time.</p><p>\u201cShe claims I\u2019m too close to the matter to be an objective judge when it comes to Imriel,\u201d she said, frustrated.</p><p>\u201cShe has a point, love,\u201d Joscelin observed. He put up his hands in a peaceable gesture when Ph\u00e8dre raised her brows at him. \u201cYou and I and everyone under this roof know that you\u2019re right. But in Ysandre\u2019s mind, you\u2019d defend Imri under any circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scared.\u201d I toyed with one of the quince tarts that Eug\u00e8nie had made in honor of my visit, the second visit that week. \u201cFor ten years, she\u2019s had people like Barquiel L\u2019Envers telling her that she was nursing a serpent in the bosom of House Courcel. Now it looks as though I\u2019ve proved them right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSinking your fangs deep into her heir\u2019s tender breast,\u201d Ti-Philippe commented.</p><p>I flushed. \u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me with amusement. \u201cOr not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019ll have to listen to the priesthood if they choose to speak on your behalf,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre mused. \u201cThat was a shrewd thought on Sidonie\u2019s part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan on telling them?\u201d Joscelin asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea.\u201d</p><p>I had indeed received a request from Brother Thomas Jubert, the senior member of the Great Temple of Elua here in the City, summoning me to an audience in two days\u2019 time. I had agreed to it readily. At the time I\u2019d not felt apprehensive, but as the meeting approached that began to change. If the priesthood did choose to give us their blessing, well and good. It wouldn\u2019t change much in political terms, but it might go some way toward swaying the hearts of those in doubt, and it would make it difficult for Ysandre to move toward outright opposition.</p><p>And if they didn\u2019t, it would seal the opinion of those who opposed us. And it would make it a great deal easier for Ysandre to issue an edict ordering her wayward heir to choose between me and her inheritance.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if she would. And I didn\u2019t know what Sidonie would do if she did. All I knew was that I didn\u2019t want to find out. If I could rip out my heart and show it to the priest, I thought, it would be simple. If I could live out my life before his eyes, show him I intended no harm and aspired to nothing more than spending the balance of my days at Sidonie\u2019s side, it would be simple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I couldn\u2019t, and mere words seemed an inadequate tool.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d I asked Sidonie the night before my meeting with the priest, pacing the salon. \u201cConvince him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke from the heart.\u201d She smiled slightly. \u201cAt considerable length. I think mayhap I wore him down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what did you say?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s right to tell you.\u201d Sidonie regarded me, her expression unreadable. \u201cAnd even if it is, I can\u2019t lend you my words, Imriel. They won\u2019t help. You have to find your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know.\u201d I halted my pacing and sat on the couch beside her. \u201cBut it would help me to hear it, truly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She drew her knees up beneath her gown, lacing her arms around them. Her dark Cruithne gaze rested on me. \u201cI said a lot. It\u2019s probably for the best I don\u2019t remember half of it.\u201d Her smile came and went in a quick flicker. \u201cI don\u2019t want to swell your head. In the end . . .\u201d She lifted her chin, her gaze moving off into the distance. \u201cWhy you? That\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? Why is this worth sowing unrest in Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and kept silent.</p> <p>\u201cBlessed Elua doesn\u2019t join hearts without a purpose.\u201d Sidonie knit her brows. \u201cSince I was old enough to know my own name, I\u2019ve known I was my mother\u2019s heir. I\u2019ve grown up learning and understanding the responsibilities that entails. And until . . . until that night, the Longest Night, when I first kissed you, I\u2019d scarce done a single thing that wasn\u2019t in keeping with those duties. Not one action, not one deed, not one misspoken word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery proper,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Her gaze shifted back to me. \u201cImriel, you are the one person in the world, the only person in the world, my mother would forbid me. And yes, I did think in the beginning, mayhap it was only that. Some long-stifled act of rebellion. But it wasn\u2019t. So, why? Surely there must be purpose in it.\u201d Her voice dropped, softening. \u201cLove chooses. We don\u2019t, not always. I could have chosen anyone, anyone else, and I would have learned nothing of the terrible might of love, the power and sacrifice. What manner of D\u2019Angeline would I have been, then? What manner of person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be you,\u201d I said. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie tilted her head, her gaze sliding away once more, contemplating somewhat I couldn\u2019t see. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure. This land, this realm of ours, at its worst . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWe can be a vain, proud, and insular people. I know it. I\u2019ve felt it all my life.\u201d Her mouth quirked. \u201cI hear what people say. Cruithne half-breed. And the worst of it was always leveled against Alais, not me, just because of the way she looks. It hurt more in a way because I couldn\u2019t protect her from it. She\u2019s my younger sister; we share the same blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAnd pride in it on both sides. So you should, Sidonie.\u201d I touched the torc at my throat. It had been a proud day when Drustan gave it to me. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her dark gaze returned. \u201cMy mother and father, D\u2019Angeline and Alban, a love-match despite themselves, uniting two realms. Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, anguissette and Cassiline Brother, facing untold danger. Anafiel Delaunay, keeping his oath after so many years, honoring his lost love. Ah, Elua!\u201d Sidonie drew a deep breath, eyes bright with unshed tears. \u201cAt its best . . . at its best, Terre d\u2019Ange has a great deal to teach the world about the nature of love and how we might best live our lives.\u201d Her voice grew stronger. \u201cAnd I do not think I would ever have understood that if I had not fallen in love with the one person in the world it was not proper to love.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, the hair on the back of my neck prickling.</p><p>\u201cI had a long time to think while you were surviving shipwrecks and gaol and endless hunts through the trackless wilderness.\u201d Sidonie wiped her eyes impatiently, adding, \u201cYou can close your mouth now.\u201d</p><p>I did. \u201cSidonie . . .\u201d</p><p>She uncoiled, reaching for me. Her hands sank deep into my hair. Her face was close, so near our breath mingled, and her expression was fierce. \u201cSo now you know. But I don\u2019t want to talk anymore. I don\u2019t want to think anymore. Not here, not now.\u201d</p><p>I obliged her.</p><p>Our love-making wasn\u2019t gentle that night. Betimes it could be. Betimes it wasn\u2019t. That night, for the first time since we had been reunited, Sidonie and I waged love like war. I took her on the couch. I carried her to the bedchamber and I took her there. I left marks on her skin. She left marks on mine. And in the small hours of the night, when the full moon rose outside our balcony, I watched her sleep, peaceful as a babe, her bare skin silvered by the slanting moonlight.</p><p>\u201cSun Princess.\u201d I traced the line of her spine, from the nape of her neck to the cleft of her buttocks. My throat felt tight. \u201cI don\u2019t have the words. I wish I did. I just don\u2019t ever want to be without you.\u201d</p> <p>Sidonie murmured in her sleep. I lay down beside her, fitting the curve of my body around hers, drawing up the sheet to cover us both. My arm settled around her waist. Still sleeping, she hugged it to her.</p><p>Why do we fit so well together?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to find words,\u201d I whispered, and slept.</p><p>On the morrow, I went to meet with the priest at the Temple of Elua. A smiling young acolyte met me in the vestibule, kneeling to draw off my boots.</p><p>\u201cBrother Thomas will meet you in the inner sanctum,\u201d he said.</p><p>It is an old place, one of the oldest in the City, quiet and peaceful; a roofless sanctuary with pillars marking the four corners and ancient oaks flanking the effigy of Blessed Elua. The trees were old, too. The only living thing in the City more ancient was the oak tree in Elua\u2019s Square in the exact center of the City, said to have been planted by Elua himself. I walked barefoot over lush grass to approach the effigy, kneeling to press my lips to the cool marble of his foot.</p><p>\u201cImriel de la Courcel,\u201d a voice said behind me.</p><p>I rose and turned. \u201cBrother Thomas Jubert?\u201d</p><p>The priest inclined his head. He was a big man and younger than I\u2019d expected, not yet sixty, with black hair and pale grey eyes that reminded me of Berlik, the magician of the Maghuin Dhonn who had killed Dorelei. The thought made me uneasy, which his words did nothing to allay.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Brother Thomas beckoned. \u201cI would speak with you, as would others.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cOthers?\u201d</p><p>He folded his hands in the blue sleeves of his robe. \u201cElua\u2019s priesthood does not speak for all his Companions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I followed him into the temple, down a corridor. Somewhere, a woman\u2019s voice was raised in song, merry and incongruous. Brother Thomas led me into a pleasant atrium garden, set about with chairs and couches.</p><p>Representatives of all the orders of Elua\u2019s Companions were there\u2014or at least all save one. Naamah\u2019s priest clad in scarlet, Azza\u2019s in a saffron tunic with a crimson chlamys. A Priest of Kushiel clad in black robes, wearing the bronze mask of office. A Priestess of Eisheth in sea-blue, and Shemhazai\u2019s in a scholar\u2019s dark grey robes. A Priestess of Anael in brown, tied at the waist with a rope belt. A Priest of Camael in a forest-green surplice, his sword hanging at his side.</p><p>\u201cNo Cassiline Brother?\u201d I asked Brother Thomas.</p><p>He smiled faintly. \u201cWe do not believe the Cassiline Brotherhood speaks for Cassiel. I believe you have some familiarity with that notion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Joscelin had been a Cassiline Brother, a warrior-priest of the order. He had broken his oaths of loyalty, obedience, and chastity for Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s sake. He believed in the end that his path was in accordance with Cassiel\u2019s wishes. I believed it, too.</p><p>\u201cPlease be seated.\u201d Brother Thomas gestured. His expression was grave again. \u201cUnderstand, Imriel de la Courcel, that we have little liking for this process. We are servants of Blessed Elua and his Companions. We concern ourselves with matters of the soul, the heart, the flesh. Of love, desire, and divinity, growth and healing, penance and redemption, wisdom and mortal striving. Not politics.\u201d</p><p>I took a seat. \u201cAnd yet you summoned me here, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYour dilemma is a political one, but it touches on matters of the spirit.\u201d</p><p>No one else spoke, all of them watching silently. I felt unpleasantly as though I were on trial. \u201cWhat would you have me say, my lords and ladies?\u201d I asked, spreading my hands. \u201cOr what is it you wish to say to me?\u201d</p><p>They exchanged silent glances.</p><p>\u201cI wish to say this,\u201d Brother Thomas said quietly. \u201cWe will listen to the words you say here today. Once we have come to consensus, I will advise the Queen accordingly on this as a matter of spirit. I will give no advice in the matter of politics.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNor would I expect you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is well, then.\u201d Brother Thomas inclined his head. \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t expected this. I had expected . . . what? A more intimate conversation, a priest\u2019s gentle questioning leading me to divulge the secret truths of my heart. I wondered if Sidonie had known, and suspected that she had. I wished she\u2019d given me warning, though I supposed that would have somehow tainted the procedure. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was more annoyed or impressed with her integrity.</p><p>\u201cI love her,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cSidonie. And I could give you a hundred reasons why, a hundred things about her that surprise and delight me, but the truth is that, in the end, I don\u2019t know why.\u201d I paused, but no one spoke. \u201cMy lords, I know no one who has done more in the service of love than Joscelin Verreuil. When I first came to love Sidonie, I didn\u2019t trust my feelings, not wholly. We were young and fearful and uncertain, and we both knew full well the risks involved in our liaison. I asked Joscelin how it was that he knew for a surety that he loved Ph\u00e8dre. He said that he had tried doing without her.\u201d I smiled a little to myself, remembering. \u201cHe\u2019s not a man of surpassing eloquence, but he speaks to the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took this as advice?\u201d the priest inquired.</p><p>\u201cI did. And in defiance of Blessed Elua\u2019s precept, I chose duty over love. I fulfilled my obligation to the Crown and wed the Cruarch\u2019s niece. You know well what followed.\u201d I swallowed hard at the memory and made myself continue. \u201cIf I could unmake that choice, I would. And yet I cherish what small good can be gleaned from the horror. To do otherwise dishonors the dead. I learned a great deal about the true nature of love from Dorelei mab Breidaia. I learned a great deal about myself and what it means to be a man. And I learned that for good or ill, I do love Sidonie de la Courcel with an abiding passion that time, distance, or dire magic cannot alter.\u201d</p><p>They were silent.</p><p>My heartbeat quickened. \u201cMy lords, for two years, since first we knew we loved one another, Sidonie and I have been parted. It\u2019s led to naught but misery for far too many. I cannot unmake my choice or undo the tragedies that ensued, but I can seek to trust Elua\u2019s wisdom as I should have done before.\u201d I turned out my hands, pleading. \u201cIs it too much to believe that the gods wish us to be happy?\u201d</p><p>Another glance was exchanged.</p><p>\u201cDo you claim that your happiness is worth throwing Terre d\u2019Ange into chaos?\u201d Brother Thomas asked in a dry tone.</p><p>\u201cDo you claim we are the ones responsible for sowing chaos when we are but following Elua\u2019s precept?\u201d I asked sharply. \u201cLove as thou wilt. If the Queen forbids our union, she is violating the one tenet we are all of us taught to hold dear, and guilty of heresy. That\u2019s the crux of the matter, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the reason we are listening,\u201d the priest replied. \u201cBut you have not answered my question.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head and regarded the sky. It was a clear summer day, sunny and bright. A flock of swallows veered across the blue expanse overhead, graceful and free. \u201cMy happiness,\u201d I murmured. There was a taste of bile in the back of my throat. \u201cNo, my lord. When you phrase it thusly, how can I say yes? And yet . . .\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019ve had so very little of it.\u201d</p><p>The assembled group stirred. \u201cOf happiness?\u201d Brother Thomas asked gently.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My voice broke on the word. I gazed at his face, feeling uncommonly weary. \u201cMy lord, let us be honest with one another. In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter what I say to you here today, what advice you give the Queen. All it can grant is a small respite, a measure of time. I know this. The wounds my mother caused cut too deep, and there are no words that will sway the wounded heart of Terre d\u2019Ange, only deeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeeds,\u201d he echoed, his expression sharpening. \u201cYou speak of deeds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. One deed in particular.\u201d I took a deep, shaking breath. \u201cThere is a burden ahead of me I have to shoulder if I am to prove myself to the Queen and the realm. And I will. I\u2019ll try. But Blessed Elua, I\u2019m tired!\u201d I laughed humorlessly, raking my hands through my hair. \u201cIn a scant twenty-one years, I\u2019ve lived enough for three lifetimes. Is it so much to ask for a small respite?\u201d</p><p>Brother Thomas studied me. \u201cYou know the burden you face? This deed you have not named?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d I said wearily. \u201cOf course I know. Somewhere in my heart, I suppose I\u2019ve always known.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Priest of Kushiel rose. \u201cWhat I have heard suffices,\u201d he said, his voice muffled by the mask. He bowed in my direction, sunlight glinting off the bronze planes. \u201cHe speaks the truth of his heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI concur.\u201d Naamah\u2019s priest and the Priestess of Eisheth spoke simultaneously, rising and exchanging laughing glances. \u201cIt may be there is healing in it,\u201d Eisheth\u2019s priestess added.</p><p>The Priest of Naamah smiled at me. \u201cOf a surety, there is desire.\u201d</p><p>Shemhazai\u2019s priest leveled a shrewd, thoughtful gaze at me, then stood. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot fathom the wisdom of it, not yet. But I do not deny the knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see no harm here,\u201d Anael\u2019s priestess said simply, rising.</p><p>Azza\u2019s priest stood, tossing his chlamys over his shoulder. \u201cIf it is pride that speaks, it is earned,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more can I say.\u201d</p><p>The last to rise was the Priest of Camael. He was the oldest among them, with a warrior\u2019s posture that belied his lined face and age-silvered hair. \u201cI like this least among you,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cFor there is too much in it that threatens the strength of Terre d\u2019Ange. But I will not say he does not speak true, and that is all you have asked of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d Brother Thomas said.</p><p>One by one, they inclined their heads to him and departed. I got to my feet and watched them go, my heart feeling at once heavy and light. I had spoken the truth, but it was a cruel, harsh truth, and not one I welcomed. Love came at a price. If Terre d\u2019Ange was not to bear the cost of it, I would have to do it. The deed that had been left unspoken. \u201cIs that all, then?\u201d I asked the priest. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is enough,\u201d he said somberly. \u201cAnd what happens now depends entirely on the will of her majesty Queen Ysandre.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>We found out soon enough what Ysandre willed.</p><p>Brother Thomas served us better than I would have reckoned. He paid a visit to the Palace with a dozen members of the temple in tow, serene priests and priestesses in their blue robes and bare feet. The Queen granted them a private audience. What was said in her chambers, no one knew for sure, but all had seen them arrive.</p><p>Speculation swirled, and a day after the meeting, Ysandre announced that there would be a public audience in the throne hall at three hours past noon on the morrow.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll heed their advice?\u201d I asked Sidonie.</p> <p>\u201cElua, I hope so,\u201d she said fervently.</p><p>\u201cAnd if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d I watched her expression change. \u201cI know it\u2019s your choice, Sidonie. But I have a voice in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a very pleasant voice.\u201d She kissed me. \u201cNot in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I said.</p><p>The audience was enormous. The throne hall was a vast space, big enough to swallow up the two hundred chairs placed toward the front of the room for peers of the realm. There were at least three hundred peers in attendance, and many hundreds more ordinary citizens, jostling for standing room.</p><p>It was easy to see the realm was divided. Sidonie and I were seated in the first realm of peers to the right of the Queen, as was befitting our status. Those who chose to sit or stand on the right side were allies and supporters. House Montr\u00e8ve, of course. House Shahrizai. Sidonie\u2019s personal guard. My old friends Julien Trente and his sister, Colette, now wed to Raul L\u2019Envers y Aragon, who was also there. And too, although he wouldn\u2019t meet the Queen\u2019s eyes, their father, Lord Amaury Trente. Gerard de Mereliot, representing the Lady of Marsilikos. Marquis Tibault de Toluard, the avid inventor, who maintained a friendship with Joscelin. A number of young peers I didn\u2019t know by name.</p><p>There were Tsingani and Yeshuites among the throng, too; and adepts of the Night Court, hundreds of them, glittering and lovely. It tugged at my heart for reasons I couldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>But there were others, too. The left side of the throne hall was nearly as crowded, and there were victims of the Skaldi War among them, sporting grim expressions and black armbands. And, of course, the contingent wouldn\u2019t be complete without Duc Barquiel L\u2019Envers, who had long detested me for inexplicable reasons of his own.</p> <p>At the precise hour, a horologist struck a gong. An impressive silence fell over the hall, broken only by the faint creak of hinges as the great doors at the rear of the hall were closed. A pair of guards opened the doors to the inner throne chamber and Ysandre emerged.</p><p>The Queen mounted the dais and stood before the audience, tall and fair, her carriage erect and regal. Sidonie lacked her mother\u2019s height, but she had the same carriage. I wondered if Ysandre had the same capability as her daughter for utterly abandoning it in private. Somehow, I didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cAll rise for her majesty Queen Ysandre de la Courcel!\u201d the herald called.</p><p>Those who were seated rose, bowing or curtsying. The packed throngs toward the rear followed suit. Ysandre inclined her head.</p><p>\u201cAll be seated for her majesty Queen Ysandre de la Courcel!\u201d</p><p>We sat.</p><p>Ysandre took the throne. She looked tired, shadows under the violet eyes that were nothing like her eldest daughter\u2019s. A gold crown with delicate spires sat atop her fair hair. For all that it was finely wrought, it carried a visible weight. I felt an unwanted pang of guilt and sympathy. I couldn\u2019t even imagine what Sidonie must feel.</p><p>\u201cMy lords and ladies, good folk of the realm.\u201d The Queen\u2019s clear voice carried in the stillness. \u201cEven in the annals of Terre d\u2019Ange, I imagine this is an unwarranted occurrence,\u201d she continued more softly. There was an edge of sadness in it. \u201cI daresay it is known why I have called this audience.\u201d</p><p>There were nods and murmurs all around.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Ysandre gathered herself. \u201cSidonie de la Courcel, my eldest child and heir, the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange, desires to be united in love with her kinsman, Imriel n\u00f3 Montr\u00e8ve de la Courcel. Is this still your claim?\u201d she asked Sidonie.</p><p>Sidonie rose, according her mother a second curtsy. \u201cIt is, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is it also your stated desire?\u201d Ysandre asked me.</p><p>I stood and bowed. \u201cIt is, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre nodded. \u201cI am advised by the priesthood of Blessed Elua that your claim is worthy,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cAnd here before those assembled, I swear in Blessed Elua\u2019s name that I will not forbid your union.\u201d</p><p>There were gasps, hisses, and a few quickly stifled cheers.</p><p>Ysandre raised her hand. \u201cHowever.\u201d Her voice hardened. \u201cI am advised by many others that this union is a dagger that cuts at the heart of Terre d\u2019Ange. Let me say this.\u201d She looked squarely at me. \u201cImriel de la Courcel has served the thrones of both Terre d\u2019Ange and Alba with honor. I do not accuse him of sedition. But when I look upon the faces of those here assembled . . .\u201d Her gaze drifted over the crowd. \u201cI see a thousand anguished memories of lives lost on the fields of Troyes-le-Monte, memories you children cannot begin to compass. I see fear and suspicion, a canker eating at the heart of the realm. I see old hatreds roused, old wounds bleeding, and the seeds of discord being sown.\u201d</p><p>There was a genuine ache behind her words, and I did not think she took any pleasure in the fierce nods of agreement from those assembled on the left of the hall. I\u2019d had my differences with Ysandre, but I\u2019d never doubted she loved Terre d\u2019Ange.</p><p>\u201cBlessed Elua cared naught for crowns and thrones,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThose words, I am told, were spoken by Melisande Shahrizai.\u201d</p><p>The mention of my mother\u2019s name evoked another hiss.</p><p>Ysandre raised her hand for silence a second time. \u201cIt is true,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also true that Blessed Elua cared naught for the trappings of mortal society, the conventions and rules by which we bind ourselves.\u201d She closed her eyes briefly. \u201cLove as thou wilt. It suffices unto itself.\u201d Opening her eyes, she gazed at Sidonie. \u201cThat I grant you, my love,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLove as you will. But if you declare him your consort, know that I will not acknowledge it. There will be no legal binding. And if you wed him . . .\u201d The Queen\u2019s jaw tightened as she forced the words out, sorrow in every syllable. \u201cIf you wed him, I will disinherit you.\u201d</p><p>In silent acquiescence, Sidonie inclined her head.</p><p>\u201cThis I swear in Blessed Elua\u2019s name before all here assembled.\u201d Ysandre\u2019s voice sharpened. \u201cDo you hear and acknowledge it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, your majesty.\u201d Sidonie lifted her chin and gazed at her mother. \u201cIs there aught that might make you recant this vow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed you ask?\u201d Ysandre said wryly.</p><p>Sidonie held her gaze without blinking. \u201cI would hear you say it before all here assembled.\u201d</p><p>The hall was deathly silent. I felt Ysandre\u2019s gaze shift, felt the weight of it fall upon me. Felt the unwanted burden settling on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said gently. \u201cOf course. Twenty-some years ago, on the blood-soaked battlefields of Troyes-le-Monte, Melisande Shahrizai was convicted of treason and sentenced to execution for conspiring with the Skaldi warlord Waldemar Selig to conquer Terre d\u2019Ange. That death, she evaded.\u201d Her throat worked. \u201cImriel de la Courcel, do you find your mother and bring her to justice, I will recant this vow and grant every blessing to your union.\u201d</p><p>There it was, then.</p><p>The burden.</p><p>I bowed deeply for a third time, holding it. The silence in the hall persisted. I straightened and met the Queen\u2019s eyes. \u201cI hear and acknowledge your words, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre inclined her head. \u201cThat is all.\u201d</p><p>The Queen made her exit through the throne chamber, but it took a long time for the crowd to disperse, mingling excitedly to discuss the news. Sidonie\u2019s guardsmen hovered close, mindful of the hostile element, and Joscelin took care to position himself at my side while we waited for the throng to thin. But there were no threats, only a long, bland stare from Barquiel L\u2019Envers that didn\u2019t disguise the seething dislike beneath it.</p><p>\u201cWhat in Elua\u2019s name is the matter with him?\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cA lifetime of plans gone awry.\u201d Sidonie watched him. \u201cYou missed the last one. He\u2019d hoped to convince Mother that I should wed his youngest son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She nodded. \u201cTo forge a great alliance with Khebbel-im-Akkad. Truth be told, I don\u2019t think the Lugal would consider sending one of his heirs to Terre d\u2019Ange for aught less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your mother say?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Sidonie smiled faintly. \u201cShe told him he forged a great alliance with Khebbel-im-Akkad when he wed his only daughter to the Khalif\u2019s son, and if he thought the realm would stand for her half-Cruithne heir wedding a half-Akkadian prince, he\u2019d lost his wits.\u201d She gave me a wry glance. \u201cAt least no one questions the purity of your bloodline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerations of incest,\u201d Mavros said cheerfully, approaching us with our cousin Roshana beside him. \u201cAt least on House Shahrizai\u2019s side. Nice to see you\u2019re carrying on the tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re pleased,\u201d I said.</p><p>In truth, Sidonie and I weren\u2019t all that closely related. My father had been her great-granduncle, brother of King Ganelon de la Courcel. It made us first cousins, I supposed, but there were two generations between us.</p><p>Of course, it was also true that my father had gotten me late in life, embittered by a lifetime of intrigue in La Serenissima, obsessed with the idea of putting a pure-blooded D\u2019Angeline on the throne, and seduced by my mother\u2019s wiles. When I was a babe, he and my mother had been part of a plot to assassinate Ysandre. It very nearly worked, too; it would have, had it not been for Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin.</p><p>Strange to think, if it had worked, I would likely have inherited the throne by now. I would be the King of Terre d\u2019Ange, and Sidonie would never have been born. The thought made me shiver.</p><p>Small wonder half the realm mistrusted me.</p><p>Sidonie touched my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere quieter.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI think that would be wise.\u201d</p><p>The crowds had thinned enough for us to make our way out of the throne hall, escorted by guards and accompanied by a small entourage. We adjourned to one of the smaller salons in the Palace, used for private f\u00eates. Sidonie looked pale. I would rather have spent this moment alone with her, and I daresay she felt the same, but those who had supported us publicly risked the Queen\u2019s displeasure. It would have been ungracious to dismiss them as mere props. I sent one of the Palace understewards to fetch wine and refreshments.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . are we celebrating?\u201d Julien Trente asked uncertainly after the wine had been poured.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re not lamenting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Mavros perched on the arm of a couch, swinging one leg. \u201cDo you pack your trunks and head off to La Serenissima to follow your vanished mother\u2019s seven-year-old trail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice was fierce. She drank half the contents of her winecup, her color returning. \u201cNot now. Not yet. Not after two years of fear and uncertainty, wondering if Imriel was alive or dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d Roshana asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cMy thought is this.\u201d I glanced at Ph\u00e8dre. \u201cI mean to write to the Master of the Straits and beseech his aid. He can search for her in his sea-mirror. If she is anywhere on D\u2019Angeline or Alban soil, he will find her.\u201d</p><p>Mavros blinked in surprise. \u201cYou think he\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre answered his question, and well she might. The Master of the Straits, the waters that divided Alba and Terre d\u2019Ange, could cause the waves to rise and lightning to strike at his command. He had also once been a Tsingano lad named Hyacinthe and her dearest friend. Like me, he owed her a debt he could never repay. \u201cI am quite sure of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you think she is?\u201d Roshana asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d I smiled wistfully. \u201cAlba, I doubt, but mayhap Terre d\u2019Ange. Of a surety, it would make matters a great deal easier. And if she\u2019s not, at least I\u2019ll know where not to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time,\u201d Sidonie murmured. \u201cGods, I hate this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo do we all, your highness,\u201d Mavros said with a rare note of genuine sympathy in his tone. \u201cBelieve me, House Shahrizai does not relish its role in your plight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they support me in this?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou know it means my mother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said without hesitating, and Roshana nodded in agreement. \u201cThere may be a few who are uncomfortable with it. It goes against the grain, turning on family. But what she did is unconscionable. Her sentence was just. No one likes it, but no one denies it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur kinsman Marmion Shahrizai did turn on her years ago,\u201d Roshana reminded him. \u201cAnd Duc Faragon sent him into exile for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuc Faragon sent Marmion into exile because he caused the death of his sister Persia,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said thoughtfully. \u201cNot for trying to bring Melisande to justice.\u201d She was silent a moment. She had known my mother very, very well. I tried not to think about that. \u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to contact Marmion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeeking vengeance?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre shook her head. \u201cNo. He was always terrified she would, of course. But Melisande\u2019s too cool-headed for vengeance. That\u2019s part of what made her so damnably deadly. If anything, she\u2019d use his guilt and regret to turn him back into an ally.\u201d She glanced at Raul L\u2019Envers y Aragon. \u201cIs Marmion still in Aragonia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Raul nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s among the King\u2019s favorite drinking companions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap your mother will make some discreet inquiries.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre smiled. \u201cLady Nicola had a certain fondness for him once upon a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is a woman of varied tastes,\u201d Raul said diplomatically. \u201cI will ask. I am told that matters are uneasy in Aragonia these days and tongues are wagging in all directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUneasy?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cCarthage,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cThe Council of Thirty has elected a new general, young and ambitious. There are rumors that he means to move against Aragonia and reclaim it for Carthage.\u201d He smiled sardonically. \u201cAll the Carthaginian ambassadors deny it, of course, and I am told the King accepts their gifts and believes their smooth lies. But my brother, Serafin, is worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerre d\u2019Ange stands with Aragonia,\u201d Sidonie assured him. \u201cWe have not forgotten that when Skaldia invaded, Aragonia came to our aid.\u201d</p><p>Raul gave her a brief bow. \u201cAragonia knows no better ally than Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cLet\u2019s not discuss Carthage further today.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an apologetic look. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>It was unreasonable to hold an entire nation to blame for the actions of two men; nor did I. Still, I could not forget that the men who had abducted me and sold me into slavery were Carthaginian. It is not the sort of thing one ever forgets.</p><p>We spoke for a while longer, speculating and planning. Although I\u2019d rather have been elsewhere, alone with Sidonie, there was a comfort in knowing we had friends and allies. And, too, what was said here today would be carried forth as rumor and gossip. Terre d\u2019Ange would know that I was not sitting idle, that foreign dignitaries and the Master of the Straits himself were assisting me.</p><p>I hoped Hyacinthe\u2019s search would be lengthy.</p> <p>I hoped against hope that he might find her.</p><p>In my heart, I didn\u2019t believe he would. But it would buy us time to enjoy this brief respite, Sidonie and I, before the suspicion grew that I was merely biding my time, going through the motions of looking into the mystery with no intention of actually searching for Melisande, let alone bringing her to justice.</p><p>When it came to that point . . . ah, Elua.</p><p>I knew what had to be done. It was the one secret I\u2019d kept from Sidonie. Not a-purpose, not really. It was the sort of secret that got people killed. Before I wouldn\u2019t have dared risk it. We were too young and uncertain. Now it was different. She\u2019d stood up to her mother and defied half the realm for my sake. There could be nothing less than complete honesty between us, dangerous or no. I owed her nothing less.</p><p>I would have to tell her about the Unseen Guild.</p><p>Four</p><p>I told her that night.</p><p>I could have waited. Elua knows, I wanted to. We\u2019d won a victory of sorts that day, albeit a bitter one. By the time we retired to her chambers, Sidonie was tired and drained. I wanted nothing more than to hold her in my arms and safeguard her sleep.</p><p>Instead, I laid a burden on her.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I said softly when we were alone together. \u201cThere\u2019s somewhat I never told you about my time in Tiberium.\u201d</p><p>She paused in the act of brushing her hair. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>I sat cross-legged on her bed, turning the knotted gold ring on my finger. The ring had been her gift, a symbol of the ties that bound us, and of other ties, too. On the night of her seventeenth birthday, I\u2019d lashed her wrists to the bedposts with a golden cord and tormented her with pleasure until she begged me to take her. I suspected there would be no such love-play tonight. \u201cYou know the tale of Anafiel Delaunay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Anafiel Delaunay, born Anafiel de Montr\u00e8ve, had been her grandfather\u2019s lover and a poet of some renown. Long before any of us were born, they had studied together in Tiberium. There had been a falling out between them when Prince Rolande\u2019s betrothed was killed and Delaunay wrote a satire implicating Rolande\u2019s new bride in the death, none of which particularly mattered anymore. What mattered was that Delaunay had sworn an oath to protect Rolande\u2019s daughter, the infant Ysandre. And he had kept it, long after Rolande\u2019s death in battle.</p><p>The Whoremaster of Spies, his detractors called him. Anafiel Delaunay had adopted two children into his household, training them in the arts of covertcy, and later, courtesanship. He was long dead, and so was one of them; two more casualties of my mother\u2019s plotting.</p><p>The other was Ph\u00e8dre, who had kept all his promises and more.</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cWho taught Anafiel Delaunay the arts of covertcy?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie stared at me. \u201cI never thought to wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cI did. And I found out.\u201d</p><p>I told her then. The truth, the whole truth, of what had befallen me in Tiberium. How I\u2019d made inquiries. How I\u2019d been seduced by Claudia Fulvia, the wife of a Tiberian senator, seeking to recruit me for a secret organization she called the Unseen Guild. A consortium of spies, reporting to persons in places of power all across the world, capable of influencing great events. They had attempted to recruit Anafiel Delaunay when he was a young man in Tiberium, training him in the arts of covertcy.</p><p>In the end, he had refused them.</p><p>So had I.</p><p>\u201cIt was a choice,\u201d I said hoarsely. \u201cSwear allegiance, or refuse and keep their secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you chose the latter?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cBut there\u2019s more. I told you about Canis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who took a spear for you in Lucca.\u201d Her eyes were dark and unreadable. \u201cThe one who said, \u2018Your mother sends her love\u2019 before he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I told her the whole truth of that tale, too. How Canis, who had seemed only an odd philosopher-beggar, had given me a clay medallion with the image of a lamp on it. How I\u2019d learned in the Temple of Asclepius that there were words etched around the edge in a code invented by a blind healer. Do no harm. And how, when at last I\u2019d confronted Claudia Fulvia about it, she had admitted that it meant a member of the Unseen Guild had placed me under their protection.</p><p>\u201cYour mother,\u201d Sidonie said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Sidonie rose without comment. She went to the balcony doors, gazing out into the summer night, her arms wrapped around herself. She was wearing a dressing-robe of thin, cream-colored silk, so fine I could see the silhouette of her body through it. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t want to discuss the issue of finding my vanished mother until we had no choice,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd because you could get killed for knowing it.\u201d</p><p>She turned. \u201cI\u2019m the heir to Terre d\u2019Ange with a hand-picked personal guard, not some fainting flower to be coddled from the world\u2019s dangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Guild employs assassins,\u201d I said. \u201cIf Canis had been one, he could have killed me in my sleep a half a dozen times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, you\u2019re not particularly careful of your safety.\u201d Sidonie studied me. \u201cIt\u2019s a fanciful tale. Do you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the medallion I wore on the Longest Night?\u201d I asked. She nodded. \u201cIt was a replica of the one Canis gave me. I wanted to see if anyone at Court recognized it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cBut the Ephesian ambassador who was visiting did. Diokles Agallon. He offered an exchange of favors. He said if I told him where and how I got it, he might be able to tell me where it originated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want in return?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>I smiled slightly. \u201cFor me to push the Sultan\u2019s suit for your hand.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile. \u201cI take it you declined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie . . .\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cAt that moment, I realized I didn\u2019t want anything to do with it. All I wanted was you. All I could think about was you. And at the time, no, I hadn\u2019t thought so far ahead as to reckon that one day, the price of it would be bringing my mother to justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes my mother know about this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cPh\u00e8dre didn\u2019t reckon it worth the risk. Not with so little knowledge. She\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve told, and she\u2019s said naught to anyone but Joscelin, and mayhap Hyacinthe. I left the choice to her. She\u2019s been trying to learn more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t not tell her, Imriel,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of state. I can\u2019t withhold that from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might feel that way,\u201d I said. \u201cSidonie, listen. I don\u2019t know the extent of the Guild\u2019s power and influence, but I do know they\u2019re real. Enough to be dangerous. Do as you must. Only please, please bid your mother to tread lightly in this matter. I am truly afraid that if she shows her hand, they might act.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cImriel, why does everything in your life have to be so infernally complicated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said humbly. \u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods!\u201d Sidonie blew out an exasperated breath, casting her gaze toward the ceiling. \u201cBlessed Elua, if there is some divine purpose in this union, I hope and pray that you will reveal it to me one day.\u201d</p><p>I kept silent.</p><p>\u201cAre you harboring any other secrets?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cNot a one. Have I lost your trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s mouth quirked. She crossed the room lightly, climbed on the bed, and knelt astride my lap. \u201cNo.\u201d She took my face in her hands. \u201cMay Blessed Elua and his Companions have mercy on me, I do trust you. As I love you, I trust you.\u201d</p><p>I slid my hands up her warm, silk-covered back. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie kissed me. \u201cI do. Irrationally, maddeningly, utterly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cAlways and always.\u201d She kissed me again, her tongue darting between my lips, then sat back on her heels to regard me, a complicated mixture of sorrow and love in her dark eyes. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>On the morrow, Sidonie requested a private audience with her mother. They met for a long time, long enough that my relief was mingled with apprehension. I spent the better part of the day drafting my appeal to the Master of the Straits, trying not to worry.</p><p>In the afternoon, one of her guards came to fetch me\u2014Alfonse, the one who\u2019d come before. I hoped he brought word from Sidonie, but I was wrong. \u201cCaptain de Monluc wonders if you\u2019d pay him the courtesy of a visit, Prince Imriel,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cIs aught amiss?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked surprised. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so, your highness. Should there be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cAnd please, call me Imriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Alfonse tasted the word, then grinned. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never been comfortable standing on ceremony. I wasn\u2019t raised to be a Prince of the Blood. I\u2019d obey the protocols when I had to, but I preferred to dispense with them whenever possible.</p><p>Alfonse led me to the wing of the Palace that housed the barracks of the Dauphine\u2019s Guard, which in truth were generous and comfortable. Most members of the Palace Guard came from the ranks of the lesser nobility\u2014younger scions unlikely to inherit lands of their own, hoping to make names for themselves in the service of the throne and earn a reward, or mayhap make a wealthy love-match.</p><p>The captain of Sidonie\u2019s guard, Claude de Monluc, was one such\u2014although he\u2019d fallen in love with a chambermaid, not an heiress. I knew that much about him and little else, except that he seemed serious and competent, and he\u2019d cared enough for the chambermaid to wed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The full complement of the Palace Guard numbered five hundred, but only fifty of them were personally attached to Sidonie\u2019s service. That day, it seemed half of them were lounging in the common room of the barracks, tending to their equipment, playing games of chance, drinking and flirting with servants and sundry guests. There was a pause when I entered, the captain\u2019s men watching curiously.</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel.\u201d Claude de Monluc was seated on a hassock, running a whetstone down the edge of his sword. He rose, sheathed his blade, and gave me an exacting bow. \u201cThank you for coming, your highness.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, my lord captain. Is there some danger I should be aware of? Your men seem sufficiently at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d De Monluc hesitated, frowning. He was a tall fellow with blond hair and cool blue eyes, an expression that sought to keep its own counsel. \u201cI thought we should talk, you and I. Will you join me in a tankard of ale?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>We retired to a quiet corner with a pair of chairs drawn up to an unlit brazier. A barracks attendant brought over a pair of foaming tankards. I hadn\u2019t seen them poured. I gazed at the ale, then at de Monluc\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDo you fear poison?\u201d he asked in a dry tone.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said thoughtfully. \u201cNo, you\u2019re a man with a sense of honor, albeit a rigid one.\u201d I took a healthy drink. \u201cAnd anyway, \u2019tis you who mistrusts me.\u201d</p><p>He gave a short laugh. \u201cI cede the point, your highness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in playing games,\u201d I said mildly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d sooner have you call me Imriel.\u201d</p><p>De Monluc\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cYou\u2019re blunt. Will you give me an honest answer to a blunt query?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d I said. \u201cIt depends on the query.\u201d I watched suspicion creep into his expression and rolled my eyes. \u201cElua\u2019s Balls, man! I\u2019ll not lie, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in his cheek twitched. \u201cDo you seek my post?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour post?\u201d Whatever I\u2019d expected, it wasn\u2019t this. I stared blankly at him. \u201cThe captaincy of the Dauphine\u2019s Guard? Why in the world would I want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the last man to share her highness\u2019 bed did,\u201d de Monluc observed. \u201cBut I reckon you might have reasons of your own.\u201d He studied me with his cool, blue gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ve enemies at Court. Taking command of the Dauphine\u2019s Guard and creating your own personal army would be a shrewd step. It would afford you a measure of protection.\u201d</p> <p>I returned his gaze. He looked away, taking a sip of ale. It didn\u2019t matter. I could see the aching lines of pain and sorrow beneath the distrust. \u201cYou\u2019re one of them,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t wear the black armband, but you are, aren\u2019t you? You lost family at the battle of Troyes-le-Mont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t . . .\u201d De Monluc paused. \u201cMy father. I was ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>He was silent a moment. I waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of them,\u201d he said at length. \u201cNot one to reckon a man should be judged by the deeds of his forebears. I talked to men who served under you in Alba, Urist and some of his fellows. They thought well of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought well of them,\u201d I said.</p><p>Claude de Monluc glanced at me. \u201cSo do you want it or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you good at your job?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>He straightened, stung. \u201cI am. I earned this post, my lord, and I am loyal to her highness. These men . . .\u201d He gestured. \u201cThey\u2019re off duty, your highness. We completed drills this morning. There is no license here, if that\u2019s your thought. We know our duty. Any one of us would lay down our lives to protect the Dauphine.\u201d</p><p>There were shouts of agreement from a few guardsmen within earshot who forgot to pretend they weren\u2019t eavesdropping.</p><p>\u201cIs he good at his job?\u201d I asked them.</p><p>\u201cToo good, my lord,\u201d one called amid rumbles of laughter and agreement.</p><p>\u201cA strict taskmaster?\u201d I asked. \u201cWilling to share every hardship? Given to painstaking measures of precaution when it comes to the Dauphine\u2019s safety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the seven hells, is he ever!\u201d Alfonse said fervently.</p><p>I raised my brows at Claude de Monluc. \u201cWell, then. I have no interest in your post, Captain.\u201d</p><p>He flushed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d I said. \u201cAfter Maslin de Lombelon\u2019s ambitions, and with the gossip surrounding me, I don\u2019t blame you for wondering . . .\u201d A thought struck me. \u201cDo you and your men drill on horseback?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d De Monluc looked startled. \u201cNo, only on foot. We\u2019re guards, not cavalry.\u201d</p><p>It was Maslin\u2019s name had made me think of it. We had a long history. He had been the second in command of the Dauphine\u2019s Guard, and, briefly, Sidonie\u2019s lover. After they had quarrelled, he\u2019d set out to find me in Vralia, determined to prove to her that he loved her more than I did. Instead, he\u2019d found out a great deal about himself, including the fact that his feelings for Sidonie were a dubious mixture of yearning, ambition, and idealized romanticism.</p><p>And that I, on the other hand, truly did love her.</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d I said. \u201cThe men who attacked me in Vralia were mounted. Maslin thought he could handle them, but good as he is with a sword, he doesn\u2019t fight well in the saddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet he saved your life, did he not?\u201d de Monluc asked in confusion. \u201cOr so I heard.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t said any more than that publicly, reckoning it was true enough in its own way. \u201cHe did,\u201d I said, lowering my voice. \u201cOf a surety, I would likely have died if he\u2019d not been there. But let us say I had more of a hand in my own salvation than Maslin would have liked.\u201d I laughed at the memory. \u201cHe told me that he was hoping I\u2019d have to spend the rest of my life knowing I owed every breath I drew to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d De Monluc stared. \u201cAnd you think it\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIn its own way, yes. Anyway, \u2019tis a serious weakness. What if Sidonie were attacked in the middle of a hunting party or riding from some pleasure jaunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s reason to fear such a thing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cElua, I hope not!\u201d I shuddered. \u201cStill, people are capable of terrible things, my lord, and I daresay there are a few out there willing to blame Sidonie for the unspeakable sin of falling in love with Melisande Shahrizai\u2019s son. Why not take every precaution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a point,\u201d de Monluc said.</p><p>Another thought struck me. \u201cAsk Barquiel L\u2019Envers for assistance,\u201d I suggested. \u201cBlessed Elua knows I can\u2019t abide the man, but I\u2019ve always heard he fielded an excellent light cavalry.\u201d I laughed again. \u201cTell him it\u2019s because you mistrust my intentions and you want Sidonie\u2019s personal guard trained to deal with any possibility. He\u2019ll leap at the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d Claude de Monluc drained his ale. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly what I expected, Prince Imriel de la Courcel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d I said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cImriel.\u201d</p><p>I finished my ale and rose. \u201cI nearly lost my wits when my wife was slain. If anything like that were to happen to Sidonie . . .\u201d It was so awful to contemplate, I couldn\u2019t find words. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live through it twice. I\u2019d die. And that\u2019s really all you need to know about me, my lord de Monluc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaude,\u201d he said, rising and putting out his hand.</p><p>I clasped it. \u201cMy thanks. Let me know what arrangements you make. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to train with your men, so long as it\u2019s not L\u2019Envers himself doing the training. I could use some lessons on fighting in the saddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSounds like you managed well enough in Vralia.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at him. \u201cOh, I was on foot.\u201d</p><p>He stared. \u201cOn foot?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI spent half my life being taught by Joscelin Verreuil. Would you expect aught else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently I did,\u201d he said.</p><p>I left the encounter feeling better. I didn\u2019t expect to earn the loyalty and trust of Sidonie\u2019s guard, at least not easily, but I\u2019d settle for a measure of respect, and I thought mayhap I\u2019d won it today from Claude de Monluc. It wasn\u2019t his job to protect me and I didn\u2019t expect that either, but it would be good to feel confident that if there was a dagger hurtling toward my back, a guard would shout a warning.</p><p>And it least it hadn\u2019t been a summons to speak with Queen Ysandre for failing to tell her about the Unseen Guild, although it made me uneasy that Sidonie hadn\u2019t returned yet. I put the thought out of my head and sat down at her desk to complete my letter to the Master of the Straits.</p><p>I was just finishing when she returned. I glanced up, trying to decipher her expression. \u201cWas she angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie looked bemused. \u201cShe knew.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cShe knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d She sat on the couch. I dusted my letter to Hyacinthe with sand and went to join her. \u201cPh\u00e8dre told her everything before she and Joscelin departed on their mysterious errand.\u201d Sidonie glanced at me with a flicker of amusement. \u201cThe one we don\u2019t want to know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGods, no.\u201d She rolled her shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ve got burdens enough, you and I.\u201d</p><p>I shifted to rub her neck and shoulders. \u201cYou were gone a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a good discussion.\u201d Her voice was soft and low. \u201cThe first in a long time. I was angry. She should have trusted me with the knowledge.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips to the nape of her neck, inhaling her scent. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor many of the same reasons you didn\u2019t, so she said.\u201d Sidonie sighed. \u201cBecause it\u2019s dangerous. And because there\u2019s no proof and naught to be done about it without stirring the waters. Spies will be spies, she said. We have spies, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>I blew in her ear. \u201cOh, do we?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie wriggled. \u201cDo you want to talk or . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d I let go of her and reclined on the couch, folding my arms behind my head, smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cElua, you\u2019re insufferable!\u201d With an agile movement, Sidonie turned and stretched atop me, propping her elbows on my chest and resting her chin on folded hands. \u201cYes.\u201d She gazed down at me. \u201cWe have spies, although not so extensive a consortium, and none successful enough to find your cursed mother. But you recall the situation in Carthage that Raul mentioned? Mother is concerned about it. Aragonia has been a loyal ally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarthage,\u201d I echoed, shifting my hips so that my phallus, erect and aching in my breeches, pressed against the warm cleft between her gown-clad thighs. \u201cWhere an ambitious young general threatens war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not . . .\u201d Sidonie writhed against me. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no . . .\u201d I unfolded my arms and reached down to grasp her buttocks, pulling hard. She shuddered and narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cWhy in the name of all the gods do you find it so perversely arousing to discuss politics while making love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I murmured. \u201cBut you want me inside you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGods, yes!\u201d</p><p>It had been this way between us since the beginning, and neither of us could say why. The desire between us was like an oil-soaked rag, ready to ignite at a single spark. And yet it was more than that, too. We reflected one another, the bright mirror and the dark. Sidonie sat back on her heels, undoing the laces of my breeches. I pushed her skirts up around her hips, tugged her underdrawers down. She took my throbbing phallus in hand, fit me to her slick opening. I pushed.</p><p>We fit.</p><p>She sank onto me, sighing. I filled her.</p><p>\u201cSo it was a good talk,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie rocked atop me, her eyelids flickering as I dug my fingernails into her buttocks. \u201cI think . . . I think mayhap the truth of it is she was waiting to see if you would tell me on your own. About your mother and the Unseen Guild.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my hips upward. \u201cAnd I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d she agreed. \u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who didn\u2019t want to face the cost of winning your mother\u2019s blessing until we had to,\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Her pace quickened. \u201cI need to not talk for a moment.\u201d</p><p>A moment; many moments. I watched her face transformed with pleasure, alight and incandescent. It never failed to shock and thrill me, how utterly and thoroughly my cool, collected cousin was willing to surrender to complete abandonment. We hadn\u2019t even begun to test the limits of it. I watched her ride me to climax, again and again, waiting a long time to join her.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Sidonie collapsed on my chest. \u201cAlso a good talk.\u201d</p><p>I ran a few strands of her hair through my fingers, watching her blurred, black gaze sharpen, coming back from wherever pleasure took her. \u201cDo you suppose it will always be like this between us?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved. \u201cAlways?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAlways and always.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie kissed me. \u201cGods, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>The months that followed were among the best of my life.</p><p>They weren\u2019t perfect; Elua knows, nothing ever is. Not in my life, anyway. But this came close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d won the respite I\u2019d prayed for. The Queen had made her pronouncement; the gauntlet had been cast. I had countered. My letter to Hyacinthe was dispatched by courier; the Master of the Straits made a prompt reply. There was a debt of honor between us, he wrote. I had played a crucial part in Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s quest to find the Name of God and free him from his curse. I had ventured into the depths of distant Vralia to avenge his wife\u2019s niece. Of course he would search for Melisande in his sea-mirror.</p><p>Word was leaked. The adepts of the Night Court were more than happy to comply. Gossip whispered in the bedchambers of the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers made its way to the Palace Court and out into Terre d\u2019Ange. The Master of the Straits himself was aiding my quest.</p><p>For now the realm was content to watch and wait.</p> <p>And I was content to be with Sidonie.</p><p>We spent the better portion of our days apart. After their long talk, Ysandre didn\u2019t exactly relent, but she thawed considerably. Sidonie had duties, many of them tiresome. Whenever Ysandre was otherwise committed, she stood in her mother\u2019s stead, hearing suits brought by foreign dignitaries, the quarrels of members of the noble Houses, the complaints of the citizenry.</p><p>She had a good head for it. Although she was young\u2014only nineteen, a year past gaining her majority\u2014Sidonie had spent her entire life learning statecraft. She had an acute memory and the ability to recall in a heartbeat the most obscure detail of any legal or historical precedent she\u2019d ever read\u2014and she had read extensively. Supplicants thinking they stood a better chance of swaying the Queen\u2019s young, untried heir were shortly disillusioned.</p><p>For my part, I did my best to take on the mantle of responsibility I\u2019d long avoided. I was a peer of the realm, and I had estates I\u2019d neglected all my life. I was a member of Parliament, capable of influencing decisions that had bearing on the whole of Terre d\u2019Ange. I spent a great deal of time simply trying to inform myself. It seemed for every person reluctant to speak with me, there were two others eager to bend my ears in different directions.</p><p>Claude de Monluc kept his word, and much to my amused delight, Duc Barquiel L\u2019Envers dispatched the Akkadian-trained captain of his own guard to teach the Dauphine\u2019s Guard how to fight in the saddle. Since he didn\u2019t know me by sight, I was free to take part, posing as a nameless guard among guards. I spent many hours on the drilling-grounds, learning the niceties of cavalry warfare: how to shoot a short bow from the back of a horse at full gallop, how \u2019twas better to slash and cut on a forward charge than risk lodging one\u2019s blade, how to use one\u2019s mount\u2019s momentum to best advantage and avoid engagement, when to trust blindly to a rearward thrust.</p> <p>The Bastard loved it. He had the makings of a good warhorse.</p><p>And I was good at it. I daresay I had been for a while; as I\u2019d told Claude, I\u2019d spent half my life being taught by Joscelin. Still, it would always be Joscelin against whom I measured myself, and there was no contest. He was better than me. He always would be. Once I might have cared. I didn\u2019t, not anymore.</p><p>Heroism be damned. I wanted only to be sure Sidonie was safe.</p><p>Later, at Claude\u2019s request, I asked Joscelin to teach the Dauphine\u2019s Guard a few rudiments of the Cassiline discipline. Not all of it, of course. True Cassiline Brothers begin their training at the age of ten, and for ten years, they do nothing else. Claude\u2019s men were skilled swordsmen in the traditional style, and it would have made no sense for them to unlearn everything they already knew to commit to a discipline that would take ten years to master. Still, there were some useful maneuvers that they could add to their repertoire, like the overhead parries for defending against a mounted enemy while on foot.</p><p>It was . . . fun.</p><p>With the sense of an extended truce in what Sidonie called the Battle of Imriel settling over the Court, a spirit of revelry returned. Drustan mab Necthana arrived later than was his wont. Sidonie and I attended his reception together. After that, daring young nobles began to throw private f\u00eates, inviting us to attend together. Julien Trente was the first, although I happened to know it was Mavros who put him up to it, reckoning it wouldn\u2019t have been seemly for House Shahrizai to be the first to celebrate. But after Julien came Lisette de Blays, who was one of Sidonie\u2019s ladies-in-waiting, a pretty young Namarrese noblewoman with an impudent sense of humor.</p> <p>After that there were others. It became somewhat of a fashion. Sidonie and I weighed the invitations with care, seeking to accept only those that were sincere and genuine, begging off on those who merely sought to create spectacle. In public we were circumspect, even in the midst of frivolity and license.</p><p>Betimes it wasn\u2019t easy. Whatever the nature of the fire Blessed Elua had lit between us, it continued to burn unabated. It had survived time, distance, enchantment, and grief, and it survived familiarity, too. There was an invisible cord binding us together. In the midst of a crowded room, I always knew where she was. If I closed my eyes and listened hard, I could almost feel her heart beating, drawing mine as inexorably as a lodestone draws iron.</p><p>I could make it quicken with a single whispered word in her ear and watch the pulse beat faster in the hollow of her throat. And all it took was one laden glance under her lashes, and my blood ran hot with desire. Still, we never acted on it in the presence of others.</p><p>Alone, it was different.</p><p>The nights were ours.</p><p>After we talked of exploring love\u2019s sharper pleasures, I turned to Mavros for counsel. If there is one thing the Shahrizai understand, it is discretion. I trusted Mavros enough to arrange a private Showing for us featuring adepts of Valerian House and Mandrake House engaging in love\u2019s sharper pleasures. It was customary to attend the Night Court for such things, but there were other arrangements that could be made, private townhouses with pleasure-chambers.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think this is necessary?\u201d Sidonie asked me.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cFor both of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt frightens you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cStill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d I was honest. \u201cI saw too much darkness in Dar\u0161anga. Death sown in the place of life.\u201d The mere mention of the place made me swallow, tasting bile and worse. \u201cFor a long time, it made me fear my own desires. It\u2019s different with you. But I need to be sure this is somewhat you truly wish to explore, because if it\u2019s not, if we do and you discover the reality\u2019s nothing like the fantasy, and you want naught to do with it . . .\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI promise you, I\u2019ll wake screaming in the middle of the night, dreaming of the Mahrkagir. Only it\u2019s my face he\u2019ll be wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sidonie took my hand. She was one of only three people I\u2019d ever told the whole truth about what befell me there. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>I gazed at her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t frighten you at all, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cI told you, I trust you.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s what frightens me.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie raised her brows. \u201cTrust me, then.\u201d</p><p>She was right, of course. In the Night Court, there were elaborate contracts spelling out what was or was not permitted during the course of an assignation. That was part of what I wanted her to see and understand. Still, in the end, the essence of the exchange was trust, the surrender and acceptance of it. The more complete the surrender, the more wholehearted the acceptance, the more powerful the exchange.</p><p>And that, no mere Showing could teach.</p><p>We went, though.</p><p>It took place in the townhouse Mavros had rented. It was much like the Showing I had attended with him at Valerian House, only more discreet. The staging area was behind a veil of sheer, transparent silk. It was dimly lit, but the viewing area was completely dark. None of the adepts performing would be able to see who watched them. There were no attendants, only Mavros, serving as the host.</p><p>Sidonie and I fumbled our way to one of the reclining couches, trying to hush our laughter. We took our places. I slid my arms around her, resting my chin on her shoulder. I wanted to be able to feel her every reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou may begin,\u201d Mavros called.</p><p>We watched.</p><p>It was the same, but different, so different! The only other time I\u2019d attended such a Showing, I\u2019d been abominably drunk, wallowing in misery. And even then, it had been good. Now . . . Elua have mercy, it was so much more.</p><p>We watched the pair of Valerian adepts enter the staging area and kneel, abeyante, heads bowed and hands clasped before them. We watched the Mandrake adepts stride onto the stage. \u201cStrip,\u201d one ordered ruthlessly.</p><p>The Valerian adepts obeyed.</p><p>I felt Sidonie\u2019s breathing quicken, her ribcage rising and falling beneath my encircling arms. I could tell by her subtle responses whether or not what she was viewing pleased and aroused her.</p><p>Most of the time, it did.</p><p>A few times, it didn\u2019t.</p><p>I took note of everything. It was beautiful; it was all beautiful. These were Naamah\u2019s Servants, reveling in their art\u2014and it was an art. There was a calculated beauty to the arc of a Mandrake adept\u2019s arm as she swung the flogger. There was a pattern to the emerging welts, a rhythm to the gasps and pleas. Every pose struck had its own beauty, its own internal tension. Every order, every plea was part of a ritual. Still, I took note. The blindfold, yes; the gag, mayhap not. The crack of the whip, the slap of the tawse, the smack of the paddle\u2014yes. Even the keen whistle and sharp cut of the cane.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I whispered in Sidonie\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d There was a smile in her voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>One of Mandrake\u2019s adepts tossed a rose, gave an order. A Valerian adept crawled on all fours, retrieved it in his mouth. He raised his head for approval, lips bleeding from the stem\u2019s thorns. His mistress retrieved it, stroked his cheek with the rose\u2019s petals. He bowed his head, kissing the tips of her boots. I felt Sidonie\u2019s body tense.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tilted her head back. \u201cI\u2019ll kneel for you, but I won\u2019t crawl.\u201d</p><p>I stroked her hair. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>When it was over, after I gave Mavros a purse to present to the adepts as a patron-gift, all three of us shared a cordial in the salon. For the first time, he looked at Sidonie with frank curiosity. She returned his regard with perfect equanimity.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy the Showing, your highness?\u201d Mavros inquired, studiously polite.</p><p>\u201cVery much so, my lord Shahrizai,\u201d she replied, echoing his tone exactly. Mavros narrowed his eyes at her, trying to decide if she was teasing him. Sidonie laughed and finished her cordial, then got to her feet. \u201cYes, Mavros,\u201d she said in her own voice, bending down to kiss his cheek. \u201cThank you for arranging it. I\u2019m glad Imriel has a kinsman he can trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, bemused. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t act on what we\u2019d seen that night, nor for several nights. I wanted to approach this with a mind clear of other images, and a heart purged of fear. I made offerings at the temples of Blessed Elua and all his Companions. In the Temple of Kushiel, I stood for a long time, simply gazing at the effigy\u2019s face. I had come once to offer penance, making expiation for the lives I\u2019d taken in Lucca, for all my dead. I hadn\u2019t been there since.</p><p>Kushiel\u2019s marble arms were crossed on his breast, his rod and flail held in either hand. His gaze was fixed on the distance, his features stern and calm. There was a trace of sorrow in his marble eyes, hinting at a compassion beyond the mortal compass. I thought about Berlik of the Maghuin Dhonn, whom I had killed in Vralia. He had knelt beneath a barren tree, bowing his head as the snow swirled around us. After I\u2019d killed him, I\u2019d wept.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t done penance for his death. I didn\u2019t think it would be fitting. That one, I was meant to carry.</p><p>And I thought, too, about Sidonie. About her strength and determination, and the unexpected desires that accompanied them. About the wondrous gift of her trust, and what I needed to do to be worthy of it. Trusting her, trusting myself. That was the hardest part of all. The thought of engaging in violent play with her thrilled me to the very marrow of my bones, so deep it made me shudder, stirring echoes of my worst fears. It was a dark, surging desire, tinged with cruelty and laced with tenderness.</p><p>I wanted it.</p><p>Blessed Elua, I wanted it.</p><p>And I loved her.</p><p>Somehow it made all the difference in the world. There in Kushiel\u2019s temple, I gathered up all my fear, took a deep breath, and let it go.</p><p>Sidonie knew. We had dined apart that evening. The Queen was entertaining an ambassador from Euskerria, a territory that lay betwixt Aragonia and the south of Terre d\u2019Ange, and she wanted her heir present. The dinner ran late, and I was in her chambers before she returned, thoughtful and talkative.</p><p>\u201cImriel, you spent your childhood in Siovale,\u201d she said in absent-minded greeting. \u201cWhat do you know about . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she glanced around the salon. It was ablaze with candles.</p><p>\u201cThe Euskerri?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>Sidonie nodded.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d I said. \u201cIn the south, they were made scapegoats in the same way the Tsingani were, blamed for goat stealing and the like. I daresay there\u2019s as much truth to it. Do you want to talk about it now or later?\u201d</p><p>Her throat moved as she swallowed. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I put down the book I\u2019d been reading. \u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I cocked a brow at her. \u201cThe drapes are drawn, Sun Princess. There\u2019s no one here. You\u2019ve ridden me on this very couch. Are you suddenly overcome with modesty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie shook her head. Amber drops hanging from her ears shivered, catching the light. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . different.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything else, only watched her. After a long moment, Sidonie began to disrobe, unlacing the bodice of her gown. Her fingers trembled a little and her breath was beginning to quicken. The air between us felt charged. \u201cWhat . . . what do you want me to do with this?\u201d she asked, the satin folds of her gown overflowing her arms.</p><p>\u201cPut it there.\u201d I nodded at the arm of the couch.</p> <p>Sidonie obeyed. The candlelight gleamed on her bare skin as she returned to the center of the room, naked and vulnerable. I made myself breathe slowly, trying to rein in my desire.</p><p>\u201cKneel,\u201d I said. She knelt, neat and composed, her hands folded in her lap. \u201cClasp your hands behind your neck.\u201d She obeyed. The pose arched her back and thrust her breasts outward. I closed my eyes briefly. \u201cHave you chosen a signale?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it.\u201d I picked up my book. \u201cWhen I ask, you will tell me.\u201d</p><p>The silence grew and stretched between us. I glanced up a few times to find her watching me, intent and wondering. Each time, I returned to my book. It was a treatise by a Hellene philosopher on the nature of love. I made myself read the words, but for all I grasped of their meaning, it might as well have been written in Ch\u2019in. The candles burned steadily, wax dripping.</p> <p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice sounded small. \u201cI\u2019m bored and my arms are getting tired.\u201d</p><p>I shot her a hard look. She returned it with a mixture of defiance and uncertainty. I closed my book, marking the page with one finger. \u201cWe can put a halt to this here and now.\u201d</p><p>Her chin rose. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>I waited a long time. I could feel her watching me, the cord that bound us together drawn taut. But Sidonie didn\u2019t speak again, not even when her arms began to quiver with the strain of keeping them raised, hands clasped as I\u2019d ordered. At last I put down my book and crossed over to crouch before her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said to her. \u201cYou know that I would never harm you.\u201d</p> <p>Sidonie nodded, her eyes grave and unfathomable.</p><p>\u201cGo into the bedroom,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s an item in the bedside cupboard that wasn\u2019t there before. Bring it here.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her arms and rose unsteadily. I caught her elbow. Desire flared at a single touch. I let her go. Sidonie gave me a quick, flickering smile, then went to obey. She returned with a short braided whip, kneeling without asking and laying it at my feet. The black leather shone dully. It was lambskin with a long, soft tassel at the tip. I stooped to pick up the whip, then circled her, letting the tassel trail over her bare skin and watching her shiver.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Amarante tell you about seeking pleasure in haste?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Her breasts rose and fell, breath quickening again. \u201cIf you rush too quickly through all the pleasures Naamah\u2019s arts offer, they will lose their savor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so.\u201d I nodded. \u201cIf you\u2019re good, once a month, I will add a new item to the cupboard. If you\u2019re not . . .\u201d I paused. \u201cI\u2019ll take one away.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie made a sound that might have been acknowledgment or protest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you growing jaded on me, Sun Princess.\u201d I gave the whip the slightest flick, the soft tassels snapping against one rosy nipple. It didn\u2019t hurt, but it provoked a startled gasp. \u201cI want to keep you sated for a long, long time.\u201d I thrust the braided haft of the whip through my belt and crouched in front of her again. \u201cOut there, you belong to the realm and your duty. In here, you\u2019re mine. Understand?\u201d</p> <p>Our gazes locked. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d One by one, I undid the pins that held her hair coiled atop her head. It fell in a honey-gold cascade over her shoulders. She looked younger and even more vulnerable. \u201cTell me your signale.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was low, but steady. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d I laughed softly. \u201cAlways and always.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie nodded, the hint of a smile hovering at the corner of her mouth. There was nothing but trust in her eyes.</p><p>I put two fingers beneath her chin, raising it, and kissed her. Her lips parted for my tongue, her body straining toward mine. I wrenched my mouth away with an effort and stood, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cStand over there,\u201d I said roughly, pointing toward a low chair. \u201cBend over and grasp the arms.\u201d</p><p>And, ah, gods and goddesses! She did. I stood behind her, my heart hammering in my breast. My mouth was dry with desire, my palms sweating as I clutched the whip. Her loose hair hung about her face in tumbled locks of gold. The tips of her breasts brushed the chair\u2019s cushion. I flicked the whip, lightly, lightly. Once, twice, three times. The soft tasseled end kissed her buttocks, light and teasing. Sidonie caught her breath.</p><p>The air between us crackled.</p><p>\u201cYou like that.\u201d I drew near and trailed the tassel down the length of her spine, the cleft of her buttocks. I slid one hand between her thighs, fingering her. Gods, she was wet! \u201cSpread your legs. Wider.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>I shuddered, struggling for control. \u201cThat\u2019s how much you want this.\u201d I withdrew my hand, found her mouth, slid my fingers over her lips. She turned her head, sucking obediently. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She made a muffled sound of agreement.</p><p>It nearly sent me over the edge.</p><p>I pulled away. \u201cI\u2019m going to whip you in earnest now,\u201d I said, my voice sounding hoarse and strange to my ears. \u201cUntil you beg me to stop. And when you do, I\u2019m going to take you where you stand, hard. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I did.</p><p>Elua have mercy, there are no words for such a thing. Sidonie bore it for a long time, longer than I would have expected, legs spread and arms braced, head lowered, shuddering in the throes of violent pleasure. I took it slowly, plying the whip gently, taking it to the edge of pain and backing away, over and over. A flush spread over her creamy skin. I pushed her harder, farther. Over the threshold, into the realm of pain. The whip cracked, laying harsh kisses on her vulnerable flesh. Red welts rose on her flushed skin. I wanted to lave them with my tongue, easing her pain. I wanted to skewer her and split her open.</p><p>She began to cry.</p><p>She begged.</p><p>And I took her as I\u2019d promised\u2014hard. I was hard; ah, gods! I\u2019d never been harder in my life. I could barely get my breeches down. Wet, so wet. I pushed into her; I slammed into her. I buried myself in her. Her cheek scraped the chair\u2019s cushion. Her nails dug into its wooden arms. I felt her flesh convulse around me, over and over. I didn\u2019t care. I drove into her, groaning aloud, until I spent myself in one long, excruciating spasm of pleasure, filling her with my seed.</p><p>I barely caught her as she sagged, easing her to the carpeted floor. There I held her, panting, waiting for my hammering heart to slow.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked when I could talk.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie lifted her face toward mine, slowly returning from a faraway place. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She wound a lock of my hair around her fingers and gave it a sharp yank. \u201cA little sore. Very sated. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I laughed. \u201cGods, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She drew a long, shuddering breath, brushing absently at the tear stains on her face. \u201cHow odd. I didn\u2019t expect to cry. It didn\u2019t hurt that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the pain,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She was quiet a moment. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Sidonie glanced down at our entangled limbs. \u201cImriel, are you still wearing your boots?\u201d</p><p>I pried them off, kicking off my breeches. \u201cI was in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>Her quick smile came and went. \u201cSo I noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d I tightened my arms around her. \u201cElua help me, I love you so much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sidonie kissed my throat. \u201cI do, too.\u201d She shuddered again, a latent tremor of pleasure running through her. \u201cGods! That\u2019s a sharp spice. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for a steady diet of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasional cravings?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She gave me a look that set my heart to hammering again. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>I slid one arm under her knees and scooped her into my arms, rising and heading for the bedchamber. Sidonie laughed softly, kissing my face, her fingers working at the buttons of my shirt. I hadn\u2019t bothered to take that off, either. Her body was naked and warm in my arms, nestled contently against mine. I could have carried her forever, except for the urgent, rising need to be inside her again.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were sated,\u201d she said.</p><p>I tossed her onto the bed. \u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Summer gave way to autumn.</p><p>Drustan returned to Alba, where matters were still unsettled in the wake of Dorelei\u2019s death. It was uncertain whether or not Sidonie\u2019s younger sister, Alais, would wed Talorcan, Drustan\u2019s heir.</p><p>A lot of things were uncertain.</p><p>Aragonia was uncertain, fraught with rumors of a Carthaginian invasion. Euskerria was uncertain, fraught with rumors that the House of Aragon meant to press the Euskerri into battle to defend against a possible Carthaginian incursion, struggling to establish their territory as a sovereign state. Queen Ysandre, trying to negotiate between the two, worried about the succession in Alba, worried about her own recalcitrant heir, was uncertain.</p><p>I, on the other hand, had never been more certain in my life.</p><p>Ah, Elua! Those were good days and better nights.</p><p>Some were gentle and sweet and tender. Others . . . weren\u2019t. Together, Sidonie and I embarked on an exploration of the full spectrum of all of the pleasures of Naamah\u2019s arts. Neither of us tired of the other. Neither of us could get our fill. For two years, for too long, we\u2019d been parted. Again and again, we made up for lost time.</p><p>And again and again, I was filled with amazement and wonder. I\u2019d spent so long fearing my own nature. Now I could scarce remember why. The nightmare of Dar\u0161anga was a long, long way away.</p><p>Sidonie was fearless, but she wasn\u2019t reckless. She didn\u2019t hesitate to use her signale. The first time it happened, the first time she gasped, \u201cAlways!\u201d I found myself responding instantly. I didn\u2019t even need to think\u2014the word penetrated the madness of desire, halting me like a brake thrown on a runaway wagon. I soothed her until she caught her breath and told me to continue. Before it happened, I\u2019d been apprehensive. Afterward, it was easier. The threshold had been crossed. Nothing terrible lay on the other side.</p><p>I learned to trust myself, even as Sidonie trusted me.</p><p>It was such a strange and unlikely thing, this trust between us. We had spent so many childhood years disliking one another. Sidonie had been cool and dismissive, filled with mistrust. It had always galled me.</p><p>Things had changed slowly . . . and then all at once. We\u2019d bickered at a f\u00eate and I\u2019d pledged loyalty to her on a perverse impulse. She hadn\u2019t believed me, but she hadn\u2019t entirely disbelieved me, either. Then came the day of the hunting party, when we startled a wild boar and Sidonie\u2019s horse had bolted. I\u2019d gone after her, found her thrown. There had been a rustling in the wood. Thinking it was the boar returning, I\u2019d flung myself atop her, seeking to bear the brunt of its tusks.</p><p>And everything had changed.</p><p>In hindsight, it was a wonderment that I hadn\u2019t ravished her then and there, with her willing encouragement. But it was only the beginning of my realization that my infuriatingly composed cousin wasn\u2019t at all what she seemed. And I hadn\u2019t been anywhere near ready to embrace my own nature. I\u2019d run away from it, reckoning myself damaged goods.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>The scars of the damage were still there. They would always be there. I bore scars, figurative and literal. The faint tracks of old weals, administered by a whip that was never intended to bring pleasure. The puckered scar of a Tatar branding iron that had gotten me thrown in gaol in Vralia, mistaken for a horse-thief.</p><p>They were nothing to the scars Berlik\u2019s claws had left on me, but they were emblems of a wound that had cut as deep as Dorelei\u2019s death. In Tiberium, a Priest of Asclepius had told me to learn to bear them with pride. Even a stunted tree reaches for sunlight, he\u2019d said.</p><p>I\u2019d found mine.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t want to leave her.</p><p>Word came from the Master of the Straits. He had completed a search of Alba and found no trace of my mother. He pledged to spend the winter searching every inch of Terre d\u2019Ange for her, gazing into his sea-mirror, and promised a report in the spring. It was a slow process, he wrote, easy to locate someone when one knew where to look, but tedious and exacting when one didn\u2019t. We made certain this bit of gossip was disseminated.</p><p>I discussed the matter at length with Ph\u00e8dre, who knew Melisande Shahrizai better than anyone else. When spring came, unless by some miracle Hyacinthe actually found my mother, I would be bound to act.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said with some asperity, \u201cI wanted to go after her when she first vanished.\u201d She gave Joscelin a sidelong glance. \u201cYou refused to allow it. Now her trail\u2019s seven years\u2019 cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d found her then, how would Imriel prove himself now?\u201d he asked reasonably. \u201cMayhap this happened for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refused, too,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her past dictating our lives anymore. And I certainly wasn\u2019t planning on falling in love with Sidonie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still puzzles me a little,\u201d Joscelin mused.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cWell, we could start in La Serenissima,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said thoughtfully, ignoring our comments. \u201cThey kept her secrets well at the Temple of Asherat, but of a surety, someone there knows. Mayhap they\u2019d be willing to talk after so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d I said.</p> <p>She gave me one of her deep looks. \u201cYou didn\u2019t suppose we\u2019d let you go alone.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Joscelin, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cThis time she\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou came too damnably close to dying in Alba while we were half a world away. I\u2019ll not run that risk again.\u201d</p><p>It made me feel immeasurably better. \u201cSo it\u2019s a start. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow the tale,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said simply. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s somewhat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Bella Donna,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Joscelin rolled his eyes.</p><p>My mother had spent almost fourteen years claiming sanctuary in the Temple of Asherat in La Serenissima. In Tiberium, I\u2019d learned that an odd cult of faith had sprung up around her presence there: the Bella Donna, the beautiful woman wrongfully accused, mourning her lost son. It was said that the goddess Asherat-of-the-Sea, herself a grieving mother, had taken pity on her, dissolving the walls of her sanctuary-prison, so that the Bella Donna could go in search of her missing son.</p><p>What the tale failed to take into account was that I had in fact been found for some years before my mother vanished. And it wasn\u2019t Melisande who had found me and brought me out of darkness, but Ph\u00e8dre.</p><p>My mother had sent her, though. That much was true.</p><p>\u201cStories feed on kernels of truth,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said pragmatically. \u201cThere have to have been sightings. And then there\u2019s Menekhet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMenekhet?\u201d I echoed.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cShe counted Ptolemy Dikaios an ally. I\u2019ll warrant he knows somewhat.\u201d Her brows furrowed. \u201cI\u2019ll warrant he\u2019s a member of your Unseen Guild, too. If ever there was a candidate ripe for covertcy and intrigue, it would be Pharaoh of Menekhet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my Guild,\u201d I said automatically</p><p>\u201cWhat about your senator\u2019s wife?\u201d Joscelin asked. \u201cClaudia Fulvia.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cClaudia didn\u2019t know anything beyond what she told me. I do believe that much. I daresay her masters didn\u2019t trust her with more than she needed to know.\u201d I grinned at the memory. \u201cClaudia had her skills, but discretion wasn\u2019t among them. I\u2019d reckon the Ephesian ambassador a better wager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiokles Agallon,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said aloud, remembering.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe offered a trade of favors. When I refused, he bade me remember his name. He implied that few within the Guild would be willing to make such a trade. And Canis did have an Ephesian accent.\u201d I frowned. \u201cOr somewhat close to it, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sooner hunt across Caerdicca Unitas than chance your owing favors to the Unseen Guild,\u201d Joscelin observed. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard of them, it seems an unnecessary risk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you say the same if it meant leaving Ph\u00e8dre for months on end?\u201d I asked. \u201cMayhap years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you choose, we will aid you,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said steadily. \u201cNo matter what.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her. \u201cMy thanks.\u201d</p><p>I talked about these matters with Sidonie, too. We talked endlessly about all manner of things, and if half our discussions ended up in bed and breathless, we simply picked up the threads of conversation in the morning.</p><p>Elua, it was good.</p><p>So many things in my life had been hard. Since I\u2019d been abducted as a child, life had dealt me blow after blow. I\u2019d borne them. I\u2019d survived. As Urist, the commander of the garrison at Clunderry, had noted when we\u2019d been shipwrecked together, I had a knack for surviving. I\u2019d struggled with guilt, struggled against strange magics, struggled to become a good man. But this . . . this was so blessedly easy. It seemed manifestly unfair that I would have to walk away from the best thing in my life.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let the quest make you bitter,\u201d Sidonie said once when we were lying in bed together, talking in love\u2019s afterglow about things to come. \u201cUnfair though it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d I said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re doing well. It\u2019s a lot to ask.\u201d</p><p>I rolled onto my back. \u201cWell, this deed pays for all. After this, no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lavish wedding, mayhap.\u201d Sidonie propped herself on her elbows, gazing at me. \u201cIn time, children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren.\u201d I ran a lock of her hair through my fingers. \u201cYours and mine.\u201d</p><p>The shadow of Dorelei and the son I\u2019d lost lay between us, but Sidonie didn\u2019t speak of it. We both knew. Neither of us ever forgot. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard, you know,\u201d she said instead. \u201cYour mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cEven with all she\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still your mother,\u201d she said.</p><p>I\u2019d only ever met my blood-mother twice. The first time, I hadn\u2019t known who she was. I\u2019d been ignorant of my own heritage, a Sanctuary-raised fosterling, ignorant of my own face. I\u2019d thought she was wonderful.</p><p>The second time, I\u2019d known.</p><p>That time, I had despised her.</p><p>I still did. Since the day Ph\u00e8dre, Joscelin, and I had ridden out of Drujan and Lord Amaury Trente had greeted me as Prince Imriel de la Courcel, turning my world inside out, I\u2019d lived my life under the poisonous cloud of Melisande Shahrizai\u2019s monstrous, unspeakable treason. She had been condemned to death before I was born, before I was even conceived. There was no doubt in my mind that she deserved the sentence, none at all.</p><p>And yet . . . she had loved me. I didn\u2019t doubt that, either. A few years ago, I\u2019d finally steeled myself to read the letters she\u2019d written me during the long years of her exile in the Temple of Asherat. And I could not forget that the woman I was meant to bring to justice had also been a doting mother, filled with fierce, unexpected love, counting my infant fingers and toes.</p><p>I stared at the ceiling. \u201cHow do you suppose it will be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter so long?\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice was gentle. \u201cI imagine she\u2019ll be asked to make a confession, then given a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison or the blade?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cA swift-acting poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the body displayed,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Sidonie didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cImriel, I hate this, too. On some level, I daresay even my mother hates it. You wanted a voice in this choice. If it hurts that badly, if you want me to step down . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I rolled onto my side, grasping her upper arms hard enough to bruise. \u201cNo. I want you, all of you, but as you\u2019re meant to be.\u201d I flexed my fingers, then let go with an effort. \u201cWife, mother, and Queen, Sidonie. Nothing less.\u201d</p><p>She brushed a lock of hair from my brow. \u201c\u2019Tis still a high price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay it,\u201d I said. \u201cAny price.\u201d</p><p>We fell to kissing, then, rolling in the tangled bedsheets. Every time I thought my desire was spent, I found it wasn\u2019t. This time, this respite, was short and precious. Autumn was tipping toward winter. Come spring, I would be forced to choose a course of action. But not yet, not now. What my mind denied, my body knew. I nudged Sidonie\u2019s knees apart, settled between her thighs. I felt her body accepting mine. Sank into her like I was coming home.</p><p>Love.</p><p>You will find it and lose it, again and again.</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said aloud.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice, bemused. Her hips rose to meet mine, nails digging into my buttocks, urging me deeper.</p><p>Alais\u2019 voice in my memory.</p><p>I think she\u2019s going to need you very badly one day.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated, saying it to the Priest of Elua who had uttered that long-ago prophecy, saying it to Alais with her dreams and dire forebodings. I shook my head, dispelling all their warnings and fears. \u201cNo, no, no. I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll pay the price. Only don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Sidonie gasped.</p><p>\u201cStay with me?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Her back arched; it was a promise, not a signale. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Life continued apace.</p><p>Swift, too damnably swift. The bright blaze of autumn\u2019s foliage flared and dimmed. Leaves turned brown and dry, loosed their moorings. In the mornings, the garden where I practiced the Cassiline discipline, telling the hours, sparkled with hoarfrost. The members of Sidonie\u2019s guard watching me huddled in woolen cloaks.</p><p>It was the one time of day I always had a pair of her guards in attendance, the one time of day I was otherwise alone and isolated. It had been Claude de Monluc\u2019s idea, not mine, and Sidonie swore she hadn\u2019t asked it of him. If there were any complaints among the guards, I never heard them. I was glad of their presence.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been any threats, but there was a lingering uneasiness beneath the truce. During the nights, it was easy to forget. During the days, there were reminders.</p><p>One came in the form of a ridiculous suit pushed all the way from the provincial court of Namarre to the Palace Court. I held among the estates of my inheritance the duchy of Barthelme, located in the province of Namarre. The seneschal had reported the suit to me\u2014some incident of a vassal lord, the Baron Le Blanc, claiming I had violated an obscure clause in his charter of tenure that granted him a tithing exemption on Muscat grapes.</p><p>As it happened, it was true. The Duc de Barthelme who had signed the charter some three hundred years ago had been possessed of a surpassing fondness for Muscat wine and had waived the customary tithe in favor of an annual keg of the barony\u2019s finest. Generations later, an enterprising successor to the duchy had managed to evade the clause in favor of a monetary tithe, and the clause had eventually been forgotten altogether until Jean Le Blanc uncovered it.</p><p>According to my seneschal, the matter had been settled in the provincial court. The bailiff\u2019s ruling had been favorable to Le Blanc. The records were surveyed assiduously, and Barthelme was assessed a fine for a hundred and eleven years\u2019 worth of illegally gathered tithes.</p><p>The incident stuck in my mind because it had been a sizable sum, and when I\u2019d told Sidonie, she\u2019d laughed and said it was a good thing she wasn\u2019t in love with me for my wealth. I\u2019d given it no more thought until Sidonie brought it up again.</p><p>\u201cYou remember your old friend Baron le Blanc?\u201d she said one evening. \u201cHe\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. \u201cThe fellow with the Muscat? Whatever for?\u201d</p><p>We were dining in her chambers. Sidonie shrugged, spearing a piece of roasted capon. \u201cLost revenues on a hundred and eleven years\u2019 of tithes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a stupid clause,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the point. The Namarrese bailiff ruled that since the Barons of Le Blanc collected revenues on a hundred and eleven years\u2019 worth of their finest Muscat in lieu of tithing it, he\u2019s no right to complain. Not unless he\u2019s prepared to deliver a hundred and eleven kegs of Muscat to you. Now he\u2019s demanding a hearing Ex Solium.\u201d</p><p>Any D\u2019Angeline peer who felt himself wronged by the regional judiciary had a right to demand a hearing from the throne. It was an old law, but one seldom used for frivolous matters.</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cIs Ysandre going to hear it?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it passed through the Court of Assizes, but it did. He\u2019s hired a persuasive advocate. Even so, they decided it wasn\u2019t worth Mother\u2019s time, so it landed on my plate. I\u2019m to take the hearing as a representative of the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA suit brought against me as the Duc de Barthelme,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d She tapped her fork idly against the rim of her plate. \u201cPassing odd, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I agreed. \u201cWill you hear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, no!\u201d she said fervently. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not about to walk into that trap. I pleaded lover\u2019s bias in the matter, and threw it back to the Court of Assizes. Let the Chancellor make of it what he will. If Le Blanc persists, his silver-tongued advocate can pitch his suit to my mother and find out how well she enjoys having her time wasted.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cIt is odd, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Baron Jean Le Blanc never did get his hearing and his suit was withdrawn for reasons that were never made clear. Still, rumor circulated in its wake. My detractors whispered that it was proof that I was exerting undue influence over Sidonie.</p><p>It troubled her, and me too, although mostly for her sake. In many ways, we were still coming to know one another as adults. If I\u2019d learned nothing else about Sidonie, I knew for a surety that she had a keen sense of justice and a determined adherence to the rule of law, instilled in her by both parents, amplified by her own sensibilities.</p><p>As much as I loathed to mark the passage of time, I was almost glad when the autumn days turned to winter, shortening, and the Longest Night drew nigh.</p><p>It was a time of license and sheer revelry, and although it had its roots in a tradition older than the coming of Blessed Elua, it was one D\u2019Angelines had adopted wholeheartedly.</p><p>It was sacred.</p><p>It was joyous, too.</p><p>For me it held a special significance. Three years ago, on the Longest Night, I had kissed Sidonie for the first time. It had all begun in earnest that night. I still shuddered at the memory of her gold-masked face lifting toward mine, our lips meeting. My Sun Princess. The next year, the next Longest Night, I\u2019d passed in Alba. I\u2019d knelt in the snow, keeping Elua\u2019s vigil. That was the night Dorelei had finally surmised to whom my heart belonged. The following year . . . that, I\u2019d passed in Vralia, hunting Berlik. I\u2019d no idea when it had fallen, not for sure. It might have been the night I killed him, or it might have fallen afterward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This would be our first time together, truly together.</p><p>\u201cNight and Day,\u201d Favrielle n\u00f3 Eglantine pronounced. \u201cI see no other choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Sidonie asked mildly. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019ve already\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The couturiere\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cNone.\u201d Snapping her fingers, she uttered an order to one of her assistants. \u201cBring the fabric.\u201d</p><p>It was gorgeous beyond all expectation. One bolt was black velvet, a black so dense it seemed to absorb light. The other was silk. It was a pale gold hue, almost white, like the radiance of the sun at high noon; but to describe it thus does it no justice. It flowed like liquid sunlight, shimmering with its own inner brilliance. Favrielle handled it with reverence.</p><p>\u201cI discovered this in the stores of Eglantine House when I was fourteen,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one ever dared use it. When I first had my own salon, I nearly beggared myself to buy it.\u201d She smiled wryly. \u201cAnd then I never dared use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I said sincerely.</p><p>Favrielle held up a length. \u201cIt is the essence of daylight itself.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cNot some tawdry cloth-of-gold.\u201d She shot a challenging glance at Sidonie, who hid a smile.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought, mayhap, one day Joscelin Verreuil would consent to attend the Queen\u2019s f\u00eate with Ph\u00e8dre instead of keeping Elua\u2019s vigil,\u201d Favrielle mused. \u201cI would have done it for them. But you\u2019ll do, the two of you.\u201d</p><p>I kissed her cheek. \u201cThank you, Favrielle.\u201d</p><p>She glowered at me. \u201cGo away, now.\u201d</p><p>The days grew short; the nights grew long. In the salon of Favrielle n\u00f3 Eglantine, seamstresses sewed feverishly. Our costumes took shape.</p><p>Night and Day.</p> <p>Our fittings were held separately. I didn\u2019t see Sidonie\u2019s costume until the Longest Night. Mine was exquisitely simple: breeches and a doublet of unadorned black velvet, flat and fathomless. One of Favrielle\u2019s endlessly patient assistants spent hours brushing my hair and tying hundreds of tiny crystal beads into it. When she was done, it fell over my shoulders like a cloak of the night sky itself.</p><p>\u201cPerfection,\u201d she said, tying my mask in place. It was a simple domino of muted silver, a crescent moon rising like horns on my brow.</p><p>When at last I saw Sidonie, it took my breath away. I\u2019d dressed in my own quarters. Her guards came to fetch me that we might enter the ballroom together. All I could do was stare at her.</p><p>It was simple, too\u2014and subtle, infinitely more subtle than the Sun Princess costume. The pale silk glowed with soft luminosity, unadorned, clinging to the curves of her body in a way that made my mouth go dry. She wore long gloves of the same white-gold fabric, but her creamy shoulders and the length of her back were bare. Her golden hair was coiled in an artful coronet, a radiating sunburst affixed to the back of her head. Behind the softly gilded domino, her eyes looked like pools of night.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>\u201cYou look so beautiful it hurts,\u201d I said truthfully.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>It should have been a perfect night.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>For a long time, it promised to be. There was a little hush when Sidonie and I made our entrance, but it passed. This was the Longest Night, a time for joy and revelry. We had a good many friends and supporters amid the throng, and even Ysandre managed to greet us with considerable aplomb. Ph\u00e8dre was there, of course, escorted by Ti-Philippe.</p><p>\u201cElua!\u201d she breathed. \u201cSo that\u2019s what Favrielle\u2019s been hiding.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cShe said she would have used it for you and Joscelin if he\u2019d ever consented to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s perfect for you. Both of you.\u201d She kissed me lightly, smiled at Sidonie. \u201cYou look splendid together.\u201d</p><p>We drank joie, danced and mingled with friends, sat at the laden table and dined together. As the hour of midnight drew nigh, the usual sense of anticipation mounted. There were no surprises this year. The horologist called the hour, and the great hall was plunged into darkness. The Winter Queen hobbled out of her false crag, leaning on a blackthorn staff. The Sun Prince entered in his chariot to a drumroll and resounding cheers, pointing his spear at her and restoring her to youth. The oil-soaked wicks were lit, light returning in a sudden blaze.</p><p>Sidonie released her breath in a sigh. \u201cI never tire of the spectacle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d I touched her cheek. \u201cYou are my sunlight, Sidonie. The sun in my sky and the moon in my heavens. All that\u2019s bright and good in my life.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd a little bit that\u2019s dark, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re uncommonly sentimental,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m uncommonly happy.\u201d I spread my arms. \u201cAnd a little bit drunk.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and caught my hand. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>Catching sight of us returning to the dance floor, one of the musicians grinned and gestured to his fellows. They switched smoothly into a slow, romantic melody. As we danced, I thought about all the Longest Nights I had known. I thought about the fact that a year ago, I\u2019d been in Vralia. I thought about all the times I had danced with Sidonie. The first time, it had been on the Longest Night, too. That was when we\u2019d bickered and I\u2019d given her my oath on impulse.</p><p>It seemed impossible now, remembering how formal and careful we had been with one another. Sidonie had held me at a distance. I\u2019d scarce touched her. Later, after we\u2019d become lovers, we\u2019d struggled to recapture that sense of cool formality. At the f\u00eate for her seventeenth birthday, we\u2019d tripped over one another\u2019s feet, absurdly awkward in our efforts to disguise how well our bodies knew one another, how well we moved together. It made me laugh aloud to remember it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I whirled her. \u201cOnly that I love you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOh, that. \u2019Tis enough to make the gods laugh.\u201d</p><p>Now it was the Longest Night, and it was a simple, blessed pleasure to hold her in my arms with no barriers between us\u2014no mistrust, no awkwardness, no pretense. The music swooped and swirled in long, poignant arcs. We danced effortlessly. Tomorrow the world of politics and its burdens would be awaiting us. Tonight there was only music and joie.</p><p>And us.</p><p>The song ended, and another began. We stood without moving; night and day, reflecting one another. Sidonie gazed up at me. \u201c\u2018The lover showers kisses on the face of the beloved\u2019,\u201d she quoted softly from the Trois Milles Joies.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Like petals falling in a summer rain\u2019,\u201d I finished, kissing her.</p><p>\u201cWhore!\u201d</p><p>The epithet was harsh and shocking. A violin screeched to a halt. A very drunken lord costumed as a Tiberian imperator staggered onto the dance floor, his purple-edged robes disheveled, a laurel wreath askew on his dark hair.</p><p>\u201cWhore!\u201d he repeated, spitting the word at Sidonie. \u201cYou robbed me for his sake. Everyone knows.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s guards were trying to push through the throng, but everyone on the dance floor was pressed tight around us, eagerly watching the spectacle. I edged my body in front of her. \u201cWho in the hell are you, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neighbor,\u201d he spat. \u201cYour vassal, my greedy, treasonous, pandering liege!\u201d He waved a flask, his tone turning bitterly sardonic. \u201cCare for a swig of Muscat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJean Le Blanc?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows!\u201d He pointed at Sidonie, swaying. \u201cYou. You wouldn\u2019t even hear my suit. Everyone knows. Walking around all day, looking like butter wouldn\u2019t melt in your mouth. Spreading your legs for that traitor-spawn, rutting like an animal all night. Your guards talk. They laugh. Everyone knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a cursed lie!\u201d Claude de Monluc squeezed through the crowd, his hand on his sword-hilt, his face flushed with fury. \u201cYour guards don\u2019t talk, my lady,\u201d he said to Sidonie. \u201cAnd they certainly don\u2019t laugh.\u201d</p><p>Jean Le Blanc sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t deny the rutting, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one denies the rutting, my lord.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice was cool and remarkably calm. \u201cThat\u2019s why I refused to hear your suit. Apparently your advocate chose not to waste my mother\u2019s time with it.\u201d She studied him. \u201cDid someone suggest otherwise to you?\u201d</p><p>He looked away, uncertain.</p><p>I followed his gaze and saw Barquiel L\u2019Envers grinning. He caught my eye and gave me a mocking salute. \u201cOh, Elua and his Companions have mercy on me!\u201d I said in disgust. \u201cIs this what you\u2019ve been reduced to, L\u2019Envers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said . . .\u201d Le Blanc swayed. \u201cHis advocate said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, you thrice-cursed idiot.\u201d I grabbed a handful of his white robe and shook him. \u201cHe put you up to this, didn\u2019t he? Pushing your suit after it had been settled fairly. Lending you his advocate. Why?\u201d I tightened my grip. \u201cMore of my damned mother\u2019s legacy?\u201d</p><p>Le Blanc had turned pale, but he found a measure of his dignity. \u201cIt\u2019s not old history. Not to some of us. I fought at Troyes-le-Mont, but I couldn\u2019t protect my own family.\u201d His mouth worked. \u201cMy wife . . . my wife was raped. Many times. She killed herself.\u201d</p><p>I let go of him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not!\u201d he said in anguish. \u201cDancing and laughing and kissing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd rutting,\u201d Sidonie murmured.</p><p>His hands tightened into fists. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said to her. \u201cMy lord, believe me, I\u2019m sorrier than you know, but we have no quarrel here. You were urged to bring a foolish suit and misled about its outcome.\u201d I pointed at L\u2019Envers. \u201cHe took your grief and turned it to his own purposes for what amounts to little more than a childish prank. So tell me, my lord, where your anger lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d Claude de Monluc said crisply. \u201cDrunk, and a disgrace to the Court. Her highness has acted correctly in all legal matters, which is all that need concern you. You may apologize and leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Le Blanc glanced at Sidonie. \u201cI just . . . can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He left, though, miserable and stumbling, a pathetic figure. No one accompanied him, least of all his patron L\u2019Envers. I felt sick at heart.</p><p>\u201cUncle.\u201d Queen Ysandre\u2019s voice sliced through the crowd, filled with rare fury. Her guards cleared the throng. Glittering in wintry white, her mask discarded, she confronted L\u2019Envers. \u201cYou go too far,\u201d she said grimly. \u201cUrging that poor man to profane the Longest Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYsandre . . .\u201d he said in a placating tone, gesturing at Sidonie and me. \u201cThey flaunt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Color rioted on her cheekbones. \u201cThey\u2019re in love. I don\u2019t like it; you don\u2019t like it. No one likes it, except mayhap the Night Court and folk too young to remember. But Name of Elua! It\u2019s the Longest Night, and I will have peace in my Court. Since you\u2019ve broken it, you may take your leave.\u201d</p><p>If it was a contest of wills, L\u2019Envers lost. He bowed stiffly and departed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sidonie said quietly to her mother.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Ysandre rounded on her. \u201cJust . . .\u201d She drew a sharp breath, her violet gaze settling on me. \u201cFind her,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI\u2019m willing to place resources at your disposal once you do. Whatever it takes to bring Melisande Shahrizai to justice, I will provide. Bribery, diplomacy, force of arms. Only find her, Imriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promised.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Winter\u2019s grip on the land began to ease.</p><p>I wrote to Diokles Agallon, the Ephesian ambassador, a member of the Unseen Guild.</p><p>It was a calculated risk. I was circumspect in what I wrote. I promised nothing; I didn\u2019t dare, not knowing what he might ask. I didn\u2019t mention my mother by name. I alluded to our conversation in roundabout terms. I implied that if he had learned aught of the origins of a certain medallion, I might be willing to ply whatever influence I wielded in exchange for the knowledge.</p><p>Might.</p><p>I made no promises.</p><p>\u201cYou did make one promise,\u201d Sidonie reminded me, dark eyes grave. \u201cYou promised Alais a puppy come spring.\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten.\u201d</p><p>She kissed me. \u201cShe\u2019s like to forgive you. She\u2019s got larger matters to consider.\u201d</p><p>Of a surety, that was true. Unlike Sidonie, I\u2019d always regarded Alais as a sister, a true sister. And although she was young, she was older now than Sidonie had been when first I\u2019d begun to fall in love with her. Alais was still affianced to her own cousin in Alba, Drustan\u2019s nephew, Talorcan. The wedding had been postponed a number of times.</p><p>Everything had been so certain once.</p><p>The lines of succession in Alba were matrilineal. Terre d\u2019Ange had feared losing its foothold. That was why Ysandre and Drustan had pressed me to wed Dorelei, Talorcan\u2019s sister. Our son would have been his heir.</p><p>Our son, the monster.</p><p>Now Alais was pressing for change. She was willing to wed Talorcan . . . but she wanted assurance that their children would inherit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame her,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201c\u2019Tis a rule based on men\u2019s mistrust of women and fear of being cuckolded. I daresay there are any number of Alban women who would support her in this, and a few men, too, when you come to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrustan\u2019s thoughts changed after he became a father, didn\u2019t they?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. \u201cHe can\u2019t do it, though. It\u2019s tied too closely to Maelcon the Usurper\u2019s revolt.\u201d</p><p>It was yet another event that had happened long before we were born. The old Cruarch\u2019s son, Maelcon, had seized the throne and overturned the old traditions of succession. Drustan, the Cruarch\u2019s nephew and heir, had fled into exile among the Dalriada. In time, with the aid of the Dalriada\u2014not to mention Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin\u2014Drustan had raised an army of his own and taken the throne back. He had restored the matrilineal lines. There would be a fearful outcry against the hypocrisy if he overturned them now.</p><p>\u201cGods.\u201d I groaned. \u201cI know it\u2019s not old history to those who lived it, but I get infernally tired of having our lives shackled to the past.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sidonie said with sympathy. \u201cBelieve me, I do. But it won\u2019t be forever, or at least not all of it. Mayhap the Ephesian ambassador will have a swift reply at a cost we\u2019re willing to bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d I said. \u201cClaudia said there were factions within the Guild, and I got the sense Agallon was no ally of my mother\u2019s. If he had been, he would have known the medallion\u2019s origin and dangled it before me as a surety, not a possibility. I pray he can discover it, and I pray he\u2019s willing and eager to betray her, because that\u2019s exactly what we need.\u201d</p><p>It had been one of the factors, a big one, in my decision to contact Diokles Agallon. Ysandre had made her decree in a public forum, heard and acknowledged. By now, all of Terre d\u2019Ange knew, and gossip had doubtless spread beyond our borders. There was simply no way my mother was unaware of it. And while I had come to believe that she did indeed love me in her own way, I didn\u2019t think she was likely to wait patiently for me to find her and fetch her back to Terre d\u2019Ange to be executed, a notion that made me queasy when I contemplated it.</p><p>No, if I tried to trace her trail, years old, amid a tangled maze of allies and enemies, Melisande would know. She would know my next step before I took it. It would be child\u2019s play for her to stay a step ahead of me.</p><p>Taking her by surprise was our best chance. And even at that, even if Agallon did betray her, even with Ysandre\u2019s promise of aid, I didn\u2019t expect it to be easy.</p> <p>The decision came at a price, though. Seeking to bargain with the Guildsman might have been the most expedient course with the best chance of success, but no one could know of it. Sidonie told her mother; Ysandre extracted a promise that I\u2019d not grant any favors without her consent. And I told Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, of course. Beyond that, we didn\u2019t dare tear away the Unseen Guild\u2019s veil of secrecy.</p><p>I had been allowed to walk away from the Guild, but there was a price for that, too. Silence. Claudia Fulvia had been clear; if I revealed the Guild\u2019s existence and what little I knew of the extent of their vast web, my life\u2014or worse, the lives of my loved ones\u2014was forfeit.</p><p>Spies will be spies, Ysandre had said; but I\u2019d seen a measure of their influence in Tiberium. When it suited their purposes, the Guild had provoked a dangerous riot. I remembered Claudia, careless and dismissive. Starting a riot\u2019s one of the easiest things in the world. Even with her warning, I\u2019d gotten caught in it and nearly died. Of course, that was because Bernadette de Trevalion had hired a man to kill me to avenge the death of her brother Baudoin, whom my mother had betrayed\u2014yet another delightful piece of Melisande Shahrizai\u2019s legacy\u2014but it would have been terrifying anyway.</p><p>And my comrade Gilot, who had served House Montr\u00e8ve since I was a boy, had died. Not that night, not then and there, but it was the injuries he sustained in the riot that killed him in the end.</p><p>So we kept our silence.</p><p>And people began to wonder at my lack of action.</p> <p>Spring blossomed. A letter came from the Master of the Straits. Hyacinthe wrote with regret that he had found no trace of my mother anywhere on D\u2019Angeline soil. Wherever she was, it was beyond the limits of the gaze of his sea-mirror, which could not see past the lands bounded by the Straits. This news, we did not divulge.</p><p>But people began to wonder.</p><p>Of her own initiative, Ph\u00e8dre elected to write once more to old acquaintances and allies among the Stregazza in La Serenissima, pressing them to make one last inquiry into Melisande\u2019s disappearance from the Temple of Asherat there. As a stopgap measure, it wasn\u2019t much, but at least it might serve to provide a viable explanation for any information we did learn without compromising the Guild\u2019s secrecy.</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s birthday came and passed; mine fell a few weeks later. The celebrations were muted. After the ugliness of the Longest Night, we\u2019d fallen back into the habit of being circumspect in public. Jean Le Blanc hadn\u2019t been entirely misled. There were a couple members of the Dauphine\u2019s Guard who had been indiscreet, gossiping about what they suspected went on in the bedchamber when they were posted outside her quarters. Claude de Monluc had been furious, had wanted to dismiss them altogether. Sidonie, cool-headed and pragmatic, had refused.</p><p>\u201cGossip\u2019s not a crime,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cLack of loyalty is,\u201d de Monluc said in a grim tone.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in aught done in love,\u201d Sidonie said, unperturbed. \u201cAnd no sin in gossiping about it. But matters are tense and I\u2019d sooner be served by men with sense enough not to throw oil on fire. Let them serve in the regular Palace Guard. Give them my thanks and a generous purse. Make the same offer to any who want it.\u201d</p><p>Claude obeyed her order.</p> <p>There were three men who took it; there were thirty who applied for their posts. Young men, mostly, half in love with the notion of our star-crossed romance. They doted on Sidonie, which startled her a bit.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever doted on me before,\u201d she mused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never defied half the realm for the sake of love before,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I think they\u2019re beginning to suspect you don\u2019t exactly have ice water running in your veins.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>The nights . . . Elua, the nights were still wonderful. Knowledge that our time was beginning to dwindle lent a constant sense of urgency. Still, I could feel the tensions at Court rising.</p><p>There were moments of respite. In an effort to keep at least half my promise to Alais, I went to Montr\u00e8ve to choose a puppy for her from that spring\u2019s litter. Long ago, I\u2019d given her one of Montr\u00e8ve\u2019s wolfhounds. Alais and the dog had been inseparable, but the dog had been killed at Clunderry, torn open by a swipe of the bear-witch Berlik\u2019s claws.</p><p>Sidonie accompanied me, her mother reckoning that having the both of us out of sight for a few weeks might help reduce the sense of unease.</p><p>It was strange and wondrous having her there. We rode together, exploring the places I\u2019d loved as a child. I took her to the spring-fed pond hidden in the mountains. I told her about how my cousin Roshana had sought to teach Katherine Friote, the seneschal\u2019s daughter, and me a Kusheline game of courtship, teasing with a quirt of braided grasses. How I\u2019d been unable to bring myself to do it.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d Sidonie said, eyes sparkling.</p><p>I did.</p><p>There in the meadow, I plaited long stalks of grass. I stroked her soft skin and bade her to keep still and quiet, rewarding her with kisses when she obeyed, punishing her with the quirt when she didn\u2019t. The memory stirred all that old, aching adolescent yearning, banishing the fear that had accompanied it. I ended up tumbling her there in the meadow, the sun warm on my naked back, the sweet scent of bruised grass rising all around us.</p><p>We rode home adorned with wreaths of flowering bindweed vine, butterflies trailing in our wake, members of the Dauphine\u2019s Guard following at a discreet distance. At times like that, it almost seemed it would be worthwhile to give up the quest in favor of a flawed joy. To allow Sidonie to step down, to return to the City of Elua and say to Ysandre, Forgive me. It\u2019s too hard, too much to ask.</p><p>We didn\u2019t, though.</p><p>Instead, we chose a puppy; or I did, in consultation with old Artus Labb\u00e9, the kennel master, who would see to the pup\u2019s training. We spent time with Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, who had elected to accompany us. There at Montr\u00e8ve, with no duties to attend to, no constant presence of judging eyes, Sidonie was more at ease. I saw them begin to see her as I did. Not so much Ph\u00e8dre\u2014Elua knows, there wasn\u2019t much hidden from her\u2014but Joscelin.</p><p>One night, after much pleading on my part, he reenacted a famous performance from the time he had been disguised as a travelling Mendacant with Ph\u00e8dre and Hyacinthe. He hadn\u2019t done it since I was a boy. We all laughed until we wept. And when we had done, I prevailed on Sidonie to re-create an imagined scene from the youthful courtship of Ysandre and Drustan, somewhat she and Alais had concocted between them as children.</p><p>It was wickedly funny\u2014Sidonie had a knack for mimicry. She emulated her mother at her coolest, uttering declarations of undying passion and high-minded romance in a crisp, exacting tone, until even Joscelin was wiping his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think I begin to understand,\u201d he said to me that night.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said in her mild way. \u201cWhen all\u2019s said and done, she\u2019s a bit like you, love.\u201d</p><p>It was true, although I\u2019d never thought on it. Sidonie\u2019s habitual composure was as much a part of her as Joscelin\u2019s Cassiline discipline. When it was laid aside, it could be an unexpectedly delightful thing. And yet she was a bit like Ph\u00e8dre, too. Not an anguissette, no. I don\u2019t think I could have borne it. But she was fearless in her desires, and utterly unapologetic.</p><p>Gods, those were good times.</p><p>When we returned to the City of Elua, there was another glad surprise awaiting us. Amarante of Namarre, who had served as a lady-in-waiting, among other things, to Sidonie for a number of years, had returned to take service in the Temple of Naamah.</p><p>Her mother was a priestess and the head of Naamah\u2019s Order. During the year she had been gone, Amarante had been fulfilling her own final duties before taking her vows. She had spent a year wandering Terre d\u2019Ange, serving Naamah. Now she was back, and a priestess in her own right.</p><p>Mavros threw a f\u00eate in her honor, staging it to accord with our return.</p><p>He had long maintained an obsession with Amarante, which I knew. I do believe he genuinely liked her. I also knew that he had sought her out once her term of Naamah\u2019s Service had begun. What had passed between them, no one knew for certain. I knew what Amarante had predicted, because Sidonie had told me.</p><p>It won\u2019t be what he wants, Amarante had said. But it will leave him wanting more.</p><p>More than that, Sidonie hadn\u2019t cared to know.</p><p>It was the first time I found myself jealous; and to my surprise, there was a certain smoldering pleasure in it. I\u2019d known about Amarante for a long time. In some ways, her claim superseded mine; she had been recruited to instruct Sidonie in Naamah\u2019s arts. And she had done a damnably good job of it. Still, it stung to see Sidonie\u2019s eyes sparkle for someone else, even if that someone had shining hair the color of apricots, apple-green eyes, and plump lips for kissing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d Sidonie murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d There was a teasing undertone to Amarante\u2019s reply, although it was uttered with her usual unearthly calm, which had only deepened during her absence. \u201cI\u2019d hardly thought you\u2019d have time.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie laughed, and said somewhat too low for anyone else to hear.</p><p>Amarante glanced at me, lips curving. \u201cIf it\u2019s what you want, of course.\u201d</p><p>Mavros punched me hard in the shoulder. \u201cI hate you,\u201d he said cordially. \u201cOnly know that, cousin. I hate you with the blistering heat of a thousand fiery suns.\u201d</p><p>The three of us passed the night together; and it was a night impossible to describe, except to say that it was surpassingly beautiful, and when it was over, there was no jealousy left in me. Priests and Priestesses of Naamah are trained in the same arts of pleasure as adepts of the Night Court, but the year of Service they undertake differs. Afterward, they are free to choose patrons or lovers at will. When Naamah stayed beside Blessed Elua during his wanderings, she gave herself to strangers that he might eat, to the King of Persis that he might be freed. During their year of wandering, Naamah\u2019s acolytes are forbidden to refuse anyone who seeks them out of true longing, that they might better comprehend the sacrifice of the goddess who lay with mortals.</p><p>And in turn, Naamah graced them with desire.</p><p>I could feel her presence lingering over Amarante like a touch, a claim, and a blessing at once. A mantle of grace lay over us that night: love, desire, and selflessness all intertwined. There were no violent pleasures, only tender ones, but I learned somewhat of myself. I learned I was capable of sharing and being shared, of holding fast and letting go all at once. And I realized I was surpassingly grateful that Amarante had returned, albeit altered. She had long been Sidonie\u2019s closest confidante, her safe harbor. I was glad she would be here while I was gone.</p><p>In the morning, Sidonie was thoughtful. \u201cI knew it was time to send you to Naamah,\u201d she said to Amarante. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she would keep so much of you for herself.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met in a manner born of long familiarity, and Amarante smiled. \u201cI held a little back. I\u2019ll always be there when you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon, I hope,\u201d I said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mistake my meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s no word of your mother yet?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting on word from La Serenissima.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it comes soon,\u201d Amarante said quietly.</p><p>It did, although it didn\u2019t come from La Serenissima.</p><p>It came only a few days later, in the midst of sufficient uproar at Court that it easily passed unnoticed. If tensions in Terre d\u2019Ange were internal and simmering, they were external and rising to a boil elsewhere in the world. Alba\u2019s future remained unsettled. Queen Ysandre had been unable to broker any lasting peace between Aragonia and the Euskerri, and now fighting had broken out between them in the mountains south of Siovale. Delegates from both nations were beleaguering her\u2014the Aragonians begging her to honor her alliance and stay out of the matter, the Euskerri begging for acknowledgment of their sovereign rights\u2014and the Siovalese lords worried that the fighting would spill across the border. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the midst of that came the news that a sizable delegation from General Astegal of Carthage\u2014who had thus far done not the slightest thing to justify the rampant unease his appointment had provoked\u2014was lying off the shores of Marsilikos, begging leave to sail up the Aviline River and pay tribute to Queen Ysandre.</p><p>And I got a letter.</p><p>To all appearances, it was a love-missive, written in a feminine hand, tied with ribbon and scented with perfume. It was delivered to the barracks of the Dauphine\u2019s Guard.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the first of its kind. We\u2019d both gotten them; it was a popular pastime at Court. This one was unsigned. It contained an innocuous love poem written on thick vellum . . . but there was a series of subtle notches and lines etched along the edges of the vellum. I fingered them, thinking back on the day in the Temple of Asclepius when the priest had taken my hand and shown me similar notches etched in a clay medallion.</p><p>\u201cWho delivered this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Claude de Monluc shrugged. \u201cSome Tsingano lad. He said a lady in Night\u2019s Doorstep paid him.\u201d He grinned. \u201cNot intrigued, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, no!\u201d I laughed and showed him the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s not signed, that\u2019s all. One never knows if it\u2019s a prank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike as not it\u2019s just another high-spirited young noblewoman,\u201d he suggested. \u201cDrunk enough to take a dare, sober enough to realize she\u2019d regret it in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike as not,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Since Sidonie was in conference with her mother, I went straightaway to the townhouse. Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin were still in Montr\u00e8ve, but Eug\u00e8nie admitted me to Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s study without question. I knew Ph\u00e8dre had found a reference for the blind priest\u2019s system of notation, but it took me forever to locate the moldering old Hellene medical tome in which she\u2019d found it. Doubtless Ph\u00e8dre could have laid her hand on it in a heartbeat, but she wasn\u2019t the most organized archivist in the world.</p><p>Once I finally did, I laid it open on her desk, studied the maddeningly intricate chart of slashes and crosshatches it contained, and set about transcribing the message.</p><p>It was painstaking work and I daresay I made a few errors, but eventually the gist of it came clear.</p><p>I do not hold the answer you seek, but one of Carthage does. If the Queen receives their tribute, he will tell you.</p><p>\u201cCarthage,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIt had to be Carthage.\u201dGiving Eug\u00e8nie my thanks and a fond embrace, I took the letter, the transcription, and the musty old Hellene volume, stowed them in my bags and headed for Night\u2019s Doorstep, where the portly Emile presided over a tavern called the Cockerel. He was a Tsingano half-breed who had been one of Hyacinthe\u2019s boon companions many years ago, and he was unfailingly loyal to House Montr\u00e8ve.</p> <p>\u201cI need a quiet word,\u201d I said to him.</p><p>\u201cFor you, my gadjo pearl?\u201d He clapped my back. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Emile listened while I told him I\u2019d received a mysterious love letter delivered by a Tsingano lad, that I wanted to talk to the boy and learn what he could tell me of the woman who\u2019d given it to him. And that I wanted it done in secrecy.</p><p>\u201cI will find out.\u201d Emile studied me with disapproval. \u201cAlready you philander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shook my head. \u201cBut I fear mayhap it\u2019s a plot to make her highness believe otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The lines of reproach smoothed from his fleshy face. Emile laid a finger alongside his nose. \u201cLike the other time, eh? Do not fear. The Tsingani will always keep your secrets and seek to ferret out the secrets of those who would harm Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay\u2019s son. We do not forget who freed Hyacinthe from his curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another matter,\u201d I said. \u201cCan you find someone discreet to ride to Montr\u00e8ve and fetch Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin?\u201d Emile hesitated, and I fumbled for my purse, setting it on the table. \u201cFor a generous fee, of course.\u201d</p><p>The purse vanished. \u201cOf course I would do it for free.\u201d Emile smiled broadly. \u201cBut all things are possible for a fee, chavo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy thanks,\u201d I said, rising.</p><p>Strange but true, I trusted the Tsingani more than I trusted most of my peers. Most D\u2019Angelines held them in a measure of suspicion, although it is better now, I am told, than before I was born. In fairness, the Tsingani did take a certain delight in bilking outsiders whenever possible, but they could be fiercely loyal friends. Of a surety, they\u2019d been that to Ph\u00e8dre\u2014and to me. It was a Tsingani kumpania that had reported seeing Carthaginian slavers with D\u2019Angeline children in tow long, long ago. If not for that, I would have been dead years ago.</p><p>I rode back to the Palace and awaited Sidonie.</p><p>When at last she entered her quarters, she took one look at my face and stopped dead. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>I showed her the letter. \u201cWord\u2019s come.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Ysandre took the news better than I would have reckoned.</p><p>We met in private, just the three of us. She glanced briefly at the text of the letter itself, then examined the vellum edges, lingering over my transcription and checking it against the chart in the Hellene book. At length, her fair brows rose.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d she asked. \u201cI accept Carthage\u2019s tribute, and some mysterious agent of the Guild will divulge Melisande\u2019s whereabouts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much of a favor to ask,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cYour majesty, I can\u2019t say why the Ephesian ambassador would ask such a thing in such a covert manner.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre leveled a hard gaze at me. \u201cGive me your best guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I said in frustration.</p><p>\u201cA favor may be transferred if all parties are in agreement,\u201d Sidonie said pragmatically. \u201cI imagine the Guild must deal in such currency. For some reason, Diokles Agallon has transferred his favor to Carthage. He seeks to align himself with their interests, which, at the moment, appear to be courting your favor.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre tapped the vellum, her face thoughtful. \u201cHe\u2019s wary, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Sidonie agreed. \u201cCarthage is poised to make a gambit. If it succeeds, and the axes of power shift in their favor, well and good. If it fails, he may yet distance himself\u2014and Ephesium\u2014from it.\u201d</p><p>I felt hopelessly over my head. \u201cWhat gambit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherein lies the question,\u201d Ysandre said in a wry tone. She tapped the vellum idly again, thinking. \u201cI must confess, I am curious about this General Astegal, and I\u2019m weary of trying to settle the bickering of Aragonia and those damned Euskerri. I\u2019d cede sovereignty to the Euskerri over the D\u2019Angeline territory they want if Aragonia would do the same, but there\u2019s no reconciling them. And I\u2019ve half a mind to hear Carthage\u2019s suit anyway. We\u2019ve had poor relations with them since . . .\u201d She glanced at me, her face softening. \u201cFor a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarthage still practices slavery,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSo do many nations,\u201d Ysandre said gently. \u201cBut at least there has been no further traffic in D\u2019Angelines. Imriel, I thank you for your candor in bringing this to me. I have promised a reply to General Astegal in a fortnight\u2019s time. I have taken counsel with the Royal Admiral Quintilius Rousse, who sees no harm in their overture. I will take counsel with Drustan when he arrives, convene Parliament, and give my answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather\u2019s late this year,\u201d Sidonie commented.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Queen Ysandre eyed her. \u201cOur children are a trial to us.\u201d</p><p>The days that followed were fraught with tension. Emile in Night\u2019s Doorstep located the Tsingano lad who\u2019d delivered the missive, but the boy could tell me nothing useful about the lady who\u2019d given it to him. A foreigner, he said, but he couldn\u2019t guess from what nation. She\u2019d asked him to deliver it because she was leaving the City in haste, or so she claimed. I spoke to the City Guard, but any number of foreign women had come and gone in the past two days. In the end, it didn\u2019t really matter how the message had arrived. What mattered was what we would decide regarding it. And so we waited. We waited for Drustan to arrive; I waited for Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin to arrive. The Carthaginians awaited a reply. Quintilius Rousse awaited word to bring it. Alba awaited a clear line of succession. Parliament awaited a voice and a vote.</p><p>Everyone was waiting, waiting.</p><p>I felt myself wound tight and restless. For the first time, things went awry between Sidonie and me in the bedchamber, our desires staggering out of rhythm. She wanted reassurance, and I sought to lose myself in violent pleasure.</p><p>I ignored her protestations for too long, too far.</p><p>\u201cAlways!\u201d Her voice cracked like a whip, one hand wrenching away the blindfold of black silk she wore. She glared at me. \u201cImriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>I dropped the tawse paddle, dropped to my knees. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel . . .\u201d Sidonie sighed, cupping my face. \u201cI know. The world\u2019s all out of kilter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. \u201cSidonie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll set it right.\u201d There was a world of tenderness in her voice. \u201cI asked you for this, do you remember? Tonight, you do what I say. Do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I said hoarsely.</p><p>She handed me the blindfold. \u201cPut this on.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed, tying it behind my head.</p><p>\u201cPresent yourself,\u201d she said, and I clasped my hands behind the nape of my neck as I\u2019d taught her to do. I heard her pick up the tawse and circle me. My skin prickled. I was still wound tight and I didn\u2019t want this, not now, but I was willing to bear it in atonement. The edge of the tawse scraped along my skin. My muscles tightened further. \u201cI don\u2019t mind giving my signale when we\u2019re caught up in play that\u2019s gone too far,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cOr when I find my imagination exceeds my appetite.\u201d She tapped me lightly between the shoulder blades with the paddle\u2019s edge, and I flinched. \u201cBut you just weren\u2019t listening to me tonight, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou do make a lovely picture like this.\u201d There was amusement in Sidonie\u2019s voice. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to punish you.\u201d The tawse fell to the carpet with a soft thud. She tugged off the blindfold, tangled her fingers in my hair. I blinked up at her, feeling the heat of her body, breathing in the scent of honeyed musk. \u201cI\u2019d never ask aught from you that you didn\u2019t wish to give freely and joyously, Imriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hush.\u201d She gave my hair a tug, then smiled and touched my lips. \u201cThere will be other times. But as long as you\u2019re on your knees, you may do penance. Lengthy, lengthy penance.\u201d</p><p>That I did, freely and joyously. And she was right. I lost myself in her pleasure and hers alone, worshipping her with lips and tongue until she cried out, fingers clenched in my hair, and I had to grasp her hips to steady her.</p><p>And when it was done, when I couldn\u2019t wring another spasm of pleasure from her, I felt calm and at peace. Mayhap we couldn\u2019t set everything that was wrong in the world to right, but as long as all was well between us, it was enough.</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s grip eased, and she gave a long, shuddering sigh. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><p>Still on my knees, I grinned at her. \u201cYou\u2019re an easy mistress.\u201d</p><p>It was the following day that everything began to converge. Drustan and his escort of Cruithne arrived at last. Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin returned from Montr\u00e8ve. The Queen and Cruarch spent a day closeted in consultation, while I did much the same with my foster-parents.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d Joscelin shook his head. \u201c\u2019Tis too easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t fathom where the risk lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor can I.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre rested her chin on her hand. \u201cHe asked naught but that Ysandre accept Carthage\u2019s tribute? There was no implication that it implied a favor, a bribe?\u201d</p><p>I showed her the letter and my transcription. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>She studied it absently. \u201cWell, mayhap Melisande\u2019s made herself a thorn in Ephesium\u2019s side somehow, and Agallon saw an opportunity to get rid of her and curry favor with Carthage at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why does Carthage have a sudden burning desire to pay tribute to Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d Joscelin asked. \u201cIf this General Astegal does mean to move against Aragonia, does he really think Ysandre can be bribed into looking the other way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might reckon it worth a try,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said. \u201cHistory is full of precedents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a sizable tribute,\u201d I said. \u201cAt least according to Quintilius Rousse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Rousse say about the risk?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s not worried. There are only six ships, lightly armed. He\u2019s got half the Royal Navy holding them at bay. He\u2019s willing to follow them up the Aviline, and recommended Ysandre bring the bulk of the Royal Army inside the walls of the City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t like it,\u201d Joscelin said.</p><p>\u201cBe as that may, my love,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre observed, \u201cwe\u2019re not the ones to choose. We can advise Ysandre to be wary, but Parliament has the final say.\u201d</p><p>It was true, but it was also true that no one with a seat in Parliament\u2014with the exception of me and Sidonie, who had gained a vote upon reaching her majority\u2014knew about the Unseen Guild. I didn\u2019t know if that mattered, if it should play a role in my own decision, and if so, what? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin spoke to Drustan and Ysandre in a private audience. Sidonie and I discussed the matter endlessly. After hours of talking, none of us were any the wiser.</p><p>Ysandre convened Parliament.</p><p>There were seventy-two members all told: ten hereditary seats for each of the seven provinces of Terre d\u2019Ange, the Queen, and her heir. When a sitting regent didn\u2019t have an heir of age, they were allotted two votes. A simple majority of those present would constitute a binding vote. If there was a tie, the regent\u2019s vote decided the matter.</p> <p>It was rare to have the full complement of members present when Parliament was convened, and if the matter was a delicate one, many members chose to abstain; but for that session, we very nearly did. Those unable to attend sent a properly authorized delegate. Word had leaked out across the realm that the Carthaginian tribute was impressive, and curiosity and greed made for a powerful incentive.</p><p>It was an open session in the Hall of Audience, every seat along the long, curved tables filled, and a throng of avid onlookers pressed together in the back of the hall. The place was buzzing like a beehive, but it fell silent when Ysandre, seated at the center of the table, raised her hand.</p><p>\u201cAn offer lies before us,\u201d she announced. \u201cLord Admiral, will you present it?\u201d</p><p>The Palace Guard cleared a path for the Royal Admiral Quintilius Rousse. He strode into the hall with a rolling seafarer\u2019s gait, bluff and hearty despite the grey salting his ruddy hair. There was a chalice tucked under one arm. He swept a deep bow, then placed it on the table before Ysandre.</p><p>\u201cYour majesty, august peers!\u201d His voice boomed in the hall. \u201cI bear greetings from Astegal of Carthage, Prince of the House of Sarkal, appointed General by the Council of Thirty. He wishes to pay tribute to Terre d\u2019Ange on behalf of Carthage.\u201d</p> <p>Ysandre eyed the chalice. It was wrought of translucent red carnelian, the stem shaped like a pair of clasped hands, the base adorned with gold. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Quintilius Rousse cleared his throat. \u201cThere is a letter. May I read it?\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>I knew what it said; Ysandre had already read it, of course, and so had Sidonie.</p><p>\u201cSince I was a boy,\u201d Rousse read aloud, rather badly, \u201cI have longed to see for myself the splendors of Terre d\u2019Ange and its Queen famed for her beauty; and yet, the shadow of misfortune has hung between our two great realms, born of deeds carried out by people too low to mention. I come at the behest of the Council of Thirty, anxious to dispel this shadow and restore amity between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep reading!\u201d someone shouted when he paused.</p> <p>Rousse cleared his throat again. \u201cFor myself, it would suffice to gaze upon the fabled white walls of the City of Elua, and gaze on your face. I dare to present this small token, this chalice, in the hope that the clasped hands wrought thereon might prove emblematic of a restored amity between us.\u201d He squinted, holding the parchment at arm\u2019s length. \u201cIt in itself is a mere token, emblematic of the gifts the Council of Thirty wishes to bequeath to your majesty and her people, to evince the sincerity of Carthage\u2019s desire. These gifts are as follows . . .\u201d</p><p>In his resounding voice, Quintilius Rousse read a long litany of the tribute-gifts that Carthage offered. Gold, gold in abundance. Ivory and salt. Spices, exotic seedlings gathered from many places. Bolts of cloth dyed Tyrian purple. Furniture made of fragrant woods.</p><p>I watched the avid faces of my peers and felt uneasy.</p><p>\u201c. . . and as your majesty\u2019s horologists will doubtless have informed you, a great event is pending. With your permission, my own horologists will consult with yours to show you a great marvel,\u201d Rousse finished.</p><p>Excited murmurs arose.</p><p>\u201cHold!\u201d Ysandre said crisply. \u201cWhat great event?\u201d</p><p>There was a delay, then, while the Court horologist was sent for and found. I listened to the peers gossiping among themselves, stirred by the manifest Quintilius Rousse had recited. At length, the horologist arrived, bowing apologetically.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, your majesty\u2014\u201d he began.</p> <p>Ysandre waved one hand dismissively. \u201cNo doubt you\u2019ve informed me. I\u2019ve been distracted. What event?\u201d</p><p>He was a small fellow, sweating and anxious. \u201cIt is the belief among those of us who study the stars and the planets that in three weeks\u2019 time, the full moon will pass through the earth\u2019s shadow, and its light shall be dimmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has been distracted,\u201d Sidonie murmured beside me.</p><p>\u201cIs this an omen?\u201d Ysandre asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The horologist shook his head. \u201cNo, no, no. Merely a natural phenomenon, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what marvel might we expect to see?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The horologist licked his lips. \u201cAlthough I have not seen it for myself, it is said that the moon takes on extraordinary hues while it lies beneath our shadow. Beyond that, I cannot guess.\u201d A scholar\u2019s hunger surfaced in his features. \u201cAll knowledge is worth having. I would be eager to partake of the wisdom of Carthage\u2019s horologists.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre inclined her head. \u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d she said, adding to Quintilius Rousse, \u201cYou may continue.\u201d</p><p>Rousse read the remainder of the letter aloud: more fulsome compliments, nothing of substance. No indication that this visit was aught but what it purported to be, a grand diplomatic overture. I suppose that was to be expected, and the more subtle overtures would follow if Ysandre accepted Carthage\u2019s tribute. Still, I couldn\u2019t shake a sense of lingering unease.</p><p>A period of open discussion followed, but it was already clear that the promise of extravagant gifts and a marvel to follow had swayed the majority of the peers. There were a few who argued against accepting the offer, fearing it would suggest we meant to abandon our alliance with Aragonia, but others pointed out that, despite Aragonia\u2019s fears, Carthage had not lifted a finger in its direction.</p><p>And there were a few\u2014Barquiel L\u2019Envers among them\u2014who were deeply suspicious of Carthage\u2019s motives.</p><p>\u201cYou know they want something for this, Ysandre,\u201d he said, sounding remarkably practical. \u201cAlliance, a promise of non-interference . . . or somewhat else.\u201d His gaze rested briefly on Sidonie. \u201cWhy not send a delegation to meet with them in Marsilikos and find out what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bound to reveal their hand one way or another,\u201d a Siovalese duchese observed. \u201cHere or there, what does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d L\u2019Envers muttered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t either. For once, I was in agreement with Barquiel L\u2019Envers. Somewhat in this offer didn\u2019t sit right. But it held a promise for me far greater than any gilded treasure or celestial marvel\u2014secret knowledge of my mother\u2019s whereabouts, the ability to cut through the Gordian knot of her intrigues at a single, swift blow instead of spending torturous years trying to unwind it.</p><p>And then it would be done.</p><p>I would be free. Free of her taint, free of her long shadow. Free to wed Sidonie and spend the rest of my life with her without incurring suspicion and bitterness. And she would be free to spend it with me without having to endure the contempt of those who reckoned she was weak enough to have been seduced by the cunning blandishments of a traitor\u2019s son, or an endless series of suits from foreign princes who reckoned her fair game.</p><p>So I voted to accept Carthage\u2019s offer.</p><p>Sidonie did, too.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t have mattered. It wasn\u2019t even close. There were only four votes against acceptance, and seven who abstained. By the time Ysandre cast her vote, it was merely symbolic. She hesitated, conferring quietly with Drustan one last time. Although the Cruarch of Alba had no vote in the Parliament of Terre d\u2019Ange, he always sat at Ysandre\u2019s side to counsel her when he was present. I saw him give his head a slight shake. Like the rest of us, Drustan had been unable to find sufficient cause to spurn Carthage\u2019s overture.</p><p>Ysandre cast her vote for acceptance.</p><p>It was decided.</p><p>Carthage was coming.</p><p>Ten</p><p>A bit over two weeks later, on a bright, sunny day, six Carthaginian tribute-ships sailed up the Aviline River to dock at the wharfs of the City of Elua, preceded fore and aft by D\u2019Angeline war-ships.</p><p>It was a considerable spectacle. The Carthaginian ships had massive sails striped crimson and white, gilded figureheads in the shape of horse-heads, lions, and serpents. Even the railings were elaborately carved. Bare-chested rowers manned the oars, oiled skin gleaming in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cSlaves,\u201d I murmured to Sidonie.</p><p>There was a tall fellow in the prow of the lead ship, clad in a scarlet tunic with a long cloak of Tyrian purple, a slender fillet of gold around his head. Even at a distance, I could see he had strong features. His thick black hair was swept back from his temples, and he wore a narrow beard dyed scarlet.</p><p>\u201cAnd that, I suspect, would be General Astegal,\u201d she commented.</p><p>The ships were docked. Sailors swarmed, securing their moorings. General Astegal bowed deeply in the direction of Ysandre and Drustan, but made no move to disembark. Instead, the rowers laid down their oars and set about unloading chest after chest of tribute.</p><p>The crew came from various nations. Many were olive-skinned Carthaginians. Others were a tawnier hue, and there were Nubians and Jebeans, too, with dusky skin and woolen hair. I touched my rhinoceros-hide sword-belt, thinking of distant places and old friends.</p><p>At last, when the wharf was heaped with treasure, a score of soldiers carrying gilded spears descended from the flagship, saluted the Queen and Cruarch, then formed a double line. Astegal of Carthage, Prince of the House of Sarkal, appointed General of the Council of Thirty, made his approach, sweeping another low bow.</p><p>\u201cWell met, General Astegal,\u201d Ysandre said. \u201cWe welcome you to the City of Elua.\u201d</p><p>Astegal straightened and smiled. His teeth were very white. \u201cI thank you for the honor, your majesty. Carthage thanks you. It is an honor merely to gaze upon you and your fair city.\u201d His D\u2019Angeline was accented, but excellent. He bowed again, this time toward Drustan. \u201cIt is a double honor to be received by the Cruarch of Alba.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall as we are, Alba can but aspire to be the recipient of Carthage\u2019s mighty generosity one day,\u201d Drustan said wryly.</p><p>Astegal laughed. \u201cI pray it may be so, your majesty.\u201d He turned to Sidonie, offering yet another deep bow. \u201cSurely you must be the Dauphine, with your mother\u2019s beauty and your father\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell met, my lord.\u201d Her tone was neutral.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cSo young to be wary of flattery, your highness! I did but speak the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in surpassingly good D\u2019Angeline, too,\u201d she observed.</p><p>He spread his arms as though to embrace the entire City. \u201cIt is as I wrote. I have long dreamed of this moment. I have worked and studied long and hard to bring my dream to fruition.\u201d Turning to me, he gave another bow. \u201cYou, I think, are also a member of the royal family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d I said. \u201cWell met, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel, of course.\u201d Astegal put out his hand, his expression turning grave. \u201cI hope that during my time here, I may make some atonement for the unconscionable acts of my ill-gotten countrymen. And once we have put the past behind us, perhaps you will do me the kindness of showing me your city\u2019s fabled pleasures.\u201d He winked, showed his white teeth in another easy grin. \u201cYou strike me as a young man of good appetite.\u201d</p><p>He had a firm grip and his sword-hand was callused. For all his diplomat\u2019s charm, I thought, this man was a soldier. He was a few inches taller than I, and some ten or twelve years older. Young and ambitious, the rumors had said.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord,\u201d I said politely, wondering if there was some hidden message behind the request. \u201cI do not blame Carthage for the acts of a few miscreants.\u201d</p><p>Astegal smiled. \u201cExcellent!\u201d</p><p>There was a grand procession from the wharfs to the Palace. Behind us, slaves continued to work at unloading the other ships, under the supervision of various Court officials who would attend to the other Carthaginian dignitaries and horologists disembarking, all of it taking place under the watchful eyes of a full contingent of the Royal Army. Commonfolk lined the streets, gazing in awe at the spectacle.</p><p>As we rode in an open carriage, Astegal offered a running litany of praise: for the gracious lay of the City, for the skill of its architects, for the beauty of its folk. Flattery, but it stopped short of unctuousness. He seemed sincere in his praise, glad to be here, at ease in his own skin.</p><p>I tried to read aught beyond it, and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>When we reached the Palace, he fell silent a moment, gazing at it, then gave his head a little shake. \u201cLovely. Who would have thought a structure so vast could hold such grace. Mayhap your majesty will consent to send architects to advise ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarthage comes courting Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s architects?\u201d Ysandre inquired.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Astegal smiled. \u201cAmong other things. Terre d\u2019Ange has grown bolder and more adventurous under your rule, gracious lady, opening its doors to new friendships and alliances, creating strong bonds.\u201d His gaze lingered briefly on Drustan. \u201cIt is my wish that Carthage do the same. There are many ways in which we may profit one another,\u201d he added, and his gaze slid toward Sidonie.</p><p>It made my teeth grate.</p><p>Sidonie didn\u2019t take his gambit. \u201cOur horologists are eager to learn of this celestial marvel you promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He nodded. \u201cYou have the wisdom your gods bequeathed you, but Carthaginian horologists were studying the skies long before your Elua roamed the earth. We may learn much from one another. And if nothing else\u201d\u2014he made a graceful, self-deprecating gesture\u2014\u201cit is my hope that we shall all part as friends, enriched by our mutual interests.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we will,\u201d Sidonie agreed, and I had to stifle a laugh.</p><p>All throughout the day, the Palace bustled with activity. Tribute-gifts were carted and displayed in the great hall, dignitaries, horologists, soldiers, and slaves were lodged, tables were laid, harried servants hurried on endless errands. There was to be a grand f\u00eate that night with over a hundred peers of the realm, a handful of Cruithne, and all of the Carthaginian dignitaries and horologists attending. Astegal had expressed the hope that he and Ysandre would share a drink from the carnelian chalice, pledging one another\u2019s health and toasting to the shared future of our nations. He had also promised one final tribute-gift, a surprise not listed in the manifest and kept veiled until the f\u00eate.</p><p>\u201cDo you truly intend to prowl the Night Court with him?\u201d Sidonie asked in the bath, as we began to prepare for the evening\u2019s festivities, enjoying what was likely to be our last time alone together for many hours.</p> <p>I grinned at her. \u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cCurious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can play escort without partaking if need be.\u201d I caught her arms and tugged her toward me. Water sloshed over the edges of the tub. \u201cIf he\u2019s an agent of the Guild, it may be he\u2019s seeking a private moment.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie settled atop me. \u201cWhat do you make of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d I clasped her buttocks, shifting her to gain a better angle. She made a small, satisfied sound as I entered her. \u201cYou?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her hips rose and fell, slow and delicious. \u201cI don\u2019t dislike him. I expected to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t agree to wed him,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>Sidonie laughed and kissed me. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Afterward, clean and dried and dressed in finery, we attended the f\u00eate. It was a gorgeous affair, albeit a chaotic one. Very few of the Carthaginians spoke D\u2019Angeline. Punic was their native tongue, although all in attendance spoke Hellene, which was used as a common tongue among traders. Many of the D\u2019Angelines spoke Hellene, but not all, and none of the Cruithne did.</p><p>As a result, conversations were difficult, and those of us who did speak Hellene were often forced to do double duty, making introductions and translating. My Hellene was good; one advantage of being Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay\u2019s foster-son was that I\u2019d been taught to read and speak in a number of tongues. Still, it was exhausting, and I will own I felt relieved when a plump Carthaginian fellow hovering near the veiled treasure introduced himself to me in D\u2019Angeline.</p><p>\u201cI am Jabnit of the House of Philosir,\u201d he announced with an exacting little bow. \u201cAnd I have already learned you are Prince Imriel. Well met, your highness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell met, my lord,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cOh, no lord!\u201d His black eyes twinkled. \u201cMerely a well-connected merchant.\u201d Jabnit patted his considerable belly. \u201cWell-connected and well-fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo well-fed,\u201d a light voice said in amusement.</p><p>\u201cSunjata!\u201d The merchant glanced around. \u201cCome meet the prince.\u201d</p><p>A young Nubian man stepped around him and bowed gracefully. He was of middling height and slender, with plum-dark skin and gently rounded features. \u201cIt is an honor, your highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunjata is my assistant.\u201d Jabnit patted his shoulder with the same comfortable familiarity with which he\u2019d patted his own stomach. \u201cTell the prince of our role in this venture. I spy a servant with a laden platter of delicacies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho will care for me if you stuff your belly to bursting, you old glutton?\u201d Sunjata asked, but there was fondness in it. \u201cGo, go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour role?\u201d I asked politely as the merchant waddled away.</p> <p>\u201cThe House of Philosir provided the gems for the gift to be unveiled this evening.\u201d Sunjata looked at me under his lashes. \u201cAt a considerable discount, for the privilege of being part of this excursion. But surely you cannot be interested in that.\u201d</p><p>Somewhat in his manner, in the smoothness of his skin, in the light timbre of his voice struck an old chord of memory in me. I had known eunuchs in Dar\u0161anga.</p><p>My reaction was subtle, but Sunjata read it. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said with a seeming ease that didn\u2019t quite belie the bitterness beneath it. \u201cThere is something we share in common, is there not? I too fell into the hands of Carthage\u2019s slavers as a boy. Only in my case, the effects were more . . . lasting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>His slender shoulders moved in a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge you your manhood. \u2019Tis no fault of yours that mine was taken. And I am a free man these past few years, insofar as I may call myself a man. Jabnit is a fair patron.\u201d He gazed after the merchant, then back at me. \u201cAnd I am rude and insolent,\u201d he said, putting out his hand. \u201cThank you for your kindness.\u201d</p><p>I took his hand. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand, his thumb pressing on mine. I glanced down involuntarily. Sunjata sported a silver signet ring on his thumb, a lamp carved on the seal. \u201cPerhaps we will speak again later,\u201d he said, releasing my hand. With one deft, unobtrusive gesture, he twisted the ring, hiding the seal against his palm.</p><p>I met his gaze. \u201cI would like that.\u201d</p><p>For the balance of the evening, my thoughts were in a whirl. Exactly what I had expected of the Unseen Guild, I couldn\u2019t say, but it wasn\u2019t a eunuch in the employ of a gem-merchant.</p><p>And the night only got stranger.</p><p>A sumptuous meal was served, although I ate without tasting, distracted by my own thoughts and the sight of Astegal, several seats away, paying court to Sidonie in a manner light-handed enough to be inoffensive. She was being pleasant without encouraging him. Elua knows, it wasn\u2019t that I was worried about her loyalties, but I was on edge, and it only made me edgier.</p><p>Fortunately, I was seated across from the Chief Horologist, who spun a tale compelling enough to prevent anyone from noticing my distraction. He was a kinsman of Astegal\u2019s; Bodeshmun was his name. Another tall fellow, older, grave, and serious, with deep-set eyes and a long black beard. In a sonorous voice, he described the promised marvel, in which twelve silver-backed mirrors were to be placed around the walls of the City, and one great mirror in the very center.</p><p>\u201cWhen the moon is wholly obscured,\u201d he said, \u201cthe light is such that when one gazes into the great mirror, one sees reflected all that is hidden between the stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not simply gaze at the sky itself?\u201d Tibault de Toluard inquired, knitting his brows in perplexity. He was a Siovalese lord with a considerable knowledge of science. \u201cWhy use a mirror? Surely a reflection is less true than the thing itself.\u201d</p><p>Bodeshmun turned his head. \u201cSilver has the quality of revealing much that is hidden. Have you not found it to be so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot especially,\u201d the Marquis de Toluard said frankly.</p><p>The horologist smiled into his beard. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat may we expect to see, my lord?\u201d Roxanne de Mereliot, the Lady of Marsilikos, asked with interest.</p><p>\u201cAh, no!\u201d Bodeshmun laughed deep in his chest. \u201cI will not spoil the surprise, my lady. Let the secrets of the cosmos reveal themselves.\u201d</p><p>After the meal was concluded, at least one secret was revealed. Ysandre, good-natured, acceded to Astegal\u2019s request, at least in part. They both drank to one another\u2019s health from the carnelian chalice, although she stopped short of toasting the shared future of Carthage and Terre d\u2019Ange. Astegal seemed pleased nonetheless. He called for the veiled treasure to be brought forth. The silk draped over the large square frame was whisked away to reveal what appeared at first glance to be a painting in a gilded frame.</p><p>A painting that glittered.</p><p>Not pigment, but ground gems in pure form, used with exacting care. It depicted a tall, black-haired man with a scarlet beard and a blonde woman, standing before a tree, their hands clasped in friendship.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d Ysandre said, sounding surprised. \u201cIt is surpassingly lovely.\u201d</p><p>Astegal bowed. \u201cAs are you and your land, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down the table toward where Ph\u00e8dre was seated. In the midst of this polyglot mayhem, I\u2019d not had a chance to speak with her or Joscelin all night. Her head was tilted and she wore a faint, familiar frown, as though she were listening for the strains of a distant sound no one else could hear. But when I caught her eye, she merely shook her head, perplexed.</p><p>I knew the feeling.</p><p>The gem-painting was placed on an easel in a position of honor. The tables had been cleared of all plates and platters, but the wine and cordial flowed freely. And I found myself approached for a second time that evening.</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel.\u201d A hawk-nosed Carthaginian I\u2019d not met earlier approached. He bowed deeply, addressing me in Hellene. \u201cI am Gillimas of the House of Hiram, magistrate to the Council of Thirty.\u201d He placed a gilded, gem-studded coffer on the table. \u201cIt is our wish to present this small token to you in acknowledgment of the unpleasantness you endured at the hands of our countrymen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d I said.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA small token. The wood is cypress from the isle of Cythera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCythera?\u201d I echoed.</p><p>\u201cThe fragrance alone tells the tale,\u201d Gillimas said.</p><p>I opened the coffer. The inner lid was also worked in gold, but the coffer itself was bare wood. The scent of cypress wafted out, and from the inside of the lid, the image of a lamp leapt out at me. Both caught at my memories. A barrel outside an incense-maker\u2019s shop, Canis the beggar giving me a clay medallion with a lamp on it.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>\u201cOh, it is nothing, nothing.\u201d Gillimas made a dismissive gesture. \u201cA mere token, fit for storing letters.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers over the edge of the coffer\u2019s lid, feeling for hidden messages. There were none. \u201cIt gives a pleasant aroma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cypresses of Cythera are legendary,\u201d he agreed. \u201cHave you been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Cythera?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gillimas favored me with a careless smile. \u201cMayhap you should go.\u201d</p><p>I closed the lid. \u201cMy thanks. I\u2019ll think on it.\u201d</p><p>His smile deepened. \u201cDo.\u201d</p><p>The evening wore on and on, into the small hours. I did my part, conversing pleasantly in several tongues with myriad people, trying to collect my reeling thoughts. Out of the corner of my eye, I kept a lookout for the eunuch Sunjata, but it seemed he had been present only to attend his merchant-patron. All along the edges of the great hall, Carthaginian treasure sparkled. Ysandre had pledged to divide it among the members of Parliament.</p><p>Everyone was happy.</p><p>My skin crawled.</p><p>I wanted . . . what? I didn\u2019t know. I wanted a moment alone with Gillimas, with Sunjata, a chance to shake the truth from them. I got neither. I wanted to talk to Ph\u00e8dre. Cythera. It made sense. A small isle, but it had been ruled in its time by many different folk. Hellas. Ephesium. I\u2019d never been able to place Canis\u2019 accent, his history. It had held somewhat of both.</p><p>Gillimas made sense as a member of the Guild.</p><p>So who the hell was Sunjata?</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d In her chambers, in the bed we shared, Sidonie propped herself on one elbow and regarded me, her unbound hair falling over her shoulders. \u201cDid you learn aught this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSun Princess,\u201d I murmured, running a lock through my fingers. \u201cYes and no. I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d She bowed her head, her hair trailing over my skin, her lips tracing a line of kisses along the pink scars that furrowed my torso. \u201cSleep. We\u2019ll sort it out in the morning, you and I.\u201d</p><p>Love.</p><p>Loss.</p><p>My fingers tightened on her. \u201cGods, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie yawned, settling her head on my shoulder, fitting her body to mine, where it belonged. \u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whispered, wrapping her in my arms. \u201cAh, Elua. Please.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cCythera,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Joscelin asked.</p><p>\u201cPtolemy Dikaios\u2019 wife was Cytheran,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAnd we know Melisande was in league with him.\u201d</p><p>Joscelin eyed her. \u201cYou do keep an ungodly amount of information stored in that beautiful head, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecious little else regarding Cythera, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cExcept that it\u2019s an Akkadian holding. Mayhap the Khalif will prove willing to assist us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming my mother actually is there,\u201d I said. \u201cElua! I wish these damned people would speak plainly.\u201d</p><p>After talking with Sidonie, I\u2019d sent a polite message to Gillimas asking if he could tell me aught more about the coffer\u2019s history. I\u2019d received a prompt, polite message in reply saying no, he was unable to tell me more, but if I wished, he would be honored to speak with me regarding any other matter. And I\u2019d sent a message to Sunjata asking if I could meet with him regarding a commission of gem-stones, and received a polite reply saying that he and his employer were busy assisting the horologists with their preparations, but that he would be honored to meet with me after the spectacle, which was to take place three days hence.</p><p>It was enough to drive me mad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can learn about Cythera,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre promised.</p><p>\u201cBe discreet,\u201d I said.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAren\u2019t I always?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend Ti-Philippe down to the wharf taverns to sound out Rousse\u2019s sailor-lads,\u201d Joscelin suggested. \u201cHe\u2019s always glad of a chance to drink and dice with sailors, and they trade gossip from ports all over the world. Since all of Terre d\u2019Ange knows we\u2019re trying to find Melisande, no one will find it suspicious, although he might want to get them good and drunk before he steers the conversation toward Cythera.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ph\u00e8dre blinked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cCredit a lifetime of listening to your intrigues.\u201d</p><p>Ti-Philippe agreed readily. He\u2019d been a sailor himself once, long ago, under Rousse\u2019s command.</p> <p>Beyond that, there wasn\u2019t much to be done at the moment. Sidonie reported the latest developments to her mother, who replied that the matter would have to wait for discussion until the Carthaginian delegation had departed. For my part, if I found I had no choice but to strike out for Cythera on the dubious message implied in Gillimas\u2019 gift, I damned well wasn\u2019t going to do it until the Carthaginians were gone.</p><p>They made me nervous.</p><p>The day after the f\u00eate, Astegal had a private meeting with Ysandre and Drustan. He made a candid offer for Sidonie\u2019s hand, pointing out that a strategic alliance between Terre d\u2019Ange, Alba, and Carthage would make for an axis of unparalleled power in the west.</p><p>\u201cWith Aragonia caught betwixt and between,\u201d I observed when Sidonie told me, having gotten a full accounting from Ysandre.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCarthage dreams of empire. He didn\u2019t deny it. Mother says he pointed out\u2014very smoothly\u2014that under pressure from three strong nations, Aragonia could easily agree to become a vassal state without a drop of blood spilled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAha!\u201d I said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what this is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d She looked troubled. \u201cThere was the implication that matters could go very differently if we declined this offer, and that the blood of slain Aragonians would be on Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s conscience.\u201d</p><p>I whistled softly. \u201cThat\u2019s damn nigh blackmail. Aragonia was right to be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t quite say it,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cBut it was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempted?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she said, but her expression was still troubled. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . Elua! If it comes to that\u2014and I pray it doesn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m bound to think it now.\u201d She took my hand, twisting the knotted gold ring I wore. \u201cWhat if I could have averted it? How many more people have to die for our happiness?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d I caught her fingers, stilling them. \u201cIt happened last time because we didn\u2019t trust ourselves. Will you risk betraying Blessed Elua\u2019s precept a second time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what else Astegal said?\u201d She laughed humorlessly. \u201cHe said it had come to his attention that I had already taken a lover. He said that he had the utmost respect for the customs of Terre d\u2019Ange, and that if I wished to surround myself with a bevy of beautiful young men, he had no objection so long as I took care not to conceive aught but heirs of his blood.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he did.\u201d She was silent a moment. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Terre d\u2019Ange cannot allow itself to be coerced into betraying its allies and supporting Carthage\u2019s imperial aspirations. It\u2019s just . . . ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d I agreed. \u201cWhat did Ysandre say to him?\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully. \u201cShe told him that while Terre d\u2019Ange has indeed grown less insular under her rule, D\u2019Angelines hold their descendance from Blessed Elua and his Companions as a sacred trust. That it was already a matter of considerable concern that her heir was half-Cruithne, and that she couldn\u2019t possibly betray that trust further by seeing me wed to aught but a pure-blooded D\u2019Angeline, or the peers of the realm would rise in rebellion.\u201d</p><p>I stroked her hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Sidonie shrugged. \u201cIt was the best response in diplomatic terms. It may even be true. Father backed her.\u201d She gave a quick smile. \u201cShe said beyond that, he didn\u2019t say much. Just sat and listened with that quiet, deadly look on his face that makes grown men squirm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that look,\u201d I said. \u201cDid Astegal squirm?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot much. He\u2019s a cool one. He thanked them for hearing his offer, expressed hopes that whatever the future held, these new friendships would continue . . . the usual diplomatic pap, all very cordial. No further mention of bloodshed in Aragonia. Mother\u2019s chosen to keep this quiet for now. She\u2019ll take counsel with Parliament after Astegal\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d I thought about it. \u201cI\u2019ll be glad when this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will I,\u201d Sidonie murmured. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like thinking about what comes next. I wish those damned Guild people weren\u2019t so secretive and evasive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish the whole lot of them would fall into the sea and take my damned mother with them,\u201d I said, and she laughed.</p><p>The following day, I found myself with diplomatic duties of my own. It seemed Astegal had been entirely sincere in his desire to sample the pleasures of the Night Court, and in desiring my company while so doing.</p><p>We set out from the Palace in the early hours of the evening; Astegal and I and a half dozen other Carthaginian lords, escorted by a score of Sidonie\u2019s guardsmen. It was to have been the Queen\u2019s Guard escorting us, but Claude de Monluc had intervened and come to an arrangement.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d I\u2019d told him. \u201cIt\u2019s not your duty.\u201d</p><p>Claude had leveled a hard gaze at me. \u201cPalace gossip says this Astegal\u2019s made a bid for her highness\u2019 hand. He knows she\u2019s in love with you. No, I\u2019m not your man, but I\u2019m Sidonie\u2019s, and I know for a surety she doesn\u2019t want you dead by mysterious misadventure. I\u2019m not willing to entrust this duty to men whose loyalties are uncertain.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou sound like Joscelin.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI wish!\u201d</p><p>We went first to Eglantine House, where we were treated to an extraordinary feast, entertained all the while by dancers, tumblers, singers, and musicians of surpassing skill. Several of the Carthaginian lords succumbed to their charms. I explained to them in Hellene the laws regarding consensuality, to which they readily agreed, and after which I made arrangements with the Dowayne. Astegal reclined on a couch, taking it all in through half-slitted eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou lead a good life here,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cWe do, my lord,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut what passes here is sacred, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His gaze slid sideways toward me. \u201cNo doubt you heard of the offer I made. I hope you do not take it amiss.\u201d</p><p>I spread my hands. \u201cPolitics.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNothing more.\u201d</p><p>After Eglantine House, we went to Bryony. Dusk had fallen and the evening was balmy, the air soft on one\u2019s skin. Gillimas of Hiram was one of the lords attending this night\u2019s venture. I was hoping by the night\u2019s end he would be sufficiently drunk to speak candidly to me. At Bryony House, where money is reckoned an aphrodisiac, I bribed an adept to see that his winecup was never empty.</p><p>It was a good investment. The Carthaginians, who had built an empire on trade and lost it through military overreach, loved Bryony House. They were willing to wager on anything: who could out-drink the other, which lean-muscled, oiled adept might wrestle the other into submission, whether or not an adept could peel an apple in a single, coiling strip. And they had a fine time doing it, encouraged all the while by Bryony\u2019s adepts.</p><p>\u201cYou fatten our purses at Carthage\u2019s expense,\u201d commented Janelle n\u00f3 Bryony, the Dowayne. \u201cMy thanks.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her. \u201cYou fattened mine, once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She traced a finger down my chest. Once upon a time, the Dowayne of Bryony House had lost a bet to me. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know your heart was given elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor did I.\u201d I caught her hand, halting its progress. \u201cNow I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re faithful to her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUnless requested to be otherwise,\u201d I said, thinking of Amarante.</p><p>Janelle n\u00f3 Bryony laughed and kissed me. \u201cYou inspire us, Prince Imriel. The Night Court stands behind you.\u201d Her eyes sparkled. \u201cAnd if there is any truth in gossip, it may be that her highness will not prove adverse to certain adventures in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>An idea was beginning to take shape in my mind. There had been debate over which of the Houses to visit. Astegal had wished to experience the genius of Eglantine House and the carnival atmosphere of Bryony. After some deliberation, he had settled on Jasmine House for our final destination.</p><p>The central tenet of Jasmine House was pure, unadulterated sensuality. It was palpable, too. It struck like a wave the minute one was ushered into the salon of reception. It was an undulating space, filled with semiprivate niches. The floor was piled with thick Akkadian carpets and massive cushions on which patrons and adepts reclined. Fretted lamps hung low from the ceiling, wrought with images of love-making. Incense and opium burned in tiny braziers, and servants circulated with wine, cordials, and delicacies.</p><p>With the assistance of Claude de Monluc, I got the Carthaginians settled in a niche, happily drinking wine and reviewing those adepts willing and available to serve them, and begged a private word with the Dowayne, Yolande Caradas.</p><p>\u201cI have a great boon to ask, my lady,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Her brows rose. She was a stunning woman, with perfectly straight black hair that fell to her waist, and a mouth made for sin. \u201cI\u2019m . . . curious.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never heard anyone invest so much sensuality into so few syllables. It made the room feel hot. \u201cThat man, the hawk-nosed fellow.\u201d I nodded slightly toward Gillimas. \u201cI wish to have a quiet word with him without General Astegal\u2019s knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Yolande asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201c\u2019Tis a matter of state I cannot reveal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCovertcy.\u201d Her generous mouth curved. \u201cHe seems quite taken with Marielle. I\u2019ll have her fetch you to her chamber when they have concluded their pleasure. Will that suffice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m in your debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice place to have you,\u201d Yolande Caradas said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the Carthaginians had made their selections. Astegal was ambitious; he\u2019d chosen two adepts, a dark-haired girl with smoldering eyes, and a young man with full lips and a wiry panther\u2019s grace. They seemed pleased at being selected. I had to own, he wasn\u2019t a bad-looking man, and I might have found him charming if I didn\u2019t know about his ambitions and his veiled threats.</p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019re not abstaining,\u201d he said to me, his arms slung around the adepts\u2019 shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI am, my lord,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019ll await you here.\u201d</p><p>Astegal shrugged. \u201cHow very unlike a D\u2019Angeline.\u201d</p><p>I met his gaze squarely. \u201cYou don\u2019t know us as well as you reckon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He smiled lazily. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll know you better after tonight, eh? At least two of you.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head. \u201cNaamah\u2019s grace be on you.\u201d</p><p>One by one, they retired to private chambers, all except a certain Lord Mintho, who had fallen asleep and was snoring peacefully on the cushions. He\u2019d been one of those who had taken his pleasure at Eglantine House, so I didn\u2019t reckon he\u2019d be too sorry in the morning. All of them were fairly well drunk except mayhap Astegal, and I was pleased to see that Gillimas was weaving on his feet as he left, the girl Marielle laughing and tugging his hand.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have that long to wait. A good deal less than an hour had passed before Marielle came to fetch me. Claude gave me a sharp look. I put my hand over his mouth before he could speak.</p><p>\u201cState business,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI need to talk to him without Astegal\u2019s knowledge and I can\u2019t do it at Court. There are things he may be willing to tell us about Carthage\u2019s true intentions. As you value your commission in the Guard, keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Claude gave a slow nod. I took my hand away, rose, and followed the girl.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not get much out of him,\u201d she said when we reached the inner corridors, her tone smug. \u201cHe\u2019s snoring like a babe.\u201d Marielle tossed her hair. \u201cPatrons shouldn\u2019t come to Jasmine House wine-sotted. They tire too quickly for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they do.\u201d I smiled at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll wake him. What of General Astegal?\u201d</p><p>Marielle glanced down the corridor. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a man knows what he\u2019s about. By the sound of it, he\u2019ll be busy awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d I fished in the purse at my belt for two gold ducats. \u201cThis is for your assistance,\u201d I said, giving her one. \u201cAnd this is for your silence.\u201d I fixed her with a stern look. \u201cLord Gillimas\u2019 life could be in danger if Astegal learns he\u2019s provided us with secret information. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, chastened.</p><p>I kissed her cheek. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>I let myself into her bedchamber, closing the door quietly behind me. Gillimas was sprawled on the bed, mouth open and snoring. I picked up one of the pillows strewn about and took a deep breath, approaching the bedside. In one swift motion, I straddled him and shoved the pillow over the lower part of his face.</p><p>Gillimas woke thrashing and terrified, uttering muffled cries. I pinned his arms with my knees and pushed hard against the pillow. His chest heaved and his fear-stricken gaze found my face.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d I said in Hellene. \u201cBecause you will die if you don\u2019t. You\u2019re in the Night Court of Terre d\u2019Ange, Gillimas, surrounded by my allies, escorted by my men. I can smother you here in this bed, and the girl will swear your heart gave out during love-making. Understand?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His bare feet flailed ineffectually against the bedding.</p><p>\u201cStruggle if you like.\u201d I leaned more weight on the pillow. \u201cYou think Jasmine House isn\u2019t used to hearing a few odd thumps and cries? All I want is a straight answer in plain language. Will you give it?\u201d</p><p>He did struggle awhile longer, but he was growing weaker. At length his eyelids flickered in a way I took to indicate assent. I eased the pressure on the pillow. \u201cI\u2019ll let you breathe,\u201d I said. \u201cBut one shout, one lie, one evasion, and it\u2019s over. You have one chance. Understand?\u201d</p> <p>There was a pause before Gillimas\u2019 lids flickered again.</p><p>I lifted the pillow a few inches. \u201cIs my mother on Cythera?\u201d</p><p>He drew a long, ragged gasp of air. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>I held the pillow at the ready. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGovernor\u2019s mistress,\u201d he croaked. \u201cPaphos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I sat back on my heels and regarded him, setting the pillow aside. \u201cName of Elua, man! That wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d I clambered off him. \u201cWhy in the seven hells didn\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot how the Guild works,\u201d Gillimas said shortly. He glared at me, his chest rising and falling hard. \u201cNot with outsiders.\u201d</p><p>I helped him sit upright. \u201cWell, it ought to be.\u201d</p><p>He smiled bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>It was a long night.</p> <p>I had to credit Astegal; he got his money\u2019s worth. It was near dawn when he emerged, looking heavy-lidded and pleased with himself. And in fairness, the adepts he\u2019d chosen seemed pleased enough. The Dowayne was pleased; I\u2019d given her a generous donation for her assistance. I daresay everyone was pleased except Lord Mintho, grumbling sleepily over missed opportunities, and Gillimas of Hiram, although he gave no indication of it.</p><p>For my part, I was delighted.</p><p>My mother was in Paphos on the isle of Cythera, mistress to the Governor. I had the information I needed. Now all I needed to do was figure out how to act on it without tipping my hand. Ysandre had promised assistance, and I meant to hold her to it.</p><p>I was a little concerned about Gillimas, but not overly. He was a Guildsman and a magistrate of considerable standing, and he\u2019d been careless. I doubt my bluff would have worked if I hadn\u2019t caught him unaware, sotted, sated, and sleeping, but I had and it did. He could admit to it, or he could keep his mouth shut and let the Unseen Guild believe I\u2019d assembled the cryptic pieces of their puzzle myself. If I was lucky, mayhap Ti-Philippe\u2019s inquiries would turn up somewhat that would lend credence to the notion.</p><p>Either way, I knew.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bear to wait. With dawn breaking over the Palace, I woke Sidonie and told her, watching her sleepy eyes widen in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth it,\u201d I said. \u201cI got the idea in Bryony House when I realized that for once I was surrounded by supporters and loyal guards. It was the perfect time to bluff.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her tousled head. \u201cWhat if Gillimas had called it?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cWell, it would have put him in the position of having to explain why I was trying to smother him in a D\u2019Angeline pleasure-house without exposing the Guild. I daresay that thought flashed through his mind, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Sidonie murmured. \u201cIt was a big risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut now we know. And as soon as these damned Carthaginians stage their damned horologists\u2019 celestial mirror-show and leave, we\u2019ll all sit down, pool our knowledge of Cythera, and make a plan.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie frowned. \u201cWhat about the eunuch? What was his name? Sunjata?\u201d</p><p>I flopped down on the bed beside her and closed my eyes, feeling weariness from the long night settling into my bones. \u201cTo hell with the eunuch. If he has a message for me, let him deliver it. I\u2019m not chasing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he is rather fetching,\u201d she said with unexpected humor.</p><p>I cracked one eye open. \u201cNot half as fetching as you, Princess. By the way, the Dowayne of Bryony House expressed the hope that you and I will partake in certain adventures in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Sidonie leaned down and kissed me. \u201cLet\u2019s get our future in order first.\u201d</p><p>The horologists\u2019 spectacle was to take place on the morrow. The mood in the City was festive, and the City itself was ungodly crowded. An unwarranted number of peers had chosen to stay to witness the spectacle. Scientists and engineers poured into the City, many from Siovale, skeptical but curious. Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion had the entire Royal Army billeted within the walls of the City. Quintilius Rousse had a dozen war-ships anchored in the Aviline River, and his lads thronged the taverns.</p><p>It seemed like the only preeminent figure not in the City was Barquiel L\u2019Envers, who had withdrawn in disgust to his estate in Namarre, having never abandoned his opposition to the Carthaginian delegation. Even the other members of Parliament who\u2019d opposed it had lingered, drawn by curiosity. Not L\u2019Envers. In truth, I didn\u2019t blame him, but I welcomed his absence nonetheless.</p><p>The day before the spectacle, Sidonie and I rode out to observe the preparations, accompanied by her guard.</p><p>I must own, I was at least a little curious. The event itself was to take place in Elua\u2019s Square, the exact center of the City. The horologist Bodeshmun was there, overseeing the placement of the great mirror, directly in front of the ancient oak tree said to have been planted by Blessed Elua himself.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said absently, making a measurement with a piece of string on which a bead was strung. \u201cNo, no, no! It must be perfectly level.\u201d</p><p>Slaves groaned, lifting the mirror from its tripodal base. One crawled beneath it, adjusting the tripod, and the mirror was lowered again.</p><p>\u201cThat is one damnably big mirror,\u201d Claude de Monluc observed.</p><p>It was. I gauged its diameter as at least five armspans\u2019 length; a vast pool of silver, reflecting sky and oak leaves. There were symbols worked around the silver rim, representing the twelve Houses of the Cosmos.</p><p>Bodeshmun measured again and grunted. \u201cBetter.\u201d He glanced down at one of the symbols, then strode a few paces, an unlikely figure in his black beard and a long robe. He raised his thumb, sighting along an unseen line. Half a league away, atop the white walls of the City, an answering mirror flashed. Bodeshmun squinted at his thumb. \u201cTwo degrees west,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cSend a runner.\u201d</p><p>One of the slaves departed at a run. We lingered, watching, while the process was repeated, then began anew with the next symbol.</p><p>\u201cIt seems a complicated business, my lord,\u201d Sidonie said at length, still seated astride her white palfrey.</p><p>\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d Bodeshmun glanced up at her from beneath heavy brows, then gave a short, perfunctory bow. A multifaceted green gem that hung on a chain around his neck swung briefly into view, catching the sunlight. \u201cThe secrets of the heavens do not reveal themselves easily,\u201d he said in his deep voice. \u201cOne must be diligent and exacting. But I promise, you will find the results well worthwhile.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cI\u2019m sure I shall.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in a way that made my flesh prickle. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since we\u2019d become lovers, Sidonie and I argued that day. All the way back to the Palace, we quarrelled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d I said. \u201cCan\u2019t you talk Ysandre into calling it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what grounds?\u201d Sidonie asked reasonably.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d My voice rose in frustration. \u201cIt smells bad, Sidonie. I don\u2019t know why. I just know it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d Her back was very straight in the saddle. \u201cHalf the realm is here to observe this. We need some evidence of bad faith on the part of Carthage to deny them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstegal\u2019s intentions\u2014\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cWere spoken plainly.\u201d Sidonie scowled at me. \u201cImriel, I don\u2019t like it either. But we\u2019ve accepted their gifts. We\u2019ve heard their suit, and they accepted our refusal with seeming good will. If Carthage does move against Aragonia, yes, everything changes. But they haven\u2019t, not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will,\u201d I said darkly.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAnd we will deal with it when they do. What are you afraid of, Imriel? The City is bursting at the seams, filled with our soldiers and sailors. What can Carthage possibly do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s what scares me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop scaring me!\u201d she retorted.</p><p>We were irritable enough with one another that when Sidonie answered a summons from her mother on returning to the Palace, I went to the Hall of Games to distract myself. I found Mavros playing piquet with Julien Trente and a young Siovalese baron, and joined them. I played badly and lost rather more money than I\u2019d intended by the time the game broke up many hours later.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your problem?\u201d Mavros inquired after Julien and young Baron d\u2019Albert had departed for the Night Court, purses fat with my coin.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cThis business with Carthage has me on edge. I just want it to be over.\u201d We were drinking wine, and I swirled my cup, scowling into it. \u201cI asked Sidonie to have her mother call off the spectacle. She refused. We argued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Mavros asked.</p><p>\u201cWe never argue,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit odd in and of itself, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shrugged again. \u201cWe did enough of it growing up. Not now. It feels wrong.\u201d</p><p>Mavros sighed. \u201cLook around you, Imri. The City\u2019s full to bursting with folk eager to see the spectacle. Our new Siovalese friend was fair twitching with excitement. Carthage has been generous. What do you expect?\u201d His voice softened. \u201cGo tell Sidonie you\u2019re sorry and make it up with her. You\u2019re lousy company when you\u2019re brooding.\u201d</p><p>I stood. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cGood man.\u201d</p><p>Halfway to Sidonie\u2019s quarters, I was met by Alfonse, who had been sent to fetch me.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I said when I entered the salon. \u201cI came to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said at the same moment.</p><p>\u201c\u2014came to say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I finished. Both of us laughed. I reached out my hand. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Sidonie twined her fingers in mine. \u201cSomewhat about this sits wrong, and Mother agrees. She wouldn\u2019t have Ghislain and the entire army here if she didn\u2019t. But I asked, and there\u2019s simply no cause to cancel without reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cMavros said the same thing. He also thinks it\u2019s odd that we never quarrel.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will when we can afford the luxury. Right now, we\u2019ve got the entire realm doing our quarrelling for us.\u201d</p><p>I slid my hands around her waist, drawing her against me. \u201cWhat shall we quarrel about when that blessed day arrives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Sidonie looped her arms around my neck, gazing up at me. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find something. Everyone does.\u201d</p><p>I kissed her, long and deep. \u201cWe\u2019re not everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d Her arms tightened around my neck. \u201cImriel, will you take me to bed? No games tonight, just us.\u201d</p><p>I scooped her into my arms. \u201cLove, I will do anything you wish.\u201d</p><p>We made love for a long time that night, until the almost-full moon stood high above the balcony outside her bedchamber, silver light spilling through the open doors and drenching our bed. Afterward, we lay for a time watching it, both of us wondering. Wondering what lay in the spaces between the stars. Wondering what the morrow would bring, and wondering what would follow.</p><p>At length, Sidonie rolled over to face me. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said. Her shadowed eyes were wide and grave, and the moonlight behind her pinned a silvery halo on her love-tangled hair. \u201cVery, very much.\u201d</p><p>Elua, she made my heart ache.</p><p>I wound a lock of her hair around my fingers, feeling it catch on my knotted gold ring; a living echo of the gilded cord that bound us together. \u201cAlways,\u201d I said. \u201cAlways and always.\u201d</p><p>Despite my misgivings, I slept soundly that night.</p><p>I woke with a vague memory of my dreams, of beseeching Hyacinthe to fill the night sky with clouds that they might blot out the moon and ruin the Carthaginian horologists\u2019 spectacle. For the space of a few heartbeats, between sleeping and waking, I thought it was true, and my heart grew lighter. But then I opened my eyes to find the bedchamber filled with sunlight, and Sidonie, fully dressed, standing at the end of the bed and regarding me with amusement.</p><p>\u201cLazy boy,\u201d she said with affection.</p><p>I smiled at her and patted the bed. \u201cCome back and join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Sidonie said ruefully, shaking her head. Gold shivered and glinted. Her hair was coiled in a coronet and she was wearing the earrings I\u2019d given her for\u2014Elua!\u2014her seventeenth birthday, it had been. Golden suns, miniatures of the pendant she\u2019d worn on the Longest Night the time I\u2019d first kissed her. \u201cI\u2019m to attend a meeting between General Astegal and the Euskerri delegation.\u201d</p><p>I yawned and stretched. \u201cAre the Euskerri intriguing with Carthage now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying.\u201d She eyed me. \u201cYou needn\u2019t look so tempting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis scarred thing?\u201d I asked flippantly, gesturing at my body.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cThat very one.\u201d She stooped to kiss me, her lips lingering on mine. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a strange day and it passed slowly. I felt caught between warring moods, my apprehension at odds with last night\u2019s tenderness, and all of it overshadowed by the vast change looming on the horizon.</p><p>I dined that afternoon at Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s townhouse. I didn\u2019t tell the whole story of how I\u2019d coerced Gillimas, but I reported what I\u2019d learned from him. In turn, I learned from Ph\u00e8dre that the Governor of Cythera was one Ptolemy Solon, a kinsman of the Pharaoh of Menekhet, although he ruled under the auspices of Khebbel-im-Akkad.</p><p>And I learned from Ti-Philippe, when he joined us a bit later, that there were rumors among the sailors about the Governor\u2019s mistress.</p> <p>\u201cThe same story?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe Bella Donna?\u201d</p><p>Ti-Philippe pursed his lips thoughtfully. \u201cNot exactly. But the isle of Cythera was once sacred to the Hellenes as the home of their goddess of love and desire. It is rumored that her likeness has returned in mortal flesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be your mother,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said calmly.</p><p>I groaned. \u201cIsn\u2019t she a bit old for it?\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre raised her brows at me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll not say much in Melisande\u2019s favor,\u201d Joscelin intervened with rare diplomacy. \u201cBut I will say one thing. Among a folk renowned for beauty and aging with grace, she does stand out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you reckon is our best course?\u201d I asked, steering the conversation onto safer shoals.</p><p>We talked for a while about plausible tales we could concoct to send a fleet of ships to Cythera to apprehend my mother without alerting her in advance, while at the same time maintaining the goodwill of Khebbel-im-Akkad. By the time I departed for the Palace, afternoon was finally wearing on toward evening.</p><p>There was a small formal meal that night with the Carthaginians, which I attended as a member of House Courcel. I was in no mood for small talk, and it seemed to drag on forever. All I wanted was for this night to be over, so I could lay aside my fears and at last address head-on the shadow that had been hanging over Sidonie and me for the past year.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until we were lingering over glasses of cordial that the Court horologist came, quivering with excitement, to report that the hour was nigh. Even at that, Astegal assured us that we had well over an hour\u2019s time before the moon would be completely obscured. Not until that moment would the effects be visible.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it last?\u201d Drustan inquired.</p> <p>\u201cAt least an hour.\u201d Astegal smiled. \u201cThe heavens move slowly in their stately dance. There will be ample time for you to bask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr ample time for many to glimpse the marvels you promise,\u201d noted Ysandre, who had dispatched a contingent of the Royal Army to ensure that matters proceeded in an orderly fashion, and as many folk as possible were able to share the spectacle.</p><p>Astegal accorded her a brief bow. \u201cHer majesty is a generous ruler.\u201d</p><p>We left the Palace in open carriages, escorted by the Queen\u2019s Guard. In the courtyard, one could already see that it had begun. The full moon stood high overhead, a faint shadow beginning to blur one edge. The sight made me profoundly uneasy.</p><p>The streets of the City were packed with folk gazing at the night sky, talking in excited tones. It was a good thing that Ysandre had sent the Royal Army to secure Elua\u2019s Square, because a solid wall of people surrounded it. If Ghislain\u2019s soldiers hadn\u2019t held a corridor open, we\u2019d have had a difficult time getting through. By the time we did, the encroaching shadow had eaten a good chunk of the moon.</p><p>It was an unnerving sight. The outer rim and the missing piece were still faintly visible, dull and red, the color of drying blood. Near the oak tree, the vast silver mirror gleamed. The angle of the moon was such that it was reflected perfectly in the mirror.</p><p>We were given places of honor around the perimeter of the mirror, as were a select number of other folk. I was pleased to see that Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin were among them.</p><p>There, we waited.</p> <p>And waited.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>It was indeed a slow and stately dance. We peered into the mirror, gazed at the sky. We ceded our places briefly to others, letting them catch a glimpse. We strained our eyes gazing toward the distant walls of the City, trying to spot the other twelve mirrors. The bloody stain spread slowly over the moon, creeping gradually toward total obscurity.</p><p>There was only a thin sliver of silver-white moon yet visible when a voice at my ear whispered, \u201cA word, your highness. Behind the oak. Believe me, it is more important than this so-called marvel.\u201d</p><p>The damned eunuch.</p><p>I turned, but he was already gone, a lithe, dark figure slipping through the throng. I glanced at Sidonie beside me. She was absorbed in watching the mirror, but she looked up and met my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSunjata,\u201d I murmured, too low for anyone else to hear.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she said.</p><p>I grabbed the nearest person behind me, a surprised Siovalese engineer. \u201cHave a quick look,\u201d I said, squeezing past him. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly time.\u201d</p><p>I left him stammering thanks and worked my way through the throng to the far side of the oak tree. Sunjata was there, pressed against it, barely visible in the shadows. I made my way to him, forced against him close as a lover due to the crush of people. His dark eyes gleamed, inches from mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d I said through gritted teeth.</p><p>The crowd surged. Sunjata swayed, steadied himself with a hand on my waist. I felt his lips at my ear once more. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor wha\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>Pain, thin and piercing, seared my side. It felt like he\u2019d driven an enormous needle into my kidneys. I tried to gasp, but my tongue was cleaved to the roof of my mouth. The sky overhead whirled, rotating around the bloody moon. Ice-hot fire ran in my veins.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Sunjata whispered urgently. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This was the only way to shield you from it. You\u2019re going to lose your wits. It\u2019s madness, but it will pass. The fever will break in a month.\u201d</p><p>The needle was withdrawn.</p><p>Cold flames continued to race through my veins. It felt like my skull was on fire. I tried to raise my hands to claw at it, but my knees were threatening to give way beneath me. Sunjata grasped my shoulders, holding me upright.</p><p>\u201cGo to Cythera,\u201d he hissed. \u201cAsk Ptolemy Solon how to undo what\u2019s done here tonight. He may even tell you.\u201d He released my shoulders, and I began to slump.</p><p>Somewhere, an emerald glow arose.</p><p>Brightness flashed.</p><p>The crowd gave a collective gasp.</p><p>I heard it, but I couldn\u2019t speak. Couldn\u2019t see anything but the roots of the oak tree that were rushing up at me, gnarled and writhing. A tangle of serpents. Deep in my throat, I mewled with fear. Serpents. Roots. I scrabbled at them. A dark hand caught mine. There was a tug on my finger, somewhat removed. A tangle. A knot of gold. A hand knotted in my hair, lifting my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this, too,\u201d Sunjata whispered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t dare disobey. It\u2019s a hard business serving two masters.\u201d</p><p>He let go my hair. My head fell. All around us, no one noticed, staring rapt at the bloody sky or shoving for a peek at the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky your mother loves you,\u201d the eunuch whispered. \u201cGo to Cythera.\u201d And then he was gone and madness took me.</p><p>That was the last thing I understood for a long, long time.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>I had gone mad before.</p><p>When Dorelei was slain, I lost my wits. I remember bits and pieces of that terrible night. Running through the woods, my sword in hand. Charging the bear. Berlik\u2019s blow laying me open. Dorelei, dead.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember much of what followed, which was a mercy.</p><p>This was different.</p><p>I lived in a world of fever-racked terror. I knew no one. Not the ones who found me after the moon\u2019s shadow had passed. Not the ones who took me back to the Palace and tended me. Not myself. I knew only that I lived in a world bent on destroying me.</p><p>Things came alive.</p><p>Sweat-damp bedsheets sought to strangle me. Fat globules of wax slid from candles to scald my skin. Demon-filled shadows lurked in every corner.</p><p>My voice came back. I screamed and ranted until my throat was raw. The fever ebbed and flowed. My strength came and went in waves. When it came, I tried to escape. I struggled with my captors. A tall man with blond hair held me down.</p><p>They tied me to my bed, tied my wrists and ankles. I strained at my bonds until my muscles threatened to burst and my ligaments to crack. I bent my back like a bow. A dark-haired woman wept. I cursed her.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to Cythera!\u201d I shouted at her. \u201cLet me go! I have to go to Cythera!\u201d</p><p>She laid a cool compress on my brow, her hot tears falling on my face. They burned.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, you weeping bitch!\u201d I raged.</p><p>They didn\u2019t. They kept me there, day after day. When I was weak, they untied me. So I learned. I feigned weakness. One day, I broke free. I burst past them, laughing like a madman. They didn\u2019t expect me to be that quick.</p><p>They caught me, though, caught me in the hallway. Men with sheathed swords barred my way. I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t draw on me. Too slow, too stupid. The tall man grabbed me from behind, pinning my arms. I thrashed in his grip, cursing him, but he was strong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take him,\u201d he said to them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Joscelin,\u201d one of them said. \u201cLet us do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cAt least in my heart.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and spat on the floor. \u201cYou wish!\u201d I shouted. \u201cMy father was the north wind and my mother was a jackal!\u201d</p><p>The tall man didn\u2019t answer, only tightened his grip. I struggled and kicked and scratched until others came to help him. They wrestled me into bed, tied my limbs. I went limp and stared up into his summer-blue eyes, hating him.</p><p>\u201cJoscelin,\u201d I crooned. \u201cThat\u2019s your name, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll remember it.\u201d I rolled my head, rolling my gaze around the chamber. \u201cShe\u2019s your woman, isn\u2019t she? The weeping bitch.\u201d I saw fear in him and laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re scared of me, aren\u2019t you? Too scared to kill me. You ought to, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d He gazed at me with red-rimmed eyes. \u201cTry to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go to Cythera!\u201d I shouted at him.</p><p>Somewhere, the woman wept.</p><p>\u201cLater, love,\u201d the tall man said gently. \u201cWhen you\u2019re well.\u201d</p><p>I tugged steadily at my bonds, feeling the ropes bite into my skin. A serpent-tangle, fibrous teeth. Gnawing my flesh until it was blood-slick. \u201cI\u2019ll cut out your heart,\u201d I said to him. \u201cJoscelin. I\u2019ll get free, and I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll take your woman.\u201d I bared my teeth at him, inspiration coming from deep inside me. \u201cI\u2019ll take her with my rusted iron rod, I will, and I\u2019ll make her beg for it like the whore she is.\u201d</p><p>He turned away with a choked sound, fists clenched.</p><p>Oh, that had hit hard, it had! I laughed.</p><p>\u201cJoscelin.\u201d She was there, weepy-eyed, gentling him. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault. He\u2019s borne too much for anyone\u2019s lifetime. Something broke inside him.\u201d</p><p>They held one another, consoled one another.</p><p>I jeered at them.</p><p>Days came and went. Others came and went. A tall woman with fair hair, a studied look of worry in her eyes. A man with a face like a blue mask and eyes like polished stones. Some bitch pretending to be a chirurgeon, a liar who called me cousin. People I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>I hated them.</p><p>I hated them all.</p><p>\u201cI will kill you!\u201d I raged, my fever spiking. I yanked at the ropes that bound me. Blood and sweat mingled. \u201cAll of you! I need to go to Cythera!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, love.\u201d The dark-haired woman sat beside my bed. She had dark eyes, too. A scarlet mote swam on the outskirts of her left iris, vivid as a rose petal. For some reason, it maddened me further. She dipped a cloth in cool water, laid it on my fevered brow. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Imri.\u201d</p><p>Since I couldn\u2019t move my limbs, I snapped my teeth at her.</p><p>Liars and hypocrites. They pretended to know me, pretended to be kind. They talked in worried tones, prayed and moaned and wept over me, but they kept me tied like an animal. They tried to feed me broth, and I spat it back in their faces. My body grew weak and wasted, ravaged by fever.</p><p>I memorized their names.</p><p>I would make them suffer for treating me like this. I plotted ways to kill them, ways to torture them before they died. I told them in exacting, foul detail, relishing the pain and fear it evoked in them. Day after day, I tormented them, while my body grew wasted and the ropes etched bloody channels into my wrists and ankles.</p><p>And then I woke up sane.</p><p>It was the moonlight that did it, a silvery wash of it spilling over my bed, so bright it woke me in the middle of the night. My bedsheets were soaked with sweat, but my body felt cool. I turned my head and gazed through the balcony doors. There was the full moon, round and bright as a silver coin.</p><p>It\u2019s madness, but it will pass. The fever will break in a month.</p><p>It had.</p><p>And I remembered everything.</p><p>My stomach seized. I turned my head and vomited, but nothing came out save a trickle of bile.</p><p>\u201cImriel?\u201d In a chair in the corner, a shadowy figure stirred and rose. Ph\u00e8dre wiped my mouth tenderly with a clean cloth, eased the soiled pillow from beneath my head. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gods!\u201d I whispered, my eyes burning. \u201cOh, Blessed Elua and his Companions have mercy on me, ah, gods! Ph\u00e8dre, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>She went very still, a moonlit statue. \u201cFor what, love?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything I\u2019ve said and done in the past month,\u201d I said wearily, exhausted past the point of shame. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s passed. The fever\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre kindled a lamp. In the warm glow, I could see her beautiful face was tired and worn, shadows like bruises beneath her eyes. She swallowed visibly, not quite daring to hope yet. \u201cDo you know who you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYour foster-son, Imriel n\u00f3 Montr\u00e8ve.\u201d</p> <p>She covered her face with both hands, drew a shuddering breath. \u201cAnd where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bedchamber of my quarters at the Palace.\u201d I flexed my stiff hands. \u201cTied to my bed because I\u2019ve been a stark raving lunatic since the last full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Imri!\u201d The anguished tone of hope in Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s voice nearly broke my heart. She laid a hand on my brow. \u201cIs it true?\u201d</p><p>Tears trickled from the corners of my eyes. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoscelin!\u201d Her voice rang out, filled with urgency. \u201cJoscelin!\u201d</p> <p>He came at a run, startled out of sleep. For the past month, they\u2019d been taking turns keeping watch over me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fever\u2019s broken.\u201d Tears gleamed on Ph\u00e8dre cheeks. \u201cHe knows himself.\u201d</p><p>Joscelin turned his bloodshot gaze on me. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. \u201cJoscelin, you look like hell. You look worse than I did when you found me in Vralia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Elua!\u201d Joscelin dropped to his knees beside the bed. There were tears in his eyes, too. \u201cI thought we\u2019d lost you. Wherever it was you went, I didn\u2019t think you were coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d I said hoarsely. \u201cI just wish I didn\u2019t remember.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t . . . just don\u2019t. It was the fever talking.\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre sent a guard to fetch the Court chirurgeon while Joscelin worked at the ropes binding me to the bed. My struggles had rendered the knots impossible to untie, and he had to saw at them with a dagger, working with tender care not to further injure my abraded flesh. Between the two of them, they helped me sit upright, propped against pillows, and drink a cup of water. I was so weak, Ph\u00e8dre had to hold the cup for me. I could feel the water blazing a cool trail into my shrunken belly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I leaned back against the pillows and closed my eyes, exhausted by the effort. \u201cWhere\u2019s Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>There was a brief silence.</p><p>\u201cSidonie?\u201d Joscelin asked in a puzzled tone.</p><p>I opened my eyes.</p><p>\u201cLike as not in Carthage by now.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre refilled the cup from a ewer. \u201cWhy, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarthage?\u201d I stared at her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo wed Prince Astegal,\u201d she reminded me, holding the cup to my lips.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I pushed it away feebly. \u201cNo, no, no! Have you all lost your wits?\u201d</p><p>Their faces fell. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Joscelin said to Ph\u00e8dre. \u201cHe knows himself, and us. The rest will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought . . .\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted at them. \u201cGods above, I\u2019m fine!\u201d I saw the fear in their eyes and caught myself, falling silent. I made myself look at the memories of my month-long madness.</p><p>Sidonie wasn\u2019t in them.</p><p>This was the only way to shield you from it.</p><p>\u201cAstegal,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhat did you do? What did they do, those damned Carthaginians? What did they do?\u201d I repeated, addressing Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin. \u201cThe full moon, the mirror? What did they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre stroked my cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see in the mirror?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>They exchanged a glance, faces softening. \u201cIt was a marvel,\u201d Joscelin said, wonder in his tone. \u201cThe invisible ties that bind all things in the cosmos . . .\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said dully. \u201cIt was a trick. It was some vast and terrible enchantment, and I was protected from it only because the eunuch stabbed me with something that sent me mad.\u201d I laughed in despair. \u201cMadness as a shield against madness. Now I\u2019m sane, and you\u2019re raving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sane,\u201d I said. \u201cSidonie loves me. She defied her mother and half the realm for my sake. She would never wed Astegal. And Terre d\u2019Ange would never betray its alliance with Aragonia to unite with Carthage.\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre shook her head in sorrow and went to meet the chirurgeon.</p><p>Somewhat was wrong, terribly wrong. Filled with terror, I held my tongue and suffered myself to be examined by the royal chirurgeon, Lelahiah Valais. She confirmed that the worst of the fever had broken, bandaged my injuries, and recommended strong broth and a great deal of sleep. I heard them speak in hushed tones about my continued delusions.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s because he was taken by Carthaginian slavers as a child that he harbors such a peculiar grudge?\u201d Joscelin asked the chirurgeon.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Lelahiah said. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it. And to be fair, I\u2019ve heard there are folk outside the City unhappy with the Queen\u2019s decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are always fearful of change,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre murmured. \u201cBut what do you make of his claim about Sidonie, of all people?\u201d She sounded perplexed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they disliked one another, but they\u2019ve never been close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap that\u2019s why.\u201d The chirurgeon lowered her voice. \u201cThe mind is a strange place, my lady, and we cannot examine its workings the way we examine the body\u2019s. I understand he was very ill after his wife was slain and his wounds turned septic. Mayhap one spell of madness evoked another, and somehow in his thoughts, he has replaced the loss of his wife with a loss that is less painful to him.\u201d</p><p>Less painful.</p><p>Sidonie.</p><p>I stared at the moon outside my balcony. A month ago, I\u2019d made love to her by moonlight. Now she was gone. Gone to Carthage, gone to wed Astegal. Gone of her own volition, it seemed. Was I mad? I had been. I\u2019d said things that made me cringe inside. I didn\u2019t trust myself. But I loved Sidonie. I knew I did. And she loved me. I could feel her absence like a wound. I remembered her. Everything about her. Everything we had done together. Her scent, the taste of her skin. The faraway look she got in the throes of pleasure. Her voice. Always and always.</p><p>My head was full of voices and memory.</p><p>Gods, I was tired.</p><p>Alais\u2019 voice, her grave face the day we\u2019d spoken atop the ramparts of Bryn Gorrydum. I think she\u2019s going to need you very badly one day.</p><p>That damned eunuch, Sunjata.</p><p>Go to Cythera.</p><p>Ask Ptolemy Solon how to undo what\u2019s done here tonight.</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cWhatever it is, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d I whispered into the darkness. \u201cI\u2019ll come for you, love. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>My strength returned slowly.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as bad as it had been after Dorelei\u2019s death. I wasn\u2019t wounded, save for the suppurating abrasions around my wrists and ankles, a bitterly ironic reminder of the bindings I\u2019d once worn as a protection against enchantment. But the fever and lack of nourishment had left me weak.</p><p>And I was surrounded by madness.</p><p>Everyone in the Palace believed it. Terre d\u2019Ange\u2014and oh, gods, Alba too\u2014had made a pact with Carthage. Sidonie had gone away to wed Astegal, escorted onto the Carthaginian flagship with great fanfare.</p><p>No one remembered our affair.</p><p>It had been erased from memory as though it had never existed. Mavros came to visit me when he learned I was recovering. I begged him to rack his wits. He had been the first person to know, the one who had helped from the very beginning. All he could do was gaze at me with sympathy and shake his head.</p><p>I wanted desperately to get outside the City, but in the first days of my recuperation, I barely had the strength to get out of bed. On Lelahiah Valais\u2019 orders, I was kept in relative solitude. Only family members were permitted to visit me. I wasn\u2019t allowed to hear aught that might disturb me and feed my delusions. Servants and guards were given strict orders not to discuss sensitive matters in my presence.</p><p>Still, I heard wisps of conversation here and there, enough to gather that there was widespread dismay beyond the City\u2019s walls. It gave me a thread of hope.</p><p>And then, some five days after my fever broke, I overheard a careless guard remark to a chambermaid as she entered my quarters that Ysandre and Barquiel L\u2019Envers were engaged in a shouting match in the throne hall.</p><p>L\u2019Envers hadn\u2019t been in the City the night of the full moon.</p><p>I struggled into my clothing, trembling with exertion, and made my way into the salon. \u201cI need to talk to him,\u201d I said. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d the guard said in alarm. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible, your highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it\u2019s not,\u201d I said. \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>He blocked me. \u201cSend for Messire Joscelin and Lady Ph\u00e8dre,\u201d he said urgently to the maid. \u201cThey\u2019re in the throne hall with her majesty.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and fled.</p><p>I found my sword-belt and drew my blade. My arm shook. \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>The guard put his hands up. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, your highness. You\u2019re ill.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth. \u201cI just want to talk to L\u2019Envers. Stand aside, man!\u201d</p><p>He did.</p><p>I pushed past him, sword in hand. Elua knows, I couldn\u2019t blame them for trying to protect me from myself. The madness had made a monster of me. I would never be able to forget. But it was gone now, or at least banished into wherever it is that such things lurk in the dark, unplumbed depths of the soul.</p><p>At least I prayed it was.</p><p>Trailed by the anxious guard, I staggered out of my quarters. Down the hallway, down the wide marble stair that led to the ground floor of the Palace. I took a two-handed grip on my sword, keeping it angled before me. People shrieked and ran. They\u2019d heard tell of my ravings. More guardsmen came, forming a wary circle around me. I ignored them and staggered onward.</p><p>The doors to the throne hall were closed. I could hear raised voices behind them. With both hands, I pointed my sword at the guards posted there. \u201cAdmit me.\u201d</p><p>They paled. \u201cWe can\u2019t, your highness,\u201d one said.</p><p>My knees wobbled. \u201cJust do it!\u201d</p><p>Someone grabbed me from behind, pinning my arms as Joscelin had done. Someone else wrestled the sword from my hands. I cursed and struggled, borne down under the weight of several guards.</p><p>The doors to the throne hall opened with a crash and Barquiel L\u2019Envers strode out, his face white with fury. He stopped short at the sight of me struggling with the guards, fixing me with a look of disgust.</p><p>\u201cSome great undying love affair that turned out to be,\u201d L\u2019Envers said in contempt, then turned on his heel and strode away, followed by a retinue of his own men-at-arms.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d His words rang in my ears. A rill of terrified strength ran through me. I thrashed and flailed my way free, got my feet under me, and ran after him.</p><p>L\u2019Envers turned and drew his blade. \u201cKeep your distance, lunatic,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cI swear to Elua, I will run you through.\u201d</p><p>I managed to halt before I impaled myself. \u201cYou remember,\u201d I gasped. \u201cSidonie and I. You remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d His violet eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, panting. \u201cCan we speak, my lord? Please?\u201d</p><p>He was silent a moment. \u201cFetch his blade,\u201d he said at length to one of his men, and to me, \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>On any other occasion, the last place in the world I could imagine wanting to be was alone with Barquiel L\u2019Envers in his private quarters, surrounded by men loyal to him. Today, I was desperately grateful to be there. He sent his men out of earshot, ensconced me on his couch, poured me a generous draught of brandy, then poured one for himself, and sat opposite me.</p><p>\u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><p>I had nothing left to lose. I told him everything.</p><p>Claudia Fulvia, the Unseen Guild and their threats. Canis and my mother. My letter to Diokles Agallon, the bargain. Carthage. The eunuch Sunjata, Gillimas. What had happened the night of the full moon. Ptolemy Solon and Cythera. My month-long madness, and the madness I\u2019d awoken to.</p><p>\u201cSodding Carthage,\u201d L\u2019Envers said when I\u2019d finished. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not mad?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were.\u201d He studied me. \u201cBarking-mad, from the sound of it. But in this, it\u2019s hard to say.\u201d He quaffed his brandy and refilled it, regarding the glass. \u201cTruth be told, I heard rumors of this Guild of yours years ago in Khebbel-im-Akkad, though I couldn\u2019t vouch for them. Of a surety, the whole damn City is convinced, man, woman, and child, that Carthage is our new best friend, and the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange made a love-match with a Carthaginian prince and sailed away merrily with him. You\u2019re right about that. Somewhat was done to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s only the City?\u201d I said hopefully.</p><p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers snorted. \u201cThe City, and all who were in it that night. Damn nigh all of Parliament. The Royal Army and its commander. The Royal Admiral and a good number of his men. The Cruarch of Alba.\u201d</p><p>I felt sick. \u201cAll the powers of the realm.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking aged and weary. \u201cAnd Ysandre\u2019s minded to dispatch the army to the Aragonian border in support of Carthage\u2019s threat.\u201d He scrubbed his face with one hand. \u201cI tell you, lad, if this is some elaborate scheme of your mother\u2019s to place you on the throne, I\u2019ve half a mind to go along with it. I\u2019d sooner see Melisande\u2019s treasonous spawn warming his arse on the throne than my own niece acting as Carthage\u2019s pawn. And outside the City walls, there are hundreds of thousands of folk who\u2019d agree.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is. The eunuch said he served two masters.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cAnyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d L\u2019Envers raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cSidonie needs me,\u201d I said simply. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p> <p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers looked at me for a long, long time, an incredulous expression slowly dawning over his worn features. He gave a short, choked laugh. \u201cOh, Blessed Elua bugger me! You actually love her?\u201d</p><p>Tears stung my eyes. \u201cVery much so, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlessed Elua bugger me,\u201d L\u2019Envers repeated, bemused. \u201cSo what in the seven hells do we do, Imriel de la Courcel? Raise an army? Wrest Quintilius Rousse\u2019s fleet from his control and sail against Carthage? How do we do it without setting off a civil war in Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to break the spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCythera.\u201d He raked a hand through his short-cropped hair. \u201cYou\u2019re sure that part\u2019s not a fever-dream?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs sure as I can be. Sunjata said the fever would break in a month, and it did. I have to try,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll grovel and beg, if that\u2019s what it takes. If Ptolemy Solon knows how to undo this, I\u2019ll do whatever is needful. But I need your help to get out of the City, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not a piece of your madness, you know damned well what he\u2019ll ask for,\u201d L\u2019Envers said wryly. \u201cA pardon for Melisande Shahrizai.\u201d</p><p>I was silent.</p><p>L\u2019Envers sighed. \u201cI wish to hell I knew whether or not to believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d I said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He eyed me. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you are. But I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ve got your wits back altogether, and of a surety, I\u2019m not convinced you aren\u2019t a pawn in some unknowable scheme of your mother\u2019s. Are you?\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019re lucky your mother loves you.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cIf I am, can it truly be worse than this?\u201d He didn\u2019t answer. I sipped my brandy, thinking. \u201cSend to Alba, my lord. There\u2019s still one member of House Courcel fit to sit the throne. Alais. If you raise a large enough delegation of D\u2019Angelines and Albans alike to petition Ysandre and convince her that there\u2019s somewhat amiss, if you reason with her instead of shouting, mayhap she\u2019ll be willing to let Alais assume the throne until we can undo what was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlais!\u201d L\u2019Envers said in surprise. \u201cThat slip of a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s second in line for the throne,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cAnd she\u2019s gained her majority; she turned eighteen last winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he mused.</p><p>\u201cShe has the Master of the Straits\u2019 ear,\u201d I added. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone Drustan might listen to, it\u2019s Hyacinthe. I\u2019m sure he would help. He\u2019s a deadly force unto himself, and he knows a good deal about magic. So do the ollamhs.\u201d I thought about Berlik. \u201cSo do the Maghuin Dhonn, for that matter. It\u2019s worth asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d L\u2019Envers asked, only slightly sardonic.</p><p>\u201cScour the Royal Archives,\u201d I suggested. \u201cThe Secretary of the Presence will have recorded Parliament\u2019s last session and . . . and the public audience wherein Ysandre bade me to bring my mother to justice if I truly wished to wed Sidonie. There has to be written evidence that casts doubt on Carthage\u2019s claims and proves the truth. You can recruit scholars from outside the City to compile it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile you sail off to Cythera to reunite with your mother and Carthage goes unchecked,\u201d he said.</p><p>I spread my hands. \u201cDo you have a better plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no,\u201d L\u2019Envers muttered, rising to pace the room. \u201cYou have a point. At the least, it might stall Ysandre from sending the army against Aragonia without setting off a civil war. And there would be a legitimate heir on the throne.\u201d He halted. \u201cNo pardon for Melisande. A pardon\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d A look of profound distaste crossed his features. \u201cHowever, I suppose we could offer to commute her sentence to exile in exchange for Ptolemy Solon\u2019s assistance.\u201d</p><p>My heart leapt. \u201cThen you\u2019ll help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, I must have lost my own wits.\u201d His mouth twisted. \u201cI swear to Blessed Elua, if you fail in this, if you prove false or a dupe, I will make it my life\u2019s work to hunt you down and kill you.\u201d His violet eyes were deadly serious. \u201cNo intrigue, no ploys. I will kill you and bear whatever punishment follows.\u201d</p><p>I thought about Astegal in Jasmine House, his arms slung around a pair of adepts. Smiling as he emerged at dawn, heavy-lidded. I thought about Sidonie in his bed, ensorceled, spreading her thighs willingly for him, urging him into her. My muscles knotted, trembling with fury.</p><p>\u201cDuc Barquiel,\u201d I said in perfect sincerity, \u201cif I fail in this, you\u2019re more than welcome to kill me.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>I told him. I didn\u2019t need much. Money. My horse, my sword and vambraces, some supplies. Mostly I needed to get out of the City of Elua and to Marsilikos without someone sending guards to retrieve me for my own safety.</p><p>\u201cCan you ride?\u201d L\u2019Envers asked pragmatically. \u201cYou look half-starved and weak as a day-old kitten.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange for passage by barge. Think you can convince your keepers to let you make a healing-offering at Eisheth\u2019s temple in three days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d I smiled ruefully. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d There was noise in the corridor outside L\u2019Envers\u2019 quarters. He turned his head. \u201cAh. That would be someone come to make sure I\u2019ve not gutted you, I suspect. I\u2019m surprised it took so long.\u201d He put out his hand. \u201cEisheth\u2019s temple, three days.\u201d</p><p>I rose and took his hand. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers tightened his grip. \u201cJust don\u2019t fail.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to convince Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin to take me to Eisheth\u2019s temple; indeed, they thought it an excellent idea. I\u2019d regained enough strength that Lelahiah Valais reckoned the outing would do me no harm, and Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin both thought it a hopeful sign that I realized I was yet in need of healing.</p><p>I felt awful about it.</p><p>I hated to betray their trust. As if I hadn\u2019t reason enough to love them, they\u2019d stood by me during my madness, tending me with care while I ranted and raved. The things I\u2019d said were seared into my memory. And when I\u2019d come out of it, they\u2019d welcomed me back with heartbreaking joy, forgiving every word without a thought.</p><p>Now I was leaving.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see any way around it. I\u2019d tried, over and over, to convince them of the truth about Carthage. Elua knows, they had to have doubts. Barquiel L\u2019Envers wasn\u2019t alone. Although he was the only one to take it up with the Queen thus far, there was a realm full of bewildered folk outside the walls of the City.</p><p>But they wouldn\u2019t hear it, not from me. The madness that had protected me worked against me. I had been insane\u2014barking-mad, as L\u2019Envers had said, frothing at the mouth. And every memory that contradicted the beliefs that Carthage\u2019s magics had instilled was gone, vanished. When I reminded Ph\u00e8dre of her research into Cythera, when I reminded Joscelin how he\u2019d thought of sending Ti-Philippe to scout among Rousse\u2019s sailors, they looked grave and worried, and quietly changed the subject.</p><p>I could imagine the memory that it evoked.</p><p>Me, tied to a bed and screaming about Cythera.</p><p>They would never let me go, not now. Mayhap in time I could wear them down. Once L\u2019Envers assembled a delegation, once they realized that outside the walls of the City, my seeming delusion was shared by thousands, things would begin to change. But even at that, my tale would seem half-mad. L\u2019Envers was willing to take a chance on it only because he was desperate and he didn\u2019t care if I lived or died. There was no way I could prove the truth of my tale. Folk outside the City could attest to my relationship with Sidonie, my quest to find my mother. Not the existence of the Unseen Guild, shrouded in deadly secrecy. Not the admission I\u2019d forced from Gillimas of Hiram. And of a surety, not my encounter with Sunjata the night of the full moon. It would take a long, long time before any of that began to sound like aught but fever-dreams to anyone caught in the grip of Carthage\u2019s spell.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t afford to wait.</p><p>Not while Astegal . . . ah, gods! I couldn\u2019t bear to think on it.</p><p>So I gave up and behaved like a model patient. I spent the long, tedious hours of my recuperation writing a letter expressing my apologies ten thousand ways over. Begging forgiveness. Telling them I loved them. And three days after my meeting with Barquiel L\u2019Envers, two of the people I loved best in the world escorted me gladly to Eisheth\u2019s temple, where I meant to betray them.</p><p>The temple was built around a spring whose waters were said to have healing properties. It was an expansive and gracious place. Many people came to stay for days at a time, partaking of the healing waters. The head priestess met us in the temple courtyard, a brown-haired woman of middle years, clad in sea-blue robes. I recognized her; she had been present at my hearing in the Great Temple of Elua, when all the orders of Blessed Elua and his Companions had elected to acknowledge Sidonie\u2019s and my love. She gave no sign of having met me before.</p><p>\u201cBe welcome, Prince Imriel,\u201d she said, bowing. \u201cMay you find healing here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes stung. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I turned to Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin. It was a bright day, the sun pinning a silvery cap on Joscelin\u2019s fair hair, illuminating the scarlet mote in Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s dark eyes. They were smiling, happy, unaware that the world had fallen to pieces all around us. My heart ached at what I was about to do.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said to them. \u201cI love you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre stretched to kiss my cheek. \u201cYou have your offering?\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink deep,\u201d Joscelin advised me.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I murmured, blinking away tears.</p><p>And then I left them, Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, the parents of my heart, to entrust myself into the hands of a man who\u2019d wanted me dead since I was born. I followed the priestess as she led me into the inner sanctum, a rocky little garden. There was the spring, bubbling gently, lined by moss-covered stones on which votive candles burned, their flames almost invisible in the sunlight. There was the effigy of Eisheth: the figure of a woman, half again as large as life, kneeling beside the spring, her hands cupped. Streaks of green moss reached up her marble flanks. Her cupped hands held the ashes of other offerings.</p><p>\u201cMake your offering.\u201d The priestess pressed my shoulder, pushing me gently to my knees. \u201cDrink, and seek healing.\u201d</p><p>I knelt and she left me.</p><p>Eisheth\u2019s head was bowed, curtains of marble hair hiding her features. Humble. The mossy stones were damp beneath my knees. I fumbled for the packet tied to my belt, poured an offering of incense into her cupped hands. Hyssop and cedar gum. There were wax tapers piled neatly at her feet. I took one, kindled it at a votive, and lit the incense. A sweet thread of smoke arose from her palms, bluish in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cMerciful Eisheth, grant me healing,\u201d I whispered. \u201cGrant it to us all.\u201d</p><p>I cupped my own hands, dipped them into the spring, and drank. The water was cool, with an acrid mineral tang. I drank deep.</p><p>\u201cReady, highness?\u201d a man\u2019s voice whispered behind me.</p><p>It was one of L\u2019Envers\u2019 guards, beckoning from the entrance, a grey cloak folded over one arm. He didn\u2019t have to tell me to hurry. I crossed quickly over to him and donned the cloak, pulling up the hood to hide my features.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d He steered me down the wide corridor, then turned into a narrow hall used by the initiates and acolytes who served the priesthood. I could tell, because he pointed to the crumpled figure of one on the floor. \u201cMind the body.\u201d</p><p>I stepped gingerly over it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t . . . ?\u201d</p><p>The guard shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a lump on his skull, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>I was relieved. Barquiel L\u2019Envers had a name for being ruthless. At least he was efficient, too. His guardsman navigated me with swift certitude down the back hallways of the temple. Once we had to duck into a storage room filled with strips of willow bark while a pair of acolytes passed, but we managed to exit the temple by the postern gate. There was a plain carriage waiting, another guard at the reins.</p><p>\u201cGet in.\u201d The first guard opened the carriage door and gave me an ungentle shove. He followed as I slid across the seats, shouting to the driver, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>The driver snapped the reins and the carriage lurched into motion. \u201cMy thanks,\u201d I said to the guard.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me.\u201d His face was shuttered. \u201cI\u2019m just following orders. It\u2019s a sodding mystery to me why his grace is helping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove of country?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth is packing you off to some strange isle supposed to help?\u201d His expression slipped a little to reveal utter bewilderment. \u201cNo mind. Like as not, he\u2019s finally found a way to get rid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike as not,\u201d I agreed, wondering if it was true.</p><p>The carriage took us to the wharf. Barquiel L\u2019Envers was there alongside a sizable merchant-barge, drumming his fingers impatiently on his sword-belt. I dismounted from the carriage, careful to keep my hood up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s there.\u201d L\u2019Envers jerked his chin at the barge. \u201cYour horse, your things. Passage paid to Marsilikos. After that, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captain and crew are sound,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were outside the City when it happened. I paid them to keep their mouths shut, and they\u2019re scared enough to do it. If you need help in Marsilikos, try the Lady\u2019s daughter. She wasn\u2019t here for it, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d I hesitated, then fished the letter I\u2019d written out of an inner pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t have the right to ask you any further favors . . .\u201d</p><p>L\u2019Envers lips tightened. \u201cJust ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is for Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin.\u201d I handed him the letter. \u201cI didn\u2019t divulge any details. And I know you can\u2019t give it to them yet. Not until I\u2019m well away, not until you\u2019ve raised a sufficient delegation that they might, might listen, instead of accusing you of abducting me. But it\u2019s important to me. I owe them my life. I owe them everything I am.\u201d</p><p>He took it. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I said softly. \u201cIf I fail, if I\u2019ve been misled . . .\u201d My voice faltered. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to seek vengeance against me, I don\u2019t care. But please . . . no matter how it seemed, she didn\u2019t go willingly. Not really.\u201d</p> <p>Somewhat in L\u2019Envers\u2019 worn, chiseled face softened. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cWhatever you can do to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Barquiel L\u2019Envers hands settled on my shoulders. \u201cShe\u2019s my blood. Why the hell do you think I wanted to protect her from you so badly?\u201d His fingers flexed, biting deep. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He let me go. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p><p>I went.</p> <p>Shrouded in my cloak, I boarded the barge. I wasn\u2019t such a fool as to trust L\u2019Envers wholeheartedly; before we cast off, I made certain all was as he\u2019d promised. It was. The Bastard was belowdeck, looking profoundly discontented. I lingered briefly, cupping his whiskered muzzle in my hand. My saddlebags were stowed in a cabin, neatly packed. There was a generous purse. My sword-belt and my dagger were there. I buckled my weapons in place, my fingers shaking with the effort. Still, it made me feel stronger.</p><p>I went to tell the barge captain all was in readiness. He was a taciturn Eisandine fellow, uneasiness lurking behind his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you want to do this, your highness?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sunlight sparkled on the Aviline River. I could see the distant walls of the Palace gleaming. Somewhere in the City behind us, Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin were strolling the outer gardens of Eisheth\u2019s temple, beginning to get worried. Mayhap they were already alarmed, alerted that some intruder had struck down a young initiate and I was nowhere to be found.</p><p>And somewhere in Carthage, Astegal, a prince of the House of Sarkal, appointed General of the Council of Thirty, preened his scarlet beard and dreamed of empire, basking under the ensorceled gaze of my girl Sidonie. Whom he might or might not have wed by now. Who did not love him, but had gone away with him willingly.</p><p>I ground my teeth. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>The captain\u2014Gilbert Dumel was his name\u2014gave the order. \u201cOars away!\u201d</p><p>The moorings were loosed, the ropes tossed aboard the barge. Deft sailors leapt across the gap. Rowers bent their backs, groaning with effort. L\u2019Envers and his men were gone, nowhere in sight.</p> <p>Another departure, another leavetaking.</p><p>Gods, I was tired.</p><p>The grey cloak puddled around me. I heard members of the crew murmuring, speculating. I bowed my head like Eisheth, splaying one hand on the sun-warmed boards of the prow to brace myself.</p><p>Love.</p><p>You will find it and lose it, again and again.</p><p>A Priest of Elua had told me that long ago. It was true. There were so many loves in my life I had found and lost. So many treasures that had slipped through my fingers. Not this. I wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>Not Sidonie.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>The barge made steady progress down the Aviline. I kept to myself, spending long hours practicing the Cassiline discipline in an effort to regain my strength, while the green banks of Terre d\u2019Ange slid past us.</p><p>Gilbert and his men gave me a wide, wary berth. They\u2019d heard the stories in the City. Prince Imriel gone mad, tied to his bed and raving. I might have seemed sane enough now, but my wrists were still circled with healing scabs.</p><p>They kept their word, though. No one betrayed my presence. I supposed that was one good thing about finding myself under the patronage of Barquiel L\u2019Envers. He wasn\u2019t a man anyone wanted to cross.</p><p>And, too, they were scared. Somehow, Carthage had managed to strike at the very heart of Terre d\u2019Ange, and no one knew how.</p><p>As the days passed, I grew stronger. I\u2019d fought back from worse. Berlik had nearly killed me; this was nothing.</p><p>Fighting despair was harder.</p><p>Even as my body slowly healed, the sense of weariness persisted. It had nothing to do with overexerting myself. It was a fear that I\u2019d been given one burden more than I could carry. I had failed in Vralia. I\u2019d given up and prepared to abandon my hunt for Berlik. In the end, he\u2019d come to me.</p><p>This was different, though. I\u2019d wanted vengeance for Dorelei, very much. I\u2019d wanted to let her spirit rest peacefully. I\u2019d needed to assuage my grief. And I\u2019d wanted to do my utmost to ameliorate the shadow of guilt that lay between Sidonie and me. Still, I could have lived with the failure, bitter and awful though it would have been.</p><p>Not this one.</p><p>So I pushed my body until my muscles quivered, taking a grim solace in my returning strength. I forced myself not to think about Sidonie and Astegal. It was too dangerous, filling me with fury and despair, making me fear for my sanity once more. There was darkness lurking in me, spilled out by the prick of a eunuch\u2019s needle. I couldn\u2019t give in to it.</p><p>We reached the wide mouth of the Aviline, opening onto the sea. The barge turned east along the coast, making for Marsilikos. I gazed out at the vast expanse of water to the south, thinking about the lands that lay beyond.</p><p>Cythera.</p><p>Carthage.</p><p>Like Tiberium, Carthage had ruled a vast empire once. Long ago, in the days before Blessed Elua wandered the earth, Carthage had conquered Aragonia. It had made alliances with our forebears in the land that would become Terre d\u2019Ange; it had marched on Tiberium. Armies of both nations had fought one another to a standstill.</p><p>In the end, the pendulum had swung. Carthage\u2019s army had been vanquished on Tiberian soil, its dream of empire destroyed. Tiberium\u2019s star had risen for a time, until it too had fallen.</p><p>Now Carthage sought to rise again, armed with dire magic.</p><p>It could be stopped, though. I had to believe it. Whatever the horologists had done, it wasn\u2019t as deadly as what I\u2019d witnessed in Drujan. The ka-Magi there had used madness as a weapon to destroy an entire Akkadian army, turning it against itself. They had been able to kill with a thought. And Ph\u00e8dre had managed to bring them down nonetheless\u2014Ph\u00e8dre, Joscelin, and the brave folk of the zenana.</p><p>I had to believe.</p><p>The gilded Dome of the Lady was shining brightly the day we reached Marsilikos. The harbor was busy, filled with an unwarranted number of Quintilius Rousse\u2019s ships. His men were swarming everywhere. I didn\u2019t dare roam the docks, seeking passage to Cythera. Once the Bastard was unloaded, I thanked Gilbert and his men and took my leave of them. I rode into the city, struggling with my fractious horse, sweating beneath my concealing cloak. I\u2019d regained a good measure of strength, but not nearly as much as I\u2019d have liked.</p><p>The streets of Marsilikos were filled with uneasy talk. I took a room at a modest inn and gave a false name. I paid a lad to carry a note to the Lady of Marsilikos\u2019 daughter, Jeanne de Mereliot, then sat in the tavern, drinking ale and eavesdropping.</p><p>All the conversation was the same. Roxanne de Mereliot, her son, Gerard, and every member of their retinue had returned from the City of Elua under the conviction that Terre d\u2019Ange was Carthage\u2019s ally, speaking in vague, glowing terms of a marvel they had witnessed, speaking happily of the love-match between Astegal and Sidonie.</p><p>No one could fathom why.</p><p>There was speculation about a bribe of unimaginable proportions, fueled by the accounts of Carthage\u2019s generous gifts. Here and there, a few stalwarts insisted that it had to be some ploy Ysandre and Drustan had concocted to confuse Carthage, lulling them into complacency, but no one could explain how that would play out in a manner that would justify Sidonie\u2019s sacrifice.</p><p>And there were whispers of dark magic performed beneath a bloody moon, about Carthage itself, a land with gods terrible enough that they had once demanded the sacrifice of babes and children.</p><p>I listened, gritting my teeth until my jaw ached.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the tavern-lad returned with a message from Jeanne de Mereliot, bidding me to meet her in all haste at the Academy of Medicine. I\u2019d nearly forgotten she was a chirurgeon in her own right. She was of Eisheth\u2019s line, with healing in her blood.</p><p>Since it wasn\u2019t far, I made the journey on foot, cloaked and sweltering in the heat, pushing my body to further endurance. There weren\u2019t many folk in Marsilikos who could put a name to my face for a surety, but there were a few. I\u2019d ridden with Gerard de Mereliot and an escort of the Lady\u2019s men once. With my luck, I\u2019d be sure to encounter one of them.</p><p>For a mercy, I didn\u2019t.</p><p>At the Academy, I presented myself as Cadmar of Landras. It was the name of a boy I\u2019d known long ago when I was a child in the Sanctuary of Elua. I don\u2019t know why it was the first thing I\u2019d thought of when I\u2019d given a false name, except that it was a piece of my past no one would ever connect to Imriel de la Courcel. I\u2019d warned Jeanne in the note I\u2019d sent, and I was escorted to her study without question.</p><p>\u201cIm\u2014\u201d Jeanne caught her breath at the sight of me, barely catching herself before saying my name. We had passed a night together once, or at least several hours of one. Eisheth\u2019s mercy takes many forms. Her smoky grey eyes widened. \u201cYou look . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said to the attendant who had escorted me. \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell met, Jeanne,\u201d I said when the door had closed.</p><p>\u201cYou look awful,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve looked worse,\u201d I said. \u201cBelieve me.\u201d</p><p>Jeanne regarded me with a chirurgeon\u2019s concern. \u201cYou were very ill. You shouldn\u2019t be travelling, Imriel. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ill.\u201d I found a chair and sat. \u201cI was stark raving mad, Jeanne. But it passed, and now I\u2019m the only living soul who was in the City of Elua the night the moon was obscured who doesn\u2019t believe that Carthage and Terre d\u2019Ange are allies, and Sidonie de la Courcel fell in love with a Carthaginian prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your letter suggested.\u201d Tears shone in her eyes, born of frustration and weariness. \u201cWhat in Blessed Elua\u2019s name happened that night?\u201d Jeanne gestured helplessly around her study, which was piled high with books and scrolls. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for answers; we all have. But there\u2019s nothing in history to guide us, no account of thousands of folk succumbing to the same delusion at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a trick,\u201d I said. \u201cA spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw it?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat they did?\u201d</p><p>The hope in her voice hurt. I shook my head. \u201cI saw very little. A man drove a needle into me.\u201d I touched my side. \u201cHere. He told me I would go mad, but it was for my own protection. He said the fever would break in a month. And he said to seek out Ptolemy Solon in Cythera, who would know how to undo what was done. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I need your help booking passage to Cythera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA needle.\u201d A strange expression crossed Jeanne\u2019s face. She stooped before me, laying one hand on my brow. \u201cHave you any idea how that sounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I caught her hand. \u201cBut it\u2019s true. There\u2019s nothing wrong with my memory. I remember you. You came to my room and offered me respite. Eisheth\u2019s mercy. You opened all the windows. I remember, Jeanne. Your black hair spread on the pillow like sea-grass, the cool wind blowing over my skin. You were gentle and kind, and I needed that so much. When you left, you laughed and told me Eisheth had a fondness for beautiful sailor-boys.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers stirred in mine. \u201cRemembering that doesn\u2019t make this true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if it is?\u201d I asked simply.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away, but began rummaging through the texts piled on every surface of her study, her face fierce with concentration. I sat quietly, watching her.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Jeanne said at length, thrusting an ancient, cracked tome at me, marking a passage with one finger. It was written in Hellene.</p><p>I read it.</p><p>To induce madness, forge a needle of silver that has never seen daylight, one handspan\u2019s length. Bathe it in the sweat of a lunatic\u2019s brow mixed with the effluvium of a horned toad. For one year, expose it to the light of the full moon. When plunged into the vitals, it will induce madness for the duration of the moon\u2019s cycle.</p><p>My blood ran cold. \u201cWhat is this book? Where did you get it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a compendium of occult ailments by Cleon of Naxos,\u201d Jeanne said. \u201cHe spent years gathering tales of folk rumored to have been afflicted by witchcraft.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever given it credence, but there was a copy in the Academy library. A curiosity, I suppose. I pulled it only out of desperation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes Cleon of Naxos suggest cures?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Regret darkened her gaze. \u201cHe died some two hundred years ago. There\u2019s a note at the end of the compendium stating he meant to compile a volume of occult cures, but so far as I know, he never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d I closed the book. \u201cWell, it\u2019s somewhat.\u201d I remembered the searing pain of Sunjata\u2019s needle plunging deep into my flesh and shivered. A madman\u2019s sweat and toad-slime. Gods.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d Jeanne asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d I handed the book back to her. \u201cJeanne, listen. It was Barquiel L\u2019Envers who helped me get this far. He\u2019s the only ranking peer of the realm who wasn\u2019t in the City that night. He\u2019s planning to raise a delegation to petition Ysandre to step aside and let Alais assume the throne until we can find a way to undo this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL\u2019Envers helped you?\u201d Her voice held an incredulous note.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s desperate, too.\u201d I smiled briefly. \u201cOr eager to be rid of me. Tell him about this. If nothing else, it\u2019s one more piece of proof that I\u2019m not remembering fever-dreams. And mayhap there are other texts no one\u2019s ever heeded that might hold other answers.\u201d</p><p>Resolve strengthened her features. \u201cIt\u2019s worth looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you help me get to Cythera?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Jeanne gave me a long look. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure it wouldn\u2019t be violating my chirurgeon\u2019s oath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo no harm,\u201d I said softly, thinking of Canis\u2019 medallion. \u201cMy lady, believe me when I tell you that you will do me far greater harm if you withhold your aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dauphine?\u201d she asked with sympathy.</p><p>I nodded, suddenly bereft of words.</p><p>Jeanne sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I caught her hands and kissed them. \u201cThank you. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Silence fell between us. Jeanne de Mereliot freed one hand, touched my cheek with that healing gentleness I remembered so well. Her grey eyes were clear and grave and lovely. \u201cI keep a private chamber here at the Academy if you\u2019d prefer to stay here tonight.\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cI promise you, it\u2019s much tidier than my study.\u201d</p><p>Respite.</p><p>Eisheth\u2019s mercy.</p><p>I understood what she was offering, and I wanted it more than I would have reckoned. A blessing to carry with me, a memory of grace to ward off the memories of madness that racked me with shame. A night\u2019s haven, a talisman against the thoughts of Sidonie in Astegal\u2019s bed.</p><p>But it would blur other memories, too.</p><p>Sidonie, silvered by moonlight, her face in shadow. The sweat of love-making drying on our skin.</p><p>I love you. Very, very much.</p><p>Always, I\u2019d said. Always and always.</p> <p>I needed to cling to it. It was that memory which lent me purpose and courage. I couldn\u2019t afford to let go of it, to lessen it in any way. I was afraid I\u2019d fall apart if I did.</p><p>\u201cYou are as kind as you are beautiful,\u201d I said to Jeanne. \u201cAnd there is a large part of me that would like nothing better. But, my lady, I\u2019m very much afraid that your kindness would prove my undoing.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again, but there was sorrow in it. \u201cThen I\u2019ll send word to Cadmar of Landras at the inn. Promise me you\u2019ll have a care for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long sea voyage,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll have naught to do but rest idle.\u201d</p><p>Jeanne frowned, a belated thought occurring to her. \u201cWhy is L\u2019Envers sending you alone and in secret? Do you reckon he is hoping to be rid of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, no.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, and there are parts of it that are dangerous to know. But the one who drove the needle into me, the one who bade me go to Cythera and seek out Ptolemy Solon\u2014my mother sent him. He told me as much.\u201d</p><p>She drew a sharp breath. \u201cMelisande?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d I said wryly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jeanne asked in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Solon\u2019s mistress,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d learned that much on my own. Beyond that . . .\u201d I shook my head. \u201cBlessed Elua alone knows. But if he\u2019s willing to help, it\u2019s only because I\u2019m her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelisande,\u201d Jeanne repeated. \u201cName of Elua!\u201d She gave a short laugh. \u201cWhat a piece of irony that would be if Melisande Shahrizai\u2019s intrigues provided the key to Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s salvation.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought about it in those terms.</p><p>Irony be damned. Let the gods laugh, let old scores be settled, let old wounds heal. I was sick unto death of them anyway. All I wanted was to undo this madness. I wanted to erase this grief and confusion that haunted the land. I wanted Terre d\u2019Ange back. I wanted the memories of my loved ones back. I wanted Sidonie back.</p><p>Back in my arms, back in my heart, where she belonged.</p><p>Where we fit so well together.</p><p>\u201cI pray they do,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Jeanne murmured. \u201cElua forgive me, but so do I.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Around midday on the morrow, a message arrived from Jeanne de Mereliot.</p><p>I\u2019d gone for a ride in the early hours of the morning, taking the Bastard outside the city into the countryside, where I could fling back the hood of my cloak and give him free rein to stretch his legs, working off the pent frustrations of our barge trip.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have taken him. It had been pure selfishness on my part. I knew I had to do this alone. Still, it felt good to have the companionship of one living creature.</p><p>The Bastard was blown by the time we returned, his nostrils flaring and his spotted hide damp with sweat. I tipped the ostler at the inn an extra coin to be sure he was well-tended.</p><p>Inside, the message awaited.</p><p>\u201cMessire Cadmar?\u201d The innkeeper passed me a sealed letter. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>I read it and laughed.</p><p>Jeanne had booked passage for me aboard the Aeolia, the self-same Tiberian ship that had brought me to Marsilikos . . . how long ago? Not quite four years. It felt like a lifetime. But then, I had lived a lifetime in those few years.</p><p>The Aeolia was scheduled to depart at dawn the next day. I passed a quiet evening in Marsilikos, nursing tankards of ale and dining on lamb shanks, listening to the continued profound confusion and dismay on the part of my compatriots.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>They hurt.</p><p>They were scared, bewildered, and confused. It worried me. I prayed that L\u2019Envers was able to keep his temper in check, that the delegation he assembled was able to make Ysandre see reason. Because if they weren\u2019t, fear and confusion would begin to give way to anger. L\u2019Envers, the minor lords, and the commonfolk had numbers on their side, but Ysandre had Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion and the Royal Army. If things got ugly, they could get very ugly.</p><p>I slept poorly that night, my dreams troubled, and woke in the dark hour before dawn. A yawning chambermaid fetched me bread and honey to break my fast, and then I fetched the Bastard from the inn\u2019s stable and made my way to the harbor.</p><p>The sky was beginning to lighten by the time I arrived, and I found the Aeolia without any trouble. There was a familiar rotund figure giving orders on her decks.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Captain Oppius!\u201d I called from the dock.</p><p>He leaned over the rails, plump chin quivering. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCadmar of Landras,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Oppius da Lippi\u2019s shrewd eyes narrowed. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re her ladyship\u2019s mysteriously urgent passenger, we\u2019d best get you aboard before someone recognizes that spotted hellion you ride, man!\u201d</p><p>Elua, I was an idiot. To be sure, there were other spotted horses in the realm, but the Bastard was fairly distinctive looking\u2014enough so that if there was any kind of search afoot for poor Prince Imriel who\u2019d lost his wits and gone missing from the City, a man wearing a hood and cloak astride a spotted horse in this heat would be an easy target for suspicion. It was sheer dumb luck that I hadn\u2019t been noticed earlier.</p><p>It made me realize that despite my protestations, I wasn\u2019t thinking at the height of clarity these days. I dismounted and unslung my saddlebags, making myself breathe slowly while Oppius\u2019 men hurried to lower the plank. Of course the Bastard balked at being led aboard, and I had to use my cloak to bind his eyes. Step by trembling step, bare-headed and exposed, I managed to coax him up the plank and into the hold, all the while conscious that the sun was rising and sailors were beginning to stir around the harbor. I didn\u2019t permit myself to heave a sigh of relief until we were both safely aboard, the Bastard was hidden from view, and I was able to don my cloak.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Captain Oppius strolled toward me with his rolling waddle as I emerged from the hold, pale and shaking. He extended his hand. \u201cCadmar of Landras, is it?\u201d</p><p>I clasped his hand. \u201cUntil we\u2019re at sea, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard some odd things about you.\u201d Oppius tilted his head. \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s precious little news out of Terre d\u2019Ange these days that isn\u2019t odd as all hell.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know, my lord captain. All too well.\u201d</p><p>Oppius studied me long enough that I began to grow anxious, then his plump face broke into a grin. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t seem like you\u2019re raving, and the gods above know if there\u2019s anyone in this city with a sane head left on her shoulders, it\u2019s the Lady\u2019s daughter.\u201d He clapped my shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Cythera.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d ridden out one of the worst storms of my life in a ship under Oppius da Lippi\u2019s command. He was an able captain, one of the best, and though his men mocked him gently behind his back, they respected him and worked with cheerful efficiency. We were underway in short order.</p><p>Once we cleared the harbor where the last of Quintilius Rousse\u2019s ships was anchored, I shed my cloak. I stood in the stern of the ship, getting accustomed once more to the roll of the deck beneath my feet, the snap and rustle of the sails, watching the golden Dome of the Lady dwindle behind us.</p><p>Another departure.</p><p>Another leavetaking.</p><p>It was to have been the last voyage I ever undertook in my life, this journey to Cythera. The one that paid at long last for all my mother\u2019s sins. One way or another, I\u2019d meant to return with Melisande in chains, leading her to her execution. I hadn\u2019t looked forward to it. Sidonie was right; it was a lot to ask. But I would have done it. For our sake, yes; and for the sake of all those who had fallen during the Skaldi invasion, for the sake of those who survived and endured. Claude de Monluc, who had lost his father. Grainne, Lady of the Dalriada, who had lost her twin brother. Poor, pitiful Jean Le Blanc, whose wife had taken her own life after the abuse she\u2019d suffered at the hands of the Skaldi.</p><p>All of them.</p><p>And now, instead, I was setting out to beg my mother\u2019s aid to save Terre d\u2019Ange and everyone I loved. It wasn\u2019t a piece of irony. It was somewhat so far beyond irony, so vast, that I couldn\u2019t even comprehend it. All I could do was pray, helplessly, that Melisande Shahrizai did indeed love her son that much.</p><p>It was a long journey, but at least the weather held as summer wore on toward early autumn. We followed the warmth, heading southward along the coast of Caerdicca Unitas. I kept my promise to Jeanne and didn\u2019t press myself as hard. I kept up the Cassiline disciplines, but I didn\u2019t practice obsessively.</p><p>Bit by bit, my strength and endurance returned. The ship\u2019s cook was decent, and Oppius urged me to dine in the captain\u2019s quarters with him. I ate well, putting on weight and muscle, until I began to look like myself and not a victim of famine. When I went shirtless in the sun\u2019s warmth, my ribs no longer protruded. My skin grew brown, contrasting with the shiny pink scars.</p><p>You needn\u2019t look so tempting.</p><p>This scarred thing?</p><p>The first time he saw me bare-chested, Oppius let out a low whistle. \u201cJupiter Optimus! What happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d I said.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve time.\u201d</p><p>I spent long hours dicing and talking with Oppius. I learned that the Aeolia had been in port to pick up a shipment of Namarrese wine that had never arrived, mysteriously diverted to Carthage. Jeanne de Mereliot had found him at loose ends, willing to take a commission to carry a single passenger to Cythera. She\u2019d paid him a great deal of money to do it. I hoped I\u2019d be able to make good on it someday.</p><p>Over the course of our journey, we spent a good deal of time speculating about Carthage. I told Oppius what I knew, leaving out the Unseen Guild. I\u2019d not told anyone but L\u2019Envers about the Guild. If there was a danger, I reckoned at least he could take his chances.</p><p>To my surprise, Oppius wasn\u2019t inclined to disbelieve me. \u201cBad magic,\u201d he said, making a sign against ill luck. \u201cSailors are a superstitious lot, but we\u2019ve seen a lot of odd things in our time. I don\u2019t like the sound of this. If Carthage conquers the west, they\u2019re going to turn their eyes eastward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about Ptolemy Solon?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>Oppius pursed his lips. \u201cA bit. In Cythera, they call him the Wise Ape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d I said, startled.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThe Wise Ape. He\u2019s got a name for being a deep scholar, dabbling in all manner of arcane study. Got a name for being ugly as sin, too. But fair,\u201d he added. \u201cCythera\u2019s been plagued by troubles in the past. It\u2019s been occupied so many times, you\u2019d have Hellenes and Ephesians at each other\u2019s throats, Akkadians trying to quash them all. It\u2019s been peaceful since Solon was appointed Governor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a mistress?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Oppius steepled his fingers over his belly. \u201cThe Paphian goddess come back to earth to unite with her divine husband. Venus and Vulcan, the goddess of love and the twisted smith. I\u2019ve heard that rumor.\u201d He gave me one of his shrewd looks. \u201cYour mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to credit,\u201d I said. \u201cBut so it seems.\u201d</p><p>We rounded the tip of Caerdicca Unitas and turned eastward. Carthage lay somewhere behind us. Carthage and Sidonie. I could feel it like a tug on my heart. The farther I sailed from her, the more it ached. Memories haunted me. We\u2019d made love in the bathtub the day Astegal had arrived in the City of Elua. I don\u2019t dislike him, Sidonie had said, sliding atop me. Just don\u2019t agree to wed him, I\u2019d said in reply.</p> <p>Gods.</p><p>She\u2019d laughed and kissed me, promised me that she wouldn\u2019t. And then the world had changed beneath a bloody moon, and Sidonie had sailed merrily away with Astegal while the entire City cheered and I lay tied to a bed, chafing my wrists and ankles raw, screaming about Cythera.</p><p>I wanted Astegal dead.</p><p>I\u2019d wanted men dead before. Berlik. He had killed Dorelei, killed our unborn son. I\u2019d sworn vengeance on him. But in the end, I\u2019d understood what he had done, and why. In the end, he sought his own death as penance, and I\u2019d wept after I\u2019d slain him. I hadn\u2019t told many people that.</p><p>There were others.</p> <p>There was the Mahrkagir. His death had seemed unthinkable\u2014his very name meant \u201cConqueror of Death.\u201d I\u2019d prayed for it, though. We all did in the zenana. I\u2019d prayed, too, for the death of Jagun, the Tatar warlord who had made me his plaything, put his brand on me. I\u2019d felt awe at the Mahrkagir\u2019s death, but I\u2019d gloated over Jagun\u2019s.</p><p>And there was another man who had stolen a woman and forced her into marriage, the Duke of Valpetra. Gods. I\u2019d played a role in his death. I\u2019d not even known the man, but I\u2019d hated him for what he\u2019d done. After he\u2019d taken her, he\u2019d stood before the Prince of Lucca, the girl\u2019s wrist clamped in his hand, and threatened to kill her. I\u2019d ridden them down and cut off his hand at the wrist, freeing her. Helena. That was her name. I hadn\u2019t known her, either. But I remembered the searing look of despair and pride on her face.</p><p>In an awful way, this was worse.</p><p>Astegal hadn\u2019t taken Sidonie against her will\u2014he\u2019d taken her will away. Her mind, her very heart. All of her. He had violated her in the deepest, most profound sense. It terrified me to think what it would do to her. All of that fearless lack of inhibition, that frank, fierce passion that startled and delighted me to this day . . . Blessed Elua have mercy, if Astegal destroyed that, if he made Sidonie despise herself for it, I would kill him slowly.</p><p>Days passed, one by one.</p><p>Cythera drew nigh.</p> <p>The sight of the isle\u2019s rocky coastline struck me like a fist to the gut. My mother was there. I hadn\u2019t seen her since I was eleven years old. When I had, I\u2019d thrown her crimes in her face, and then I\u2019d left. And in all the thinking I\u2019d done on this long voyage, I hadn\u2019t let myself think about actually seeing her in the flesh. Now I did. It made me feel sick and uncertain.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Oppius laid a hand on my shoulder as the harbor of Paphos hove into view on a fair morning.</p><p>My nails bit into the ship\u2019s railing. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>It was a small place, Paphos, smaller than I\u2019d expected. A pretty little harbor city nestled in the lee of a mountain range. It looked peaceful. There were a few trade-ships, many fishing vessels. A small fortress guarded the outer entrance to the harbor, and beyond it was a modest palace. A palisade running the length of the harbor, a lively marketplace. Pleasant-looking villas, apartments of pale golden brick. Temples. The sunken bowl of an open-air theatre.</p><p>I tried to imagine my mother strolling the palisade with a man ugly enough to be nicknamed the Wise Ape, flanked by attendants with parasols. I shook my head. I couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>We sailed into the harbor unchallenged. Oppius ordered the sails struck and we went to oars, gliding toward the docks. A handful of mounted men emerged from the fortress, riding along the palisade. By the time Oppius\u2019 men had secured the Aeolia, they were waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cState your business!\u201d the leader called in Hellene.</p><p>\u201cGods, this feels familiar, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Oppius murmured to me. \u201cDelivering a passenger,\u201d he called back to the Cytheran harbor-master. \u201cBut I\u2019m eager for trade if there are contracts to be had.\u201d</p> <p>The harbor-master laughed. \u201cOh, always. Come ashore, then!\u201d</p><p>My legs trembled as I disembarked. Now that I was here, I wished I had another day to think and prepare. I braced myself for the harbor-master\u2019s reaction when he saw Melisande Shahrizai\u2019s face reflected in mine.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t quite what I expected.</p><p>He whistled through his teeth. \u201cAh, I see! One of hers, eh?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. \u201cI\u2019ve come to petition the Governor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolon, eh?\u201d The harbor-master blinked. He was a slight fellow with pock-marked olive skin and an accent that reminded me of Canis\u2019. \u201cAll right, then. No doubt he\u2019ll see you. He\u2019s always interested in curiosities. You\u2019re that, no doubt.\u201d He watched the Bastard being led ashore. \u201cNice horse. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCadmar,\u201d I said. \u201cCadmar of Landras.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>The harbor-master, whose name was Mehmed, had one of his men direct me to a suitable lodging-house; it was not an inn, but a gracious villa overlooking the western edge of the harbor, surrounded by bougainvillea and tall, swaying date palms.</p><p>It was owned by a widow named Nuray. Her eyes widened at the sight of me, but she said nothing, only bowed and escorted me to my quarters, which were airy and pleasant and well-appointed.</p><p>I was in the city of Paphos, breathing the same air as my mother.</p><p>It felt very, very strange.</p><p>Mehmed had promised to bear word of my request to Ptolemy Solon. Oppius had promised not to set sail without my blessing.</p><p>I tended to the Bastard myself, refusing the aid of Nuray\u2019s stable-lad. The Bastard suffered my attentions, eyeing me with a look of deep reproach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said to him. \u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>What had I been thinking? I shouldn\u2019t have subjected him to a lengthy sea voyage. It hadn\u2019t been necessary. I hadn\u2019t wanted to be alone, that\u2019s all. Weeks without exercise, without sunlight. The Bastard was in worse shape than I was now.</p><p>And why had I given Mehmed a false name? I wasn\u2019t entirely sure. One of hers, he\u2019d said. One. What did that mean?</p><p>I didn\u2019t know and it made me uneasy. I didn\u2019t trust myself. Driven by the memories of my madness, the urgency of my cause, I\u2019d been careless. I thought about Bodeshmun the horologist, aligning his mirrors in the City of Elua with exacting care. Thought about him smiling into his beard when Sidonie and I reviewed his preparations, sure in his knowledge of what was to come.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t afford to be careless.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t afford to make mistakes.</p><p>So I waited. I availed myself of the villa\u2019s baths. Nuray sent a laundress for my clothing, all of it salt-stained and foul. While it dried in the sunlight of a hidden courtyard, I sat on a terrace above the harbor, wrapped in a thick linen robe, and ate a luncheon of grilled octopus, potatoes cooked in olive oil, and sausage seasoned with coriander. I watched waves breaking over a rock formation westward, foam jetting skyward. There was a place, only a few leagues away, where it was said the Hellene goddess of love had first touched mortal soil.</p><p>I inhaled the sea air, the same air my mother breathed. A moist, salty tang, sweetened by blooming flowers and ripening fruit. Salt and sweet. My mind wandered. I remembered kneeling for Sidonie, wearing her discarded blindfold. The tap of the tawse between my shoulder blades. Her fingers, loosing the fabric of the blindfold, forgiving me. Her scent, salt and honey. The smile in her voice as she bade me do penance. Ah, Elua! The love in it. I\u2019d done my penance with pleasure.</p><p>The taste of her.</p><p>Gods, it hurt.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d A Cytheran voice speaking Hellene, the same soft accent that blended different cultures. It belonged to a young woman, one of Nuray\u2019s servants. \u201cThere is a message for you.\u201d</p><p>The sun sparkled on the sea. I straightened. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She bowed. \u201cThe Governor wishes you to dine with him this evening. He will see you at sunset.\u201d</p><p>When it came time, I went.</p><p>I was apprehensive. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I rode the Bastard along the palisade, pacing him slowly. The sun was hovering low over the harbor, drenching everything in liquid gold. Somewhere, my mother was here. I wondered if I would see her tonight. The thought made my skin prickle.</p><p>The palace was a charming structure built for pleasure, not defensibility. Its high, arched doors and windows took advantage of the cool sea breezes. I was received courteously and escorted into a salon overlooking the harbor, the setting sun framed in its windows.</p><p>Ptolemy Solon was there.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>The Governor of Cythera was a small man with brown skin and a wizened face, coarse silver hair. One could see at once where the nickname had come from. His brown eyes were round and luminous, ringed by wrinkles. Wrinkles bracketed his wide mouth. Ugly, yes. Also very difficult to read. He regarded me without speaking.</p><p>I bowed to him. \u201cWell met, my lord. Thank you for your hospitality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCadmar of Landras,\u201d Ptolemy Solon said mildly. \u201cDo you know, that had me stumped for the better part of an hour.\u201d He tapped his skull. \u201cAnd I never forget anything. Landras. It\u2019s where you grew up, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d The round eyes blinked. \u201cWell met, Prince Imriel de la Courcel.\u201d</p><p>I fought the urge to glance around. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may call me Solon.\u201d He gave a quick smile. \u201cShe\u2019s not here, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed a little. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here, of course. On Cythera.\u201d Solon poured wine from a ewer into two cups. \u201cBut she maintains her own villa. I thought it best if we spoke first in private. You did say you\u2019d come to petition me, and I\u2019m quite interested in taking the measure of a young man callous enough to betray his mother unto her death, yet with the incredible temerity to beg her aid when his plans went awry.\u201d He beckoned. \u201cCome, sit and take a glass of wine with me.\u201d</p><p>I accepted, taking a seat at the table beneath the window. He sat opposite me. \u201cAre you aware of her crimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He took a sip of wine. \u201cStill.\u201d</p><p>I gazed out the window. Ships bobbed in the harbor, the sun-drenched water making it seem as though they floated on a lake of fire. \u201cWhat would you have me say?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes. I accepted a charge to bring my mother to justice. Thousands of people died because Melisande Shahrizai committed high treason. She was condemned to death before I was even born. I can\u2019t go anywhere in the realm without someone calling me traitor-spawn, without someone telling me how a loved one died for my mother\u2019s sins. I can\u2019t wed the woman I love.\u201d I looked back at Solon. \u201cAnd yes, my plans went awry. And now, quite frankly, I\u2019m desperate.\u201d</p><p>He sipped his wine. \u201cAt least you\u2019re honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you send Sunjata?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d The light of the setting sun glimmered in his round eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s your mother\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you forge a silver needle and lave it in the sweat of a madman\u2019s brow and the slime of a toad?\u201d I asked wryly.</p><p>The sunlight in his eyes flared. \u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>I showed him the healed scars around my wrists. \u201cI had to be tied to my bed.\u201d</p><p>Solon examined the scars. \u201cInteresting,\u201d he mused. He patted my hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. It was the only way I could think of. And to be perfectly honest, I wasn\u2019t sure it would work. The needle or the madness,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me what it was like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorrible,\u201d I said briefly. \u201cWill you aid me if I do?\u201d</p><p>The sun\u2019s bottom rim dipped below the horizon, its light shifting from gold to orange. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided,\u201d Solon said in a candid tone. \u201cIt depends on you and what you offer. It depends on your mother and what she wishes. It depends on the axes of power and knowledge involved in the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Unseen Guild?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cNo, no, no. I\u2019ve naught to do with them.\u201d He waved a dismissive hand. \u201cOh, I know all about it, of course. My kinsman Ptolemy Dikaios made me the offer long ago. I accepted the training, but I refused to swear allegiance when it was over. Much like yourself, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d I said.</p><p>Solon shrugged. \u201cKnowledge is power. And yet power corrupts. Not all who wield it, but most. Still, I had a hunger for knowledge. And so I decided long ago that I would seek it out. That I would gather and amass it, and assign myself the greatest challenge of all: to wield it seldom or never in the service of my own desires.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cThat, my lord, is passing odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d He blinked. \u201cAnd yet consider your mother. She amassed great knowledge. She used it as a tool to further her own goals. She plunged a nation into war. She tore her own family apart. In the end she lost everything.\u201d</p><p>Those weren\u2019t exactly the words of a man besotted. I frowned, unsure what to make of Ptolemy Solon. The sun sank lower beneath the horizon. A young woman in loose, flowing robes came with a taper to kindle the lamps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is a fruit that grows south of Carthage,\u201d Solon said when the girl had departed. \u201cWhen it is green, it is poisonous. Only when it has fully ripened may it be safely eaten. I sampled it once in my younger days. There was a heady sense of danger in it. Once I\u2019d eaten it, I craved more. Your mother is like that fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely.\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cI grow old. I thought myself beyond the point of succumbing to such temptations. The fruit, I withstood. My vow to myself, I have kept. But to my chagrin, I find I am unable to resist the delicious, sinful pleasure of groveling at your mother\u2019s feet.\u201d He laughed at my expression. \u201cAh, Imriel! The world is full of unexpected delights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElua knows that\u2019s true,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>The upper rim of the sun vanished beneath the sea, leaving a ruddy glow behind it. Servants came with covered dishes, lifting the domes to reveal grape leaves stuffed with rice and lamb, fillets of mullet in wine, crusty bread, and a creamy pink sauce made with fish roe. Solon sniffed appreciatively, his broad nostrils widening.</p><p>\u201cHappiness,\u201d he said.</p><p>I took a long drink of my wine. \u201cHappiness, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the highest form of wisdom.\u201d Solon tore off a piece of bread, dipping it in the roe sauce. He chewed slowly, savoring it. \u201cThat is the totality of what I have learned in my pursuit of knowledge, Imriel de la Courcel.\u201d</p> <p>I tried the roe sauce, emulating him. It was salty and delicious, velvet on the tongue. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Solon popped a grape leaf\u2013wrapped delicacy into his mouth. \u201cOh, yes. I have applied this learning here in Cythera since I was given the governorship.\u201d His jaw worked, and he swallowed with obvious pleasure. His brown eyes glowed. \u201cI\u2019ve sought to make my people happy. I\u2019ve listened to the concerns of all and brokered peace among them. I\u2019ve implemented just laws. Do you know, any man, woman, or child sold into slavery in Cythera must be paid a fair wage? Fair enough that they might buy their freedom in seven years\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunjata,\u201d I said.</p><p>He nodded with glee. \u201cEven so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolon.\u201d I pushed my plate away. \u201cI am interested in your thoughts. Indeed, I spent some months in Tiberium studying philosophy with Master Piero di Bonci, and I would have gladly spent longer. Another time, I would like nothing better than to discuss the virtues of happiness with you. But my country has been torn apart by Carthage\u2019s magics. Terre d\u2019Ange hovers on the brink of instability. And Sidonie de la Courcel, whom I love beyond all reason, has been ensorceled into believing she is meant to wed an ambitious Carthaginian general\u2014\u201d</p><p>Solon speared a piece of poached mullet with his fork. \u201cShe did.\u201d</p> <p>My voice rose. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>He chewed and swallowed. \u201cSome two weeks ago. I imagine Carthage will have launched their invasion by now. We ought to get word any day.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie had married Astegal.</p><p>I felt sick.</p><p>\u201cEat.\u201d Solon pushed my plate back toward me. There was sympathy in his wise ape\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve a feeling you\u2019re going to need your strength. Undoing Carthage\u2019s spell won\u2019t be an easy task.\u201d</p><p>I stabbed at my fish. \u201cThen you\u2019ll help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d He braced his elbows on the table. \u201cWhat are you offering?\u201d</p><p>I forced a bite of mullet down my throat. \u201cMy mother\u2019s sentence commuted to exile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo pardon?\u201d Solon asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said shortly. I thought about riding into the City upon returning from my excursion to Vralia. The black armbands, the down-turned thumbs. The hard, anguished stares on the faces of the bereaved. \u201cNo pardon.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll think on it. Will you see her willingly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have the final say?\u201d I asked grimly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Solon blinked at me. \u201cShe has the first say, but the final say is mine. I freely confess myself a man besotted, but it has not bereaved me of my wits.\u201d He gave a slow smile. \u201cI believe I am the first man to say no to your mother from time to time. And oddly enough, I do believe she respects me for it.\u201d</p><p>I took another bite of mullet. \u201cI\u2019ll see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He swabbed another piece of bread with roe sauce. \u201cBecause I would have surely refused my aid if you hadn\u2019t. One of her people will come to fetch you in the morning. I hope that you will not be unkind. This will be a long and anxious night of waiting for her.\u201d</p><p>I fought down a surge of impatience. \u201cI will try, my lord. But I have passed a good many anxious nights myself of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Solon said. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think you do. You\u2019ve built a pleasant place here on Cythera. Imagine it altered overnight at a single stroke, plunged into uncertainty and confusion. Imagine my mother leaving you gladly for a man you despise. Imagine knowing that all her formidable will and intelligence have been violated and turned against her. Because if Carthage succeeds in Aragonia and Terre d\u2019Ange, this will be only the beginning. Astegal dreams of empire. Cythera would be a pretty plum.\u201d</p><p>Solon snorted. \u201cWould Carthage be a worse master than Khebbel-im-Akkad? One overlord is much the same as another. You speak as a man whose country has never been a vassal nation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I set down my fork. \u201cAnd I would like to remain thus. Do you wish me to beg, my lord? I will.\u201d I got out of the chair and knelt at his feet. \u201cYou spoke of happiness. For the first time in my life, I had it. And it has been snatched away from me. I beg you, please, to tell me how to undo what was done. I will give you anything in my possession. I will do anything in my power that you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d His round eyes glinted. \u201cWhat if I told you I knew of a spell that could give one man the semblance of another? What if I asked for your beauty in exchange for my ugliness? Would you give it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said promptly.</p><p>Solon\u2019s brows rose. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>I sat back on my heels and spread my arms. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He regarded me a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re fortunate that I have spent my life adhering to the wisdom of restraint. Or perhaps merely that your mother would take it amiss to find me wearing her son\u2019s face.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want your face, Imriel de la Courcel. What I want is to choose wisely in this. If I aid you, there are those who will recognize my handiwork. Undoing the spell will be difficult. If you fail, it is I\u2014and Cythera\u2014who will pay the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fail,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cStubborn.\u201d Solon smiled a little. \u201cMuch like your mother. And impulsive, much unlike her. Sleep, and go to see her. Whatever you think of her, Melisande is not made of stone. For ten years and more, she has grieved deeply, knowing what befell you when you were taken as a child, knowing what role her own actions played in it. I do believe it is the pain that finally taught her a measure of compassion.\u201d</p><p>I got wearily to my feet. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glinted again. \u201cGiven that she appears ready to forgive you for seeking her life, I do believe I am right.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>I spent a fitful night, tossing restlessly in my bed at the widow Nuray\u2019s lodging-house, going over my conversation with Solon in my mind. I didn\u2019t think it had gone well. He was an odd and disconcerting man.</p><p>Small wonder my mother liked him.</p><p>At least it was better than dwelling on the sure knowledge that Sidonie had wed Astegal. I couldn\u2019t think about that without a tide of black, murderous rage rising in my heart, and the feeling was uncomfortably close to my madness.</p><p>I rose early and broke my fast, then spent the better part of an hour practicing my Cassiline forms in Nuray\u2019s garden, trying to quiet my mind. I forced myself to focus on the movements; telling the hours, they called it. Step after flowing step, tracing arcs with my blade. It worked well enough that I didn\u2019t notice my mother\u2019s messenger enter the garden.</p><p>\u201cInteresting, that,\u201d an insouciant voice said. \u201cWhat do you call it?\u201d</p><p>I halted and turned, then stared.</p><p>It was a young man around my age. He\u2019d spoken in Hellene with a native accent, and he wore billowy trousers caught at the ankles and an embroidered Cytheran vest, but he was D\u2019Angeline. His face was narrower than mine, and his eyes a lighter shade of blue, but the stamp of House Shahrizai was there in the angle of his cheekbones, the sensuous mouth.</p><p>One of hers.</p><p>\u201cTelling the hours,\u201d I said stupidly. \u201cIt\u2019s a Cassiline practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassilines!\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about them.\u201d He came over to greet me, extending a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Leander, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d I clasped his hand, frowning in perplexity. \u201cAre we . . . kin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistantly, by way of the wrong side of the blanket.\u201d Leander laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d He studied my face. \u201cBy the Goddess! You are her son. You look just like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no goddess,\u201d I said wryly.</p><p>\u201cTouchy, touchy.\u201d He arched one brow. \u201cIt\u2019s just a saying, my lovely. Very common in these parts. I wasn\u2019t speaking of her ladyship.\u201d</p><p>I bit my tongue on a sharp retort and sheathed my blade. \u201cHave you come to take me to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d Leander inclined his head. He had the blue-black Shahrizai hair, too. It was plaited in a handful of braids, caught up at the crown of his head. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s villa lay in the foothills of the mountains, a short ride from the city proper. As we rode, Leander told me somewhat of his history, or rather, his family\u2019s history. Many years ago, Melisande\u2019s father, Casimar Shahrizai, had embarked on an illicit affair with the wife of another Kusheline lord, the Baron de Maignard. During their affair, Victoire de Maignard had gotten with child and delivered a boy. Casimar had demanded she acknowledge the boy as his. Being of Azzallese descent and proud, Victoire had refused. They had quarrelled bitterly.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Leander\u2019s generous mouth twisted. \u201cCasimar ruined my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWith money.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cHe got my great-grandmother\u2019s husband to invest in a scheme that left him penniless. House Maignard was destroyed. The Baron killed himself in shame. My great-grandmother\u2019s family shunned her for her folly. House Shahrizai turned their backs on her. She became a laundress.\u201d</p><p>He went on to tell me how my mother had heard the story as a child. When she came of age and into estates of her own, she sought out the fallen Maignard clan and offered to buy them out of penury. The price for her generosity was their loyalty to her and her alone.</p><p>\u201cGreat-grandmother Victoire accepted it,\u201d Leander said cynically. \u201cEven Azza\u2019s pride would bend under the weight of a thousand vats of laundry. Our family\u2019s been in your mother\u2019s service ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Leander gestured expansively. \u201cOh, I know, I\u2019m meant to think exile from Terre d\u2019Ange is a hell unto itself. But look around you, man! It\u2019s a little paradise here. I\u2019ve lived here since I was a boy. All of that other business happened long before I was born. And I\u2019ll tell you . . .\u201d He fingered a ruby stud in his earlobe and smirked. \u201cYour mother\u2019s a generous patron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she is,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Leander drew rein. \u201cAll right. You want to hear a piece of Maignard family lore?\u201d His expression hardened. \u201cBy all accounts, Casimar Shahrizai was a nasty piece of work. He was charming, but vindictive as all hell. He spent an ungodly amount of money to ruin the old baron. When you mother made her offer, she swore in Kushiel\u2019s name that she would never act out of mere spite. Insofar as I know, she never has.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Leander shrugged again. \u201cNow you know.\u201d</p><p>It was a strange feeling. I\u2019d never thought of my mother as a child, as someone\u2019s daughter. I\u2019d never thought about the forces that had shaped her, like a charming and vicious father. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a creeping sense of admiration for the young woman she had been. Laying the groundwork for plans that would eventually shake the realm to its core. Adhering to her own twisted principles of integrity.</p><p>And a sense of loss, too\u2014for the person my mother might have been if she hadn\u2019t been so goddamned ambitious.</p><p>All of us had monsters hidden within us.</p><p>I\u2019d seen the face of mine in my madness, turning me against everyone I loved, relishing their pain. I\u2019d seen a future in which my son, Dorelei\u2019s and my son, had become a tyrant, cruel and ruthless.</p><p>We reached the villa. It was a sprawling place, sunlit and gracious. The foothills were terraced, grapes ripening on the vine. The scent of cypress wafted down from the mountains. Leander and I dismounted in the courtyard. A cheerful Cytheran stable-lad came to take our mounts. Leander ruffled his hair, gave him a kiss on the cheek. The stable-lad ducked his head and smiled.</p><p>\u201cAll is permitted in her ladyship\u2019s household,\u201d Leander commented.</p><p>He led me through the villa. It had mosaic tile floors that were exquisite, depicting the Hellene goddess of love in various adventures. I heard the sound of laughter. A young woman darted from a hallway, her eyes blindfolded, and blundered into Leander. He laughed and caught her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLeander,\u201d she said decisively, raising her blind face and sniffing. \u201cI know your pomade.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell done.\u201d He kissed her brow. \u201cHurry!\u201d</p><p>A dark-skinned young man emerged from the hallway, his eyes bound, stumbling after her. Leander stepped deftly out of his way. \u201cAh,\u201d he said with a trace of melancholy. \u201cHe puts me in mind of Sunjata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cVery well.\u201d His mouth quirked. \u201cWe trained together, Sunjata and I. \u2019Tis a barbaric custom, gelding. It happened at Carthage\u2019s hands. Now her ladyship seeks to acquire them earlier, before it can be done. And his apish lordship has banned it at her urging, at least on Cythera.\u201d</p><p>The sound of laughter receded.</p><p>I heard a fountain instead.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Leander halted at the entrance to an inner courtyard. His light-blue eyes met mine. \u201cI will go no farther with you. Her ladyship awaits.\u201d</p><p>I entered the courtyard.</p> <p>I saw her.</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre was right. My mother\u2019s beauty hadn\u2019t dimmed. It had only changed again. Melisande lifted her head and gazed at me, tears brightening her glorious eyes, the deep blue hue of a twilit sea. There were faint lines etched at the corners, a few threads of bright silver strewn in her black hair. There was somewhat else, too. A well of sorrow and regret, a humanity that had been lacking. A goddess rendered mortal by time and compassion, all the more poignant for it.</p><p>My mother breathed my name. \u201cImriel.\u201d</p><p>I walked toward her. \u201cMother,\u201d I said, my voice sounding strange to my ears. I had never called her that. I\u2019d never called anyone that.</p><p>She touched my cheek, her fingers hesitant. \u201cYou look older than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two,\u201d I said, my throat tight. \u201cBut on most days it feels like more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to loosen the tightness. \u201cI don\u2019t . . .\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. You know why I\u2019m here.\u201d She nodded without speaking. \u201cSolon accused me of callousness and temerity. I told him it was desperation. But you sent for me, too. Sunjata did your bidding. Knowing that I\u2019d sworn to bring you to justice, you sent for me. So . . . here I am. Begging for your help.\u201d I licked my dry lips. \u201cAnd I will tell you what I told Solon. Terre d\u2019Ange is willing to commute your sentence to exile. I can\u2019t offer more than that on behalf of the realm. But anything else in my power, anything you wish of me, I will do.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity raised my mother\u2019s winged brows. It made her look younger. \u201cWhat do you imagine I might ask for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I glanced around the courtyard. Flowering shrubs blossomed in profusion. The fountain splashed merrily, water sparkling in the sunlight. \u201cMe,\u201d I said. \u201cYou might ask me to join you in exile.\u201d</p><p>Melisande\u2019s curious expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>An invisible band around my chest tightened. I thought about Astegal and his heavy-lidded smile. Sidonie. Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin gazing at me in perplexity, their memories stolen. The rising tide of unease on the streets of Marsilikos, Quintilius Rousse\u2019s ships in the harbor. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, tears stinging my eyes. \u201cIf it meant undoing Carthage\u2019s spell.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, she laughed, a mixture of humor and sadness in it. \u201cAh, Elua! Imriel, I\u2019ve given you enough reasons to hate me already. Why would I choose one more?\u201d My mother shook her head. \u201cCome. Sit and listen a moment.\u201d</p><p>There was a curved marble bench near the fountain. We sat on opposite ends of it. Melisande gazed at the falling water.</p> <p>\u201cI mean to persuade Solon to aid you,\u201d she said without preamble. \u201cAnd I believe he will. I wish you to know that I expect no gratitude for it. Not from you, not from Terre d\u2019Ange. I do not imagine this will buy me forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you making atonement?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>Her gaze shifted to me. Gods, she really was beautiful. \u201cPerhaps, in a way. Although you may not believe it, I do love Terre d\u2019Ange. I could have controlled Waldemar Selig if he had proved victorious. I would have built somewhat glorious in the aftermath and turned his victory into my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreams of empire,\u201d I murmured. \u201cYou\u2019d like Astegal of Carthage.\u201d</p><p>She gave a faint, wry smile. \u201cProbably. But I don\u2019t care to watch him usurp the country I once dreamed of ruling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA true patriot,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Melisande shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to that. Still, there are ways in which I have changed. When you were taken . . .\u201d She fell silent a moment. \u201cI learned what it was to suffer. To hate. To be filled with fury and helplessness. To regret. And afterward . . .\u201d She looked away. \u201cPh\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay told me I did not wish to know what befell you in that place. And yet I was torn between a fear of knowing and a need to know. In the end, I couldn\u2019t bear it. I found a Caerdicci woman who had been there and had her sent to the Temple of Asherat. She told me.\u201d She looked back at me. \u201cAnd then it was worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrote to me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou wrote that if you could undo what was done to me, you would do anything in the world.\u201d</p><p>The shadow behind her eyes lightened. \u201cYou read my letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I propped my elbows on my knees, clasping my hands between them. \u201cNot for a long time, not until years after you disappeared. But I did. At first I tried to burn them,\u201d I added. \u201cAfter that, Ph\u00e8dre kept them for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPh\u00e8dre.\u201d My mother\u2019s rich voice held too many things to decipher. She gazed into the distance. \u201cThe gods must laugh. And yet I begin to think mayhap they hold a shred of mercy for me. I cannot take back my deeds. I cannot undo your hurt. But this at least I can do, and pray that it leavens the burden of regret. So you see, I do not pretend to selflessness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I said. \u201cSince it has the added benefit of removing the sentence of death hanging over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Her brows rose again. \u201cBut if I had not acted to protect you, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. You would have forgotten all about your vow.\u201d</p><p>I studied my clasped hands, thinking about a world in which I had forgotten my promise to bring my mother to justice. Forgotten Sidonie. \u201cWill you answer a question truthfully?\u201d I asked. \u201cCould you have prevented it? Carthage\u2019s spell?\u201d</p><p>My mother didn\u2019t answer for a long time.</p><p>I lifted my head and gazed at her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said finally. \u201cNot without Solon\u2019s help. I only knew the rumors Sunjata passed to me. It was Solon who pieced them together. He\u2019s studied a great many arcane arts.\u201d She gave another wry smile. \u201cBut he kept the full truth of it from me, knowing it would mean you wouldn\u2019t come seeking my life. All I asked was that whatever it was, he find a way to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolon,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI could kill him for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you don\u2019t,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cSince he\u2019s your best hope.\u201d</p><p>I eyed her. \u201cWhat would you have done if you had known? Would you have let it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said with surprising candor. \u201cWhat if I hadn\u2019t? What would you have done if I had persuaded Solon to tell me how to avert it? Sent a warning? Would you have believed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI believe I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would you have still sought to drag me back to Terre d\u2019Ange to be executed?\u201d Melisande inquired.</p><p>It was my turn to fall silent. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said at length.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Her shoulders moved in a graceful shrug. \u201cLife is filled with things we may never know. And although you have not asked it of me, I grant you forgiveness for seeking my death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t relish the prospect,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice to know.\u201d My mother sounded more amused than not. Whatever else was true of her, Leander was right. She wasn\u2019t vindictive. She cocked her head. \u201cYsandre\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you laugh?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Her generous lips twitched. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I smiled despite myself. \u201cIt\u2019s not a ploy, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering. I love her. I\u2019ve loved her for a long time. For years we kept it a secret, hoping it would pass. It didn\u2019t. And I truly will do whatever is needful to get her back.\u201d</p><p>The early-autumn sun poured down on us, warm and golden. My mother reached out and touched my hair, running a lock of it between her fingers.</p><p>I let her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she like?\u201d Melisande asked.</p><p>\u201cSidonie?\u201d I smiled again. \u201cDorelei said once that she was like a house without a door. It\u2019s not true, though. Not really. She\u2019s very . . . contained. But there\u2019s a fierceness in her. Once it\u2019s tapped, it\u2019s . . .\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s determined. Passionate. Loyal. Funny, too. Most people don\u2019t know that about her. I didn\u2019t, not for a long time.\u201d My smile faded. \u201cAnd she\u2019s Astegal\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>My mother stroked my hair. \u201cNot for always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I straightened my shoulders. \u201cHer always is mine.\u201d</p><p>Melisande withdrew her touch and regarded me with deep, abiding sorrow. \u201cWill you do me one kindness? I know you\u2019re impatient. And I will send word to Solon seeking his aid immediately. But I would like it very much if you would pass this day with me. I would like, very much, to hear about your life.\u201d</p><p>As much as I wanted to hate her, I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Not in the flesh.</p><p>I could feel the bond between us, blood-deep. I was her son. I had fought against it in more ways than I could count, and there was a great deal of me that owed nothing to her. I was as much Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s son, as much Joscelin\u2019s, as I was hers and my father\u2019s. But deep in my marrow, I knew her touch. I knew she had carried me in her womb. I had read her letters. I knew she had nursed me at her breast, counted my infant fingers and toes, sung me crib-songs, suffering no one else to usurp those duties.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I said.</p><p>My beautiful, damnable mother settled her glorious gaze on me. \u201cThank you,\u201d Melisande said simply.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>It was a pleasant day.</p><p>I would be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019d never understood how my mother had gotten so many folk willingly involved in her intrigues, but the truth was she was a charming and brilliant woman, unexpectedly candid and self-aware. One found oneself wishing to please her out of unthinking instinct.</p><p>To be sure, her household doted on her. It wasn\u2019t just the members of the Maignard clan, of whom there were half a dozen. It was everyone. The Cytheran servants. The freed slaves, many of whom were her pupils.</p><p>I learned that my mother was a master in the Unseen Guild, and aspired to go no higher. Once, she had. She had learned of the Guild\u2019s existence from Anafiel Delaunay many years ago, when he was distraught over the death of Prince Rolande de la Courcel and careless enough to confide in her. She had sought out the Guild on her own and risen quickly within its ranks. If her gambit with Skaldia hadn\u2019t failed, or the attempt to assassinate Ysandre, she would have risen much, much higher.</p><p>Now she contented herself with dabbling. She bought slaves who struck her fancy and gave them their freedom, offering them positions within her household with generous pay. A few took their freedom and fled, but most stayed. In time, she made an offer of Guild training and far greater wealth to those she deemed quick-witted and loyal enough to be useful to her. Then she sent them forth to spy on her behalf.</p><p>Over the course of the day, I learned a few things about the Guild. I learned that there were indeed factions within it. Alliances were formed. Ephesium, looking over its shoulder at powerful Khebbel-im-Akkad, favored the rise of Carthage. Most of Caerdicca Unitas, remembering the lessons of history, opposed it and sought ties to nascent Skaldic states. I learned that the Guild\u2019s origins lay in the east, and that their influence was weak in the western realms.</p><p>Mostly, though, I talked.</p><p>I talked for hours.</p><p>Many of the details of my life she knew. Her spies in Terre d\u2019Ange\u2014and their identities was one thing she wouldn\u2019t divulge to me\u2014had kept her well informed. But Melisande wanted to hear about my life from me.</p><p>And I found myself talking about things that surprised me. How the difficulty of being her son was compounded by measuring myself against the extraordinary heroism of my foster-parents. How I\u2019d learned to let go of that for good when I\u2019d accepted failure in Vralia. How I\u2019d felt in Clunderry after Dorelei and I had learned to love one another on our own terms, watching her belly swell with our child. How I\u2019d grieved for their deaths. How I\u2019d gone from sheer hatred and a cold desire for vengeance to feel a measure of compassion for Berlik at the end.</p><p>When I\u2019d talked myself dry, my mother was very quiet for a time. We were seated in her salon, drinking a cool white wine made on the villa\u2019s grounds. Blue twilight was beginning to fall outside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d Melisande murmured. \u201cElua knows, if I did one good thing in my life, it was binding myself to a promise to allow you to be raised by Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay and that damned Cassiline of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only gift I would accept from you,\u201d I said, remembering what Ph\u00e8dre had told me. \u201cI thank you for it.\u201d</p><p>She glanced out the window. \u201cIt\u2019s growing late. Will you pass the night here?\u201d</p><p>There was a yearning hunger in the question, and fear, too. I found myself wanting to assuage both. I was in her debt. It would be easy, so easy, to offer the simple balm of my presence. And yet in the back of my mind there were black armbands and down-turned thumbs. There was a blood-soaked battlefield. Waldemar Selig had begun to skin Ph\u00e8dre alive there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said.</p><p>Melisande inclined her head. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>And so I left to await word from Ptolemy Solon. The stable-lad that Leander had made blush brought the Bastard around. My mother escorted me to the courtyard herself. In the twilight, her beauty deepened. I thought about her likeness hanging in the Hall of Portraits at the Palace. In her youth, she\u2019d had a beauty as keen and as deadly as a blade. Now, oddly, it cut deeper. Sorrow became her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you on the morrow,\u201d I said awkwardly. \u201cNo doubt you\u2019ll wish to be a part of this intrigue.\u201d</p><p>A wry edge returned to her voice. \u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, holding the Bastard\u2019s reins. He was unusually compliant, still out of sorts from the lengthy sea voyage. \u201cMother . . . why did you name me Imriel? I\u2019ve always wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEloquence of God.\u201d A smile touched her lips. Melisande Shahrizai tilted her head, regarding me in the twilight. \u201cBecause when you were born, for the first time, I understood it. Love as thou wilt,\u201d she said, musing. \u201cI have always adhered to the precept of Blessed Elua in my own way. And yet, until you were born, I didn\u2019t truly know what it was to love another living soul. Beyond thought, beyond reason. And I thought, for once, that the gods were speaking clearly to me.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cI see.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t answer, only laid a hand on the back of my head. I bent toward her and felt the touch of her lips on my brow. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I echoed.</p><p>I rode away in the gathering dusk, my thoughts in turmoil. Unlike Carthage, unlike Alba or even Drujan, there were no arcane arts practiced in Terre d\u2019Ange. And yet, in the space of a single day, I had nearly fallen under my mother\u2019s spell, born of nothing but her own singular presence.</p><p>It had been a pleasant day.</p><p>I wrenched my thoughts away, turning them westward. Toward Carthage, toward Sidonie. I wondered what the nuptial ceremony had been like. I tortured myself with thoughts of Sidonie, willing and eager in Astegal\u2019s bed. I felt the spell of my mother\u2019s presence dissipate, hard resolve settling in its place.</p><p>Still, her kiss lingered.</p> <p>As I drifted into sleep in the widow Nuray\u2019s house, I found myself wondering if I would ever see my mother again once I left Cythera. And I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted the answer to be.</p><p>On the morrow, I rose to find a summons from Solon awaiting, bright and early. I wasted no time, breaking my fast with a couple of ripe apricots, then riding over to the palace.</p><p>Ptolemy Solon was awaiting me in his library, which was one of the largest I\u2019d ever seen. The main chamber was vast, with a high ceiling, tall windows at one end, doors at the other, and twin facing walls lined with bookshelves, ladders propped against each wall. There were alcoves with cubbyholes for scrolls, and smaller, locked chambers.</p><p>In the center of the main chamber, there were long tables suitable for study. Solon was seated at the head of one such table, a book of blank parchment and a pen and inkwell before him. My mother was seated at its opposite end. The vast space dwarfed him, while it seemed to suit her. Nonetheless, it was Solon who glanced up and bade me enter, brown eyes bright in his wizened face.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my lord,\u201d I said, hesitating. \u201cMother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Solon patted the table. \u201cSit. Between Sunjata\u2019s tales of a great mirror being forged and the coming occlusion of the moon, I knew enough to guess at what Carthage intended. Not enough to be certain how it was done. I will need to hear everything you can remember about Carthage\u2019s visit. Everything.\u201d</p><p>I approached and took a seat. \u201cI am most grateful for your aid, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are.\u201d He shot an inscrutable look at my mother, who smiled and raised one brow. Solon gestured at a tray on the table containing a pitcher of water and an array of pastries. \u201cEat. Drink. Tell me everything.\u201d</p> <p>I helped myself to a cup of water, flavored with lemon and honey.</p><p>And I began to talk.</p><p>I told them everything, commencing with my letter to Diokles Agallon. Once again, I didn\u2019t have anything to lose. There wasn\u2019t much about the Guild my mother didn\u2019t know, and I reckoned what she knew, Solon knew. I told them about Agallon\u2019s reply, Carthage\u2019s request. The discussions that had followed, Parliament\u2019s vote. Carthage\u2019s arrival, the exaggerated gift of tribute.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Solon halted me. \u201cDescribe the tribute-gifts in detail.\u201d</p><p>I did to the best of my ability. I hadn\u2019t been paying overmuch attention, being more concerned with Carthage, but Ph\u00e8dre had taught me to train my memory well. I recalled Quintilius Rousse\u2019s deep voice reading the manifest: gold, ivory, and salt, spices, and seedlings, Tyrian purple cloth, furniture.</p><p>\u201cAnd there was the chalice he sent in advance,\u201d I said, remembering. \u201cAnd the painting presented at the banquet.\u201d</p><p>Solon\u2019s round eyes blinked. \u201cDescribe them.\u201d</p><p>I described the carnelian chalice with its joined hands in which Astegal and Ysandre had drunk to one another\u2019s health; the painting made of ground jewels depicting the two of them with their hands clasped in friendship. Solon pursed his lips, his pen scratching on parchment.</p><p>\u201cContinue,\u201d he said when I had finished. \u201cFrom the point of their arrival.\u201d</p><p>I told him about the banquet where the painting had been unveiled, Sunjata\u2019s overture, the gilded coffer, and Gillimas\u2019 veiled words about Cythera. I related Sidonie\u2019s account of Astegal\u2019s offer for her hand, his veiled threats regarding Aragonia, and Ysandre\u2019s diplomatic refusal. My evening in the Night Court with Astegal and the other Carthaginian lords, and my near-smothering of Gillimas to force plain words of truth from him, watching my mother\u2019s lips twitch.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t look amused,\u201d I said to her.</p><p>\u201cHe brought it on himself,\u201d she said complacently. \u201cA skilled Guildsman ought to know better than to mince words with a desperate D\u2019Angeline in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Solon asked her.</p><p>Melisande gazed at me. \u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mother knows her child.\u201d Solon gestured at me. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>I told him everything I could remember about observing Bodeshmun\u2019s preparations the day of the occluded moon. Solon halted me numerous times, pressing me for details. He brought out a book with symbols of the Houses of the Cosmos. I racked my memory, struggling to place them exactly as they\u2019d been aligned on the great mirror in proximity to the mirrors on the City\u2019s walls. His pen scratched furiously, sketching a diagram.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he said when I had finished.</p><p>I told him again, this time dredging up the exact words he\u2019d said to Sidonie. The brief bow he had accorded her. A green gem on a chain swinging into view.</p><p>Solon\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cDescribe it.\u201d</p><p>I tried, but I\u2019d seen it only briefly. All I could tell him was that it was the size of a child\u2019s fist and multifaceted.</p><p>\u201cWere there symbols incised on the facets?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell. But I did see a flash of emerald green the next night, when it happened.\u201d</p><p>He held up one hand. \u201cDon\u2019t rush. Continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we visited Elua\u2019s Square . . .\u201d My voice faltered. \u201cTruly, there wasn\u2019t aught of significance until the following evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d Solon asked.</p><p>My mouth was parched. I took a long drink of water. \u201cSidonie and I quarrelled. I was uneasy. I wanted her to beg Ysandre to call off the spectacle. She didn\u2019t think it was possible without cause. We made up our quarrel that night.\u201d I traced a water-ring on the table with one finger, remembering the feel of her moon-silvered skin against my bare flesh. I hadn\u2019t thought about the fact that our argument might have played some role in this. \u201cIt was the first time we\u2019d argued since we\u2019d become lovers. Do you think it\u2019s significant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Solon said gently. \u201cI don\u2019t. Continue.\u201d</p><p>I relived the night of the spectacle for him. The endless dinner that had preceded it. The details of every dish I could recall. The carriage-ride to Elua\u2019s Square, the throngs that packed the City. The moon\u2019s slow, steady occlusion, and its eerie red hue.</p><p>The long wait, the crowds jostling around the mirror.</p><p>Sunjata\u2019s whisper in my ear, following him.</p><p>In a dispassionate voice, I told him all I could recall. Standing pressed together beneath Elua\u2019s Oak. The searing pain of the needle driven deep into my vitals, the rush of icy fire in my veins. Falling, the world whirling. Sunjata\u2019s voice, telling me to seek Ptolemy Solon\u2019s aid. An emerald glow, a flash of brightness. A gasp from the crowd. Sunjata\u2019s hand tugging the ring from my fingers. Roots writhing like serpents. Sunjata\u2019s voice apologizing for serving two masters. Telling me I was lucky my mother loved me. Telling me to go to Cythera.</p><p>And then the tide of madness swallowing me.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Solon said.</p><p>I closed my eyes and told him again, shutting out the sound of his pen scratching, shutting out everything. This time, there was nothing new. When I had finished, I was drained. I opened my eyes. \u201cDo you wish to hear about the madness now?\u201d</p><p>Solon began to reply, then caught my mother\u2019s warning glance. \u201cNo,\u201d he said in a circumspect tone. \u201cLater, perhaps. Tell me about the ring. Is it significant?\u201d</p><p>Tired as I was, I almost laughed. Sidonie had given it to me before I\u2019d wed Dorelei. When I\u2019d struck out from Skaldia into the unknown in search of Berlik, I\u2019d sent the ring back to Sidonie with a message that I would return to claim it. And when I\u2019d been stuck waist-deep in a Vralian snowbank, bone-weary and frozen and ready to die, it was the thought of that promise that had kept me moving.</p><p>I\u2019d reclaimed it in Alba. At long last, Berlik\u2019s skull was interred, letting Dorelei\u2019s spirit rest peacefully. Sidonie had taken the ring from its resting place on a chain around her neck. She\u2019d undone the clasp and let the chain fall, slid the ring onto my finger. And we had made love like gods, filled with wonder and awe.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA love token?\u201d Solon pressed. \u201cFrom the Queen\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cWhat do you suppose? Yes.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI needed to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure.\u201d I turned to my mother. \u201cWhat did Sunjata mean about serving two masters?\u201d</p><p>A frown knit her graceful brows. \u201c\u2019Tis a long story. To shorten it, Sunjata is a journeyman in my service. But as far as the Guild in Carthage knows, he is a gem-merchant\u2019s assistant who has been secretly recruited by a Guildsman named Hannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA horologist,\u201d Solon added.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he take my ring?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Melisande shook her head. \u201cAt a guess, I\u2019d hazard it was an order he feared to disobey without exposing himself. As to why the order was given, I can\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Solon tapped the pages of the book before him, no longer blank, but filled with scribbled notations and charts. \u201cBut it will take some doing. This was not a simple spell. It was not one spell. I suspect there are a multitude of magics combined here. Horology, symbology, and something else rare and powerful. There is a wide array of lore I must consult to be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cIt will take as long as it takes,\u201d he replied.</p><p>I gave a brief nod of acknowledgment. \u201cCan you undo it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndo it?\u201d Solon pursed his lips. \u201cNo. It does not lie within my power, and even if it did . . .\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cWell. It doesn\u2019t. But I do believe I can provide you with the keys to unlock each link of this chain.\u201d</p><p>I stood and bowed. \u201cThat will suffice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuffice!\u201d He laughed dryly. \u201cI told you, even in this I take a risk. No one else could unknot this puzzle. Carthage will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have prevented it,\u201d I said softly. \u201cAnd that, I know.\u201d</p><p>Solon\u2019s gaze darted to my mother\u2019s face. Her expression was neutral. \u201cYes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd I aid you now for the same reason I withheld the whole truth from Melisande. Because I have become a fool in my dotage, and I do not wish to lose her.\u201d He flapped one hand at me. \u201cNow go, and let me work.\u201d</p><p>I went.</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>While Ptolemy Solon consulted his library and collected toad-slime and fever-sweat, or whatever it was he did to plumb the mysteries of Carthage\u2019s magic, I passed more time in my mother\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I said to her the first day. \u201cDid you actually threaten to leave Solon if he didn\u2019t aid me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Melisande said in a calm voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>We were dining in another inner courtyard of her villa beneath the cool green shade of a grapevine-laced lattice. There were marks on the tile where Hellene-style couches had been removed, replaced by an oval table with two chairs. I knew without being told that my mother had ordered the couches removed because I wouldn\u2019t be at ease reclining in her company.</p><p>\u201cLet us say I have become a fool in my dotage, too.\u201d Melisande gave a self-deprecating smile, glancing around. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to lose this, Imriel. But strangely, it is more important to me to make what amendments I might for all that you have suffered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all your fault,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She rested her chin on folded hands, gazing into the distance. \u201cAnd yet. \u2019Tis a strangeness, truly. I never took pleasure in seeing others suffer against their will, but it never troubled me overmuch, either. It was merely . . . information.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFault-lines to exploit,\u201d I suggested cynically.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her glorious gaze returned to me. \u201cYou see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I stuck my fork into a spear of tender asparagus, chewing it slowly. \u201cBut like Solon, I choose not to exploit such knowledge for my own gain. I do not think merciful Kushiel intended us to use such a gift lightly.\u201d</p> <p>Her tone was unreadable. \u201cSo young to be so wise.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cA lifetime of struggling against your legacy. I find it hard to believe you never took pleasure in the suffering of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, suffering.\u201d Melisande gave her graceful shrug. \u201cWhen it is offered up in tribute, it is another matter. To feel another surrender his or her will unto yours, to bend it until it breaks . . . there is majesty and beauty in it.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, her words made my blood run cold. They were so matter-of-fact. I set down my fork, my appetite waning.</p><p>\u201cIt bothers you to hear this,\u201d my mother observed. \u201cHave you never been tempted?\u201d</p> <p>I thought about the first time I\u2019d given free rein to the dark desires in me, and the morning after that first encounter at Valerian House, when I\u2019d caught Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s wrist in anger, felt her pulse leap beneath my thumb, and I\u2019d known. I thought about the horrible, unthinkable threats I\u2019d made during my madness. I\u2019d hated the people I loved best in the world. And I would have taken pleasure in making them suffer against their will. I would have taken enormous pleasure in it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said shortly.</p><p>Melisande cocked her head. \u201cAnd yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a child, I saw death sown in the place of life,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I think if I were to surrender wholly to my own darkest desires, without the bright beacon of love to guide me, I would become all that I despise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cWorse.\u201d</p> <p>We were both silent a moment. Melisande pushed her own barely touched plate away. A young man who looked to be of mainland Hellene blood, tall and fair, emerged from the recesses of the villa to take our plates away, pausing briefly for a nod of approval that wasn\u2019t forthcoming. Lost in thought, my mother merely gestured absently. He looked a bit crestfallen as he departed.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019ve changed,\u201d I said, watching him go. \u201cDoes it trouble you now to observe others suffering against their will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than you?\u201d She returned from wherever her thoughts had taken her. \u201cProbably a great deal less than it should, but considerably more than it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s comforting,\u201d I said.</p><p>Another graceful shrug. \u201cI am as the gods made me, Imriel. I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d</p><p>Since it seemed to be true, I didn\u2019t press her, but changed the topic. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>Melisande smiled. \u201cSolon? In my own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a change from having one of the most beautiful courtesans in the realm kneeling for your leash,\u201d I commented.</p> <p>Her brows rose. \u201cPh\u00e8dre told you about that?\u201d she asked, sounding genuinely shocked.</p><p>\u201cGods, no!\u201d I said. \u201cMavros did, when we were younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacriphant\u2019s son,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI heard you\u2019d become friends.\u201d Melisande\u2019s gaze shifted back toward the distance. \u201cYes and no. Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay is the only anguissette in living memory, and Kushiel\u2019s hand lay heavier on her than on any I have read about in history.\u201d Her mouth quirked. \u201cAnd unfortunately, she was a good deal more persistent and resourceful than I reckoned, although in the end I had cause to be grateful for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI have enough.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut Solon . . . Solon, you see with the shallow eyes of youth. He is a homely man, yes, but the breadth of his knowledge and the acuity of his intellect are staggering. And it is an exhilarating pleasure to have one of the greatest minds in existence laid in supplication at one\u2019s feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan on attempting to break his will?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Melisande said simply. \u201cNo, there is a time when I would have tried it for the sheer joy of the challenge. Now . . . I am not entirely sure I would win. And I am not entirely sure it would please me if I did. Ptolemy Solon and I enjoy one another. After the tedium of my years claiming sanctuary in the Temple of Asherat, I am content to be . . . content.\u201d She looked amused. \u201cYou\u2019re full of questions. Are there more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I met her gaze and held it. \u201cWhat fault-lines do you see in me?\u201d</p><p>My mother looked at me for a long, long time. The mantle of sorrow settled back over her. \u201cMany,\u201d she said at length, her voice gentle. \u201cFault-lines of grief and loss and despair, and fault-lines of pride and yearning. A strong, bright vein of indomitable courage and strength that with the wisdom of experience, even I would be reluctant to cross.\u201d Reaching across the table, she touched my cheek. \u201cImriel. I swear to you, in Kushiel\u2019s name, that I would never do aught to exploit you. And I keep my promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Melisande nodded. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>I looked into her.</p><p>I saw passion and pride, humor and ambition. Regret and sorrow. A surprising reserve of measured joy, and a chilling amorality. A profound capacity for impersonal cruelty. Unexpected generosity. A lack of conscience, and a growing awareness of that lack. Thoughtfulness. Curiosity.</p><p>Me.</p><p>I was my mother\u2019s fault-line. I was the kernel of vulnerability at her core. I could hurt her far, far more than she could ever hurt me. And she could be hurt through me. What I suffered hurt her. She had loved others in her own way, and there were profound ties there, most especially to Ph\u00e8dre. That bond, I daresay only the gods themselves understood. But I was the only person she had ever loved with all the deep, abiding wonder and ferocity of her mortal soul.</p><p>I pitied her.</p><p>It hurt; it hurt us both. I was the first to look away. I knew myself, and I was sane. I took no pleasure in her pain.</p><p>\u201cNow you know,\u201d Melisande said in a low, steady voice.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I took a deep breath and forced myself to meet her gaze. \u201cAnd I am grateful for your love, Mother. Despite everything, I am grateful for it.\u201d</p><p>Her generous lips curved in a smile. \u201cLet us hope that it is enough to bring down Carthage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us.\u201d There was a pitcher of cool white wine on the table. I filled both our cups, hoisting my own in toast. \u201cBetween the two of us, let us hope.\u201d</p><p>No word came from Solon that day. I returned to the widow\u2019s lodgings and passed the night there. In the morning, Leander came to fetch me, finding me in the garden once more. This time, I heard him enter and halted my exercises.</p><p>\u201cWord from the palace?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head, braids dancing. \u201cHer ladyship thought you might fancy an excursion to the Shrine of Aphrodite. \u2019Tis only a league or two.\u201d</p><p>It was a kind thought. I was restless and impatient, eager to be doing instead of waiting. At least this would serve to keep me occupied; and too, it was always wise to pay respects to the gods of a place. I had the Bastard saddled, and Leander and I set out, following the road eastward along the Cytheran coast.</p><p>I had to own, it was beautiful here. It was autumn. In Terre d\u2019Ange, there would be a chill in the air, a promise of frost to come. Here in Cythera, it was warm and sunny. The wind off the sea tangled my hair, making me envy Leander his braids. The folk we passed saluted us cheerfully. The Bastard, recovered at last from his ordeal, pranced and snorted.</p><p>\u201cGood-looking horse,\u201d Leander observed, eyeing him.</p><p>\u201cHe was a gift,\u201d I said. \u201cFrom the House of Aragon.\u201d</p><p>He whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s got to sting, thinking on it, what with Terre d\u2019Ange betraying its alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, in fact.\u201d I looked curiously at him. \u201cDoes it trouble you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Leander shrugged. \u201cNot really. Blessed Elua wandered the world without a care. Why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think of a reply, so I didn\u2019t give one.</p><p>It took a little over an hour to reach the shrine of the goddess, situated on a windswept promontory overlooking the sea. It was built in the classic Hellene style, simple and elegant, open to the elements. Myrtle grew in abundance around it, the sun-warmed leaves releasing a pleasing fragrance. Bees droned around the flowering shrubs. There were vendors in the plaza in front of the temple steps selling incense, honey, oil, and votive offerings. On Leander\u2019s advice, I bought a flagon of sweet oil and a piece of honeycomb.</p><p>A priestess in a white chiton greeted us at the top of the steps, small, dark, and plump, with a smile at once merry and mysterious. We made an offering of coin and she directed us toward the rear of the temple.</p><p>I\u2019d thought to see an effigy there, but instead there was a black stone on a plinth, as large as a tall man\u2019s torso, its surface polished and gleaming. I gave Leander an inquiring look.</p><p>\u201cIt fell from the sky thousands of years ago,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMuch like the genitals of the castrated Ouranos from which foam-born Aphrodite was begotten. You\u2019re to anoint it.\u201d</p><p>Although I couldn\u2019t have said why, it felt ancient. Older than the temple, worn smooth by countless generations of hands. I poured the flagon of oil over the top of the stone, then squeezed the honeycomb. Honey dripped, gliding over the oil.</p><p>Honey-gold, onyx-black.</p><p>I thought of Sidonie and my heart ached with longing. I rubbed the honey and oil, spreading it over the smooth black rock. \u201cDivine Aphrodite, I pray you accept this offering,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIf there is mercy in your heart for the plight of lovers, I pray you look kindly on my quest.\u201d</p><p>The stone felt warm beneath my hands, oil-slick and sticky with honey. It was peaceful and strangely erotic, and beneath it lay a sense of waiting stillness. When I had finished, the plump priestess approached with a basin of water and a linen towel. I washed and dried my hands while she gazed at my face.</p><p>\u201cSuch sadness,\u201d the priestess said softly. \u201cDid a woman break your heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cBut the world threatens to.\u201d</p><p>She shifted the basin under one arm and took my right hand, pressing it to her warm breast. \u201cIf your heart knows its true desire, you must trust it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>With that, she let me go and departed. Leander stared after her. \u201cHuh. I\u2019ve made a dozen offerings and no one\u2019s ever said such a thing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know your heart\u2019s true desire?\u201d I asked wryly.</p><p>He looked at me under his lashes. \u201cWell, no. But I\u2019m familiar with quite a few others.\u201d</p><p>Outside the temple, we bought sausages and olives and boiled eggs from a food vendor, eating them in the shade of a fragrant stand of myrtle. I was quiet and thoughtful. Leander watched me curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d he asked. \u201cBeing in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awful.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd wonderful. Betimes you feel like your heart\u2019s going to burst into a thousand pieces, flaying your chest wide open. Betimes you feel like you could leap off a cliff and take wing. And then it changes. It puts roots into you, deep and enduring. It becomes a part of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Leander wiped his hands on his loose breeches. \u201cHard to fathom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know it one day,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMayhap.\u201d He rose with careless grace. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>We returned to Paphos together. Leander hummed as he rode. For the first time, I found myself wishing I\u2019d brought the wooden flute that Hugues had given me. I hadn\u2019t played it since I\u2019d avenged Dorelei\u2019s death. Too many memories. I hadn\u2019t thought of it when I\u2019d beseeched L\u2019Envers\u2019 aid, and I daresay he would have laughed at me if I\u2019d asked for it. But it had been a comfort to me in Alba; and in Vralia it had saved my life. I tried to recall the charmed tune of the Maghuin Dhonn that I\u2019d played, the one that had sent everyone in the gaol to sleep, allowing me to escape with Kebek, the young Tatar.</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten it.</p><p>I listened to my memories, moving my fingers. If I had a flute, I thought, mayhap I might be able to recall it. What the mind forgets, the body remembers. By the time we approached the gates of Paphos, I had resolved to visit the market in search of a skilled craftsman.</p><p>\u201cLeander\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cHsst!\u201d Leander raised one hand, peering forward. \u201cShabaq?\u201d</p><p>A lean figure sitting cross-legged beneath a lemon tree rose and crossed over to us. I recognized him as the young man playing the blindfold game in my mother\u2019s household. He laid a hand on Leander\u2019s stirrup, flashing a white grin.</p><p>\u201cHer ladyship sent me to look out for you,\u201d Shabaq said cheerfully. \u201cHis apish eminence awaits you at his palace.\u201d</p><p>Leander glanced at me. \u201cShall we\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait to hear the rest of it. I nudged the Bastard\u2019s flanks with my heels and gave him his head, all thoughts of flutes and stones and honey forgotten, pedestrians scattering before our onslaught.</p><p>Ptolemy Solon had found the key.</p><p>That was all I needed.</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>There is good news and bad news.\u201d Solon spoke in a hushed voice. We were meeting in the room where I\u2019d first met with him, overlooking the sea. \u201cThe good news is that there is a very simple way to break Carthage\u2019s spell.\u201d He pointed out the window at the bright harbor. \u201cThe spell is bound to Terre d\u2019Ange. Its effects cannot cross the sea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart leapt. \u201cSo Sidonie\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the bad news. I fear she has been bound with a different spell, a simpler spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ring,\u201d I said grimly.</p> <p>Solon nodded. \u201cThat is doubtless one part of it. Astegal bears your love-token. He will have placed some token of his own on her to seal the bond.\u201d</p><p>My mother stirred. \u201cBut in Terre d\u2019Ange, all that is needful to break the spell is to ferry everyone affected across the sea? Mayhap to Alba?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d He looked apologetic. \u201cForgive me. I do believe I overstated the good news. The problem is twofold. Unless the spell is undone, it will reclaim anyone who returns to D\u2019Angeline soil. Of greater concern, there is malevolence at its core. Any attempt to struggle against it will cause the spell to tighten like a snare, and those caught within it will grow angry and violent.\u201d</p><p>I thought about Ysandre shouting at Barquiel L\u2019Envers. \u201cSo logic and reason will prove little use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear you would have a very difficult time convincing anyone caught in Carthage\u2019s coils to sail away in pursuit of their sanity,\u201d Solon said.</p> <p>I frowned. \u201cQuintilius Rousse had put to sea. It didn\u2019t restore his wits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he cross to a foreign shore?\u201d Solon asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was anchored in the harbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far enough,\u201d he replied. \u201cOne would have to cross the sea itself.\u201d Solon opened a large book on the table, its pages dark with age, and pointed to an engraving. \u201cThis is what lies at the heart of the spell.\u201d</p><p>Melisande and I gazed at the image. An infant lay on a slab of rock in a desert, a gaping slit in its belly. Beside it was what appeared to be a whirlwind sprouting horns, fiery eyes, and four reaching arms with clawed hands. A robed man hid behind a boulder, watching.</p><p>\u201cThis tells how to make a ghafrid-gebla.\u201d Solon ran one finger from right to left along a line of unfamiliar script. \u201cIt requires a flawless gem, emerald or ruby, cut into twelve facets, with the symbols of the twelve Houses of the Cosmos etched onto its facets. The jewel is placed in the belly of an infant. When the ghafrid\u201d\u2014he tapped the image of the whirlwind\u2014\u201cdevours the infant, the magus utters a word of binding, trapping the ghafrid in the very stone it has swallowed.\u201d</p> <p>I stared in sick fascination. \u201cWhat exactly is a ghafrid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what we call an elemental,\u201d Solon said. \u201cA desert spirit. Very powerful, capricious, and cruel. Once it is trapped within the stone, it must do its master\u2019s bidding.\u201d He looked thoughtful. \u201cUnderstand, this is very difficult to do. The infant must be alive when it is devoured. And given that one must slit its belly to insert the jewel, this is a tricky proposition.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cI begin to perceive the wisdom in your restraint of exercising knowledge, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d my mother murmured. \u201cSo the business with the moon and the mirrors mattered naught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Solon shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s all part and parcel. This is a puzzle with many pieces. The placement of the mirrors established the compass of the spell, setting the framework for binding the entire City and all in it. The occlusion of the moon increased its power a thousand-fold. And the painting you described defined the essence of the spell. Each piece is important. But this\u201d\u2014he tapped the engraving again\u2014\u201cthis is the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Solon smiled. \u201cTo undo the spell, all you must do is free the ghafrid. And to do this, all you must do is take possession of the gem-stone and speak the word of binding, which is also the word of unbinding.\u201d</p><p>My mother eyed him wryly. \u201cSomehow I suspect you\u2019ve overstated the good news once more.\u201d</p> <p>He spread his hands. \u201cI have no way of knowing the word. Bodeshmun\u2014I\u2019m sure this is his work\u2014would have chosen it.\u201d He turned back a page, pointing to an image depicting a drawing of a ghafrid with a single word inscribed beneath it. \u201cSymbology. Somewhere, likely on his person, Bodeshmun possesses a similar image. It is necessary to maintain the bond.\u201d</p><p>I studied the page. \u201cWhat if the image were destroyed? Would that free the ghafrid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell reasoned,\u201d Solon said approvingly. \u201cBut alas, no. It would merely bind the elemental into the stone for all eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t Bodeshmun do so?\u201d Melisande inquired. \u201cIt seems simpler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, because the ghafrid would go mad with rage,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cViolently, horribly mad. And because Bodeshmun would be bound to it, he would slowly succumb to madness himself. No, no. He\u2019ll keep the talisman safe until such time as he deems it reasonable to release the ghafrid. It\u2019s a dangerous business, trafficking with elementals. I suspect he plans to free it at some point, perhaps when Carthage\u2019s ascent is secure and the Queen\u2019s daughter has provided Astegal with a few heirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cwill not happen.\u201d</p><p>Solon glanced at me, sobering. \u201cForgive me. It\u2019s begun, though. I heard word late this morning. Carthage\u2019s fleet has set sail for Aragonia.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cThe good news is that General Astegal has left his young bride in Carthage. So I suppose that reduces the chances of begetting an heir, unless she\u2019s already with child.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth. \u201cSo in order to undo Carthage\u2019s spell, I need to obtain the word of binding and unbinding, which Bodeshmun is likely to have on his person. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded. \u201cAnd speak it in the presence of the ghafrid-gebla once you have claimed possession of the stone.\u201d</p><p>Irony piled on irony. I\u2019d travelled to the far ends of the earth with Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin to find the Name of God, a word capable of binding an angel. Now it seemed I sought a word that would loose a demon from its bindings. The bright mirror and the dark reflected one another: good and evil, the sacred and profane.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cAnd the stone lies in Bodeshmun\u2019s possession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Solon pursed his lips. \u201cThat I neglected to mention. The gem must remain in Terre d\u2019Ange to be fully effective. Bodeshmun will have hidden it somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it were removed?\u201d my mother asked with interest. \u201cWould it diminish the effects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiminish, yes,\u201d Solon said. \u201cUndo, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have said that at the outset,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhat about Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d His wizened face brightened. \u201cNow that\u2019s easy. She\u2019s safe beyond the ghafrid\u2019s reach. All you need to do is obtain the ring from Astegal, find his token, and remove it from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother ring?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Solon shrugged. \u201cA ring, a necklace, a pair of eardrops, a ribbon. . . . whatever it is, it will be something of significance that he\u2019s given to her and bade her never remove. A ring is likely. If you were able to obtain even one of the tokens, it would weaken the binding.\u201d</p><p>I rose to pace the room, restless. \u201cSo Sidonie is in Carthage. Astegal is, or will be, in Aragonia. Where\u2019s Bodeshmun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Solon admitted.</p><p>\u201cCarthage,\u201d Melisande said. She met his glance with amusement. \u201cOddly enough, I received word this morning, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need to go to Carthage,\u201d I said slowly, thinking. \u201cI\u2019ll send word to Barquiel L\u2019Envers. I can tell him to try his damnedest to get Ysandre and anyone who will go to Alba\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Aragonia,\u201d my mother interrupted me. \u201cLet him agree to send the Royal Army and all of Rousse\u2019s fleet in support of Carthage\u2019s invasion. It won\u2019t matter. Once they\u2019re on Aragonian soil, the spell will lose its hold, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well reasoned, my love!\u201d Solon said in delight.</p><p>\u201cAragonia, then,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell him to find that thrice-cursed jewel and take it with him, away from the City. But I need to go to Carthage.\u201d I paced, still thinking. \u201cThere are two pieces of the puzzle there, Bodeshmun and Sidonie. And I can reach her. I know I can. I was bound by magic in Alba. I never forgot that I loved her. Even through the bindings, I knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d The gentleness in Melisande\u2019s voice halted me. \u201cYou can\u2019t go. Bodeshmun knows you.\u201d</p><p>Solon blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Perhaps Sunjata\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I raked a hand through my hair, still wind-tangled. \u201cI don\u2019t trust Sunjata. He\u2019s the one who took my ring. If he\u2019s caught serving two masters, he\u2019s not like to risk himself on Sidonie\u2019s behalf.\u201d I narrowed my eyes. \u201cSolon, you said you knew a spell that could give one man the semblance of another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He furrowed his brow. \u201cBut a mere glamour will not suffice to fool Bodeshmun. Ordinary folk, yes. Not a magus.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cUnless it were done so that you believed it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that possible?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Solon\u2019s tone was reserved. \u201cBut it is dangerous. Of a surety, you would risk losing yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolon,\u201d my mother murmured. \u201cI think this unwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would I be?\u201d I asked him, ignoring her.</p><p>\u201cLeander would be a good choice,\u201d he said without looking at Melisande. \u201cYour mother has trained him well. He knows Sunjata. Carthage is likely to accept him as my emissary, since the infernal Guild knows of our circumstances here. And he\u2019s bored and ambitious and handsome enough to consider seducing Astegal\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>I nodded curtly. \u201cSo I\u2019d think myself Leander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would,\u201d Solon confirmed. \u201cUntil such time as the spell was broken. It would be necessary to create such a key.\u201d He rubbed his chin, thinking. \u201cA kiss, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Sidonie?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The Wise Ape of Cythera studied me. \u201cAre you that confident, Imriel de la Courcel, that this woman you love, this cousin of yours, will succumb to your charms no matter what face you wear, no matter who you believe yourself to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said softly. I thought about my encounter in the temple that morning, the priestess pressing my hand to her breast. If your heart knows its true desire, you must trust it. \u201cNo, my lord. But I am very, very sure that I love Sidonie enough to take any chance.\u201d</p><p>Melisande sighed. \u201cI mislike this. Imriel, you\u2019ve suffered one ordeal of madness. Your mind is fragile.\u201d</p><p>I laughed shortly. \u201cWhat happened to that bright vein of indomitable strength you spoke of yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are limits to what the mortal mind was meant to bear.\u201d Her face was grave. \u201cI fear you challenge them.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Solon. \u201cWhat do you say, my lord?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAs I said, it is dangerous. There is a chance you would succeed. There is a chance that you would fail, but that this Duc L\u2019Envers will succeed in your stead with the keys I have given you, and you could be thus freed from the spell. And there is a chance that your wits would snap, and you would spend the balance of your life believing yourself to be Leander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d I said.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>That evening, I acceded to my mother\u2019s wishes and passed the night at her villa. I couldn\u2019t maintain the will to refuse her, and in truth, if this was the last night in which I would know myself for many days, I didn\u2019t wish to spend it alone in rented lodgings.</p><p>I was scared.</p><p>After what had happened in Alba, I\u2019d sworn I\u2019d never suffer myself to be bound by strange magics; and it was true, the memory of my madness was fresh and raw. The prospect of losing myself filled me with dread. But the prospect of doing nothing was worse. Someone had to get to Bodeshmun, and while Sidonie was in Astegal\u2019s thrall, she was in danger. Mayhap it wasn\u2019t immediate, but the moment aught went awry with Carthage\u2019s scheme, Sidonie became a hostage in deadly earnest.</p><p>I wrote a long letter to Barquiel L\u2019Envers, detailing everything I knew. I tried to compose a letter to Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, but in the end, I couldn\u2019t think of anything I hadn\u2019t already said. I settled for asking L\u2019Envers to tell them I loved them. I paid a visit to Captain Oppius of the Aeolia. I released him from his pledge to wait for me, and he promised to see my letter delivered. Beyond that, I told him only that I would be staying on Cythera for a time.</p><p>Melisande was unwontedly quiet and subdued. Although she misliked the plan, she had consented to assist. Leander had been told. He had no real quarrel with it, although he was envious and a bit irritated that Ptolemy Solon had sent a request for all his clothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy not simply send me, my lady?\u201d Leander asked Melisande. \u201cIt\u2019s a good deal simpler and less risky. And I wouldn\u2019t have to purchase a new wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it were my choice, I would,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut this is Imriel\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to try it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll go just as mad if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Leander studied me. \u201cYou know, once you\u2019re convinced you\u2019re me, you won\u2019t give two figs for the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I said.</p><p>Melisande and I dined alone, and I couldn\u2019t have said what we ate, although it was good. I was sufficiently on edge regarding the morrow\u2019s prospects that I forgot to be uneasy in her company. She spent long moments watching me without speaking.</p><p>\u201cIs there nothing I can say to dissuade you?\u201d she asked me at last, when the dinner plates had been cleared and cups of a strong Cytheran cordial served. \u201cLeander is right. The risk is unnecessary.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sipped my cordial. \u201cI can reach Sidonie. He can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t know you,\u201d Melisande observed.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll find one another.\u201d I gazed toward the west, where Carthage lay. \u201cAlais told me once that she thought Sidonie would need me very badly one day. And Sidonie . . . when she met with the combined priesthood of Elua and his Companions, she told them that Blessed Elua doesn\u2019t join hearts without a purpose. I believe it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill I ever see you again?\u201d my mother asked.</p><p>I looked back at her, at her grave, beautiful face illuminated by lamplight. A mortal goddess who carried her sins lightly, her sorrow heavily. What emotions I felt, I couldn\u2019t name.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll not make any false promises.\u201d</p><p>Melisande nodded. \u201cIf you find it in your heart to see me again one day, I would like it. I would like it very much.\u201d</p><p>Against all expectations, I slept soundly that night, beneath my mother\u2019s roof in a pleasant guest-chamber on sheets of the finest Menekhetan linen. I slept without dreaming and woke feeling oddly lighthearted.</p> <p>Today I would surrender everything.</p><p>Everything I had, everything I was. I would let go of all of it, placing myself and all my trust in the hands of my mother\u2019s lover, the dangerously clever and unfathomable Wise Ape of Cythera. Laying it all on the altar of love. In the end, that was truly where my trust lay. Not in Ptolemy Solon\u2019s spells and arcane knowledge, but in love. In the precept of Blessed Elua. In Sidonie\u2019s pledge.</p><p>Always and always.</p><p>She was the one who had taught me to trust. To trust her. To trust myself.</p><p>I did.</p><p>The mood stayed with me as we rode to the palace after breaking our fast; Melisande, Leander, and I. His presence was necessary for the spell. I breathed deep of the warm, salt-tinged air, filling my lungs. Reveling in the knowledge of myself, soon to be relinquished. I patted the Bastard\u2019s spotted neck with bittersweet affection.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to stay here,\u201d I said to him, watching his ears swivel. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have brought you. I wasn\u2019t thinking. But I can\u2019t take you to Carthage. Bodeshmun\u2019s seen you.\u201d</p><p>The Bastard snorted in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take care of him for me?\u201d I asked Leander.</p><p>He nodded, sunlight winking on his ruby eardrops. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>My mother said nothing.</p><p>At the palace, Ptolemy Solon was awaiting us in the chamber overlooking the sea. All of Leander\u2019s clothing was there, clean and pressed with a hot iron, neatly folded. Solon looked unspeakably weary, his eyes bloodshot.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cis a damnably difficult spell.\u201d He flexed his cramped hands. \u201cOne thing must always be bound to another. I have been sewing all night, which is not an activity to which I am accustomed. You need not know the details, but suffice it to say that this enchantment has been bound into every fiber of these garments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to wear Leander\u2019s attire?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Solon stifled a yawn. \u201cFor therein lies the spell, bound to it stitch by stitch. Do you expose yourself to anyone in your full nakedness, that person will see you for your true self, then and thereafter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he beholds himself thusly?\u201d Melisande asked in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cHe would see himself truly,\u201d Solon admitted. \u201cBut only were he to regard himself naked in a mirror. I do not recommend it, Imriel. For you would perceive yourself to be Leander trapped in Imriel\u2019s form, and it would tax your wits.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not given to looking in mirrors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Leander murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell, I recommend against it.\u201d Solon gathered himself. \u201cStrip and don his clothing.\u201d</p><p>I stripped.</p><p>It felt odd. I heard my mother catch her breath as I tugged the shirt over my head, baring my scarred torso.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods,\u201d she breathed. \u201cImriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA souvenir of Alba,\u201d I said with a lightness I didn\u2019t feel. The gravity of what we did here was settling into my bones. I slid my arms into one of Leander\u2019s vests, tugging it into place. \u201cAs I said, a great deal of what I\u2019ve suffered is no fault of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . .\u201d Melisande shook her head. \u201cElua have mercy.\u201d</p><p>I unlaced my breeches. \u201cI pray he does.\u201d</p><p>Once I was fully attired in Leander\u2019s clothing, Solon bade me sit cross-legged on the floor, strewn with cushions. I did, and he sat opposite me. \u201cYou must go now,\u201d he said to Leander and my mother. \u201cLeander, you I will send for in some time, for you must recount your memories for Imriel once he is entranced. Melisande . . .\u201d He paused, sorrow etched in his homely face. \u201cBid your son farewell.\u201d</p><p>My mother sank to her knees before me, cradling my face in her hands. \u201cCome back, Imriel,\u201d she whispered. Her touch was warm and soothing, and there were tears in her glorious eyes. \u201cIf not to me, at least to the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>She kissed my brow. \u201cBlessed Elua pray you keep it.\u201d</p><p>She went.</p><p>Leander went.</p><p>Ptolemy Solon and I faced one another. \u201cBreathe deep,\u201d he advised me. \u201cBreathe deep and listen. Close your eyes. Take my words into you. Listen.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed.</p><p>\u201cClose your thoughts and quiet your mind,\u201d Solon said in a low, calm voice. \u201cHear nothing but the sound of my voice. Think of nothing but my words. My voice is a warm sea of light, soft and mild. You are drifting atop it, safe and warm. Let yourself go. Let yourself drift . . .\u201d</p><p>It was warm in the room and I could feel the sunlight flooding through the window. Solon\u2019s voice continued to speak, low and pleasant, almost droning. I listened. I began to feel drowsy and a little bored. I began to wonder how long it would take, then forced myself to stop wondering. I listened, floating atop the sea of Solon\u2019s voice. Elua, if nothing else, the man had the patience of a stone. To spend the entire night sewing, of all things, and then this endless talking . . .</p><p>Listen.</p><p>I made myself listen.</p><p>On and on he went. I passed beyond boredom and relaxed. My body felt heavy and inert, but inside, I felt light. Lighthearted. Floating on a sea of light. There had been enough darkness in my life. Too much. This was nice.</p><p>\u201c. . . and now it is time to put Imriel away,\u201d Solon\u2019s voice told me. \u201cTime to make him small. Small like a grain of sand, like a tiny, tiny seed. Make him very small, a tiny seed.\u201d</p><p>I agreed. I made Imriel into a tiny seed.</p><p>\u201cTuck him into the farthest crack of your mind,\u201d Solon\u2019s voice continued. \u201cHide him where no one will see him. A tiny seed, safe and hidden.\u201d</p><p>I hid Imriel away.</p><p>\u201cForget he is there,\u201d Solon instructed me. \u201cUntil the moment your lips touch Sidonie\u2019s, you will forget Imriel is there. When you kiss her, you will remember. Until that moment, you will forget. Forget.\u201d</p><p>I forgot about Imriel.</p><p>\u201cSit quietly in peace,\u201d the man talking to me said. I obeyed, hearing his joints creak as he rose, the sound of a door opening. \u201cCome in,\u201d he said to someone. \u201cYou may begin. Tell him the story of your life. I will speak over your words. Pay it no heed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do I begin?\u201d the new voice said.</p><p>\u201cBegin at the beginning,\u201d the first one said.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d The newcomer took a deep breath. \u201cI was born in Kusheth about a year after the Skaldi War ended, and . . . hells, my lord Solon, I don\u2019t remember all that much about the first five or six years of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the man he\u2019d called Solon said. \u201cSay what you do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first thing . . . the first thing I remember is when my little sister Darielle was born. She was a red-faced, wrinkled, squalling thing, and everyone doted on her because Mother had given up on getting with child again after so long . . .\u201d</p><p>The newcomer\u2019s voice went on and on, joined by the man called Solon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHear and remember,\u201d Solon said. \u201cThis is your story. You are Leander Maignard. When you awake you will know this to be true. Each word is a stitch in the garment of your life. Hear and remember. This is your story. You are Leander Maignard. Each word is a stitch in the garment of your life. When you awake you will know this to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . really, life didn\u2019t get interesting until her ladyship sent for us to make a household in Cythera, when I was ten or so. All these years, she\u2019d provided for the Maignard clan, but I\u2019d begun to think it would never amount to more than that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your story. You are Leander Maignard. Each word is a stitch in the garment of your life . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . the day we stepped off the ship, my father said, \u2018We\u2019re never leaving.\u2019 He serves as her ladyship\u2019s master of vineyards, but then, I was always more ambitious . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . word is a stitch in the garment of your life. When you awake you will know this to be true. Hear and remember. This is your story. You are Leander Maignard.\u201d</p><p>It should have been irritating, listening to both of their voices at once, but it wasn\u2019t. One wound around the other. I listened to the newcomer\u2019s endless narrative unspooling, while Solon\u2019s calm voice continued, stitching in and out, fashioning it into the garment of self I would wear when I awoke.</p><p>It went on for a long time, but I didn\u2019t mind. Solon had told me to sit quietly in peace, so I did, listening to the story of my life unwind until at last the spool was almost wholly bare.</p><p>\u201cHalt,\u201d Solon said to the newcomer. \u201cDo not recount these last days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to oblige,\u201d the other said wearily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m forgetting . . . ah. Eardrops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Solon\u2019s voice had grown hoarse, but he sounded amused. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you without them. Surely they will serve as a last line of defense against the perils of nudity. Where did I put that needle?\u201d And then, to me, \u201cYou will feel no pain.\u201d He pinched my earlobes lightly, one after another. Afterward, they felt heavier.</p><p>\u201cAm I finished, my lord?\u201d the other asked.</p><p>\u201cYou may go,\u201d Solon agreed. \u201cRemember, keep out of sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know.\u201d</p><p>I heard him leave and heard the door close. I sat quietly in peace.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d Solon said to me. I did. The room was filled with late-afternoon sunlight. \u201cYou are Leander Maignard. You are departing on the morrow for Carthage to attempt to seduce General Astegal\u2019s wife and break the spell that binds her, and to find the key to the ghafrid-gebla that Bodeshmun possesses.\u201d He went on to explain this to me in considerable detail. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d I said politely.</p><p>Solon gave me a tired smile. \u201cIn the morning, you will awake and know this to be true. You will forget this day. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>I slept.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>The crow of that damnable rooster that the cook insisted on keeping around woke me with a start. I\u2019d slept long and hard. For a moment, I felt strange to myself, my heart racing. Then I remembered why.</p><p>Today I sailed for Carthage.</p><p>By the Goddess, it was about sodding well time her ladyship gave me somewhat meaningful to do! As much as I loved Cythera, it ate at my pride to cool my heels while others were given more interesting assignments.</p><p>And this was a big one.</p><p>I\u2019d never have admitted it to her ladyship\u2019s son, not if I valued my life, but in my heart of hearts, I was a little bit glad that Carthage had ensorceled the Dauphine and half of Terre d\u2019Ange. It was horrible, of course. But it was exciting, too. And there had been precious few opportunities for her ladyship to deploy D\u2019Angeline spies without rousing suspicion.</p><p>This . . . this was perfect.</p><p>And now that her sentence had been commuted to exile, there was no fear of exposure. At last we could play the game as it was meant to be played; and I would be at the very heart of it, a veritable lynch-pin in the scheme. I had the opportunity to seduce a Princess of the Blood and bring down a budding empire.</p><p>It was a delicious thought. It was so delicious that I permitted myself to lay a-bed a few minutes, contemplating it and stroking my phallus. I wondered what the half-breed Cruithne princess looked like, although it didn\u2019t really matter. I could rise to any challenge.</p><p>The household was stirring.</p><p>Duty beckoned.</p><p>One couldn\u2019t have luxury and adventure alike. With a sigh, I left off my musings and my pleasure. I rose, braided my hair, donned my clothing, and went to face the day.</p><p>\u201cLeander.\u201d Shabaq intercepted me on my way to the kitchen. \u201cHer ladyship wishes you to break your fast with her in the arbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d I said in delight.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>It was true. I found her ladyship awaiting me in the latticed arbor, sipping a cup of hot bitter kavah. I bowed deeply to her, holding my bow. \u201cMy lady, you honor me. I pray I prove worthy of your trust in this matter.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze, so terrible and beautiful and sad, rested on me. \u201cAs do I.\u201d</p><p>I marked, as she had taught me, how her hand trembled a bit returning her thin porcelain cup to its saucer. \u201cDo you doubt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSit and dine with me, Leander.\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>There was fresh, crusty bread still warm from the oven, honey and preserves, and heartier fare, too. Sausage flavored with coriander, eggs cooked with goat cheese and herbs. I ate with a good will, mindful that I\u2019d be dining on salt pork and beans during the voyage to Carthage. Her ladyship watched me, scarce touching her food. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you questions?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>I shook my head, chewing vigorously. \u201cHave you advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said simply. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed a mouthful of cooked eggs and smiled at her. \u201cI will be. I will be the soul of discretion. I will be the perfect courtier, I promise. I will court the D\u2019Angeline princess and make her love me. And I will ferret out all of Carthage\u2019s secrets on your behalf.\u201d I hesitated, glancing around. \u201cIs he here?\u201d</p><p>Her throat worked. \u201cImriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I lowered my voice. \u201cYour brooding son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her ladyship Melisande Shahrizai de la Courcel shook her head. There were tears\u2014tears!\u2014in her glorious eyes. It made me want to kneel and comfort her. \u201cNo, we thought it best if he wasn\u2019t here for this.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>When we had finished\u2014which was to say, when I had eaten my fill\u2014we departed for the harbor. Everything was in readiness. My mother, who ran her ladyship\u2019s household, had seen to the packing of my things. All my garments were laid in a cedar chest, neatly folded. I embraced her fondly, resting my chin on her head. She returned my embrace awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened,\u201d I said to her. \u201cAll will be well.\u201d</p><p>She avoided my gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen, eh?\u201d I said cheerfully to my father, clasping his callused hand. He gave me a grave nod.</p><p>\u201cHave a care for yourself,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I ruffled my sister\u2019s hair. Darielle, fifteen years of age and deep in her ladyship\u2019s training, wrinkled her nose at me. \u201cYou too, brat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the brat,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grinned at her. \u201cToday I\u2019m a handsome young D\u2019Angeline lord who happens to be in the service of the Governor of Cythera, and I\u2019m off to pay tribute on his behalf to General Astegal\u2019s poor, lonely young bride.\u201d</p><p>We rode in procession down to the harbor, where the Wise Ape\u2019s flagship awaited. Solon was there himself, looking uncommonly sober. I put on a solemn expression, mindful that this was a serious matter. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t appreciate the gravity of the situation\u2014all the gods of Terre d\u2019Ange and Cythera knew, one didn\u2019t rise far in her ladyship\u2019s estimation by being frivolous and careless. It was just that I felt like a hawk about to fly free of the tether.</p><p>I greeted Solon with a deep bow. \u201cGood day, my lord.\u201d</p><p>His apish eminence inclined his head. \u201cGood day, Leander Maignard. I am pleased that you have consented to carry the congratulations of Cythera to Carthage\u2019s young princess. Doubtless it will gladden her heart to see a fellow countryman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do my best to convey your goodwill, my lord,\u201d I said gravely. It was all for show, of course, but outside the veil of discretion that existed in her ladyship\u2019s household, one had to be circumspect.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Deimos has orders to give you every assistance,\u201d Solon said, indicating the man beside him, a tall, lean fellow with piercing eyes. The captain and I exchanged greetings. \u201cThe tribute has been loaded.\u201d He smiled faintly. \u201cI trust you will find sufficient funds, gifts, and bribes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been more than generous, my lord,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Solon handed me a packet of letters. \u201cThese are letters of introduction to various Carthaginian lords of my acquaintance. I cannot say of a surety which you will find in residence, and which will have joined Astegal\u2019s campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will suffice, my lord,\u201d I replied.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a great deal more to be said. Captain Deimos\u2019 sailors loaded my belongings. Solon glanced at her ladyship. \u201cHave you words in parting?\u201d</p><p>Her ladyship stood, tall and splendid as a goddess, and although she\u2019d taught me to read faces, I couldn\u2019t read hers in this moment. For the first time, it struck me\u2014truly struck me\u2014that this was a grave trust indeed. Cythera ran a serious risk in this scheme. If I failed, if I was caught, the consequences could be dire. I was leaving her to wait and worry, while her poor, besotted son chafed at his inactivity and I went off to attempt to seduce the woman he loved.</p><p>It made me feel strange in my skin.</p><p>\u201cBe safe,\u201d her ladyship said in a low voice. \u201cNothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady Melisande,\u201d I said to her, \u201cI swear to you in Blessed Elua\u2019s name that I will make you proud.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJust be safe.\u201d</p><p>It was a peculiar moment. I took it to be a final warning against taking any unnecessary risks, probably one that was well merited, given my exuberant spirits. I noted it duly.</p><p>And then it was time to go.</p><p>I boarded the flagship, waving a final farewell to those gathered on the docks. Solon had moved to stand at her ladyship\u2019s side, and though he looked smaller and more wizened than ever next to her, she had laid a hand on his shoulder as though to draw strength from him. It was curious, and it made me feel oddly melancholy.</p><p>Then Captain Deimos gave the order to raise the anchor and set to oars, and the ship began to move. Our prow nosed seaward and the harbor began to fall away behind us, taking my melancholy with it.</p><p>I was bound for Carthage.</p><p>Her ladyship needn\u2019t have warned me against unnecessary exuberance. By the end of our first day at sea, my initial rush of excitement had settled into a more calm, calculating frame of mind. I examined the manifest of tribute that Solon had provided. He really had been generous. Gods above, the old ape doted on her ladyship! A lifetime of caution and restraint, and he was throwing it all to the wind, risking Carthage\u2019s ire\u2014and a considerable amount of money\u2014in a mad scheme like this.</p><p>And to whose benefit? That was the part that made me shake my head. Terre d\u2019Ange and its spell-beleaguered Queen, who had insisted on pressing for her ladyship\u2019s execution. Her ladyship\u2019s own son, who, until Carthage struck and he desperately needed her help, had seemed perfectly willing to see her executed if it meant he got to wed his princess.</p><p>Yet her ladyship and Solon were aiding him.</p><p>Love makes fools of us all, I supposed. Solon loved her ladyship. And she loved her son Imriel, and bore a strong measure of guilt in the bargain. I\u2019d heard the tales of what he\u2019d suffered as a child, and I had to own, it sounded awful.</p><p>One had to wonder about him.</p><p>I knew what slavery had done to Sunjata. It had made him bitter. And as much as I loved his caustic wit, there were times when I wondered what he would have been like if he\u2019d not been taken. He\u2019d come from a line of warriors. He remembered his father dressing for battle, tall and strong, laughing deep in his chest. Teaching him to throw a spear, to lift his heavy shield. I knew how much it hurt Sunjata that that had been taken from him. One skirmish gone awry, and his father was dead and he\u2019d become chattel.</p><p>Imriel . . . Imriel was different.</p><p>Well, of course he hadn\u2019t been gelded. Two quick cuts of a slaver\u2019s knife, and good-bye to the ballocks. Small wonder Sunjata was bitter. He\u2019d been eleven years old. But from what I\u2019d heard about the mad ruler of Drujan, Imriel had cause of his own to harbor soul-twisting bitterness, ballocks or no. And I hadn\u2019t sensed that in him.</p><p>Anger, yes. Of course he was angry. Either Astegal of Carthage had stolen his beloved, or he\u2019d been unexpectedly thwarted in playing a very, very deep game to place himself on the throne of Terre d\u2019Ange. I wondered which was true. If it was the latter, he played it very well.</p><p>But then, he was her ladyship\u2019s son.</p><p>Such were the intriguing puzzles that occupied my mind during my voyage to Carthage.</p><p>I pored over the manifest, making notes in my mind about which items were suitable for what purpose. Good hard coin was always suitable for a bribe, and I\u2019d need a fair bit of it to set myself up with a decent household. There were various baubles and trinkets that might suffice for lesser personages. I might need them to gain access. Access to the Dauphine Sidonie, access to the magus Bodeshmun. Access, in time, to Astegal himself. I went over the things that Solon had told me.</p><p>So much to be done.</p><p>There was a very fine chess set listed in the manifest, with jeweled pieces of onyx and ivory. That, I decided, was meant for the princess. It was an excellent opening gambit. Once the opportunity to present it was established, I could offer to match wits with her and enjoy a game together.</p><p>Sidonie.</p><p>My thoughts kept returning to her. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what she was like. Weak-minded, I thought. Surely, to fall so thoroughly under the influence of her ladyship\u2019s son\u2014and then to abandon him for Astegal\u2014she must be weak-minded.</p><p>Well and good.</p><p>Weakness could be plied, most especially when it failed to know itself. In Astegal\u2019s absence, I would ply her. I would woo her. I would find her fault-lines and break her wide open, gently turning her against herself\u2014or at least against Bodeshmun\u2019s spell. After all, it was for her own good, more or less.</p><p>Gods, that was an intoxicating thought.</p><p>And Imriel deserved it.</p><p>That was another thought I\u2019d never dare voice in his presence\u2014nor her ladyship\u2019s. It was true, though. What manner of son sought his own mother\u2019s life? Oh, I knew what she\u2019d done, or at least what the world claimed she had done. They didn\u2019t grasp the scope of her vision. And Melisande Shahrizai had kept her word, at least to the Maignard clan. The rest of the world couldn\u2019t claim as much. When her ladyship gave her word, she meant it.</p><p>Always.</p><p>\u201cI will make you proud, my lady,\u201d I vowed aloud.</p><p>And to myself, I vowed silently that I would succeed on my own terms. I liked, very much, the idea of being the lynch-pin of this mad scheme. The thought of bringing down Carthage single-handedly made me shiver to the marrow of my bones. But too, I relished the thought of cuckolding Imriel de la Courcel. Of exposing him as a hypocrite, mayhap even excising her ladyship\u2019s single weakness. Him.</p><p>Once I had ensconced myself betwixt the Dauphine\u2019s thighs, that would do it. I\u2019d strip her bare of Astegal\u2019s token. I\u2019d claim her, albeit temporarily, for my own. I\u2019d plunder her to the core and make her mine. I\u2019d been taught the arts of the bedchamber. I was of Kushiel\u2019s bloodline, albeit not so pure a strain. I would make her crave me, bend her pliable will. I\u2019d leave my own mark on her.</p><p>Of that, at least, I was sure.</p><p>The only thing I couldn\u2019t fathom was why the thought made my heart ache.</p><p>That made no sense at all.</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>\u201cCarthage!\u201d</p><p>The cry came from the crow\u2019s nest, was taken up aboard the ship. Captain Deimos flung out one lean-muscled arm, pointing the way.</p><p>\u201cCarthage,\u201d he echoed.</p><p>It was an elaborate harbor; and well it ought to be, since Carthage sought to dominate the western world. We showed our papers, and after they\u2019d been examined for a long, hard time, we were granted passage and glided into the wide canal that led to the harbor proper, going to oars.</p><p>I craned my neck.</p><p>Carthage.</p><p>I\u2019d heard the gossip. Carthage was a walled city, her earliest walls built to withstand a Tiberian invasion centuries ago, added to many times. I hadn\u2019t credited the size of those walls. I had to own, I nearly goggled at the sight. They were at least fifty feet tall, and there were entire garrisons built into them. There were stables that housed elephants, by the Goddess. Astegal may have taken Carthage\u2019s fleet and the bulk of its army overseas, but he\u2019d hardly left her ill defended. I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone assailing those walls.</p><p>\u201cBig place,\u201d Captain Deimos remarked.</p><p>\u201cThat it is,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll need to take lodgings in the finest inn Carthage offers, at least until I can arrange for a proper household.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the harbor-master.\u201d</p><p>What a pleasure it was to have so many of Cythera\u2019s resources at my disposal! I leaned on the ship\u2019s rail, gazing at the city, which spilled down a steep hill toward the sea. There were temples, an immense bath-house, an amphitheater. No great palace, merely villas that grew finer and finer the farther up the hill they were. Of course, Carthage was an oligarchy, lacking a single ruler; although as I understood it, Astegal\u2019s appointment as General gave him a tremendous amount of power.</p><p>But Astegal wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>I wondered which of the villas belonged to the House of Sarkal. I was eager to pay tribute to Astegal\u2019s young wife, left to languish while her martial husband went off to conquer Aragonia. And I wondered how that venture was going.</p><p>Well, there was one way to find out. While Deimos spoke with the harbor-master, I disembarked and strolled the docks, getting used to the feeling of solid ground beneath my feet once more. There was a group of sailors dicing in the shadow of a Carthaginian ship.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, lads,\u201d I said to them in Hellene. I untied the strings of my purse and fetched out a silver coin. \u201cWhat\u2019s the news out of Aragonia?\u201d</p><p>They glanced up at me with suspicion. \u201cA D\u2019Angeline asks?\u201d one said.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNot exactly. I\u2019m a long-time exile in the service of the Governor of Cythera. We\u2019ve got no dog in this fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneral Astegal routed the Aragonian fleet at New Carthage,\u201d the sailor said, putting out his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s occupied the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d I put the coin in his grimy palm. \u201cAny indication Aragonia means to surrender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d The sailor shook his head. \u201cArmy\u2019s withdrawn to the north. Looks like a long slog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thanks.\u201d I fished out another coin. \u201cWhat of Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They exchanged grins. \u201cYou have been gone a long while, my lord,\u201d the talkative sailor said. \u201cDon\u2019t know, except the whole country\u2019s damn well flummoxed and at each other\u2019s throats. Meanwhile, Astegal\u2019s pretty little royal bride sits here waiting patiently for him to return.\u201d</p><p>They all laughed. I found myself hating them with unexpected intensity.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d I smiled broadly and paid the man his second coin. \u201cMany thanks, my friends.\u201d</p> <p>He pocketed it. \u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>By the time I\u2019d strolled back to the ship, Deimos had arranged for my lodgings at an inn the harbor-master had assured him was the most fashionable. He\u2019d hired porters and a palanquin, which I was also given to understand was the most fashionable mode of transport. A very efficient fellow, Captain Deimos.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d I said to him. \u201cWhere will I find you if I\u2019ve need?\u201d</p><p>He jerked his chin at the ship. \u201cWe\u2019ll bunk on board until you\u2019ve arranged for proper lodgings and the cargo can be unloaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I fetched a smaller purse out of the inner pocket of my vest and handed it to him. \u201cMake sure your lads have a chance to entertain themselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been paid,\u201d Deimos said, but he took it nonetheless. \u201cHow long do you reckon we\u2019ll be here?\u201d</p><p>I glanced up the hill, past the sprawl of townhouses and multistory apartments, toward the costly villas. \u201cAs long as it takes. Does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cJust curious.\u201d Deimos lowered his voice. \u201cWhat exactly is the old ape up to, anyway? He seems deadly serious about it.\u201d</p><p>Days at sea, and the man picks a crowded harbor to ask. Gods above, people could be stupid. I gave him my blandest smile. \u201cSpreading goodwill, my lord captain, that Cythera may be left in peace, untouched by any trouble. Happiness is the highest form of wisdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Deimos said dryly.</p><p>I clapped his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll send word.\u201d</p> <p>The porters and the palanquin-bearers were waiting. The latter lowered their poles, allowing me to step lightly into the palanquin. As soon as I was seated, they raised the poles and began moving forward at a smooth, steady trot. The porters followed, carrying my trunks, and a sealed trunk I\u2019d found that bore an engraved plate with Sunjata\u2019s name. I\u2019d no idea what was in it, but it wasn\u2019t listed on the manifest, and I\u2019d thought it best to take it with me. Some business of her ladyship\u2019s, no doubt.</p><p>We passed a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Tanit, who I understood presided over Carthage along with Ba\u2019al Hammon, and a vast, open space marked by a multitude of carved stelae. One of the porters freed a hand to touch his brow in a gesture of deference.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that place?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>\u201cIt is the tophet,\u201d he said. \u201cMany children are buried there.\u201d After a moment, he added, \u201cNot for a very long time. The gods have been merciful.\u201d</p><p>What a thought! I couldn\u2019t imagine gods cruel enough to demand such a sacrifice. \u201cDo you have children?\u201d I asked the porter, curious. \u201cCould you offer them if the gods demanded it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a son.\u201d He jogged along, holding Sunjata\u2019s trunk balanced atop his head. \u201cTo save my people from famine or conquest? If the gods demanded it, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d find a gentler god to worship,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>The porter shrugged, or made a gesture that would have been a shrug if he hadn\u2019t been carrying a heavy trunk on his head. \u201cWhat use is a gentle god?\u201d</p> <p>It was an interesting question; oddly, it made me think of the shrine of Blessed Elua in our garden when I was a boy. There had been a field of . . . no, not poppies. I\u2019d no idea what had made me think of poppies. Elua\u2019s effigy had stood beneath a trellis laced with climbing sweet-pea vines. My mother used to send me out there to pray and contemplate when I\u2019d done something bad, like poked Darielle with a pin to make her scream. I\u2019d usually fall asleep, basking in the scent of sweet-peas, feeling safe and content beneath Elua\u2019s enigmatic smile.</p><p>I supposed Blessed Elua was a gentle god.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think on it,\u201d I said to the porter, who merely grunted.</p><p>They took me to an inn on the slopes of the hill, which was indeed quite acceptable. The proprietor as an unctuous fellow, dressed in loose robes of good quality, jewels flashing on his fingers.</p><p>\u201cMaharbal is here to serve you, young lord,\u201d he said with a bow, then paused. \u201cMy lord is from Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy birth, yes.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cBut no, my lord is from the Governor of Cythera, and it is there that my loyalties lie.\u201d It was true enough in its own way, so long as his purpose accorded with her ladyship\u2019s. \u201cLeander Maignard. I come bearing gifts of goodwill for General Astegal\u2019s bride.\u201d I gestured loosely toward the harbor. \u201cThey\u2019ll be transported once I\u2019ve arranged for a proper household, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Maharbal touched his fingertips together. \u201cI would be pleased to assist your lordship. As it happens, I have a cousin . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a cousin,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d His smile faded somewhat. \u201cI think you would find her accommodations most suitable for a D\u2019Angeline lord of style.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cHow passing odd that you find yourself in the service of Cythera.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a long, long story.\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cHis eminence thought the young princess might take kindly to seeing a fellow countryman. One without loyalties to Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d Another broad smile. \u201cAlthough of course the princess need not know this. It is understood that there is some delicacy to the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Maharbal said dubiously.</p><p>I laughed and patted one of the nearest trunks. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, good Maharbal. My papers were inspected in the harbor. I have letters of introduction from Ptolemy Solon to a dozen of Carthage\u2019s luminaries. You or your cousin won\u2019t find yourself harboring a D\u2019Angeline spy, if that\u2019s what you fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d he protested. \u201cCome, come, let me show you to your chambers.\u201d He snapped his fingers for a servant. \u201cHave his lordship\u2019s things brought.\u201d</p><p>Well, of course he feared I was a spy. I\u2019d watched the suspicion emerge when I\u2019d blunted the edge of his greed with the comment about his cousin. It was bound to emerge sooner or later, so best to get it out of the way. And people were predictable. Confronted with the very suspicion in the forefront of their thoughts, they\u2019ll deny it almost every time, even though it\u2019s written on their faces.</p><p>And the ironic thing was that I hadn\u2019t exactly lied. I was in Ptolemy Solon\u2019s service for this mission. But even among those members of the Unseen Guild in Carthage who knew of her ladyship\u2019s existence, I doubted anyone would suspect that the Wise Ape of Cythera was sufficiently besotted to risk such a dangerous venture as I was undertaking; and moreover, that her ladyship would implore him to risk it on behalf of the son who\u2019d recently sought to have her slain.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t fathom it myself.</p><p>A gentle god, indeed. Mayhap not.</p><p>I followed Maharbal to a pleasant suite of rooms, complete with a pert little serving maid to attend me. She eyed me with interest, not particularly caring if I was a spy. I winked at her and wondered how close-knit the web of intrigue that bound Carthage\u2019s servants and slaves was. To wit, if I bedded the chambermaid in Carthage\u2019s most fashionable inn, would this bit of gossip find its way to the princess\u2019 household staff? And did they gossip with their young D\u2019Angeline mistress?</p><p>Mayhap, mayhap not.</p><p>Best to be circumspect. As her ladyship had said, just be safe.</p><p>It was growing late in the day. I had the chambermaid show me to the inn\u2019s modest bath, declining with regret her offer of assistance. The evening air held just a touch of coolness. I luxuriated in the warm waters, washing the salt grime from the long sea voyage off my skin, unbraiding and washing my hair, letting it float on the surface of the water. When I climbed out of the pool, clad in naught but my ruby eardrops, there were a handful of peeping gazes. I stood beside the pool, shaking water out of my hair.</p><p>\u201cSee anything you like, ladies?\u201d I called.</p><p>Most of them giggled and scattered. My chambermaid came forward, blushing, to proffer a linen robe.</p><p>\u201cIf my lordship wishes . . .\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d I lifted her chin with two fingers. \u201cBut I have duties to attend to, my peach, and I am weary from my journey.\u201d I kissed her lips, feeling them part beneath mine. \u201cAnother day, mayhap.\u201d</p><p>The chambermaid trembled a little. \u201cDo you promise?\u201d</p><p>I smiled into her eyes and lied. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>Later, the words haunted me. Unfulfilled desire made me restless. I tossed and turned on my sheets, which were not so fine as those in her ladyship\u2019s household. I should have bedded the chambermaid. After all, who would find that odd? Like as not, it was odder that I\u2019d refused. After all, I wasn\u2019t meant to be coming to Carthage with the intent of seducing the Dauphine. Not so far as the world knew, not so far as she knew. There was no reason I shouldn\u2019t bed a willing girl. It might even have had more impact if the princess knew, later, that I\u2019d eschewed all others, ostensibly in love with her. On the other hand, if I established myself as a rake, whatever dragons Astegal had left guarding his household would hardly be inclined to allow me access to his wife.</p><p>Gods, this was more complicated than I\u2019d reckoned.</p><p>Why did the lie trouble me?</p><p>Because, I decided, it wasn\u2019t worthy of her ladyship. Despite all the vitriol leveled at her, she lied very seldom, and only to a purpose. And she never made false promises. She maintained her own unfathomable standards of integrity. And although she did not demand that of her people, it irritated me that I\u2019d fallen short of it for so little reason.</p><p>I resolved to do better. I would give the chambermaid some little trinket and an apology; like as not, that would suffice to thrill the lass. And as far as slaking my desire went, I\u2019d err on the side of discretion.</p><p>After all, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. I hadn\u2019t seen Sunjata for a couple of years, but I couldn\u2019t imagine that much had changed between us. And for a surety, one couldn\u2019t ask for a more discreet lover than Sunjata.</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>In the morning, Maharbal escorted me to his cousin\u2019s villa. It seemed the lady\u2019s husband was a minor Carthaginian lord and a captain in the service of General Astegal\u2019s army. While he was away, she had retired to their country estate, and Maharbal saw no reason why the villa should remain empty when there was a tidy profit to be turned.</p><p>I liked it. It was a bit small, but then I was accustomed to her ladyship\u2019s vast and labyrinthine estate. The mosaic floors were of good quality and the frescoes on the walls were tasteful. The gardens were pleasant.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t in the most elite neighborhood, but it was clearly a neighborhood of quality. The surrounding villas spoke of well-to-do families, ambitious without being grasping. Nothing ostentatious, but nothing overly modest. If I wanted to be careful and discreet, this struck just the right tone.</p><p>As an added advantage, the lady in question had left a handful of her household behind to tend to the maintenance and security of the villa. All I\u2019d need to hire were bearers for a palanquin.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin\u2019s servants would be at your service, naturally,\u201d Maharbal said, pointing out this fact.</p><p>I pursed my lips. \u201cI prefer to oversee the hiring of my own household.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed. \u201cI assure you, they are more than competent.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around. \u201cIt\u2019s rather small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are but one man,\u201d Maharbal observed. \u201cIt is space sufficient for a small family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I may wish to entertain while I\u2019m here,\u201d I said. \u201cOne could not hope to dine with more than a dozen folk.\u201d</p><p>Maharbal shrugged. \u201cI suspect you\u2019ll find that many of his eminence\u2019s acquaintances are not in residence during wartime.\u201d</p><p>We played the game for a while longer; then I relented and expressed grudging interest. Maharbal made an outrageous offer, which I countered. After copious haggling, we came to an accommodation.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wish, I would be pleased to accompany you to the slave-market to purchase bearers. I can tell you which merchants are reputable, and which beat or starve their wares.\u201d</p><p>An edge had crept into his voice. I sensed Maharbal was testing me, waiting to see if I would protest out of delicate D\u2019Angeline sensibilities. \u201cExcellent!\u201d I gave him a bright smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go at once.\u201d</p><p>Maharbal bowed. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>We proceeded to the slave-market in the inn\u2019s double palanquin. In my opinion, it was a singularly stupid and inefficient manner of travel. I\u2019d sooner ride astride or in a carriage, or even go on foot, which would be just as swift and considerably less jarring. But it was clear, travelling the streets of Carthage, that no one of quality walked. The only folk I saw on horseback appeared to be couriers, and many of the streets were too narrow to admit a carriage.</p><p>So, palanquins.</p><p>The slave-market was in a forum lined with voluminous silk tents. Maharbal gave his bearers leave to rest in the shade at one end of the forum, while we strolled and perused the wares.</p><p>\u201cWill you be wanting a girl?\u201d he asked. Without waiting for an answer, he pointed at a tawny lovely with a defiant gaze. \u201cAmazigh. They\u2019re desert folk. Stay away from them. The women are as like to stab you as kiss you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo girl.\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Maharbal raised his brows. \u201cA boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cMy friend, it\u2019s been over ten years since I\u2019ve set foot on Terre d\u2019Ange, but there is one part of my heritage I retain. I\u2019ll not take anyone, man or woman, as an unwilling bed partner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA man of scruples,\u201d he said with amusement. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, one or two,\u201d I replied easily.</p><p>Maharbal laughed. \u201cSomehow, I suspect that getting willing bed partners is no obstacle for you, my lord. Come, let\u2019s have a look at the brute muscle. Strytanus keeps a healthy stable.\u201d</p><p>We strolled over to a blue tent where the slave-merchant Strytanus did indeed keep a healthy stable.</p><p>I\u2019d been to slave-markets before, but only in her ladyship\u2019s company, and only knowing that any slave purchased on Cythera would serve no more than seven years\u2019 time, which really wasn\u2019t much worse than the custom of indentured service in Terre d\u2019Ange. And, of course, any slaves purchased by her ladyship were given their freedom and the opportunity to enter her service, which served the dual purpose of assuaging her ladyship\u2019s deep-seated remorse for her son\u2019s suffering, as well as building her loyal network.</p> <p>This was different.</p><p>Carthage had no such laws. Most of the slaves sold here would live and die as slaves, unless by some chance they were clever or useful enough to rise very, very high in their master\u2019s estimation. And anyone being sold for brute muscle was unlikely to stand such a chance.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d I asked an older hulking fellow with a squashed nose.</p><p>\u201cHellas,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cI was a wrestler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He eyed me warily. \u201cLost too many matches and fell into penury. Why do you care?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d The slaver Strytanus struck him across the broad shoulders with a narrow rod. \u201cMind your tongue.\u201d</p><p>The wrestler didn\u2019t flinch, but his gaze slid away from mine.</p><p>I talked to a few others, a process the slaves, slave-merchant, and Maharbal found quite bizarre. In the end, I settled on the wrestler, a pair of lean, hungry-looking Carthaginian brothers who\u2019d known a lifetime of deprivation, and a fierce Amazigh with a branded cheek who refused to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d Maharbal said affably. \u201cThe Hellene\u2019s too old, the Carthaginians are malnourished\u2014through no fault of Strytanus\u2019, I\u2019ll hasten to add\u2014and the Amazigh\u2019s like to slide a dagger between your ribs.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Strytanus had grown distracted by a new customer, a Carthaginian lady seeking a pretty boy to decorate her household. She was contemplating a slender lad of some ten or eleven years, with curly black hair and fear-stricken eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs he biddable?\u201d she fretted.</p><p>The slave-merchant spread his hands. \u201cMy lady, I make no claims. He is Aragonian, one of the first fruits of the spoils of war. You asked for pretty and he is that. If he is wise, he will be grateful for your gentle mercy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d The woman waved one hand. \u201cDoes he at least speak Hellene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear he does not,\u201d Strytanus said in an apologetic tone.</p><p>She tilted her head, considering the boy. He stared back at her, wide brown eyes filled with terror and incomprehension. For some reason, the sight made me feel sick inside.</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d the Carthaginian woman said decisively. She gestured to her attendants. \u201cNext!\u201d</p><p>The boy gazed after her as she swept away toward the next tent full of human merchandise, unsure what had transpired. Knowing only that he was alone in the world, friendless and bereft.</p><p>\u201cForgive me.\u201d Strytanus approached, bowing. \u201cYou have made your choice, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d I wrenched my gaze from the Aragonian boy.</p><p>Strytanus noticed. \u201cIs my lord . . . interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, no.\u201d I forced a smile. \u201cShall we talk?\u201d</p><p>We haggled over the bearers I\u2019d chosen. In the end, I daresay I got a fair price, since I\u2019d chosen men the slaver was eager to dispose of. Not so good a price as I might have gotten. I was distracted by the boy.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Strytanus said smoothly when our deal was concluded. \u201cI shall have them delivered to your household in a matter of hours.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head. \u201cMy thanks.\u201d</p><p>Our business finished, Maharbal and I departed. I felt the Aragonian boy\u2019s eyes burning holes in my back, starved for some word or gesture of kindness. I wished I could have spared him. But I\u2019d already told Maharbal I wasn\u2019t in the market for aught but bearers. And as the slave-trader had said, he was but the first of many. The spoils of war. There would be others.</p><p>Many others.</p><p>I could best help them by completing my mission. By undoing Carthage\u2019s magics\u2014those that bound the princess, and those that bound Terre d\u2019Ange itself. For the first time, it began to feel like a noble cause. It was a novel sensation, and one I quite enjoyed contemplating.</p><p>We ventured to the inner harbor and located Captain Deimos aboard the Cytheran flagship. I made arrangements to have Ptolemy Solon\u2019s tribute-gifts delivered to the villa I had rented. And then, back to the inn, where Maharbal made arrangements to have my things delivered and his bearers to escort me. He bade me farewell, covering my hands with his own. \u201cIf I may be of further service . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I pressed his hands warmly. \u201cYou have been most helpful.\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cWe seek to please.\u201d</p><p>I gathered my things, making them ready for the porters. I spied the chambermaid I\u2019d rejected lurking around a corner. I gave her a cheap gilt ring set with a flawed garnet.</p><p>\u201cA token,\u201d I said somberly. \u201cFor your beauty. An apology for the lack of what might have been.\u201d</p><p>The chambermaid beamed at me. \u201cMy lord is too kind!\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her. \u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>It was a relief to get free of the place. Gods above! It took so little time for folk to attempt to set hooks in one. I rode in Maharbal\u2019s palanquin to his cousin\u2019s villa, then dismissed his bearers with a word of thanks and a few copper coins.</p><p>The servants at my new villa were bustling about, dusting, waxing, and scouring with an alacrity that I daresay they\u2019d not shown since their mistress departed. I wandered the rooms and the grounds, familiarizing myself with the place. The chamberlain, a sober fellow named Anysus, assured me that he would be pleased to procure anything I required. After the cloying manner of Maharbal, I was pleased by his demeanor.</p><p>Everything arrived in good order. My possessions, sent from the inn. The tribute-gifts, under the watchful eye of Captain Deimos and his men. Deimos gave me the name of the dockside inn where they would take lodging, and I assured him I\u2019d send word if I had need.</p><p>My bearers arrived, looking sullen and suspicious. The steward Anysus took charge of them and led them to the servants\u2019 quarters. I\u2019d told him I wanted them washed and fed on arrival. I waited until they were eating, then went to have a word with them, closing the door of the small room in which the household servants dined. The aroma of lamb stew filled the space.</p><p>\u201cListen, lads,\u201d I said to them. The Carthaginian brothers put down their spoons with pained looks. I laughed. \u201cGo ahead, keep eating.\u201d</p><p>They hunched over their bowls, shoveling down food. The Hellene wrestler waited, regarding me with equanimity. The Amazigh continued eating, slow and measured, his gaze hooded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a stranger here,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd this place, these servants . . .\u201d I waved my hand. \u201cRented. I\u2019d like to know I\u2019ve a few loyal men at my side. Give me that, and I\u2019ll pledge you your freedom when I\u2019m done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would we go?\u201d one of the brothers asked in bewilderment.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWherever you like. You can stay here, or you can return to Cythera with me. You\u2019d be given a position there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your business?\u201d the Hellene asked cynically. \u201cA danger to us, I\u2019ll wager.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d chosen him for the shrewdness in his gaze. The brothers were desperate, which would serve well enough. The Amazigh . . . I don\u2019t know. A bit of a whim, a hunch. Mayhap a desire to irk Maharbal.</p><p>\u201cNot if you keep your mouth shut,\u201d I said candidly. \u201cI\u2019m here to pay tribute to General Astegal\u2019s new bride and meet with members of the Council of Thirty. All his eminence the governor asks is that I return with assurances that his position is secure should Carthage turn its gaze toward the east. Assurances best kept quiet, given that the governor serves at Khebbel-im-Akkad\u2019s pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His eyes glinted. \u201cPolitics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou want to buy our loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>A wide smile spread over his ugly face. \u201cGood enough. It\u2019s yours, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be food like this every day?\u201d a Carthaginian brother asked plaintively.</p><p>I propped my elbows on my knees. \u201cEvery day.\u201d</p><p>It was good enough for them. The wrestler pointed at the Amazigh. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>I looked thoughtfully at the desert tribesman. He returned my gaze without blinking, eating steadily and managing at the same time to look as though he would indeed be pleased to knife me. \u201cDo you speak Punic?\u201d I asked the brothers, who nodded. \u201cAsk him if he does.\u201d</p><p>The older complied. The Amazigh gave a curt affirmative reply.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I smiled. \u201cTell him of my offer.\u201d</p><p>There was a long exchange. At the end of it, the Amazigh\u2019s eyes glittered with fierce tears. He leapt up from the table and poured out a long utterance in Punic. The wrestler rose and positioned himself to defend me\u2014by the Goddess, I\u2019d made a good choice there!\u2014but the Amazigh ignored him and knelt. To my astonishment, he took both my hands and kissed them.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d The older of the Carthaginians blinked. \u201cHe says if you promise to give him his freedom, he pledges loyalty with every drop of blood in his body.\u201d</p><p>I looked into the man\u2019s glittering eyes. \u201cIn Blessed Elua\u2019s name, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>The Carthaginian repeated my words. The Amazigh let go my hands and bowed his head, touching his brow to the ground.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d I stood. \u201cDo you know your way around the city?\u201d All of them shook their heads. I pointed at the wrestler. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKratos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it would take you to learn Carthage\u2019s streets, Kratos?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cA day.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart when you\u2019ve finished eating,\u201d I said. \u201cCome back when you\u2019re done.\u201d I thought for a moment. \u201cTake him,\u201d I added, nodding at the Amazigh.</p><p>\u201cHe might flee,\u201d Kratos observed. \u201cI might flee.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>I spent the balance of my first whole day in Carthage sorting through letters requesting audiences from various personages, placing them with the letters of introduction that Solon had given me. I\u2019d used my time aboard the ship wisely.</p><p>One letter I hadn\u2019t written, and that was to the princess. I wasn\u2019t sure why. On the ship, it had seemed to me that there was some perfect choice of words that was evading me, and I\u2019d resolved to put off the task until I was on solid ground, hoping I\u2019d be able to think more clearly.</p><p>Now it seemed a foolish notion. I was Ptolemy Solon\u2019s emissary. Her highness would see me or refuse me on that basis alone. Still, the feeling persisted. I pushed it firmly away, uncorked my inkwell, and wrote out a courteous and polite request for an audience with her.</p><p>Kratos and the Amazigh\u2014whose name I later learned was Ghanim\u2014returned ere nightfall. I was pleased to have my conviction confirmed. Carthage had strict laws for dealing with runaway slaves. The brand on Ghanim\u2019s face suggested he\u2019d already made one such attempt, and I\u2019d determined that he\u2019d put enough stock in my promise not to risk another. Kratos, I thought, had too much sense.</p><p>Still, \u2019twas always a pleasure to be right. If I\u2019d been mistaken, I\u2019d have been out naught but the cost of a pair of slaves. With this gamble, I\u2019d won another measure of their loyalty, purchased with simple trust.</p><p>I had a brief word with the steward Anysus regarding the delivery of my letters on the morrow, a task he readily agreed to oversee. I gave orders that my new slaves were to be fed heartily three times a day and provided Anysus with funds to cover all additional expenses that this expansion of the household would entail.</p><p>Once that was done, I felt my plans were settling nicely into place. I dined alone and found that the villa\u2019s cook was perfectly adequate. And then I retired to my private chambers and rummaged through Solon\u2019s tribute-gifts until I found a ring that fit me nicely, a heavy band of gold set with a sapphire. Using the tip of my little belt knife, I was able to prize the gem from its setting.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>With the last of my preparations complete, I took to my bed and slept.</p><p>On the morrow, I rose feeling refreshed and full of anticipation. Anysus had already departed, bearing my letters. Kratos had accompanied him of his own initiative to enhance his knowledge of the city. I admired the gesture, although it set my plans back a few hours. So be it. I needed to practice patience. This was not a task that could be rushed.</p><p>At length they returned. Anysus reported that a mere six of the lords were in residence, but that he thought they would be very pleased to receive Ptolemy Solon\u2019s emissary in the next few days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat of her highness?\u201d</p><p>He made an ambiguous gesture. \u201cThat I cannot say, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well.\u201d I raised my brows. \u201cIs General Astegal so protective of his new bride that he forbids her visitors in his absence?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Anysus hesitated. \u201cLet us say that his kinsman Bodeshmun serves as the gatekeeper. He is . . . selective.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. Tell me, since I find myself idle in the meanwhile, might you recommend a reputable gem-merchant?\u201d I showed him the gold ring with its empty setting. \u201cThe stone was lost at sea, and I would feign replace it. The ring was a gift from a lady who would be angry to see I\u2019d been so careless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He recommended several, including Jabnit of the House of Philosir, which was what I\u2019d been hoping to hear.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d I smiled at him and pressed a gold coin into his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve been extraordinarily efficient and helpful, Anysus. I can see why the lord and lady of the house place such trust in you.\u201d</p><p>A slight flush of pleasure touched his cheeks. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>I made my first outing with my new bearers that morning. They did a tolerable job. Kratos might have been past his prime, but he was still as strong as an ox. The Carthaginians panted a bit, but they were determined and eager to prove themselves, and they\u2019d gain strength on a good diet. Ghanim was as steady as a rock.</p><p>Kratos led us to the jewelers\u2019 district, and we located Jabnit\u2019s establishment without any difficulty. A little bell attached to the door gave a merry tinkle as I entered. A young woman emerged from the rear of the building, her eyes widening at the sight of me.</p><p>\u201cGood day,\u201d I said pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see about replacing a lost gem-stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Her hands fluttered. \u201cPlease, my lord, sit. I will fetch the owner.\u201d</p><p>There were fine carpets on the floor, strewn with cushions and set with a low table. I sat cross-legged on a cushion, waiting, until the plump gem-merchant came waddling hastily to attend me. He gave me a startled look, as though he\u2019d not believed the girl when she\u2019d said a D\u2019Angeline lord had strolled into his parlor.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, welcome!\u201d he exclaimed, bowing. \u201cI am Jabnit of Philosir. How may I serve you, my lord?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeander Maignard of Cythera.\u201d I inclined my head. \u201cEmissary of his eminence, Governor Ptolemy Solon.\u201d I slid the ring from my finger. \u201cThis stone was lost, good Jabnit. I seek a replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d With difficulty, Jabnit lowered himself to a cushion. \u201cSophonisba!\u201d he called sharply. \u201cBring tea. And pastries, a tray of pastries.\u201d He examined the ring while the girl complied, setting fragrant cups of sweet tea and a tray of honeyed pastries on the table. \u201cWhat manner of stone?\u201d</p><p>I sipped my tea. \u201cA sapphire. Deep, deep blue to match the eyes of the lady who gave it to me. She will be most wroth to find it missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Jabnit beamed. \u201cA love-token. Fear not, we shall find its very likeness.\u201d He clapped his hands. \u201cSophonisba! Tell Sunjata to bring a selection of sapphires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thanks, good Jabnit,\u201d I said.</p><p>The gem-merchant popped a pastry into his mouth. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Sunjata enter. I saw him pause briefly, a slight hesitation only a Guildsman would have caught. Our eyes met. His full lips moved in the faintest twitch. I wondered if he\u2019d suspected it was me when the girl announced my arrival. He bowed silently, then lowered a silk cushion strewn with several sapphires to the table.</p><p>\u201cSit, sit!\u201d Jabnit waved hand at him. \u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, you know the wares better than I do, Sunjata.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you wish, my lord.\u201d Sunjata sank to the cushions with fluid grace, legs crossed.</p><p>Jabnit reached for another pastry. \u201cGo on, tell him.\u201d</p><p>Calm and professional, Sunjata described the various gems to me, one by one, pointing out their flaws and merits. By the Goddess, he really had become proficient; but then, he\u2019d always learned quickly. I watched his dark, slender fingers dance over the cushion, picking up this stone and that one.</p><p>\u201cThis would fit the setting well,\u201d he murmured in his clear voice. \u201cLittle alteration would be required. Does it match your lady\u2019s eyes?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cI nearly think it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have it ready for you on the morrow,\u201d Sunjata said.</p><p>\u201cMight it be possible to have it delivered?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>Sunjata smiled back at me. \u201cI would be honored to deliver it myself. Where are you lodging?\u201d</p><p>I told him, then watched him depart after promising to deliver it in the morning.</p><p>\u201cSuch a gifted young man!\u201d Jabnit said cheerfully. \u201cHe can be a merciless scold, but he was on good behavior today.\u201d He nudged me with one elbow. \u201cVery popular with the patrons, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is.\u201d I returned my thoughts to the matter at hand. \u201cSo! How much will this lighten my purse, good Jabnit?\u201d</p><p>He named a figure, and I haggled long enough to make a good show of it. I stayed for another cup of tea, consenting to alleviate Jabnit\u2019s curiosity about my presence in Carthage as an emissary of Ptolemy Solon\u2019s, then left feeling well pleased with myself.</p><p>\u201cHome, my lord?\u201d Kratos asked, rising.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d I agreed, climbing into the palanquin.</p><p>I returned to find a reply awaiting me from one of the Carthaginian lords, an old scholar named Hamilcar, inviting me to call on him at my leisure. He wasn\u2019t one of the Council of Thirty, but he\u2019d known Solon when they were boys, and he sounded eager to speak with me. And one entry into Carthaginian society, accepting me as Ptolemy Solon\u2019s legitimate envoy, would ease the way for others.</p><p>They would come.</p><p>Bodeshmun . . . Bodeshmun might be the toughest nut to crack, guarding access to the princess. But I\u2019d a feeling curiosity would wear him down. Like my lord Solon, he was a man who valued knowledge above all else. In the end, I thought, it would get the better of him. Then all I had to do was convince him I was harmless, and exactly what I seemed. And on the morrow, I\u2019d have the benefit of Sunjata\u2019s advice on how to do that very thing.</p><p>All in all, it had been a good day.</p><p>On the morrow, I idled in my private chambers until Anysus came to announce Sunjata\u2019s arrival.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d I said. \u201cPray, send him in. I\u2019ve a mind to speak with him regarding another commission.\u201d</p><p>The steward bowed. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>He left and returned shortly with Sunjata in tow. This time, Sunjata\u2019s handsome face was perfectly composed. Not until the door was firmly closed behind him and we heard the steps of Anysus departing did he smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Sunjata murmured. \u201cLeander Maignard.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cPleased to see me?\u201d</p><p>Sunjata came forward and put his arms around my neck, kissing me. His lips were as soft as a woman\u2019s, but firmer. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd curious as hell.\u201d He tilted his head, regarding me beneath long lashes. \u201cWhat in the name of all the gods is her ladyship up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestroying Carthage,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>His brown eyes widened, lit by a sudden spark of hope and bitter ferocity. \u201cDo you jest?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d Sunjata\u2019s body tensed. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p><p>I led him into the farthest reaches of my chambers, where there was no risk of being overheard. He sat cross-legged on my bed opposite me and listened without a word while I told him all of it. How Prince Imriel had survived his madness and come to Cythera to beg his mother\u2019s aid. How her ladyship had persuaded Solon to give it. The details of the intricate web of spells binding Terre d\u2019Ange and its young princess, and how they might be dismantled.</p><p>Some of it, of course, Sunjata knew\u2014he\u2019d been the one to alert her ladyship to Carthage\u2019s plans. But he hadn\u2019t known the inner workings of the horologists\u2019 magics nor the extent of what they had planned, only bits and pieces of their preparations, gleaned through his supposed apprenticeship. It was Solon who\u2019d guessed at what Carthage intended and sent the charmed needle he\u2019d used on Prince Imriel, and Solon who had now determined how the spell might be undone.</p><p>\u201cDo you truly mean to attempt this?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said in surprise. \u201cWhy ever not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d His eyes were shadowed.</p><p>I took his hand. \u201cSo is what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m merely a spy.\u201d Sunjata\u2019s full mouth twisted. \u201cEyes and ears. Does her ladyship ask more of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly your counsel,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, or so I think. She sent a trunk for you.\u201d I rose and fetched it. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>I watched him open it, picking the lock with an easy skill I envied. There was a letter on the top. Sunjata unsealed it and read what was written there. It took him some time, and I guessed it was written in coded language. He sat motionless, only his lips moving silently. Once, a little tremor ran through him. When he had finished, he bowed his head slightly, then straightened. He put the letter back in the trunk and closed it without meeting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cBad news?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His gaze shifted to my face, his expression as guarded as I\u2019d ever seen it. \u201cBut it\u2019s naught I can tell you, Leander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said gently. \u201cWhat can you tell me? I\u2019ve learned that Bodeshmun guards access to the princess. How might I convince him I\u2019m harmless?\u201d</p><p>Sunjata\u2019s expression eased somewhat. \u201cFlatter him,\u201d he said. \u201cLet him believe Ptolemy Solon is amazed at his achievement and wants a report on the effects. Bodeshmun\u2019s as clever as the devil, but there\u2019s a spark of vanity there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I nodded. \u201cHow about the princess herself? Does he keep her under lock and key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d He tapped his lower lip in thought. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . careful. She\u2019s no prisoner, but she\u2019s insulated and fed lies. I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s any idea what\u2019s happening in Terre d\u2019Ange. You\u2019ll have to convince Bodeshmun you\u2019ve not the slightest intent of telling her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is happening in Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing good,\u201d Sunjata said soberly. \u201cThe last I heard, the Queen\u2019s accused her kinsman of fomenting rebellion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duc L\u2019Envers?\u201d I asked, searching my memory. He nodded. \u201cAre they at war with one another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Sunjata said.</p><p>\u201cThe prince was to send L\u2019Envers a letter with Solon\u2019s advice,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the Queen can be convinced to send Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s army to Aragonia, it will remove them from play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d He sounded doubtful. \u201cI fear the advice may come too late. She\u2019s not likely to commit her forces overseas if she fears a coup at home.\u201d</p><p>I shivered a little. \u201cWhat a fearful thing it would be to have one\u2019s wits stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sunjata gazed at me. \u201cFearful.\u201d He gave himself a shake. \u201cAh. Your ring.\u201d He reached in his purse and brought it out. \u201cThat was a clever piece of subterfuge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I took it from him. \u201cI\u2019m not bad at this, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>A silence fell between us.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I cocked my head. \u201cJabnit implied that you were wont to tryst with patrons. Is it for business or pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Sunjata\u2019s mouth twisted in another cynical smile. \u201cWhat do you think? It\u2019s always business, Leander. Her ladyship\u2019s business . . . sometimes even the House of Philosir\u2019s business. Happy patrons are generous customers.\u201d He laughed harshly. \u201cNo one thinks of a eunuch\u2019s pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I touched the smooth curve of his cheek. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Unexpected tears brightened his eyes. \u201cYou always did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly did?\u201d I leaned forward to kiss him lightly. \u201cMust it be did?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t press him; one didn\u2019t press Sunjata. He was proud and he\u2019d been used badly before her ladyship found him. I didn\u2019t know what manner of lovers he had endured here in Carthage. But we had known each other well, once. And if I couldn\u2019t give him back what had been taken from him, I\u2019d been able to show him the beauty in what remained. He\u2019d always said no one else had done that for him. So I waited.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sunjata reached for me, kissing me with fierce passion, his tongue sliding past my lips. We tumbled on the bed together, half wrestling, tugging at one another\u2019s clothing. I wanted to go at a leisurely pace, but he was unwontedly hurried and urgent at first.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d I teased, easing his shirt over his head. I kissed his sleek dark-brown chest, slender and hairless as a boy\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me men always rush too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He did, though. When we were both naked, Sunjata grew quiet and still, gazing at me in the sunlight spilling into the bedchamber. His fingers stroked my hair, undoing my braids until my hair fell loose and waving over my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTake out your eardrops,\u201d he murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI want to see you mother-naked.\u201d</p><p>Giving him a quizzical look, I complied.</p> <p>Sunjata gazed at me for a long, long time, lips parted as though to drink in the sight of me. I let him, wondering what in the name of the gods was going through his mind. But then, I often did. \u201cYou can put them back,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>I did. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, only closed his eyes and reached for me again.</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p><p>In the days that followed, I spent a pleasant afternoon drinking palm wine and listening to the old scholar Hamilcar reminisce about his youth and the intellectual shooting star that had been Ptolemy Solon when he had tarried in Carthage and studied in her academies. I received more invitations in response and attended a dinner party hosted by Gemelquart, a prince of the House of Zinnrid and a member of the Council of Thirty.</p> <p>He was a shrewd, well-informed fellow who wasn\u2019t taking part in Astegal\u2019s campaign due to a childhood illness that had left him with weak lungs. According to Sunjata, he was a Guildsman, though I liked to think I would have discovered it quickly for myself. There is a certain tenor one learns to listen for when someone asks a question to which the answer is already known.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me,\u201d Gemelquart said with deceptive ease. \u201cHow does a D\u2019Angeline come to be in the bidding of the Wise Ape of Cythera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, \u2019tis a long tale of treason and exile, hardly fit for dinner conversation.\u201d I glanced at a nearby lamp and offered one of the Guild\u2019s coded phrases. \u201cThat burns with a passing clear flame, my lord. Is the oil pressed locally?\u201d</p><p>His eyelids flickered. \u201cYes, indeed.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>Gemelquart chuckled, then coughed. \u201cI see. And what does Cythera hope to accomplish by your presence here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI merely bring assurances of Cythera\u2019s goodwill.\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cInadvertent or no, Carthage\u2019s actions have served to resolve a certain . . . dilemma. For that, we are grateful. If I may be indiscreet, let me say that whatever the future may bring, we hope this goodwill is reciprocated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Gemelquart steepled his fingers. \u201cThe Governor of Cythera enjoys a happy situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd he would be loath to see it change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtless.\u201d The Carthaginian lord looked amused. \u201cWell, you may surely tell Ptolemy Solon that Carthage has no designs on his happiness. Perhaps someday in the future he may return our inadvertent favor, given his intimate knowledge of the workings of Khebbel-im-Akkad.\u201d</p><p>I hoisted my winecup to him. \u201cDoubtless he would be pleased to do so, were his happiness assured.\u201d</p><p>Gemelquart gave a wheezing laugh. \u201cYes, yes!\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cTell me, is she as beautiful as the rumors claim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply, picturing her ladyship. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d hoped so.\u201d</p> <p>It was an exhilarating feeling, like walking balanced atop a very high ledge. I\u2019d seldom felt more alive than I did intriguing in Carthage. And the feeling only intensified when I got my first look at Sidonie de la Courcel.</p><p>The idea was Sunjata\u2019s. I\u2019d not yet received a reply from her or Bodeshmun or any representative of the House of Sarkal. But through his own sources, Sunjata learned that the princess was dining at the house of certain Carthaginian lady on a particular evening. He came to the villa to inform me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fashion among some of the young men left in Carthage to pay tribute to her,\u201d Sunjata told me, lying propped on one elbow. \u201cLoitering in the streets outside the Sarkal villa to catch a glimpse of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unexpectedly charming,\u201d I observed.</p><p>He shrugged a shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t put too much stock into it. It\u2019s some scheme Astegal dreamed up to reinforce the notion that this is a love-match that has all of Carthage charmed. He wants her kept happy and ignorant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoughtful fellow,\u201d I said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t manage to get her with child before he left, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d Sunjata smiled wryly. \u201cThough not for lack of trying, I understand. You do realize that she thinks herself in love with him, Leander? She\u2019s not about to fall into your embrace, lovely creature though you may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know.\u201d I folded my arms behind my head. \u201cBut she\u2019s not in love with him. That truth is in there somewhere. And I\u2019m hoping that I bear just enough resemblance to her beloved Imriel to unlock it. We\u2019re kin, you know, albeit distantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sunjata gazed at me. \u201cI scarce had a chance to speak with him in Terre d\u2019Ange. You spent time with him. What\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel?\u201d I thought about it. \u201cIntense. But I suppose he was rather desperate when I met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he actually loves her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cGods above, it would be unlikely as all hell. But if he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s as skilled a player as her ladyship, which is entirely possible.\u201d I freed one arm and reached out to run my fingers through the soft cloud of Sunjata\u2019s hair. \u201cAnyway, it doesn\u2019t matter, does it? What matters is whether or not she loves him, and given that she defied her royal mother and half the nation, I\u2019d say she does. Or at least thinks she does,\u201d I added. \u201cIt may be nothing more than a girlish infatuation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sunjata rolled onto his belly, propping his chin on cupped hands. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is. And I think he does love her.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had such a romantic streak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cSo, do you want to have a look at the lady in question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I said. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>At the appropriate hour, I summoned my bearers. We went to the flower market, I in my palanquin and Sunjata walking alongside it. There, I bought a great armload of roses and a basket. I put Kratos and the lads to work plucking the roses and filling the basket with petals while Sunjata and I visited a wineshop. Kratos thought I was mad\u2014and I daresay the others did, too\u2014but he did it willingly enough.</p><p>The sun was low in the sky when we made our way up the hill to Astegal\u2019s villa, drenching Carthage in golden light. The villa was easily three times the size of mine, although most of it was hidden behind high walls. There was an imposing gate with a marble arch above it set with a seal depicting the House of Sarkal\u2019s insignia, a stylized hawk. A handful of young men were gathered there. They gave us curious looks, but asked no questions as we took places among them.</p><p>I tucked the basket of petals beneath my arm. \u201cLet them see how a D\u2019Angeline pays tribute to a woman,\u201d I said to Sunjata.</p><p>We didn\u2019t have long to wait. The gilded light was just beginning to deepen to amber when the princess\u2019 palanquin appeared. It was an ornate affair, large and heavy with gold leaf, the sides worked with the same hawk insignia. The bearers were all of a height, strapping fellows in scarlet tunics. Four additional men flanked the palanquin. They were an odd sight, clad in flowing indigo robes, their heads and faces wrapped in burnooses, swords hanging from their belts.</p><p>\u201cAmazigh,\u201d Sunjata murmured. \u201cVery fierce, and when they give their loyalty, they mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed,\u201d I said. \u201cThese are loyal to Astegal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>The young Carthaginian admirers began to cheer as the palanquin came through the gates. I caught my first glimpse of its inhabitant. Her profile held a young, delicate beauty. Honey-gold hair coiled atop her head, a few curling locks hanging loose.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fair,\u201d I mused. \u201cFairer than I expected. One wouldn\u2019t suspect she was half-Cruithne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, D\u2019Angelines can be insufferable,\u201d Sunjata muttered.</p><p>\u201cJealous, my dusky plum?\u201d I shot him a quick smile. \u201cI spoke of her coloring. My father took me to see the Cruarch\u2019s entourage pass once when I was a boy. They\u2019re not as dark as you, but believe me, there wasn\u2019t a fair-haired head among the Cruithne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s been a cuckoo in the Queen\u2019s nest,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>At that moment, the palanquin paused to allow the princess to acknowledge the cheers. She turned her head, smiling graciously at her admirers.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps not,\u201d Sunjata commented.</p><p>Her eyes were black. For no earthly reason I could conceive, that fact hit me like a punch to the gut. Her gaze shifted, meeting mine as though I\u2019d called her name. Her smile turned puzzled. If I\u2019d felt before as though I walked atop a high ledge, now it seemed to me that the drop below had suddenly become infinitely deeper.</p><p>I stepped forward and bowed, then reached into the basket and grasped a handful of rose petals, tossing them high into the air. Petals rained down between us. We gazed at one another through the shower.</p><p>\u201cHo!\u201d One of the Amazigh came over and grabbed my basket. He rummaged briefly in it, searching for a hidden dagger or somewhat. I stood stock-still, staring at the princess. She returned my gaze, frowning with bemusement. And then the Amazigh thrust the basket back at me and gave an order, and the palanquin moved on.</p><p>I stared after it, long after the other seeming admirers had drifted away.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Sunjata\u2019s light voice interrupted my reverie. \u201cIf you sought to give the impression of a man besotted at first sight, I\u2019d say you did a fair job of it.\u201d</p><p>I shook myself. \u201cDo you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d There was an inexplicable edge of sorrow to his tone. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll venture to say her young highness took notice of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seemed.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cWell. We\u2019ll see what this brings. Will you come back to the villa with me?\u201d</p><p>Sunjata shook his head. \u201cI think not. I\u2019m meeting early on the morrow with Hannon, my purported master in the Guild.\u201d He smiled crookedly. \u201cI\u2019m to report on you, as a matter of fact. The pompous dolt thinks I\u2019ve been very clever to get myself into a position to spy on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, excellent,\u201d I said absently. \u201cI revealed myself as a Guildsman to Gemelquart of Zinnrid the other night. He thinks I\u2019m here to assure the Council that Ptolemy Solon merely wishes to be left in peace with her ladyship and will happily cooperate with Carthage to that end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Sunjata nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll confirm it. The gods know, it\u2019s a good deal more believable than the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I felt strange and thoughtful, unaccountably stirred by my first sight of the woman I meant to seduce. Excitement and anticipation, I reckoned; but there was an odd tinge of melancholy, too. Like as not, I was overtired from all my intrigues. \u201cCould you have ever imagined the old ape would take such a risk for love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Sunjata asked.</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cGods, no!\u201d</p><p>He reached out and touched my cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d Sunjata murmured. \u201cI suspect we\u2019re all capable of things we couldn\u2019t have imagined.\u201d</p><p>I caught his hand and kissed his fingers, ignoring a sidelong glance from a passing palanquin. After our first tryst, it had occurred to me that there was a considerable benefit in having Carthage\u2014or at least Bodeshmun\u2014believe I was enamoured of Jabnit the gem-merchant\u2019s assistant. Harmless. I\u2019d worry later about convincing the princess otherwise.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you learn,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d Sunjata asked.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I echoed. The word seemed lodged in my chest, heavy as a stone. \u201cAlways and always. Actually, no. You don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His fingers slid from mine. \u201cWell, we all have our secrets.\u201d</p><p>With that, Sunjata took his leave of me. It was growing late, twilight falling. In another half an hour, one would need a torch to navigate the city. I stood outside the gates of Astegal\u2019s villa, watching Sunjata walk away from me. My bearers waited patiently beside my palanquin.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d I said to them, seating myself.</p><p>They bent their backs to the poles and lifted, hoisting me. Clever Kratos with his squashed nose, offering no comment. The Carthaginian brothers, growing stronger by the day. Ghanim. I\u2019d have to ask him about the Amazigh who guarded the princess.</p><p>Sidonie.</p><p>I said her name aloud, tasting it. \u201cSidonie.\u201d</p><p>It felt good on my tongue.</p><p>I said it again. \u201cSidonie.\u201d</p><p>My bearers trotted. Blue dusk was settling over Carthage, stars emerging as pinpricks in the veil of night. I closed my eyes. Behind my closed lids, I saw her face. Perplexed. A shower of petals falling between us.</p><p>Black eyes.</p><p>Why did it make my heart ache?</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I whispered for a third time, my head lolling. Petals fell. Her dark gaze met mine and held it, hard and intense. I searched for a word and found it. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>Bodeshmun\u2019s response was swift.</p><p>He\u2019d had my letter requesting an audience with the princess. Sidonie. He\u2019d doubtless had spies watching me, Sunjata ostensibly among them. I was certain he\u2019d received a full report from Gemelquart. Whether or not Bodeshmun was a Guildsman, I didn\u2019t know. Even Sunjata was unsure. It didn\u2019t matter. Like Ptolemy Solon, Bodeshmun was filled with knowledge beyond the Guild\u2019s scope. The Chief Horologist made his own rules, and it seemed my appearance among Sidonie\u2019s admirers had goaded him into action. He summoned me to a private audience the following afternoon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, I responded promptly. I brought with me the gift of a book of arcane lore I\u2019d found in the tribute manifest, guessing it was intended for the magus.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Bodeshmun accepted the book with no visible reaction. He regarded me with deep-set eyes. \u201cYou seek audience with my kinsman\u2019s wife on behalf of the Governor of Cythera.\u201d</p><p>I bowed to him, exacting and correct. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I spread my hands, helpless. Harmless. \u201cMay I speak freely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d Bodeshmun said curtly.</p><p>\u201cMuch of the world wonders what strange manner of madness has befallen Terre d\u2019Ange,\u201d I said. \u201cThey speculate and murmur, wondering, wondering. Surely you must know there is one man in the world who does not.\u201d I gave him another deep bow, this time with a flourish. \u201cMy lord Bodeshmun, his eminence Ptolemy Solon wishes to confess himself to be truly and profoundly amazed. You are the architect of a spell the scope and impact of which he could never have envisioned.\u201d</p><p>A smug, satisfied smile touched Bodeshmun\u2019s lips. \u201cOh, he\u2019d dream it, all right. It\u2019s just he\u2019d never dare it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat may be so,\u201d I said diplomatically. \u201cNonetheless, his lordship is sincerely impressed. And, I daresay, a bit envious. He is eager for a firsthand report of the workings of your charms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His heavy brows rose. \u201cWere Solon that eager, he\u2019d have sent you to Terre d\u2019Ange. Plenty to see there. But the Ape of Cythera is in no hurry to curry favor from the half-mad Queen, is he? No, he\u2019s sent you sniffing around Carthage for reassurances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. There is that. And there is another matter.\u201d I lowered my voice. \u201cHe knows about the demon-stone, my lord. The . . .\u201d I snapped my fingers. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t remember the word. Any mind, \u2019tis the other he can\u2019t fathom. How you\u2019ve managed to bind the princess all the way across the sea.\u201d I smiled disarmingly. \u201cD\u2019Angelines are notoriously difficult to sway in matters of the heart, as my lord Solon knows all too well.\u201d</p><p>It was a calculated gamble. My grasp of the workings of magic was tenuous. Still, if I understood correctly, much of the spell that bound Sidonie hinged on Prince Imriel\u2019s stolen ring. There were plenty of folk who could have described the preparations for the spell that bound the City of Elua. Aside from Sunjata, who was ostensibly doing the bidding of his Carthaginian masters, no one but the prince himself knew about the ring. I prayed like hell that knowledge of the prince\u2019s arrival on Cythera hadn\u2019t gotten out. Of course if it had, like as not all of this was in vain, so I reckoned it worth a try.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Bodeshmun smiled again, a broad gloat that sat ill on his grave, bearded face. \u201cDoes Ptolemy Solon seek a means to keep his mistress in line? He\u2019ll have to look elsewhere. I\u2019ll not divulge my secrets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, of course not.\u201d I returned his smile. \u201cBut if I might meet with the princess . . .\u201d</p><p>His smiled vanished and Bodeshmun gave me a look meant to quell. I looked suitably quelled. It wasn\u2019t hard. He was an imposing fellow.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d he mused. My heart gave an unexpected thump at her name. I ignored it and concentrated on looking quelled. Bodeshmun rose and paced the room, his hands clasped behind his back. \u201cYes. That was a clever stunt you pulled last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely hoped to hasten her response,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt had been some days since I sent a letter requesting an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer highness had not yet received your letter,\u201d Bodeshmun said, pronouncing her title with distaste. \u201cI had not made a decision regarding Ptolemy Solon\u2019s unlikely emissary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis lordship thought the princess would be comforted by a D\u2019Angeline face,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cComforted, and apt to spill secrets she doesn\u2019t know,\u201d he said cynically. \u201cBelieve me, Leander Maignard. She\u2019s not got the least inkling of what was done to her.\u201d Bodeshmun\u2019s gaze dwelled on my face. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve every intention of keeping it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course!\u201d I said in surprise. \u201cMy lord Bodeshmun, you are singularly well-informed, and I trust you\u2019re aware of my lord\u2019s situation. To be blunt, the continued peace of my lord Solon and her ladyship Melisande rests on the princess\u2019 continued ensorcelment.\u201d</p> <p>Bodeshmun gave his head a shake. \u201cI never thought to see the day Ptolemy Solon would become a fool for love,\u201d he said half to himself.</p><p>\u201cNor did I,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut her ladyship is a singular individual. And, I may add, pleased and grateful that she no longer has a vengeful son seeking her life.\u201d</p><p>He studied me. \u201cI understand he\u2019s gone missing. Does she know his whereabouts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I met his gaze, willing my expression to one of perfect clarity and transparency. \u201cNo. She knows the shock of your spell broke his wits. And yes, of course we know he vanished. Unfortunately, her own spies within the City were in considerable disarray in the aftermath and were unable to trace him. Has there been word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bodeshmun said shortly.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWell, my lord Solon keeps a guard posted, just in case. Who knows where his madness may lead him? There were rumors he spoke of Cythera in his ravings. And to be truthful . . .\u201d I lowered my voice again. \u201cNo mother prays for a child\u2019s death, not even her ladyship. But I do not think Solon would grieve if the poor mad prince met an untimely end.\u201d I put a finger to my lips. \u201cThat is between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Bodeshmun resumed his pacing.</p><p>I refrained from interrupting him, watching him guilelessly. The Chief Horologist wore long black robes, dense and concealing. There was no way of telling where on his person the talisman Solon had told me about was hidden. At a guess, I\u2019d venture to say an inner pocket. He\u2019d want to keep it close. I wondered if he slept with it. I wondered what vices he had. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy to get at him. I entertained a brief vision of Bodeshmun and I getting blind drunk together at a wineshop, of helping him stumble home, putting him to bed and undressing him.</p><p>Not likely.</p><p>\u201cYou present a dilemma, Leander Maignard,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cI would prefer to send you away. Unfortunately, your appearance last night has piqued the princess\u2019 curiosity.\u201d Bodeshmun gave a tight smile. \u201cWhich is considerable and plaguing. Now I am of two minds as to what to do.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is imperative that she be kept content.\u201d He unleashed another quelling stare. \u201cHer willing presence here is key to confounding Carthage\u2019s enemies. And I am unsure whether or not you would prove an amiable distraction or a dangerous goad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I see.\u201d I smiled. \u201cWell, as to that, I cannot say. But if you wished to advise me on how best I might serve as a distraction, I would be pleased to comply. Our interests here are the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for Solon coveting my secrets,\u201d Bodeshmun observed.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d I laughed. \u201cExcept for that.\u201d</p><p>More pacing. Bodeshmun\u2019s robes swirled. Twice, he touched his chest absentmindedly. I marked it, wondering if that was where the talisman was hidden. Clever or no, I suspected he wasn\u2019t a Guildsman if he\u2019d given himself away like that.</p><p>\u201cYou must not speak of Terre d\u2019Ange,\u201d Bodeshmun said, coming to a decision. \u201cShe believes that all is well there. She believes that the war in Aragonia was provoked by an act of aggression on their part. And she believes that when it is concluded, in time, she and Astegal will preside over a vast and peaceable empire.\u201d He smiled sourly. \u201cAnd perhaps they shall when it is sufficiently subdued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of her former beloved?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>\u201cShe has no memory of him,\u201d he said. \u201cNone at all. It was necessary. And I will ask you not to speak of anything that might touch on it, including Solon\u2019s mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mistress?\u201d I said lightly.</p><p>\u201cI am not jesting.\u201d Bodeshmun\u2019s face hardened. \u201cI don\u2019t care what tale you conceive that places you in Ptolemy Solon\u2019s service without mention of Melisande Shahrizai, but you will do it.\u201d He bent over me and took my chin in his hand. \u201cListen well, Leander Maignard. If you fail in any of these things, I will have your eyes put out and that flippant tongue torn from your head. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>My shudder was unfeigned. \u201cYes, my lord. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He released me. \u201cRemember it.\u201d</p><p>I left the audience shaken, which was probably a good thing. Sunjata was right; this was a dangerous business. I was going to have to tread very, very carefully with Princess Sidonie. I had to find a way to reach her, but if Bodeshmun suspected what I was about, I didn\u2019t have any doubt that he\u2019d carry out his threat.</p><p>I was on my own here.</p><p>And if I failed . . . if I failed, Ptolemy Solon would be placed in a very difficult situation, forced to explain my actions to an angry Carthage. But me, I\u2019d just be blind and tongueless.</p><p>Not a pleasant thought.</p><p>Thirty</p><p>The next day, I received official word from Sidonie de la Courcel, Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange and princess of the House of Sarkal, that my request for an audience had been granted and that I might call on her on the morrow. It was written on thick vellum in a neat, tidy hand, the letter sealed with the hawk crest of the House of Sarkal.</p><p>I wondered if she\u2019d written it herself.</p><p>I had one of the chambermaids polish the chess set with its ivory and onyx pieces until their jeweled eyes gleamed. I summoned Ghanim and one of the Carthaginian brothers\u2014I had a bad habit of forgetting which was which\u2014to translate and asked about the Amazigh who guarded the princess.</p><p>Ghanim spat on the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo friends of his, I take it?\u201d I asked the Carthaginian brother.</p><p>There was a long exchange in Punic.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cThey are men who betrayed their brothers for gold and promises. They are men who sold their honor cheaply. Ghanim was betrayed, too. His brother stole his wife and accused him falsely of murder. That is how he became a slave. He means to seek revenge once you free him.\u201d</p><p>Well and so, there wasn\u2019t much to be learned here. Ghanim stared fixedly at me, his eyes glittering. I felt an odd sense of kinship with him. After all, in a strange way, I was seeking to avenge another wronged man.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d I promised. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to stay here forever.\u201d</p><p>The day passed slowly. Patience, patience. I willed myself to be calm. The ledge I walked was high and narrow. On one side was Bodeshmun\u2019s threat. I could still feel his strong fingers gripping my chin. And on the other side . . .</p><p>Sidonie.</p><p>I kept seeing her face in my thoughts, that dark, perplexed gaze. I wanted . . . gods, I wanted. I didn\u2019t even know what. I wanted to hear what her voice sounded like. I wanted to know if Bodeshmun was right, if she had no inkling of what had been done to her. I couldn\u2019t imagine it was true. Surely there must be bits of awareness in there. A haunting shadow, a sense that something was wrong.</p><p>Or perhaps not.</p><p>I took especial care with my appearance on the day of my audience with her. I brushed my hair until it gleamed, applied a pomade I\u2019d discovered among the villa\u2019s owners\u2019 toiletries, plaited it in careful braids. The weather was growing a bit cooler, and I rummaged through my trunks, selecting a sleeved tunic of deep crimson silk and a pair of loose striped breeches. I decided the latter was too gaudy and abandoned them for a dark, more somber pair. Then I reconsidered, and put the striped breeches back on.</p><p>\u201cLeander,\u201d I muttered to myself in the mirror. \u201cWhat ails you?\u201d</p><p>My mirrored face gazed back at me without comment.</p><p>I blew myself a kiss. \u201cCharming and harmless. For now, that\u2019s the course.\u201d</p><p>Sunjata paid a call on me before I departed. He regarded me with quiet hilarity, his nostrils flaring. \u201cDid you bathe in a vat of perfume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pomade I found,\u201d I said. \u201cMine ran out. Too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be putting it kindly,\u201d he observed. \u201cAnd I fear it\u2019s a woman\u2019s scent, not a man\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t enough time to wash it out. I sighed and scrubbed at my hair with a clean linen towel, trying to remove the worst of the scent. It helped, but it rendered my careful braids frazzled. I unplaited them, gave my hair another rub, and started over. \u201cAny news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe good news is that you seem to have played Bodeshmun well,\u201d Sunjata said. \u201cTo hear Hannon talk, he\u2019s satisfied that you\u2019re harmless and easily dealt with. Old Blackbeard\u2019s quite tickled at the notion that he\u2019s stymied Lord Solon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou may not have much time here,\u201d he said soberly. \u201cAstegal\u2019s on the verge of having New Carthage thoroughly secured. The rumor is that he\u2019s considering wintering there and sending for the princess.\u201d</p><p>I paused mid-braid. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA matter of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I continued braiding. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to work quickly and find a way to get myself invited to New Carthage. I need Astegal\u2019s ring anyway. Have you begun creating a replica?\u201d</p><p>Sunjata shook his head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better make haste.\u201d After our first tryst, I\u2019d asked him to create a replica of the ring he\u2019d stolen from Prince Imriel, and I was rather irked to find that he\u2019d not yet begun.</p><p>He was quiet a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of risk, Leander. Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman. Astegal\u2019s ring. And you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re looking for on the princess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grinned. \u201cBut that will be the fun task.\u201d</p><p>His voice rose. \u201cIt\u2019s not a jesting matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I finished my braids. \u201cBelieve me, Bodeshmun impressed that on me quite strongly yesterday. I have no desire to lose my eyes and tongue, and if I\u2019m jesting, it\u2019s because I\u2019m nervous inside. But, Sunjata, I have to try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause . . .\u201d I frowned. The reasons I\u2019d set out with seemed distant and a bit childish now. A grand adventure, a chance to spread my wings at last. The desire to humble the brooding prince and expose his hypocrisy. Even the desire to make her ladyship proud. Instead, I thought of the Aragonian boy in the slave-market, his stricken face. The princess in the palanquin, fed a diet of lies. Terre d\u2019Ange, land of my birth, teetering on the brink of civil war. \u201cI just do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be careful,\u201d Sunjata said.</p><p>\u201cSo her ladyship bade me,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His expression was unreadable. \u201cShe cares very deeply for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice thought.\u201d</p><p>With that, I collected the pretty inlaid box that contained the chess set, summoned Kratos and the lads, and went off to my audience with the princess, wishing I wasn\u2019t so damnably nervous and unsettled.</p><p>At the villa of the House of Sarkal I was met by a polite steward who escorted me into a sunlit salon that overlooked a garden. The scent of lemons wafted through the tall, arched windows, mingling rather unfortunately with the overly sweet floral odor of pomade still clinging to my hair.</p><p>\u201cPlease be comfortable,\u201d the steward said, indicating an alcove with a low table and chairs. \u201cI will inform her highness of your arrival.\u201d</p><p>I sat and waited. Once, I heard footsteps and rose to bow, but it was only a maidservant bringing a cup of sweet mint tea. I sipped it slowly, waiting. Wishing I didn\u2019t reek subtly of rotting roses. Wondering if the princess was playing some game, making me wait. Gods, I wished I\u2019d taken the time to wash the pomade out of my hair.</p><p>And then she came, one of her Amazigh guards trailing behind her.</p> <p>She wore a gown of pale yellow silk, a necklace and earrings set with canary-yellow diamonds. Her hair was coiled in a coronet, glinting in the sunlight. A golden girl, but for the shock of those black, black eyes.</p><p>I rose and bowed, my heart thudding.</p><p>\u201cMessire Maignard, I pray you forgive my rudeness,\u201d she said, speaking Hellene with a near-flawless accent. A light voice, cool and controlled. I had an immediate urge to know what it sounded like unstrung with passion. Instead, it took on a hint of amusement. \u201cI fear I was in the midst of a lesson, and my steward chose to wait rather than inform me that my mysterious D\u2019Angeline had arrived.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNot so mysterious, I fear.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose slightly. \u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>I accorded her another bow. \u201cAs my letter indicated, I am in the service of his eminence Ptolemy Solon, Governor of Cythera.\u201d I lifted the inlaid box and opened the lid. \u201cHe sends his congratulations to you and Prince Astegal on the occasion of your nuptials, and this small token of Cythera\u2019s goodwill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is lovely.\u201d She took a piece from the box, examining it. An onyx knight, his ruby eyes sparking. \u201cYou must convey my gratitude to his eminence. It is a thoughtful gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you play?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d The princess smiled. Her lips were pink, the sort of shape that begs to be kissed. The spark of lively intellect in her dark eyes suggested it wasn\u2019t something to be undertaken rashly. \u201cBut it\u2019s a rare man thinks to gift a woman with a game of wits. And you continue to be mysterious, Messire Maignard.\u201d She returned the knight to the box and gestured at the chairs. \u201cPray, sit and tell me. How does a D\u2019Angeline come to be in the service of Cythera\u2019s governor?\u201d</p><p>I set the inlaid box on the table. \u201cHis lordship is a rare man.\u201d I waited until she sat, then sat opposite her. Her Amazigh guard remained on the opposite side of the room, but he watched us with folded arms, his expression hidden behind the folds of his burnoose. Princess Sidonie ignored him. I cleared my throat. \u201cMy lord Solon is kin to Pharaoh of Menekhet. My father served as the master chef to the D\u2019Angeline ambassador in Iskandria.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cMarcel de Groulaut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The question threw me off stride. I blinked, trying to remember the timeline for the tale I\u2019d concocted and what I knew of Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s presence in Menekhet. \u201cBefore him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The princess thought a moment. \u201cThat was the Comte de Penfars, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I asked stupidly.</p><p>Sidonie de la Courcel raised her brows, higher, this time. \u201cMessire Maignard, since the day I gained my majority, it has been expected that I should be prepared to assume the throne of Terre d\u2019Ange at a moment\u2019s need. To that end, I am reasonably well informed about the workings of my own nation.\u201d</p><p>I flushed. \u201cOf course. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quirked. \u201cRare men are . . . rare. But pray, continue.\u201d</p><p>Gods, it galled me. I\u2019d expected . . . what? A victim, a hapless pawn, easily manipulated. She wasn\u2019t. Spell-bound and ignorant, yes. But still, disconcertingly self-possessed and acutely intelligent. I stammered through my tale of how Ptolemy Solon had come to dine at the Menekhetan ambassador\u2019s home and grown enamored of his chef\u2019s cuisine, wooing him away, thus establishing the Maignard clan on Cythera.</p><p>When I finished, I was sweating; and very much aware of the aroma of my ill-advised pomade hanging in the air.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve never known Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d the princess asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy to avoid speaking of Terre d\u2019Ange when she brought it up herself. \u201cNo, but Cythera is beautiful. Mayhap you\u2019ll visit one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that would be very pleasant,\u201d she said politely.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d Hot and uncomfortably aware that I was failing at being charming, I fanned myself, waves of scent wafting from me. Her expression turned slightly peculiar. \u201cAh, gods!\u201d I blurted. \u201cMy lady, forgive me. I fear I\u2019ve doused myself in a most cloying pomade. Believe me, I regret it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>It was an unexpectedly deep-throated laugh, rich and resonant. My heart rolled over in my chest, whispering the word \u201calways.\u201d Her black eyes came to life, sparkling at me. \u201cAnd why did you do that, Messire Maignard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was anxious,\u201d I murmured. \u201cBecause you are very, very beautiful, your highness. And by the presence of yon glowering guard, I suspect you have a jealous husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Astegal is quite reasonable,\u201d the princess said with amusement. \u201cThe guards are merely for the sake of appearances. As I recall, at one point during our courtship, he told me I was welcome to keep a harem of beautiful young men if I chose.\u201d</p><p>I eyed her, trying to tell if she was teasing me. \u201cAnd do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you volunteering?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWould you have me?\u201d I countered.</p><p>A wicked smile flickered over her face. \u201cNot smelling like that.\u201d</p><p>I flushed a second time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I apologize.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re ill at ease and I\u2019m baiting you unfairly. In truth, Messire Maignard, my husband is a rare man himself, and I\u2019ve felt no temptation to test the boundaries of his tolerance.\u201d</p><p>I felt a profound pang of sorrow. \u201cNot even a little, Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>Why I\u2019d called her by name, I couldn\u2019t say. It was wildly inappropriate . . . and yet, something shifted between us. She gazed at me, frowning like someone trying to remember a forgotten tune. I held her gaze, my heart hammering in my chest, suffused with a strange tenderness. Fear, hope, desire? The air between us felt charged, as though lightning were about to strike.</p><p>And then she closed her eyes and shuddered, and it passed.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods!\u201d I said in anguish. \u201cForgive me. That was appallingly overfamiliar. I\u2019m sorry, your highness, I don\u2019t know what came over me. Will you please forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d better.\u201d A wry edge crept into her tone. \u201cI deserved no less for baiting you. Are you always this graceless and blunt in practicing the art of flirtation, Messire Maignard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you always this acerbic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was only one syllable, but it was accompanied by that same wicked little smile: a quick, maddening flicker.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I fanned myself and glanced at her Amazigh guard. He stared impassively back at me. \u201cYou mentioned a lesson. May I ask what your highness is studying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPunic,\u201d she said. \u201cOne can get by with Hellene, of course, but I find it unwise not to at least attempt to learn the mother tongue of a land. In fact, that was one of the reasons my mother replaced the Comte de Penfars as the ambassador to Menekhet. She discovered he\u2019d not bothered to learn Menekhetan after the Comtesse de Montr\u00e8ve and her consort were there to . . .\u201d The princess blinked, her voice trailing off. A perplexed frown creased her brow.</p><p>Oh, hells.</p><p>\u201cOn their quest to free the Master of the Straits, was it not?\u201d I inquired. \u201cEven in Cythera, we heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Her brow cleared, though a touch of uncertainty lingered. \u201cI imagine you would have, given his eminence\u2019s ties to Ptolemy Dikaios.\u201d</p><p>I sighed inwardly. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Gods above, I felt like a rabbit in a field of snares. How exactly was one to avoid speaking of Terre d\u2019Ange to a woman raised from birth to inherit its throne? And all the topics that touched on Prince Imriel\u2019s life . . . all the very things I needed to reach her, the very things Bodeshmun had forbidden me to discuss.</p><p>Which left flirting as the only safe ground, except that I was stumbling over my own feet there, awkward and graceless.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d the princess asked. \u201cYou look pained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the pomade,\u201d I said. \u201cYour highness, his eminence has asked me to conduct other business in Carthage, and I will be here for some time yet. If I were to promise to scour myself quite thoroughly, is there any chance that I might beg another audience of you? Mayhap to play a game of chess?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDo you promise to be as unwittingly amusing?\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cBy the Goddess, I hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather enjoyed it.\u201d Her eyes sparkled. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasant change of pace from the usual bland courtesies.\u201d</p><p>I rose and bowed to her. \u201cVery well, my lady. If the lifeblood of my dignity serves to brighten your days, then by all means, puncture it. Bleed me dry of every peck of self-respect, and I shall languish at your feet, a glad fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She rose. \u201cEloquence surfaces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelatedly,\u201d I admitted. \u201cTruly, your highness, I\u2019m terribly sorry for the impropriety. And if you give me a chance to make amends, I will be most grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome tomorrow afternoon,\u201d the princess said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how you fare at chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smiled at her. \u201cVery much indeed.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at me, sincerely, this time. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. And Messire Maignard, you may stop apologizing. There was somewhat I quite liked about the way my name sounded when you spoke it, although I couldn\u2019t for the life of me say why.\u201d</p><p>Nor could I.</p><p>I bowed again. \u201cThen I wish you would do me the kindness of calling me Leander, and I aspire to the honor of using your name one day in earnest friendship.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cOn the morrow.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>I walked out of the House of Sarkal\u2019s villa feeling more profoundly disoriented than I had in my life.</p><p>Sidonie.</p><p>Why in the name of all the gods and goddesses in heaven had she had such a disturbing effect on me? I\u2019d played the most dangerous man in Carthage like a master, then tripped over my own tongue when sparring with a young woman who\u2019d had a large piece of her memory ripped from her.</p><p>All my expectations had been wrong. Weak. I\u2019d thought she\u2019d be weak-minded. Why? Because she\u2019d fallen prey to Carthage\u2019s magic, I supposed. I was an idiot. I\u2019d sought to flatter Bodeshmun, but the truth was, he had wrought a spell sufficient to impress even Ptolemy Solon. It had ensorceled an entire city. I\u2019d have been a victim had I been there. And Sidonie . . .</p><p>Well, she wasn\u2019t bound by the ghafrid-gebla. Not here. It was a simpler magic, awful and powerful in a different way. It was the very force of her love that had been turned against her. Two days ago, I\u2019d doubted. I hadn\u2019t been sure that love was genuine.</p><p>Now . . .</p><p>A girlish infatuation. Gods! No, no. If I\u2019d ever met a woman who knew her own mind, it was Sidonie de la Courcel.</p><p>Except for the parts she didn\u2019t.</p><p>It was in there, I thought. I could see it. That perplexity, a sense of something missing. Something withheld, something denied. Knowledge trapped within her. Like a butterfly battering its wings against a glass jar.</p><p>I wanted to smash that glass.</p><p>I wanted to free her. I wanted to kiss her until she couldn\u2019t breathe. I wanted to taste her, to bury myself in her. I wanted, desperately, to find out what lay behind that quick, wicked smile.</p><p>I wanted to kill Astegal.</p><p>A rare man . . . gods! Oh, yes, it took a rare man indeed to set a country against itself, to abduct a young woman and turn her against her will with dark magics. All to further his own ambitions. Dreams of empire. And he\u2019d been doing his best to get heirs on her. Soon he\u2019d send for her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gritted my teeth at the thought.</p><p>I was losing my damned mind.</p><p>\u201cHalt!\u201d I called to my bearers. They lowered the palanquin, and I climbed out. Kratos regarded me skeptically.</p> <p>\u201cAre you well, my lord?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell enough,\u201d I said shortly. \u201cI need to walk. I need to clear my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAs you will.\u201d</p><p>I stalked alongside the empty palanquin, reliving the encounter in my mind. All right. I\u2019d acted a perfect dolt. That was good and bad. Harmless, yes. The gods above knew I\u2019d reinforced that belief. I\u2019d amused and distracted her. Bodeshmun would be pleased. From what I\u2019d seen, he had cause to worry. A butterfly\u2019s wings, battering. A considerable and plaguing curiosity.</p><p>She thought me a dolt.</p> <p>I hated that fact.</p><p>But there had been that moment, that charged moment. When I\u2019d crossed the line of propriety, called her by name as though we were intimate. Asked her a question I\u2019d no right to ask. It had struck a chord within her. I\u2019d seen it. And she\u2019d never given an answer.</p><p>I whispered her name. \u201cSidonie.\u201d</p><p>My heart leapt at the sound of it.</p><p>I pressed my own fist against my chest, willing my pounding heart to subside. It felt strange and heavy to me. A stone lodged in my chest. It ached. It threatened to drag me down into deep waters. It threatened to burst and splinter. I breathed slowly and deeply, thinking on the lessons her ladyship Melisande had taught me.</p><p>Bit by bit, the feeling eased.</p> <p>\u201cName of Elua!\u201d I said aloud. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I like her.\u201d</p><p>The following morning, I\u2019d arranged to meet Sunjata at the baths. They were massive, laid out in the grand Tiberian style, although the architecture itself was Carthaginian. I found Sunjata in the palaestra, stretching his limbs. Ordinarily, I thought, it would likely be a crowded place, filled with young men wrestling and boxing with one another, practicing for foot-races, but it was quite empty today. I reckoned a good many of Carthage\u2019s athletes were serving in Astegal\u2019s army.</p><p>\u201cRun with me?\u201d Sunjata asked in greeting, nodding at the footpath circling the exercise arena.</p><p>\u201cA lap or two,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t keep up with you for long.\u201d</p><p>He merely shrugged. For as long as I\u2019d known him, Sunjata had had a fondness for running. It gave him a sense of freedom; and too, eunuchs had a propensity to gain weight as they grew older, their figures growing more womanish. Sunjata would never let that happen. He wasn\u2019t vain, but he was proud.</p><p>After I\u2019d limbered, we set out on the footpath together. Sunjata paced himself slowly so I could match him stride for stride.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said when we\u2019d reached the far end. \u201cHow was your audience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from the fact that I reeked of attar of roses?\u201d I asked, and he laughed. \u201cGods, I don\u2019t even know what to say. I found myself acting an idiot, and she spent most of the time laughing at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you gain a second audience?\u201d Sunjata asked.</p><p>\u201cI did that much,\u201d I said glumly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to summon considerable more charm if I want to be reckoned aught but a performing lap-dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLap-dogs don\u2019t give Bodeshmun cause for concern,\u201d he observed. \u201cWhich is to the good.\u201d We fell silent on reaching the central stretch of the arena, waiting until we were out of earshot of the few folks availing themselves of the palaestra. \u201cWhat did you think of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisconcerting,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s quick-witted and bored. I can see why Bodeshmun\u2019s worried.\u201d</p><p>Sunjata increased his stride. \u201cWhat did you think of her, Leander?\u201d</p><p>I pushed myself to match his pace, feeling my muscles warm and loosen. It came easier than I remembered. Our bare feet thudded softly on the path. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure of that, either. But whatever it is, I find myself thinking a good deal too much of it.\u201d</p><p>Another stretch of silence. I could hear Sunjata\u2019s breathing, steady and even. I matched him breath for breath.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re falling in love with her,\u201d he said when next we reached the turn at the far end of the footpath.</p><p>\u201cAt one meeting?\u201d I laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a glance,\u201d Sunjata said. \u201cAt a single, devastating glance that stripped clever Leander Maignard of all his smooth beguilements and left him standing in the street, staring after her palanquin like a man besotted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat only happens in poets\u2019 tales,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>He gave me a sidelong glance. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to reply, but Sunjata pulled away, his effortless stride increasing once more. Irritated, I pulled abreast of him. My lungs were working hard now. He pushed his pace and I struggled grimly to keep up with him, running too hard for conversation. Another lap, then another and another. My lungs felt like they were bursting and I had a stitch in my side. Even Sunjata was breathing hard. Still, I managed to keep up with him this time.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d he gasped at last, slowing to a panting halt. \u201cSee, I told you. We\u2019re all capable of things we can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>I braced my hands on my knees, trying to catch my breath. \u201cYou\u2019re out of practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so.\u201d Sunjata shook his head. \u201cThis is my one great escape. I suspect you\u2019ve been training at somewhat.\u201d</p><p>I eased myself upright. \u201cNot that I recall.\u201d</p><p>Sunjata gave me one of his opaque looks. \u201cLet\u2019s get you into the baths. I can still smell that damnable pomade.\u201d</p><p>We passed a pleasant time lingering in the baths. I kept my promise to Princess Sidonie and bathed thoroughly, washing my hair several times over. Afterward, we bought food from one of the many vendors there and dined while strolling the colonnade. I felt an unaccountable excitement rising as morning gave way to noon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to be on my way,\u201d I said to Sunjata outside the baths. \u201cShall I see you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you here on the morrow.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cI\u2019ve a commission to work on. A particular ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see,\u201d I said. \u201cGood. Tomorrow, then. But why don\u2019t you come to the villa? I had some business I wished to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I threw up my hands. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeander.\u201d Sunjata caught my arm as I turned to go. He lowered his voice. \u201cListen . . . whatever you\u2019re feeling for her, don\u2019t fight it. It might be exactly what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said. \u201cIt feels more like it\u2019s fighting me.\u201d</p><p>He let go my arm. \u201cThat may very well be true.\u201d</p><p>Before I could ask what in the world that was supposed to mean, Sunjata turned on his heel and set off at a brisk walk. I let him go. There was no reasoning with him when he was in an obstinate mood.</p><p>Besides, I had a date to keep.</p><p>Once more, I presented myself at the villa of the House of Sarkal. This time, I was bade wait a moment before I was escorted within. When I was, I found the princess already awaiting me, seated in the sunlight alcove and pondering the chess board. One of the Amazigh had taken up his customary position, his presence warning me to be discreet. Today the princess wore a silk gown the color of apricots. The decolletage wasn\u2019t low enough to be unseemly, but I could see the swell of her breasts. My mouth went dry.</p><p>\u201cLeander Maignard.\u201d Her gaze flashed up at me.</p><p>I nearly greeted her by name. I swallowed it and bowed. \u201cYour highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thoroughly scoured and ready to match wits?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBoth, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d She smiled and gestured at the table. The chess board was positioned so that I would be playing white. \u201cThe opening move is yours.\u201d</p><p>I sat opposite her and moved an ivory pawn. \u201cSo it begins.\u201d</p><p>The princess mirrored my move with an ebony pawn. A heavy signet ring glinted on her right hand. I marked it, remembering she\u2019d worn it yesterday, too. \u201cTell me, Leander Maignard, how do you spend your days when you\u2019re not entertaining bored royalty? What business is it that his eminence of Cythera wishes you to conduct?\u201d</p><p>I slid a second pawn onto the board in a deliberate gambit. \u201cLord Solon merely wishes me to obtain assurances of Carthage\u2019s goodwill.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a sharp glance. \u201cDoes he fear he has cause for concern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband is an ambitious man,\u201d I said ambivalently. \u201cHis eminence is merely being cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She declined my gambit, advancing a second pawn of her own in a countering move. \u201cBelieve me, Astegal has no ambition beyond securing the peaceable future of both our nations, and Carthage did not seek this quarrel with Aragonia. Once it is settled, he will look no farther.\u201d</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou doubt me,\u201d the princess observed.</p><p>I glanced past her at the Amazigh guard. Between swathes of blue cloth, his eyelids flickered. This one, I thought, spoke more than Punic. \u201cOf course not,\u201d I lied. \u201cIndeed, I have received similar assurances from one member of the Council already. I\u2019m simply seeking to concentrate on our game.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cA courtier\u2019s reply. Very well then, let us play.\u201d</p><p>We played for a time in silence.</p><p>I found myself thinking about Sunjata\u2019s advice. I watched the princess contemplate the board. The contrasts in her face elevated what might have been mere prettiness to beauty. Her features were fine-cut and delicate, but her eyebrows were drawn in a firm line. Not heavy, not by any means. Only strong enough to offset the delicacy, to create a suggestion of determination and vulnerability combined. A captivating contrast, like the one between her gilded fairness and those night-dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cMessire Maignard,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re staring at me.\u201d</p><p>Hot blood scalded my face. \u201cOh, gods! I\u2019m sorry. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d she asked in amusement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a chef\u2019s son,\u201d I said helplessly. \u201cI\u2019ve spent almost all my life on Cythera, and yes, I\u2019m staring at you like a provincial rube. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I forgive you.\u201d There it was again, that brief, wicked smile. Honey and gall. \u201cOnly because you blush so prettily. It\u2019s your move.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and said a silent prayer for forbearance, then bent my attention to the chessboard.</p><p>On the boat, when I\u2019d found the chess set listed in the manifest, I\u2019d entertained some idea of flattering her by losing a-purpose. Playfully demanding a rematch, mayhap. I\u2019d envisioned myself very much in control, smoothly cajoling while the hapless young princess giggled and blushed. Instead, I was blushing like a maiden, while the princess uttered barbed witticisms. And I very much suspected if I didn\u2019t best her in this game of wits, I\u2019d seal her impression of me forever as a tame lap-dog.</p><p>She played well, but she played a cautious and meticulous game. I\u2019d been doing the same, trying to draw out my time with her as long as possible. Now I went on the offensive and played boldly, giving the impression of being rash and distracted. Several moves later, I made a ploy that appeared careless. This time, the princess took my gambit and walked into a trap.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Realization dawned on her face before the endgame was played out. She studied the board for a moment, seeking an avenue of escape, then reached out and tipped over her king. \u201cYou\u2019ve won.\u201d</p><p>My brow was sweating. \u201cYou underestimated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did.\u201d She continued to study the board, retracing her steps and committing her misstep to memory. \u201cWill you give me the courtesy of a rematch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I began gathering pieces to reset the board.</p><p>\u201cIt grows late.\u201d She touched my hand. \u201cTomorrow, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>A spark leapt between us.</p><p>I felt it, and I knew, I knew she felt it. Her eyes widened, their darkness blurring. I wanted to close my hand on hers, pull her to me. Scatter the chess pieces, drag her to the floor. Pull the pins from her hair until it fell in glorious disarray, tear every scrap of fabric from her body. Rip the necklace from her throat, the earrings from her earlobes. Lay her bare, break the spell. Kiss her until I bruised her lips, take her there amid the scattered chess pieces.</p><p>Under the watching eyes of her Amazigh guard.</p><p>I drew my hand back as though her touch had burned me. \u201cTomorrow would be lovely.\u201d</p><p>The pulse beat visibly in the hollow of her throat, but there was no other sign she was unnerved. Her voice was cool and calm. \u201cThe same time, then?\u201d</p><p>I rose and bowed. \u201cI would be honored.\u201d</p><p>I made myself meet the gaze of the Amazigh as I left. Clear and transparent, I told myself, clear and transparent. I gave him a nod, a careless smile. He didn\u2019t return the smile, but he accorded me a brief nod. There was no suspicion I could see in his eyes or the narrow strip of his face visible. Whatever had passed between the Princess Sidonie and me, it had gone unnoticed.</p><p>One touch.</p><p>A single glance . . .</p><p>Blessed Elua was not a gentle god.</p><p>Thirty-Two</p><p>Well played, your highness.\u201d I tipped over my king, acknowledging defeat.</p><p>Princess Sidonie inclined her head graciously. \u201cMy thanks. It was a hard-earned victory. Who taught you to play so well?\u201d</p><p>It was the fourth game we\u2019d played over the course of as many days, and the first that she\u2019d won. Since that first time, under the watching eyes of her guard, we had been careful not to inadvertently touch; and she\u2019d been as careful as I had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had felt it, I was sure.</p><p>\u201cMy . . . mother,\u201d I said.</p><p>Her eyes danced. \u201cAre you sure? You sound uncertain.\u201d</p> <p>It had been her ladyship who\u2019d taught me, of course; or at least taught me to play well. Chess was a useful game to learn, although it had its limits. In a true game of intrigue, every piece on the board would be a live player, filled with weaknesses and flaws. Still, it had its merits.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great knack for the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your mother also serve in Cythera?\u201d the princess inquired.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Ptolemy Solon\u2019s mistress,\u201d I said, conflating one lie with another. Her brows rose. I smiled ruefully. \u201cIn truth, I suspect her wit and beauty held as much appeal for my lord Solon as my father\u2019s cuisine. They have always been discreet, but my father, may Elua bless and keep him, died two years ago. Since then, the liaison has been openly acknowledged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She nodded. \u201cWhich is why his eminence holds you in such high esteem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot the entire reason, I hope,\u201d I said.</p><p>Her smile was genuine. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>My heart gave one of those involuntary leaps. I almost wished she wouldn\u2019t smile at me like that. It actually hurt. I busied myself setting up the chess board for another game, watching her out of the corner of my eye. \u201cYour victory was swift, my lady. Do you wish to play again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The princess rested her chin on one hand. Sunlight glinted on her signet ring. \u201cI\u2019m growing weary of chess, Leander Maignard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Leander,\u201d I said.</p><p>She gave me an amused look. \u201cI\u2019m considering it.\u201d</p> <p>One audience a day, four games of chess. Five days, five gowns. Today she wore a pale lavender, which I didn\u2019t think was her best hue. A choker of pearls and amethyst, earrings to match. Over the course of five days, there had been only one constant. I knew; I\u2019d been keeping track. If she was growing bored with chess, it was time for me to make a move of a different sort. I took a deep breath and did it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting ring, my lady,\u201d I said. \u201cIs that the seal of the House of Sarkal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d She twisted it on her finger. \u201cYes. Rather crude work, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I see it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Her expression turned quizzical. \u201cIf you like.\u201d</p><p>It slid easily from her finger. I held out my hand. Our fingers didn\u2019t quite touch as she dropped it into my palm. I examined the stone, a ruby cabochon engraved with the Sarkal hawk insignia. I peered under my lashes at her. Her expression was unchanged, still puzzled. \u201cA family heirloom, I imagine. It\u2019s very old. Do you wear it in honor of your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Astegal\u2019s request, yes.\u201d Her mouth quirked. \u201cOnly in public, to tell the truth. I appreciate its value and history, but it\u2019s a bit heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d A stab of disappointment went through me. I handed the ring back to her. \u201cYour secret is safe with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, he knows.\u201d The princess laughed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind as long as I wear it publicly.\u201d</p><p>It definitely wasn\u2019t the ring, then. The bastard just liked the world to see he\u2019d set his seal on her. The thought filled me with fury and disgust, so much so I lowered my face to hide it, not trusting myself. \u201cI heard he might be sending for you soon,\u201d I murmured. \u201cTo winter in New Carthage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mayhap within the next fortnight.\u201d She slid the ring back on her finger. \u201cName of Elua, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou miss him.\u201d I said it without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cVery much so.\u201d Her voice softened briefly, then resumed its light tone. \u201cAnd I\u2019m perishing of tedium. I\u2019m grateful to you for alleviating it.\u201d</p><p>I did look at her then, looked her hard in the eyes. For the first time, it was the princess who flushed slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve a fancy to see New Carthage.\u201d I forced my tone to match her lightness. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll invite me as your faithful courtier.\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we venture out, Messire Maignard? As you note, \u2019tis early yet. I feel I\u2019ve scarce had a chance to see old Carthage before trading it for the new.\u201d</p><p>I offered a seated bow. \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d</p><p>Within a short time, we were seated in her ornate double palanquin, venturing into the streets of Carthage on the shoulders of her bearers. It was the closest I\u2019d been to her. There was a gap of a mere six inches between us, and I could swear it felt charged with heat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wish to see?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cMayhap we could make an offering at the Temple of Tanit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always wise to honor the gods of a place, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be sure,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Her bearers were smooth and swift, far more skilled than my lads. The four Amazigh guards flanked the palanquin, silent and menacing in their dark robes and veils. Folk on the street called out good wishes for the princess\u2019 health and bowed toward the palanquin, but no one dared approach. Sidonie de la Courcel acknowledged them with the gracious politeness of someone who\u2019d spent a lifetime receiving similar tribute.</p><p>The goddess Tanit was akin to Asherat-of-the-Sea, an ancient goddess who had taken many forms and many names. Her ladyship had spent many, many years claiming sanctuary in the Temple of Asherat in La Serenissima. I thought about that when we arrived at our destination, awed once more by her capacity for patience.</p><p>The priests scurried and bowed, eyeing the Amazigh warily, offering the princess solicitous advice. One priest was sent running, his sandals slapping against the marble floor. He returned carrying a white rooster by its legs. It was alive, its wings flapping awkwardly. I saw the princess\u2019 mask of politeness slip as she recoiled.</p><p>\u201cName of Elua, man!\u201d I said to the priest. \u201cThey don\u2019t offer blood sacrifice in Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d I fished in my purse for a gold coin. \u201cSurely the goddess finds the scent of incense pleasing?\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Leander.\u201d The princess was slightly pale. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten they made live offerings in Carthage. That was careless of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that happens often,\u201d I said. \u201cYou hardly seem the careless type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My words seemed to strike some chord within her, her puzzled look returning. \u201cNot often.\u201d</p><p>We made our offerings of incense, gazing at the face of the massive effigy. The goddess Tanit\u2019s features were calm and unreadable, her eyes fixed on the unknowable distance. She didn\u2019t look like a goddess who craved blood and suffering. Divine Tanit, I prayed silently, if you have compassion and mercy in you, do not suffer your children to do ill in your name. Help me to undo what has been done.</p><p>What prayer the princess offered, I couldn\u2019t say. I only knew her face looked very solemn.</p><p>And she had called me by name.</p><p>I longed to hear her say it again.</p><p>Afterward, she seemed oddly melancholy. I directed the bearers to take us to the flower market, where I purchased another absurdly large bunch of roses and laid them at her feet on the floor of the palanquin.</p><p>It made her laugh. \u201cNow you\u2019re just being foolish.\u201d</p><p>I bowed elaborately. \u201cIf you will not accept it as a tribute to your beauty, accept it as a tribute to your victory today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re magnanimous in defeat. Nonetheless, I cannot accept this gift.\u201d Princess Sidonie picked up one of the roses. There were children loitering at a distance, wide-eyed and curious. She tossed the rose to a pretty little girl who caught it with a shriek of delight. The others began to beg. Smiling, the princess tossed the rest of the roses, one by one until they were gone.</p><p>It was a nice piece of subtle diplomacy. It was also so damned charming, I caught a couple of the Amazigh guards with eyes crinkled in the suggestion of hidden smiles. \u201cWell played, my lady,\u201d I said to her.</p><p>She gave me a sidelong glance. \u201cTell me, Leander Maignard, what game is it you think we\u2019re playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that I hope will while away the hours and alleviate your tedium.\u201d I placed my hand on my chest. \u201cHave no fear, I know how it ends. With you in the arms of your husband and me broken-hearted.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d spoken in a light, jesting tone\u2014or at least I\u2019d meant to. But she heard somewhat more in it. Whether I succeeded or failed, there was a bitter truth to my words, somewhat I\u2019d not yet begun to consider. She studied me for a moment, then looked away. \u201cIt grows late. I should return home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d I said.</p><p>We sat in silence in the palanquin. Gods, I wanted to touch her so badly. Cut through the banter, cut through the spell that bound her. And I couldn\u2019t. Not here, not in public, not with guards watching. I needed to get her alone somehow, and I couldn\u2019t think how to do it.</p><p>I was pondering the problem when the palanquin jolted to an abrupt halt. The two Amazigh preceding us were giving orders in Punic to the bearers, pointing and gesturing. I sensed the princess stiffen beside me.</p><p>\u201cIs there trouble?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her expression was unreadable. \u201cI need to . . . no.\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to be perplexed. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, the Amazigh and the bearers sorted it out. We changed course and took a different route back to the House of Sarkal\u2019s villa. The princess was quiet and withdrawn, and I was fearful I\u2019d made a misstep.</p><p>\u201cMay I call on you tomorrow?\u201d I asked before I took my leave. \u201cOr have I begun to contribute to your tedium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She gave me a quick, absentminded smile, and I realized that whatever disturbed her, it had naught to do with me. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed your company, Leander. I\u2019ll send word.\u201d</p><p>I bowed. \u201cI will await it.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Three</p><p>When I returned from taking exercise with Sunjata on the morrow, there was word awaiting me\u2014but it was from Bodeshmun, not the princess. He wished for me to call on him immediately at the College of Horology.</p><p>Of course, I complied.</p><p>I found him distracted and pacing. As before, he was an abrupt and ungracious host, not offering so much as a cup of water. I bowed deeply, keeping my tone light and unconcerned. Harmless. Oddly, it was a great deal easier to do with Bodeshmun than it was with Princess Sidonie.</p><p>\u201cYou wished to see me, my lord?\u201d</p><p>He fetched up before me, glowering. \u201cYou took her into the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did,\u201d I said. \u201cWas that wrong?\u201d</p><p>Bodeshmun\u2019s deep-set eyes flashed. \u201cI would prefer that you did not, not without consulting me. It is imperative that her contacts be . . . managed.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cShe made an offering to Tanit and threw some flowers to children in the marketplace. There was no harm in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere might have been,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, she\u2019s bored.\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cI accompanied her into the city at her own request. If you wish to keep her distracted and under the impression that she\u2019s not a prisoner for the next fortnight, I suggest you provide her with a few more of these managed contacts, because I fear my charming banter and impressive chess skills are wearing thin.\u201d</p><p>My suggestion earned me one of his quelling looks. \u201cI didn\u2019t become Chief Horologist to play master of revels for a bored young princess!\u201d</p><p>I stifled a smile. \u201cNonetheless.\u201d</p><p>Bodeshmun sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll think on it. Until then, you will agree to no further excursions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish me to refuse her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>His broad mouth twisted sardonically. \u201cI\u2019m confident you\u2019ll think of some cause. I understand you\u2019ve done quite well at playing the blushing admirer while dancing clear of any . . . awkward . . . topics. Whoever taught you to dissemble is to be commended.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head. \u201cMy thanks, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d He waved one hand. \u201cAnd remember that if that glib tongue of yours should slip, I\u2019ll have it cut out. Keep my warning in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always do,\u201d I said with perfect sincerity.</p><p>The encounter with Bodeshmun didn\u2019t trouble me overmuch. At least he was a known danger, and the meeting confirmed he still thought me harmless, a useful fool. But Sidonie . . . Sidonie was another matter. Gods, what was it she\u2019d overheard the Amazigh say yesterday that had disturbed her? I wished I\u2019d had time to learn Punic. If I\u2019d had any idea I\u2019d be in this position one day, I would have learned it years ago.</p><p>And what if she didn\u2019t send for me again?</p><p>The thought of not seeing her made my heart ache. And the thought of failing\u2014of leaving her a spell-bound pawn in Carthage\u2019s hands, happily spreading her legs in Astegal\u2019s bed\u2014filled me with sick fury.</p><p>When a letter inviting me to dine with her that evening came later in the day, I nearly laughed aloud with relief. It was ludicrous. Never in my life had I felt such absurd, soaring joy.</p><p>I\u2019d heard it described, though.</p><p>That was the awful irony of it. The day I\u2019d accompanied Prince Imriel to the Temple of Aphrodite on Cythera, I\u2019d asked him what it was like to be in love. And impossible as it seemed . . . yes. That was how I felt. As though my heart could burst, flaying my chest. As though I could leap off a cliff and take wing.</p><p>And then it changes, he had said. It becomes a part of you.</p><p>He had been speaking of Sidonie.</p><p>She loved him. Not me\u2014him. What I\u2019d said to her yesterday was true. Whatever I felt for her, it didn\u2019t matter. Whether I succeeded or failed, this would end with Sidonie de la Courcel in another man\u2019s arms, and me broken-hearted. The only difference was whether or not her happiness would be a faltering lie or joyous truth. And astonishingly enough, that had begun to matter to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gazed at myself in the mirror before I departed for her villa. What I\u2019d told Sunjata was true; there was a resemblance between the prince and me, at least a bit. I remembered his face well, as it was so much the mirror of her ladyship\u2019s. Mine was thinner, more aquiline. My eyes were blue, but I hadn\u2019t inherited that deep, dazzling hue that marked so many of House Shahrizai.</p><p>I looked older than I remembered.</p><p>Older, and more . . . intense. I wondered if it strengthened the resemblance between us. And I wondered, if it did, could she ever come to love me in his stead?</p> <p>I reached out and touched the mirror, bracing my fingertips against its cool surface. Gazed at my mirror-fingertips touching my own. \u201cBlessed Elua,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve been away so long, I scarce remember how to pray to you.\u201d</p><p>Somewhat in my heart stirred. Memories of home. Of fields of lavender and bees buzzing under the golden sun. Drowsing on my belly before our household shrine, the scent of sweet-peas in the air. Elua\u2019s enigmatic smile offered in loving benison.</p><p>Be worthy of her.</p><p>The words floated through my mind, and whether they came from the depths of my unconscious thoughts, or Blessed Elua himself, I couldn\u2019t say. I only knew that my eyes stung. \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhatever else happens, I will try.\u201d</p><p>I presented myself at the villa as dusk was settling over the city. It was the first time the princess had invited me to dine with her. The steward escorted me to an inner courtyard. It was hung about with oil lamps providing a soft illumination, set with multiple braziers to chase off the evening chill. Sidonie was there, clad in the pale yellow gown in which I\u2019d first seen her. She turned her head as I entered, and our eyes met.</p> <p>I bowed to her. \u201cYour beauty outshines the sun, Princess.\u201d</p><p>The words hung between us, echoing strangely. Her eyes brightened as though with tears, and mine stung again. Worthy. I would try to be worthy. I watched her gather herself.</p><p>\u201cIf you flirt overmuch, I shall have to send you away, Messire Maignard,\u201d she said in a cool tone.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw one of the Amazigh positioned against a vine-decked courtyard wall, his robed and veiled figure almost invisible in the dim light. \u201cI will try to restrain myself, your highness.\u201d</p><p>She smiled slightly. \u201cThen you may join me.\u201d</p><p>We sat opposite one another at the dining table. Servants came and went, bringing wine and an array of dishes. Sidonie\u2019s manner was guarded and careful in a way I couldn\u2019t quite fathom. It was subtle and inexplicable, somewhat only a Guildsman might notice. I made innocuous conversation, speaking of Cythera\u2019s fine wines, praising the dishes, inventing delicacies allegedly devised by my late father the chef and describing them in detail. She listened and made all the appropriate comments.</p> <p>It looked and sounded like a perfectly normal, pleasant conversation. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWill you have a cordial?\u201d Sidonie asked when the meal was finished and the last plate had been cleared. \u201cThere is perry brandy, imported from Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be delighted,\u201d I said.</p><p>A servant approached and poured. \u201cAstegal is thoughtful.\u201d She swirled her cup, and a sweet, spicy aroma arose. \u201cHe saw to it that I enjoyed a few comforts of home. To be honest, I think he has a taste for it himself. I remembered today that there was a keg in the cellar.\u201d She sipped her perry brandy. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>I tried it. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was distilled on the estate of Lombelon,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cA very small holding owned by a minor lord. Maslin de Lombelon. He served as the second in command of my personal guard for a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice,\u201d I repeated, trying to steer the conversation away from Terre d\u2019Ange. \u201cOn Cythera, there is a cordial made from the skins of grapes\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her gaze held mine, intense and compelling. \u201cDo you know, Leander, I have been remiss over these past few days. I addressed you in Hellene as an emissary of Cythera. I never thought to inquire . . .\u201d She switched to the D\u2019Angeline tongue. \u201cDo you speak D\u2019Angeline?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d I replied in kind, startled. \u201cIt was what we spoke at home.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was light and careless, speaking D\u2019Angeline. \u201cWhy do you discourage me from speaking of Terre d\u2019Ange? And why is it, do you suppose, that my guards insisted on routing us around the slave-market yesterday? What did they fear I might see?\u201d</p><p>There was a movement in the shadows. I glanced past Sidonie to see the Amazigh on guard lift one hand, his finger wagging in warning. I was not to speak words he did not comprehend.</p><p>\u201cI cannot answer you safely.\u201d I made myself stumble over the words in D\u2019Angeline, then laughed and shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your highness,\u201d I said, returning to Hellene. \u201cI know it\u2019s my mother-tongue, but I\u2019ve scarce spoken it since I was a babe. Do you mind overmuch if we continue to converse in Hellene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Her gaze was perfectly steady. \u201cI was merely trying to be polite.\u201d</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>So that was what this was about, that was what she had heard. The guards had been careless, forgetting she was studying Punic. That was why Bodeshmun was worried about our excursion. Yes, I thought; Sidonie de la Courcel would be disturbed at the sight of Aragonian children for sale in Carthage\u2019s flesh markets. And well she should be. Terre d\u2019Ange did not countenance slavery, that was true. And she was in love with a man who\u2019d been abducted as a child by Carthaginian slavers. Likely it would strike a chord within her.</p><p>Like the boy I\u2019d seen.</p><p>Is he biddable?</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold, Leander?\u201d Sidonie asked. \u201cForgive me, I forget you come from a warmer clime than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said hoarsely. \u201cNot cold.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell her. I wanted to confess everything. Smash the glass. I didn\u2019t dare, not in front of the Amazigh. I had to continue balancing on my high ledge. But everything had shifted. She knew. She knew I wasn\u2019t what I seemed. Damned guards! I stared helplessly at her, willing her to understand. Fearful that she understood too much.</p><p>\u201cI do not mean to bedevil you. Perhaps I should seek answers elsewhere,\u201d she mused aloud. \u201cMy lord Bodeshmun is a clever fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a busy one. I myself would not trouble him.\u201d</p><p>Her quick gaze flicked to mine. \u201cYou advise against it?\u201d</p><p>I was sweating. I felt my control lapse. I looked involuntarily in the direction of the Amazigh. Thanks to all the gods that were, he wasn\u2019t a Guildsman. And neither was Sidonie, but she had been trained very, very well in the art of statesmanship. It might as well have been the same. She saw where my glance went.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said.</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cThen I\u2019ll not trouble him.\u201d She paused, her gaze searching my face. \u201cMy lord Astegal will send for me soon. No doubt all will be clear when he does.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth. \u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>So near, yet so far! Gods, it was infuriating. And exhausting, too. By the time I took my leave of her that night, I felt as though I\u2019d run a distance-race. The only solace I could take from the encounter was that she was cautious. Very cautious. And right now, that was a damned good thing. Because once she started voicing her suspicions aloud to Bodeshmun or Astegal or anyone in their service, she was in danger of changing from unwitting pawn to hostage.</p><p>And I would be lucky to keep my eyes and tongue.</p><p>I slept very poorly that night.</p><p>Thirty-Four</p><p>It\u2019s finished.\u201d Sunjata handed me a suede pouch. \u201cTake it. I don\u2019t want it anywhere near me.\u201d</p><p>I opened the pouch and withdrew a ring. Plain gold, shaped like an intricate knot. \u201cIs it a good copy? Good enough to fool Astegal?\u201d</p><p>Sunjata gave me a disdainful look. \u201cWhat do you think? Of course.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away slightly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be pleased to know that I\u2019ve nearly convinced Jabnit to send me to New Carthage to establish trade for the House of Philosir. The old glutton\u2019s rubbing his hands together with glee at the thought of the profit to be made on the back of a looting army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d I was touched. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt was Hannon\u2019s idea. He wants Guild eyes and ears on the ground there.\u201d Sunjata smiled sourly. \u201cHannon\u2019s a tool of the Council of Thirty, and there\u2019s a slow-dawning concern among them that they might not be able to control Astegal once he seizes Aragonia. Not with Bodeshmun at his side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiots,\u201d I said absently. \u201cWhat did they think? So Bodeshmun\u2019s to go to New Carthage, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ll have them all in the same place, for what it\u2019s worth. Any progress?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d I sighed. \u201cDangerous progress.\u201d I told him what had transpired with Sidonie.</p><p>Sunjata whistled. \u201cYou\u2019re walking a very, very fine line, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know.\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cI need to talk to her alone. But those damned Amazigh are always there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could disguise yourself as an Amazigh,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>I blinked. \u201cYou know, that might come in handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was jesting,\u201d Sunjata observed.</p><p>\u201cEven so.\u201d I pointed at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a potential tool. Never set aside any potential tool that comes to hand, right?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI should have kept my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the comment. \u201cWhat about Bodeshmun? I know he keeps the talisman on him, and I suspect I know where. Does he have any other weaknesses I might exploit? Wine? Women? Boys? Opium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, and no,\u201d Sunjata said. \u201cHe\u2019s vain, but he\u2019s suspicious and rigid. And he\u2019s not likely to be fooled by a disguise. Leander . . .\u201d He fell silent a moment. \u201cLeander, Bodeshmun\u2019s dangerous. More than the entire College of Horologists put together, and more than Astegal. Hannon\u2019s afraid of him, the Council\u2019s afraid of him, I\u2019m afraid of him. When you move against Bodeshmun, I think you\u2019d best be prepared to kill him. And to fly like hell once you do.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d give up sooner,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cYour confidence is touching,\u201d I commented. \u201cOr is it your loyalty I should question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sunjata\u2019s voice was low and fierce. \u201cHer ladyship gave me my freedom. I would never betray her, no matter how much I doubt the merits of this endeavor.\u201d He looked away. \u201cLet us say that I didn\u2019t expect you to fall in love at a single glance and become filled with noble purpose and determination.\u201d His lips quirked. \u201cAlthough mayhap I should have known better.\u201d He looked back at me. \u201cAh. No denial this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cWhat I\u2019m feeling . . . I\u2019m not ready to call it love. By the Goddess, I barely know her! But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there it is.\u201d He wrapped his arms around his knees. \u201cAre you seeing her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d I laughed. \u201cMy good lord Bodeshmun\u2019s arranged for a hunting party outside the city. I\u2019m invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sunjata\u2019s voice rose in disbelief. \u201cA hunting party?\u201d</p><p>I grinned at him. \u201cI convinced him he\u2019d best find a way to distract her, or she\u2019d begin asking inconvenient questions. And the gods know that\u2019s true enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like truth to leaven a good lie.\u201d Sunjata unwound his arms and rose. \u201cGood luck, then. I\u2019ll see you anon.\u201d</p><p>Jest or no, I thought Sunjata\u2019s idea had merit. I summoned Ghanim and spun him a tale about wishing to obtain Amazigh garb, explaining that her ladyship kept some traditions of Terre d\u2019Ange and celebrated the Longest Night with a masked f\u00eate. Ghanim listened without comment while one of the Carthaginians translated, his fierce gaze fixed on my face. Although I kept my features schooled to perfect sincerity, I had the strong feeling he didn\u2019t believe a word of it.</p><p>But to my surprise, Ghanim agreed readily. \u201cThere are Amazigh come to the city to trade,\u201d the Carthaginian brother translated. \u201cIf you give him money, he will obtain Amazigh garments for you.\u201d</p><p>I gave Ghanim the amount he deemed necessary for barter, realizing full well as I did that there was little to keep him from wrapping the veils around his own face to disguise his slave-brand, and escaping.</p><p>He pocketed the money and bowed, both hands pressed together.</p><p>\u201cI trust your honor,\u201d I said to him.</p><p>Ghanim replied without waiting to hear my words in Punic. \u201cDo not insult me,\u201d the Carthaginian translated.</p><p>I returned the Amazigh\u2019s salute. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>He was gone the better part of the day. Fortunately, I had no need of my bearers, as I was entertaining one of Lord Solon\u2019s acquaintances within the city that afternoon: Boodes of Hiram, a doddering fellow who was the oldest member of the Council of Thirty. His wits wandered with age, although there were flashes of clarity that suggested why Solon had once counted the man a friend.</p><p>\u201cPtolemy Solon,\u201d Boodes mused. \u201cBy the Goddess, he was an ugly lad! Is he still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lad, I fear.\u201d I smiled. \u201cBut ugly, yes. Still, he\u2019s a mistress any man would envy.\u201d</p><p>The old fellow nodded; then his head slumped, face crumpling into his white beard. I was just beginning to worry when his head snapped upright. \u201cYes, of course. Your mother, is she not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I corrected him. \u201cI\u2019m merely in her ladyship\u2019s household.\u201d</p><p>Boodes peered at me with rheumy eyes. \u201cAre you sure? Betimes my memory fails me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d I said. \u201cVery sure, alas. Tell me, how fares the war in Aragonia?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAragonia.\u201d His wrinkled lips worked. \u201cDamn fine oranges they grow there. I used to gorge on them when I was a boy. You like oranges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, my lord,\u201d I said politely.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Boodes nodded again. \u201cModeration, that\u2019s the thing. Overreach, and you\u2019ll end up with a sick belly. The old Hellenes understood it. Solon does. Astegal doesn\u2019t, nor does Bodeshmun.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cDo you speak of the war, my lord?\u201d</p><p>He blinked his rheumy eyes at me. \u201cI speak of oranges, young man.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Boodes of Hiram departed, escorted by bearers who clearly bore a good deal of fondness for him, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if he\u2019d been trying to send me a subtle message of the sort Sunjata had mentioned, or if he was merely wandering in his wits. I\u2019d rather liked the old fellow, and chose to believe it was the former. I found it heartening to think that there were those in Carthage concerned about the scope of Astegal\u2019s ambitions.</p><p>It was a good thing, since it put me in a tolerable frame of mind to deal with Ghanim\u2019s return. The Amazigh presented himself at the door of my chambers, his arms filled with dark indigo cloth. He bowed and said somewhat in Punic\u2014or mayhap it was his native tongue\u2014and indicated with pride a bloodstained rip in the fabric.</p><p>\u201cName of Elua!\u201d I said, startled. \u201cDid you kill someone for this?\u201d I mimed a stabbing gesture.</p><p>Ghanim grinned. Thrusting out his left arm, he showed me a dagger strapped to his forearm. \u201cAmazigh,\u201d he said with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said slowly. I thought about calling for one of the Carthaginians to translate, but at need, one can accomplish a good deal without language. I studied Ghanim\u2019s face. Whatever he\u2019d done, he reckoned it wholly acceptable with Amazigh culture. I hoped it was, because I wasn\u2019t about to inform Carthaginian authorities that I\u2019d commissioned a slave to purchase Amazigh garments for me and discovered he\u2019d killed to obtain them. \u201cWill you show me how to wear it?\u201d I asked, miming.</p><p>He nodded. I ushered him into my chambers, and spent a good hour struggling to master the intricate twists and folds of wrapping the head-scarf so that it formed a turban and veiled my lower face.</p> <p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d I said at last, studying myself in the mirror. If I darkened the skin of my face and hands with charcoal and kept my eyes narrowed, I could pass in very dim light. All that fabric provided good concealment.</p><p>Ghanim pointed to my waist and mimed drawing a sword. I rummaged in my trunks and fetched out my sword-belt, fastening it about my waist. The sword wasn\u2019t the right sort\u2014a slender gentleman\u2019s blade, not the heavier weapons the Amazigh carried\u2014but again, it would suffice to pass a cursory glance. Ghanim slapped my shoulder in approval and asked somewhat in a questioning tone.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea, my friend. Not yet. But it seems a useful item to have.\u201d I accorded him a bow, pressing my palms together. \u201cMy thanks.\u201d</p><p>He bowed in return.</p><p>Once Ghanim had left, I practiced wrapping the head-scarf a few dozen more times, until I felt I could do it in my sleep. And then I took off the robe and burnoose, did my best to scour the stiff, dried blood from the robe with water from the washstand, and buried both items deep within my trunks.</p><p>In a single day, I\u2019d acquired a ring and a disguise.</p><p>Tools. Dangerous, but useful.</p><p>I slept better that night and arose with a renewed sense of purpose. Truth be told, I could use the distraction of a hunting party as much as Sidonie. There was a certain measure of safety in Bodeshmun\u2019s managed contact. In the company of others, I could count on them to shunt aside any dangerous turns of conversation, and merely play at being the amicable courtier. She knew it was less than the whole truth, of course, but she would have no grounds to question it this day, and I would spend a few precious hours not feeling as though I walked a knife\u2019s edge of intrigue.</p> <p>And I would be in her company.</p><p>The hunting party assembled outside the western gates of Carthage. Passing beneath the massive arch, I felt the same reluctant sense of awe I\u2019d felt on first beholding the city. The walls were just so damned vast.</p><p>South of Carthage, it was desert; but here near the coast, it was fertile territory, rife with citrus and olive groves. We would be coursing hares today, riding astride and hunting with a breed of dog particular to Carthage, lean and speedy.</p><p>\u201cLeander Maignard!\u201d Gemelquart of Zinnrid hailed me, seated astride a dish-nosed grey mare. His wife, whom I had met at his dinner party, was on one side of him. Princess Sidonie was on the other. \u201cI\u2019m pleased you could join us.\u201d</p><p>I bowed to them. \u201cI am honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will remember my lady Arishat, I trust.\u201d Gemelquart chuckled. \u201cAnd I am given to understand you have spent some hours entertaining her highness.\u201d</p><p>I gazed up at Sidonie\u2019s face. \u201cI have had that honor, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuntsman!\u201d Gemelquart shouted. \u201cFetch this man a mount and a bow!\u201d</p><p>There was a period of milling chaos while all was made ready. I was provided with a stalwart little chestnut mare and a short hunting bow. It seemed there was to be a picnic luncheon. A battalion of servants was dispatched to make ready for it. Along with Gemelquart and his lady wife, there were some half a dozen Carthaginian nobles taking part in the excursion. Most of them, I did not know. Bodeshmun was there, looking distinctly unlike himself in ornate hunting leathers, glowering into his beard.</p><p>At last, the horns blew and we rode forth at a jog. The dogs strained at their leashes. I positioned myself beside Sidonie.</p><p>\u201cMessire Maignard,\u201d she acknowledged me in greeting.</p><p>I winced. \u201cHave we returned to such formality, your highness?\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cDo you not think it wise?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. I made a show of testing the draw of my hunting bow. \u201cI aspire to wisdom, my lady. I do not believe I possess it, not yet. But my lord Ptolemy Solon holds that happiness is the highest form of wisdom.\u201d I made a broad gesture. \u201cToday the sun is shining and we are engaged in a pleasant pursuit in the company of friends. If that is wisdom, let us be content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are content with little.\u201d Her tone was unreadable. She didn\u2019t believe it. I knew; I could feel it on my skin. She doubted me. I had revealed too much when I\u2019d stumbled over speaking D\u2019Angeline the other night, when I\u2019d glanced at the guard, when I\u2019d warned her against questioning Bodeshmun.</p><p>I bowed in the saddle. \u201cToday, yes.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie studied me. \u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p>So we hunted.</p><p>We rode only a short distance from the vast walls of Carthage. The huntsmen sounded their horns and loosed the hounds. We rode after them, whooping in the chase. I felt invigorated. The hounds were graceful, lean-bellied creatures with plumed tails. In an olive grove, they flushed a brace of hare. I shot and missed as the hares dodged and doubled, the hounds yelping. One of the Carthaginian lords I didn\u2019t know set out in hot pursuit, followed by others.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a terribly good shot, are you, Leander?\u201d Beneath the shade of an olive tree, Sidonie drew rein alongside me, accompanied by Gemelquart and his wife.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled because she\u2019d used my name. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Gemelquart said. \u201cBut I\u2019m under orders not to overexert myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and you use your weak lungs as an excuse for laziness,\u201d his wife, Arishat, said, but she was smiling as she said it.</p><p>\u201cAlais would enjoy this,\u201d Sidonie mused. \u201cShe likes the hunt, and she loves dogs. She had one for many years\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Alais!\u201d Gemelquart interrupted her. \u201cYour highness, I would be delighted to make your sister a gift of one of these dogs. They are royal Phoenician hunting dogs, a very ancient strain. As you can see, they are possessed of tremendous speed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a wolfhound,\u201d Sidonie said, frowning. \u201cShe was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a sad thing to lose a beloved pet!\u201d Arishat exclaimed. She was a Carthaginian lady some years younger than her husband, with pleasant features and a lovely speaking voice. \u201cWhy, I had a cat, a pretty little Menekhetan cat, that I\u2019d raised from a kitten. She used to follow me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled by a bear?\u201d Lost in thought, Sidonie blinked. \u201cOr was it a boar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me summon the huntsman,\u201d Gemelquart said smoothly. He raised one arm and gave a shout, beckoning. \u201cDoubtless he\u2019ll be able to advise us on the dogs\u2019 qualities and recommend one suitable for a young lady\u2019s companion.\u201d</p><p>In the distance, the huntsman turned, heeding Gemelquart\u2019s summons. Bodeshmun heard it, too, and reined his mount in our direction.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I remember?\u201d Sidonie reached out and grabbed my wrist without thinking. There was a panicked strength in her grip and slow terror rising behind her black eyes. \u201cWas it a boar or a bear? Leander, why can\u2019t I remember how Alais\u2019 dog was killed?\u201d</p><p>Ah, gods, what in the seven hells did Prince Imriel have to do with the death of her sister\u2019s dog? I couldn\u2019t even begin to guess. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Bodeshmun looming nearer. Gemelquart gave me a helpless grimace.</p><p>\u201cSunstroke.\u201d I freed my wrist, leaned over in the saddle to place my hand on Sidonie\u2019s brow. \u201cForgive us, my lady, we were thoughtless. The sun is much stronger in Carthage than you\u2019re accustomed to. Being raised on Cythera, I forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have sunstroke,\u201d she said in a low tone, batting my hand away.</p><p>I caught her hand and squeezed it hard enough to feel the small bones grinding together. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me.</p><p>\u201cI fear he\u2019s right, your highness,\u201d Arishat said in her soothing voice. \u201cOh, I feel a fool! You feel disordered in your wits, yes? \u2019Tis a common malady. I\u2019ve suffered it myself. In the cooler weather, one forgets the sun\u2019s strength.\u201d She dismounted and took hold of Sidonie\u2019s mount\u2019s bridle. \u201cCome, let us sit here in the shade together. We\u2019ll have the picnic brought to us.\u201d</p><p>I let go of Sidonie\u2019s hand and nodded imperceptibly.</p><p>\u201cSunstroke,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cA touch of fever, likely,\u201d Gemelquart said with cheerful sympathy. \u201cA cool compress will help. I pray you will forgive us our thoughtlessness. Ah, Bodeshmun!\u201d He greeted the Chief Horologist. \u201cI fear her highness is unwell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, your highness.\u201d Bodeshmun gazed down at Sidonie. \u201cI\u2019ll send for a physician immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord, but that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d She returned his gaze, her face pale. \u201cAlready, I\u2019m feeling better. I\u2019m sure if I rest here a little and have something cool to drink, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonetheless.\u201d He snapped his fingers and summoned one of the minor lords. \u201cWe can\u2019t be too careful, can we?\u201d</p><p>A physician arrived in short order. He examined Sidonie and confirmed a diagnosis of sunstroke, prescribing cool baths and rest in a darkened room. Bodeshmun sent for her covered palanquin. While we waited, he strolled some distance from the olive grove, beckoning for Gemelquart and me to accompany him.</p><p>\u201cWhat provoked this?\u201d the Chief Horologist asked us.</p><p>Gemelquart shrugged. \u201cDamned if I know. Something to do with her sister\u2019s dog getting killed. She wouldn\u2019t be swayed from talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t remember how it happened,\u201d I added. \u201cIt scared her.\u201d</p><p>Bodeshmun rubbed his chin. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank young Maignard here for convincing her it was merely a touch of sun,\u201d Gemelquart said with some asperity. \u201cBecause I was at my wits\u2019 end. Isn\u2019t there something you can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without . . . damage,\u201d Bodeshmun said slowly.</p><p>My blood ran cold.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Gemelquart retorted. \u201cDo we need her undamaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the moment, yes.\u201d Bodeshmun turned his quelling look on Gemelquart. \u201cYou forget, my lord, that her father is the Cruarch of Alba. He has returned to Alba\u2019s shores, where my spell no longer binds him. It could not be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forget nothing,\u201d Gemelquart muttered. \u201cI\u2019m merely saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Cruarch is bewildered,\u201d Bodeshmun continued, ignoring him. \u201cFor so long as he believes his eldest daughter is sincere in her marriage, he will remain frozen in inaction, unwilling to commit troops against Carthage. And yes, we need that, Gemelquart. We need to keep Alba and Terre d\u2019Ange bewildered and unable to act. We need to secure Aragonia. And we need to trade on the strength of this marriage to force Terre d\u2019Ange and Alba to bow before the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Gemelquart glanced back toward the olive grove. \u201cYet I fear your spell is weakening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime and distance strain it.\u201d Bodeshmun waved a dismissive hand. \u201cOnce the princess is reunited with Astegal, all will be well. She will forget her fears. I will see to it that it happens sooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d the other said curtly.</p><p>That earned him another quelling look. In the bright Carthaginian sunlight, Bodeshmun seemed to swell and tower, while Gemelquart quailed before him. I clasped my hands behind my back and looked away, doing my best to seem inconspicuous and innocuous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo not presume to give me orders,\u201d Bodeshmun said in a voice of quiet menace. \u201cI have wrought my life\u2019s work with these spells. The world has never seen their like before. What does the Council know of what is entailed in such magics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Gemelquart said lightly. \u201cNothing at all!\u201d He forced a laugh. \u201cI should return. We don\u2019t want to give the princess further cause for suspicion.\u201d</p><p>Bodeshmun watched him go, resting a heavy hand on my shoulder. \u201cDo you know,\u201d he said wistfully, \u201cI almost wish Ptolemy Solon were here. I have no peers capable of appreciating my work, only acolytes and fearful allies.\u201d His hand tightened on me. \u201cBut you\u2019ll tell him, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>He laughed deep in his chest. \u201cHave you discovered how I bound the princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said truthfully. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well! Keep trying.\u201d Bodeshmun laughed again, giving my shoulder a rough shake. \u201cYou acquitted yourself well today. You\u2019re a useful tool, Solon\u2019s pretty little monkey.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cI try.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-Five</p><p>For a day, I heard nothing. I was in an agony of suspense. Ah, gods! The irony abounded. Bodeshmun, sodding Bodeshmun, trusted me. The man Ptolemy Solon himself admired for his cleverness\u2014I\u2019d fooled him. That was good. That was very, very good.</p><p>But it was Sidonie\u2019s trust I needed.</p><p>And that, I feared I was in danger of losing.</p><p>Such a difficult game it was. Lies and a marrow of truth. Everything I\u2019d said cut close to the bone. Again and again, I relived that moment in the olive grove. Her hand clutching my wrist, the quiet panic rising. She had listened. She\u2019d heeded me. But she didn\u2019t trust me. Why should she? I\u2019d seen the fear dawning in her eyes.</p><p>I was afraid, too.</p> <p>For the first time in years, I drilled with my sword. I practiced in the privacy of my chambers, feeling woefully inadequate. I wasn\u2019t a swordsman, wasn\u2019t a warrior. I knew how to hold a blade, a few rudimentary thrusts and parries. Nothing more.</p><p>Still, I drilled.</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d It was Kratos who interrupted me. \u201cThe princess has sent word wondering if you would care for another game of chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she?\u201d I snatched the letter from his hands.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m told,\u201d Kratos said laconically. \u201cNot succeeded in bedding her yet, have you, my lord?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my gaze from the vellum. \u201cThat would be an offense against General Astegal, would it not? Against Carthage itself?\u201d</p><p>Kratos shrugged his heavy wrestler\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDo I care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you value your tongue, you\u2019ll watch it,\u201d I said in warning. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>Whatever Kratos saw in my face, it impressed my seriousness on him. He merely gave a brief nod and went to fetch the other bearers.</p><p>By the time I arrived at the Sarkal villa, my stomach was in knots. Whatever Sidonie wanted, I didn\u2019t think it was a game of chess. And as pleasant as the thought was, I was fairly sure it wasn\u2019t a dalliance. I suspected she wanted answers. And while I would like nothing more than to give them to her, I didn\u2019t know how in the name of Blessed Elua I could accomplish it without alerting her guards.</p><p>In the salon, the chess board was set on the table. The ranks of onyx and ivory figures faced off across the board, their ruby eyes glittering. Sidonie stood beside it, her back very straight, her features calm and controlled. Behind her, one of the ever-present Amazigh stood with his back to the wall.</p><p>\u201cGood day, your highness,\u201d I greeted her. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to see you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She turned to the Amazigh. \u201cMasmud, you may go.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened between veils of cloth. \u201cGeneral Astegal has ordered us to protect you at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessire Maignard is a concerned friend and no threat.\u201d A hint of steel crept into her voice. \u201cAnd in Astegal\u2019s absence, I command here. I am commanding you now. Go.\u201d</p><p>The Amazigh hesitated.</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s voice cracked like a whip. \u201cNow, or I will have you dismissed!\u201d</p><p>He went.</p><p>She rounded on me. \u201cNow. Tell me. What is it that passes here? What is it you know that I do not? Why do I find myself unable to recall simple things? And what is it you fear from Bodeshmun and my guards?\u201d</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>There was so much, I barely knew where to begin. And I had a feeling there wasn\u2019t much time. I didn\u2019t know to whom the Amazigh reported directly, but I desperately hoped it wasn\u2019t Bodeshmun.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAll is not as it seems. You\u2019ve been ensorceled. Parts of your memory are missing. Parts are false. Terre d\u2019Ange is not allied with Carthage. And you are not in love with Astegal.\u201d</p><p>Her face was rigid. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a spell,\u201d I said helplessly. \u201cThere\u2019s somewhat on you, somewhat on your person, some token of Astegal\u2019s that binds you. I thought it was the signet ring, but it must be somewhat else. If you can find it, remove it; it will weaken the spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing on me!\u201d Her voice rose. \u201cI\u2019m passing familiar with my own person, Leander, and I think I would know! Who are you? What do you want? What does Cythera want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you!\u201d I hissed. \u201cAnd if Bodeshmun finds out, I\u2019ll be lucky if he settles for killing me. For the love of Elua, my lady, you\u2019re in danger! Please believe me. You cannot let them suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuspect what?\u201d she demanded in frustration.</p><p>\u201cThat you know about the spell!\u201d I ground my teeth. \u201cAll right, mayhap Ptolemy Solon was wrong about part of it. But the ring, Astegal\u2019s ring\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it if it concerns you that much!\u201d Sidonie wrenched the heavy signet ring from her finger and hurled it at me. It bounced off my chest and fell clinking to the floor, rolling beneath the table.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cNot that ring\u2014\u201d There were footsteps hurrying in the hallway outside the salon. I dropped to my knees. \u201cSidonie de la Courcel, in the name of Blessed Elua and his Companions, by all that is holy, by all that I\u2019ve ever held dear in my life, I swear to you that I mean you no harm and all I have told you is true. In your heart, in your deepest heart, you know somewhat is amiss. Please, please, please, if you do nothing else, do not let them suspect it. Bring me to New Carthage with you. I swear to you, I will prove my words and my loyalty. I am begging you, please, to look into your heart and trust me in this.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie stared at me without answering.</p><p>\u201cYour highness!\u201d The steward bustled into the salon, his voice distraught. \u201cForgive me, but it is unseemly . . .\u201d He paused. \u201cIs all well here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sidonie said slowly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I dropped my ring. Messire Maignard was retrieving it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The steward eyed me with relief as I reached beneath the table and found the signet ring. I rose without comment, bowed, and handed it to Sidonie. She examined it, then slid it onto her finger. \u201cIs it damaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappily, no.\u201d She smiled briefly at the steward. \u201cWhy are you here, messire? Is there somewhat that demands my attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cBut the guard . . . Forgive me, your highness. In my lord Astegal\u2019s absence, it is unseemly that you should meet alone with another man.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cSurely you do not suspect me of dallying with Messire Maignard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not!\u201d The steward wrung his hands. \u201cAnd I am sure that if his lordship were here, he would countenance it without a thought. But in his absence, it falls to me to ensure that there is no cause for misunderstanding or idle gossip. I merely seek to do my duty, your highness. I beg of you, please do not punish me for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Sidonie gazed at him for a long time, during which the steward went white, then red. \u201cYou must understand, in Terre d\u2019Ange, matters are very different. But I suppose I am in Carthage now, albeit for only a few more days. Very well, since you have such concern for semblances, you may stay and observe our game for yourself. I\u2019m weary of my lord\u2019s Amazigh guards hovering over me as though to dispatch an assassin at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d</p><p>The steward sighed. \u201cA thousand thanks, your highness.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie and I sat at the table opposite one another. I felt strung tight, quivering like a plucked harp-string. Oh, gods, that had been a near thing! I\u2019d never known fear before, not like that. Fear for me, fear for her. As long as it served his plans, Bodeshmun wanted her undamaged. But I didn\u2019t doubt for an instant that he would throw her to the wolves the moment she was no longer useful to him.</p><p>A moment I was trying to hasten.</p><p>I played very badly. Sidonie was quiet, concentrating on the board. I watched her annihilate me piece by steady piece. It seemed impossible to believe that no more than a week had passed since we\u2019d played our first game. I didn\u2019t feel like the same Leander Maignard who\u2019d sat opposite her that day and blushed at her teasing barbs. The stakes had grown far too high.</p><p>\u201cHave you had word from Lord Astegal?\u201d I inquired presently. \u201cYou mentioned leaving within days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She captured one of my knights without looking up. \u201cA courier came this morning. It seems matters have progressed swiftly. King Roderico has surrendered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Aragonia has fallen?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Sidonie shook her head. \u201cThere was a coup. One of his young cousins has declared himself regent in exile.\u201d She watched my move. \u201cActually, he\u2019s a distant kinsman of mine, too. Serafin L\u2019Envers y Aragon. We\u2019re related through my grandmother on my mother\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if that was a safe topic or not. \u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstegal says he\u2019s holed up in Am\u00edlcar with what\u2019s left of the Aragonian army. He doesn\u2019t expect the fighting to resume until spring.\u201d She deftly captured another piece. \u201cI imagine Serafin will attempt to negotiate with the Euskerri and promise them the sovereignty Roderico refused to consider in return for their aid. I don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t try to settle that matter earlier when . . .\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off.</p><p>I saw it again, the perplexity and fear. There was a memory missing here. I had no idea what it was, some piece of political intrigue. All I knew was that I wanted to cup her face in my hands, shower her with tender kisses, whisper all of her missing secrets in her ear until the fear and uncertainty were gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that all will be well,\u201d I said gently. \u201cIf King Roderico has surrendered, no doubt this young rebel kinsman will see his wisdom in time and follow. When do you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn three days\u2019 time.\u201d With an effort, Sidonie focused her attention on the board. Her hand trembled slightly as she moved a rook. \u201cSo I fear this is our final game, Messire Maignard. Unless . . .\u201d</p><p>I sacrificed a pawn in a hopeless gambit. \u201cUnless?\u201d</p><p>Her black gaze lifted to meet mine. \u201cUnless you wish to accompany me.\u201d Her tone was light, lighter than I could have managed. \u201cYou said you\u2019d a fancy to see New Carthage, and a D\u2019Angeline princess ought to have courtiers. Might your lord Solon see fit to allow it?\u201d</p><p>Despite the fear, despite the tension, my heart soared. \u201cI\u2019m sure he would. I\u2019m here to obtain Carthage\u2019s goodwill, and I\u2019ve obtained all the assurances he could hope for. I\u2019ll dispatch them forthwith and place myself at your disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Sidonie declined my pawn\u2019s gambit, moving her queen decisively. \u201cCheck and mate. I will be pleased to have your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I to provide it,\u201d I murmured. I studied the board, then tipped my king.</p><p>\u201cSo our game continues?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>I wanted to say to her, It\u2019s not a game; it\u2019s in deadly earnest. But Sidonie knew. I didn\u2019t need to hear her say it. I saw her, saw all of her. The raised chin and the firm, demanding brows, at odds with the delicate bones of her face. All the pride and determination, all the rising fury and suspicion, terror and vulnerability. A measure of trust I hadn\u2019t earned. Fault-lines created through cruel artifice. It made my heart ache and my throat tighten.</p><p>I loved her.</p><p>No point in denying it, no point in doubting it. It was unlikely, improbable, and true. If I had to lay my broken heart on the altar of love and let it be destroyed in a glorious blaze to secure her happiness, so be it. I would do it.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I said hoarsely. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>There it was again, that word.</p><p>The word lodged like a stone in my chest. It felt like a stone in my mouth, heavy on my tongue. Always. Always and always. Why did it make my eyes sting? I looked away. Sidonie looked away. Her steward, Astegal\u2019s steward, cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cThen I will see you in New Carthage,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>What I wanted to say was I will follow you to the ends of the earth. I will be whatever you ask of me: courtier, savior, lover, and husband, master and slave. Anything, everything.</p><p>Only ask.</p><p>What I said was, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She nodded. \u201cTo New Carthage.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Six</p><p>I spent three days putting my affairs in order.</p><p>I wrote out a lengthy letter to Ptolemy Solon, employing one of the codes her ladyship had devised, one that owed naught to the Guild, but merely to her own prodigious intellect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I met with Maharbal and haggled over the terms of ending my lease of his cousin\u2019s villa earlier than expected. I thanked the steward Anysus for his service and gave him a purse to share amongst the household.</p><p>I wrote out letters of manumission as I had promised for my bearers and had them witnessed and stamped by the city official in charge of such matters. I presented them to the lads and asked what they willed.</p><p>Ghanim received his letter with fierce joy. Through one of the Carthaginians, he made me to understand that he would be returning to the desert to seek vengeance against the brother who had wronged him. I wished him well. In turn, he uttered a lengthy prayer on my behalf in the Amazigh tongue that no one could translate.</p> <p>I\u2019d never thought before what a strange thing it was the way lives intersected. I had changed the course of Ghanim\u2019s life, while the only trace of his impact on mine was a blood-stained robe hidden in the depths of my trunks. Passing strange.</p><p>The brothers elected to remain in Carthage, working as porters or bearers on the docks. It didn\u2019t surprise me. They were young enough to be resilient. A couple weeks\u2019 worth of a good diet had given them a measure of strength and, more important, hope.</p><p>Kratos . . . Kratos was the surprise.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, I\u2019ll stay in your service,\u201d he said, pocketing his letter of manumission. \u201cMight be you could use a loyal man.\u201d</p><p>I dismissed the others, then studied Kratos\u2019 homely face. \u201cHow loyal?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not a fool, my lord. Most people don\u2019t see that. You did. I know you\u2019re up to something. But you kept your word. I\u2019ll keep mine. You\u2019re not buying my loyalty this time. I\u2019m giving it freely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou\u2019re the one was clever enough to be concerned about my business being dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d A broad smile spread over his face. \u201cTruth be told, I don\u2019t rightly know. I\u2019m curious. You\u2019re not what I took you to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>\u201cA shallow fellow,\u201d Kratos said frankly. \u201cA smooth-tongued politician delighted by his own cleverness. Now . . .\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You seem different, or mayhap there\u2019s more to you than I gauged. I\u2019m long past my prime. I\u2019ve got nowhere to go, no family left to me. Those lads, the Carthaginian boys . . .\u201d He jerked his thumb at the door. \u201cThey\u2019re young. They\u2019ve a chance to build lives for themselves. Might be they\u2019ll succeed; might be they\u2019ll fail. Me, I\u2019m a broken-down wrestler with only a few good working years left in me. Might as well satisfy my curiosity. Good enough?\u201d</p><p>I put out my hand. \u201cGood enough.\u201d</p> <p>Kratos clasped it. \u201cCare to tell me about this danger, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cFor the moment, suffice to say that as far as you\u2019re concerned, I\u2019m exactly what you took me to be. And no careless remarks about the princess.\u201d I released his hand and pointed at him. \u201cI meant my threat.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me. \u201cNot so effective now that I\u2019m a freedman, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think General Astegal\u2019s Amazigh guards will be concerned for such niceties,\u201d I observed. \u201cMy lord Bodeshmun has made it clear to me that a similar threat hangs over my head, the mantle of Cythera\u2019s protection notwithstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d Kratos sobered. \u201cSo why is it you\u2019re doing . . . whatever you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>I sorted through the reasons I\u2019d once believed. None of them seemed adequate. Sidonie\u2019s face surfaced in my memory, filled with that terrible mixture of fear, vulnerability, strength, and unlikely trust.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have to,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>Kratos nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. \u201cThat, my friend, makes one of us.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d told my bearers that their freedom would take effect the day I sailed. To that end, I called on Captain Deimos and informed him that I required passage to New Carthage. He took the news with equanimity. We discussed the necessary preparations, including dispatching my letter to Ptolemy Solon by some other means. Happily, Deimos knew of an Ephesian merchant-ship that would be making port at Paphos, and promised to arrange for the letter\u2019s delivery.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of matters in New Carthage?\u201d I asked him when we\u2019d finished. Sailors always had the best gossip.</p><p>Deimos smiled briefly. \u201cOn the docks, they\u2019re saying that Astegal\u2019s set himself up like a king there. Every city and village within a hundred leagues is paying tribute and pledging loyalty to him. He\u2019s not going to be content to wear the Council\u2019s yolk for long. Is that what you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat of this rebel, this Serafin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Deimos glanced around. \u201cA stubborn fellow with a hopeless cause. I imagine he\u2019ll be crushed in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d I clapped his shoulder. \u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>As I returned from the harbor, I paid a visit to Jabnit of Philosir, ostensibly to inquire if he had an interest in purchasing a necklace set with rubies and seed-pearls that had been among Ptolemy Solon\u2019s tribute-gifts, an item for which I\u2019d found no suitable recipient. We haggled for a time and drank sweet tea. When I mentioned that I was bound for New Carthage and needed coin more than gems, Jabnit\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cAt the invitation of the princess!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cSuch an honor. Will you sail under the auspices of the House of Sarkal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d I sipped my tea. \u201cMy lord Ptolemy Solon has vouchsafed me the usage of a ship and crew for as long as I require.\u201d I laughed. \u201c\u2019Tis a great deal of ship for a lone emissary, but his eminence has his foibles!\u201d</p><p>Jabnit pressed his hands together, his eyes twinkling. \u201cYou know, I have a most excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>I listened while he proposed to purchase the necklace for a generous price. In turn, Jabnit asked that I provide passage for his assistant, Sunjata, and once we reached New Carthage, hire out a few of my crew to serve as bodyguards while Sunjata went about the business of acquiring looted gems and jewelry at an advantageous price.</p><p>\u201cThink of it!\u201d Jabnit said. \u201cYour men would otherwise be sitting idle in port, spending your wages on dicing and wenching. This way, they will spend my wages. And it is a very short journey between old Carthage and new. If your ship will ferry precious cargo for the House of Philosir, I will give you a percentage of the profits.\u201d He gave me a broad wink. \u201cAnd I do not think you will mind Sunjata\u2019s company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d I smiled at the fat gem-merchant. \u201cWhat an excellent idea, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He chortled. \u201cI knew you were a clever fellow!\u201d</p><p>Sunjata was summoned from the rear of the establishment and given the news. He gave me a long, slow smile that could have meant anything. \u201cI\u2019ll make ready to leave at once,\u201d he said to Jabnit. \u201cHow very clever it is of you to have conceived of this opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Jabnit smiled complacently. \u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Clever. I thought about what Kratos had said of me. He was right, a mere two weeks ago I would have been falling all over myself with inward delight for having arranged this so neatly. Now I was merely relieved to have it done.</p><p>How odd.</p><p>It was the difference, I supposed, between training and being engaged in the actual practice of the arts of covertcy. They say callow soldiers either become men or die quickly on the battlefield. This was a different field of battle, but the stakes were no less high. I\u2019d never known real danger before. Bored and idle on Cythera, a hawk on a tether, I\u2019d thought to crave danger and excitement.</p><p>Now I\u2019d had a surfeit of it.</p><p>And then there was Sidonie.</p><p>That was the oddest thing of all. I truly hadn\u2019t believed one could form such strong feelings for another in such a short time. It seemed an impossible fancy, a poet\u2019s tale. Now I was awash in emotion, fairly drowning in it.</p><p>I sent a letter to notify her that my own plans for travel to New Carthage were in readiness. She sent a reply in short order, confirming the time of departure. A total of six ships would be escorting her to New Carthage, and she invited me to join their small fleet in the interest of safety. I sent a polite reply accepting with thanks, and dispatched Kratos to notify Captain Deimos.</p><p>Gods, I wanted to see her.</p><p>And it would be worse in New Carthage. I had to prepare myself for that. There was somewhat between us, and I knew Sidonie felt it. That spark of desire when she had touched me. Even when she\u2019d grasped my wrist in fear the day of the hunting party. I could still feel her grip. On my flesh, in my bones.</p><p>But time and distance strained the spell, Bodeshmun said. He was convinced that she would forget her fears once she was reunited with Astegal. I wasn\u2019t, not entirely. Bodeshmun saw her as a pawn, not a person. Her curiosity was merely an annoyance to be managed. He hadn\u2019t truly seen the sharp intellect struggling against the magics that bound her thoughts. Beyond whatever purpose she served, he couldn\u2019t have cared less about Sidonie herself. And for that, I was profoundly grateful, because if he had, Bodeshmun might have seen what I did.</p><p>Still, it wasn\u2019t likely he was entirely wrong, either. Likely the spell would exert new strength.</p><p>And Astegal . . .</p><p>I\u2019d have to see her with Astegal, this ambitious Carthaginian general styling himself a king in Aragonia. The man she thought she loved. I would have to witness it and smile pleasantly. The thought was unbelievably galling.</p><p>On the night before our departure, I went through my things once more. One of the trunks her ladyship had given me had a false bottom, a standard practice as such things went. It was there that I\u2019d stowed the Amazigh garments and the ring Sunjata had made for me.</p><p>I took a moment to study the latter. I hoped to hell it was an accurate copy. Like as not it was. Sunjata had had the original in his possession, and he had an eye for detail trained by her ladyship.</p><p>A simple thing, a knot of gold. A love-token. Sidonie had given Prince Imriel the original. I slid the copy on my finger, wondering what it had meant to them. Some bit of girlish folly, I\u2019d assumed when Ptolemy Solon had explained it to me. That seemed a very long time ago, when I\u2019d been a different Leander Maignard, a callow young man still capable of imagining a Sidonie de la Courcel prone to girlish folly.</p><p>Lamplight gleamed softly on the gold. I felt a knot tighten in my throat, tighten around my heart. I tightened my hand to a fist.</p><p>\u201cAstegal,\u201d I said aloud. \u201cI\u2019m coming for you.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Seven</p><p>We departed for New Carthage on a sullen day, the skies grey and cloudy, spitting fitful bouts of rain. I stood beside my borrowed palanquin, watching hired porters carry my trunks onto Captain Deimos\u2019 ship. Everything was packed away, the Amazigh garb and the false ring safely hidden once more.</p><p>I\u2019d arrived early, hoping for a glimpse of Sidonie. A glimpse was all I got. I saw her ornate palanquin in the midst of a considerable entourage, flanked by her Amazigh guards. They escorted her aboard the House of Sarkal\u2019s flagship. Her figure was cloaked and hooded against the chilly drizzle.</p><p>Still, I knew her.</p><p>I knew her by the way she moved, at once controlled and deft. There was a neatness to it, a precise grace. I\u2019d seen it every time she left or entered a room. I\u2019d seen it sitting opposite her, a chess board between us, in the way she had made her choices and moved the pieces.</p><p>Oddly, it made me think of the time my father had taken me to see the Cruarch\u2019s entourage pass. They\u2019d had that quality, some of Drustan mab Necthana\u2019s Cruithne warriors. The Cruarch himself had had it. I\u2019d shouted along with all the other children, tossing petals in his path. He\u2019d glanced my way. His eldest daughter had inherited his black eyes, too.</p><p>Beside me, Sunjata shivered. \u201cGods, Leander! You are truly a man besotted.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my chin at the ship. \u201cGo aboard, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said, suiting actions to words.</p><p>On the flagship, Sidonie vanished from view. On Captain Deimos\u2019 ship, all my things were loaded. There was no more reason to linger on the quay. Kratos waited patiently to accompany me, blinking against the drizzle, his grey-brown hair plastered to his skull. I\u2019d paid one of the porters to take his place at the palanquin, returning it to the villa of Maharbal\u2019s cousin. Once that was done, my briefly held slaves were all freedmen. Ghanim eyed me hungrily, eager to enjoy his freedom and pursue his vengeance.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d I said gently to them. \u201cMay Blessed Elua hold and keep you.\u201d</p><p>They went at a swift jog.</p><p>I watched them go, wondering. Wondering what had prompted me to speak the words of a blessing I hadn\u2019t uttered since childhood. Wondering what private tale of great and terrible romance Ghanim inhabited. Wondering whether the Carthaginian brothers would turn freedom into success or sink back into abject poverty. Wondering what story the hired porter had to tell. All four of them trotted lightly, carrying the empty palanquin. Soon they were out of sight.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>I sighed. I had the strangest feeling that I\u2019d been here before, done this before. That there had been too many leavetakings in my short life. It wasn\u2019t true, but I felt it all the same.</p><p>Kratos put his hand beneath my elbow, steadying me. \u201cReady, my lord?\u201d</p><p>I gazed at his stolid face. The squashed nose, the shrewd eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen let\u2019s board.\u201d</p><p>As Jabnit had indicated, the journey was a fairly short one. New Carthage was an old name; the port city had been founded by a Carthaginian conqueror before Blessed Elua walked the earth. Aragonia had been part of Carthage\u2019s empire, that was true. And then it had been a Tiberian holding, even as Terre d\u2019Ange itself had been long ago. But Tiberium\u2019s star had set, and like Terre d\u2019Ange, Aragonia had been an independent and sovereign nation for many centuries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least until now.</p><p>Throughout the short journey, the weather continued to be miserable. It wasn\u2019t truly cold this far south, but it was cool enough that the rain made one feel dank and chilled. Sunjata and I spent a good deal of time taking refuge in my cabin and speculating, while Kratos entertained himself by dicing with the sailors.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose Ptolemy Solon was wrong about Astegal\u2019s token being hidden on Sidonie\u2019s person?\u201d I asked after I\u2019d told Sunjata about my last encounter with her. \u201cShe seemed quite convinced it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Sunjata reclined in a hammock, one foot braced on the floor, rocking himself gently. \u201cAs I understand, there\u2019s more than one way to construct a spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one secretly apprenticed to a horologist,\u201d I observed. \u201cYour guess is likely to be better than mine. Why do they call themselves that, anyway? It seems to me that they study a good deal more than the cosmos.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cTrue. It didn\u2019t begin that way. The study of arcane arts have flourished since Bodeshmun was appointed.\u201d He rocked in his hammock for a moment, then added, \u201cYou know, it may well be Solon\u2019s inquiries long ago that piqued Bodeshmun\u2019s interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dire thought,\u201d I commented.</p><p>\u201cMayhap it\u2019s one of the reasons he agreed to help you,\u201d Sunjata said. \u201cWho knows what goes through the Wise Ape\u2019s head?\u201d</p> <p>I snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s not me he agreed to help. I\u2019m the one taking the risks, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Sunjata smiled crookedly at me. \u201cYou just seem to have grown singularly . . . invested . . . in the cause.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the comment. \u201cSo what do you think? About the spell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He pushed with his foot, rocking. \u201cLeander, what if it\u2019s not one thing you\u2019re looking for? What if it\u2019s everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Sunjata gazed fixedly at me. \u201cEverything. What if Bodeshmun\u2019s managed to stitch and bind the spell into every garment, every piece of jewelry the princess possesses?\u201d</p> <p>I thought about it. \u201cIs that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s bound to be some point . . . the bath, mayhap . . .\u201d I thought more about it. \u201cWell, no. I suppose it could be managed if her attendants were careful and clever. Hairpins, earrings, nightgowns.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSo you\u2019d have to get her mother-naked to break the spell. Or at least that half of it.\u201d Another crooked smile. \u201cThat\u2019s a prospect you shouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well it would have been a great deal simpler to remove a single ring,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, like Astegal\u2019s will be?\u201d Sunjata raised his brows at me.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThat\u2019s different. I don\u2019t expect that to be easy. But if his token had been the House of Sarkal\u2019s signet ring, I tell you, Sunjata, half the spell that binds her would already be broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you a happier man,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help how I feel.\u201d I gazed at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I never meant to hurt you. Are you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous.\u201d Sunjata folded his arms behind his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the right word for it. We\u2019ve been friends for a long time, you and I. Lovers when it suited us. I never expected anything more than that, and I daresay you didn\u2019t, either. So, no. And yet . . .\u201d He stared at the ceiling. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling, I\u2019ve never felt. Let us say I\u2019m envious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d I said. \u201cRemember, if I do succeed in breaking the spell, the first thing she\u2019ll remember is Prince Imriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cAre you so certain she\u2019s not capable of loving more than one man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBelieve me, I wonder about it every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need to believe it, Leander.\u201d Sunjata smiled with surprising gentleness. \u201cWill it truly hurt all the more if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will.\u201d</p><p>The weather cleared at last on the day we sailed into the port of New Carthage. I nearly wished it hadn\u2019t, since it felt almost as though the weather itself was in league with Astegal. Still, it meant we were able to be comfortable above the deck, gazing at the city that was our new temporary home.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t nearly as formidable as old Carthage, but it was imposing enough. The harbor was large, with heavy fortifications on either side, fortresses mounted with engines of war. Here and there, one could see foundered ships that had not yet been salvaged. But most of Carthage\u2019s fleet had survived intact, and the waters were thick with war-ships.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the Aragonian fleet?\u201d I asked Sunjata.</p><p>\u201cDestroyed,\u201d he said soberly.</p><p>\u201cThe whole thing?\u201d I asked. He nodded.</p><p>Like old Carthage, New Carthage was walled, although the walls were a fraction of the size. And too, the city was built on a hill, sloping down to the harbor. Unlike old Carthage, here the hill was topped with a sizable palace, dominating all it surveyed.</p><p>That, I thought, would be where Astegal had ensconced himself.</p><p>We were stopped and our papers examined. New papers, stamped with the seal of the House of Sarkal, courtesy of Sidonie\u2019s steward. The captain who examined them shrugged quizzically, but he let us pass.</p><p>There was a procession of mounted Carthaginian soldiers in full regalia making its way toward the quay to meet the flagship. As we waited our turn to dock, I studied the fellow at the head of the procession.</p><p>\u201cAstegal?\u201d I asked Sunjata.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>He was a tall man, but he sat lightly in the saddle. Black hair bound with a gold fillet. Strong features in the hawk-nosed Carthaginian mold. A narrow beard dyed a striking scarlet. Above it, he was smiling broadly, watching as the flagship was moored. His teeth were very white.</p><p>I hated him already.</p><p>Trumpets blared as Sidonie appeared at the top of the ramp, flanked by her Amazigh guards. Today it was warm enough that she needed no cloak. She was wearing the pale yellow gown. Sunlight gleamed on her hair, sparkled on the diamonds at her ears and throat.</p><p>My heart ached more than I would have thought possible.</p><p>Astegal\u2019s smile widened as she descended. He made her a courtly bow, a cloak of Tyrian purple swirling around him. He didn\u2019t need a cloak, either. It was just for show. The trumpets blared again. To the accompanying cheers of his soldiers, Astegal swept Sidonie into his arms and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cEasy, my lord,\u201d Kratos said at my left shoulder.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized I was gripping the railing with such force that the wood was splintering beneath my nails. Sunjata gave me a worried look. I forced myself to breathe slowly and relax.</p><p>We had to wait some time to dock and disembark, but a second delegation arrived, composed of Aragonian peers with stilted smiles and hatred in their eyes. Foremost among them was a tall, slender old fellow with silvery hair and beard.</p><p>\u201cRoderico de Aragon, I\u2019ll wager,\u201d Sunjata remarked.</p><p>Kratos whistled. \u201cThe deposed king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a political hostage . . . ha!\u201d Sunjata nudged me with his elbow. \u201cWell, well. Look who\u2019s here. Justina.\u201d</p><p>I followed his gaze to spot an old childhood companion in the midst of the Aragonian peers. Justina. I hadn\u2019t seen her in the better part of five years. Long ago, she, Sunjata, and I had all trained together under her ladyship\u2019s aegis.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was in Aragonia,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I,\u201d Sunjata replied. \u201cBut her ladyship casts her nets far and wide. Well, that\u2019s a gift from the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to need all the divine providence the gods have to offer.\u201d</p><p>Kratos glanced from one to the other of us. Over the course of the voyage, I\u2019d assured Sunjata that he was trustworthy. Still, it was the first time we\u2019d spoken openly in front of him. I could see the flicker of curiosity in his gaze, but he kept his mouth shut. Good man.</p><p>The throng was still there when we finally disembarked. I paused at the top of the ramp. On the dock, Sidonie turned her head, gazing in my direction. I felt a sinking sensation in the pit of my stomach as our eyes met. What if she had changed her mind? But no, she tilted her head slightly and made a beckoning gesture.</p><p>\u201cYou do plan on introducing me, I hope,\u201d Sunjata said.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>We left Kratos and the sailors to keep watch over our things while Captain Deimos made inquiries regarding lodging. I felt lightheaded and sick making my way along the crowded quay. We waited our turn amid other well-wishers, and then there they were before us.</p><p>Sidonie and Astegal.</p><p>\u201cMessire Maignard.\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cI\u2019m pleased you were able to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is the chess-playing Cytheran D\u2019Angeline.\u201d Astegal studied me, then chuckled. \u201cI suppose I must thank you for providing my wife with a harmless diversion. She has an impatient spirit.\u201d</p><p>I bowed. \u201cThe pleasure was mine, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll lodge at the palace, of course.\u201d Astegal waved a careless hand. A gold knot glinted on one finger. \u201cThere\u2019s ample room, and I fear Sidonie will find it no less idle here, at least until we come to terms with the rebels.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cOr you could do the sensible thing and leave me to administer New Carthage while you settle the matter.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in Astegal\u2019s jaw twitched. He smiled at Sidonie. \u201cWhen the last rebel has surrendered, my dear, I will shower cities at your feet and you may administer them to your heart\u2019s content. Until then, a man\u2019s firmer hand is needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever died of tedium, your highness,\u201d I said lightly. Her quick gaze flicked to meet mine.</p><p>\u201cI suppose not,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>So it was still there, gods be thanked. Her wits, her lingering fears and suspicions. I presented Sunjata to them, explaining my partnership in a business venture with the House of Philosir.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Astegal\u2019s gaze rested on Sunjata\u2019s face for a few heartbeats. \u201cGood old Jabnit\u2019s assistant. You did us a good service as I recall.\u201d He laid his hand on Sidonie\u2019s shoulder, the ring glinting. \u201cDo you remember the painting of gems I presented to your mother, my dear? The House of Philosir procured the gems.\u201d</p><p>Sunjata bowed. \u201cIt was our honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you,\u201d Sidonie said to him.</p><p>Astegal\u2019s hand tightened on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shot him a puzzled look. \u201cYou were with Messire Maignard, were you not?\u201d she asked Sunjata. \u201cOn the street outside the villa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Although his reaction wasn\u2019t visible, I could feel Sunjata relax beside me. \u201cYes, your highness. I was among your admirers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must come to the palace as well,\u201d Astegal said smoothly. \u201cMy lady wife should be surrounded by admirers. Speak to the chamberlain; he will see to everything.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned away, taking Sidonie\u2019s arm and steering her. I hoped she\u2019d look back at me, but she didn\u2019t. I forced myself to look away, willing myself not to show the hatred and jealousy raging inside me. Some yards away, I saw Justina winding her way toward us, attended by a pair of Aragonian servants.</p><p>She had been a pretty girl, and she\u2019d grown into an attractive woman. Quick-witted and quick-tempered, I remembered. Dark hair and olive skin. Her mother had been a Hellene slave in the household of a Tiberian merchant, and she could pass for any one of a half dozen nationalities.</p><p>To my surprise, Justina spat at my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings a D\u2019Angeline to New Carthage?\u201d she demanded in flawless Aragonian. \u201cDo you come to spy and mock for your traitorous Queen while Astegal sets her daughter over us?\u201d</p><p>A few Aragonians in earshot murmured with approval. Others sought to hush her, glancing anxiously in Astegal\u2019s direction. I was so astonished, I could barely frame a reply. \u201cNo, my lady,\u201d I stammered in Aragonian. \u201cI am D\u2019Angeline in heritage only. I come as a citizen of Cythera, an emissary of my lord Ptolemy Solon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCythera!\u201d Justina sneered. \u201cWhat does Cythera want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace, generally.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cMy lady, I am Leander Maignard, and I will be lodging at the palace. If you will grant me the courtesy of an audience, I will be pleased to discuss how Cythera might be of assistance to Aragonia in this difficult time.\u201d I smiled ruefully. \u201cI fear we are an island with considerable experience in the matter of being conquered and occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blunt,\u201d Justina said. \u201cI\u2019ll think on it.\u201d</p><p>She flounced away. Sunjata and I gazed after her. \u201cWell,\u201d he said presently. \u201cWelcome to New Carthage and a whole new set of intrigues.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Eight</p><p>Life in New Carthage was agonizing.</p><p>Astegal was generous in his hospitality. Sunjata and I were given a suite of rooms to share, with a servant\u2019s chamber for Kratos. Space was found in the barracks for a handful of Captain Deimos\u2019 men to serve as guards for Sunjata as he went about the business of the House of Philosir, acquiring looted gems and jewelry at prices little short of robbery from unwitting soldiers. Astegal, it seemed, was eager to ensure that peers of old Carthage like Jabnit of Philosir thought themselves fatted on the spoils of war. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While he ruled like a king.</p><p>And that he did.</p><p>Every night there was feasting and revels in the great hall of the palace. Wine flowed freely, and platter after laden platter emerged from the kitchens. There were dancers and musicians and comedians. Some were Carthaginian, imported along with his household. Most were Aragonian. Some performed with bitterness scarce concealed behind stoic expressions. Some with philosophical indifference.</p> <p>Astegal didn\u2019t care either way.</p><p>All of it entertained him\u2014all of it.</p><p>He laughed and clapped regardless, tossing coins for the performers to scramble after. And every night, every damnable night, Sidonie sat beside him. For the most part, she was quiet and withdrawn. She was struggling, I could tell. Sorting through her thoughts and fears and confusion, trying to put them in order. Sometimes she would glance my way, and I could see the quiet panic. At other times, Astegal spoke soothingly to her, stroking her face with his ringed hand, and I could see the fears abate.</p><p>And every night, every night, she went willingly with him. His strong arm resting around her waist or draped over her shoulders. His hardened soldier\u2019s hands. Touching her, possessing her. Guiding her to their bedchamber, over and over.</p><p>I thought I would lose my mind.</p> <p>My only consolation was that Bodeshmun himself seemed disturbed at Astegal\u2019s excesses. He attended the revels, grim and funereal in his black horologist\u2019s robes. From time to time, I saw him murmur in Astegal\u2019s ear. The Carthaginian general merely laughed, waving away his concerns. Well and good, I thought, you reap what you have sown, Bodeshmun.</p><p>Still, it was cold comfort.</p><p>I waited for Sidonie to send for me, waited and waited. But it was Justina who sent for me first, inviting me to dine privately with her. It seemed she had a villa of her own, not far from the palace.</p><p>\u201cLeander Maignard!\u201d This time, in private, Justina greeted me with a kiss. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I wanted to send for you or Sunjata sooner, but I had to be cautious. I\u2019m treading a narrow path here. Tell me, do you have word from her ladyship? What game is afoot?\u201d</p><p>I glanced around, wary of her servants.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dismissed them for the evening,\u201d Justina said, reading my face. She reached up to toy with my braids. \u201cThe table\u2019s already laid. As far as they\u2019re concerned, this is likely a dalliance I don\u2019t want known. So come dine, and tell me.\u201d</p> <p>I did.</p><p>Justina listened in fascination, her eyes widening. \u201cDire magic,\u201d she said when I had finished. \u201cThat explains a great deal.\u201d</p><p>I stabbed my fork into a piece of overcooked fish. \u201cCan you help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have.\u201d She eyed me wryly. \u201cGods, Leander! I wish you\u2019d come here first. Until her demure highness arrived, I\u2019d managed to position myself nicely as Astegal\u2019s mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I savaged my fish. \u201cThen why did you spit at me on the docks?\u201d</p><p>Justina blinked. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m treading a narrow path. As far as Astegal and Carthage are concerned, I\u2019m a young Aragonian widow, an eager opportunist playing at being a double agent. As far as loyal Aragonia is concerned, I\u2019m a spy in Serafin\u2019s service.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBefore this I was eyes and ears, nothing more. Now I\u2019m merely awaiting word on whom, if anyone, to betray. I haven\u2019t been able to get word out to her ladyship since the war began.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Astegal,\u201d I said curtly.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t mind if I confirm that with Sunjata, will you?\u201d Justina rested her chin on one hand, studying me. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll be honest, Leander. You seem . . . odd.\u201d</p> <p>I set down my fork. \u201cOdd how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Justina blinked again. \u201cJust . . . odd.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cOh, hells! Justina, I feel odd. And her highness . . . I assure you, Sidonie de la Courcel is not demure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s barely said a word in public,\u201d she observed. \u201cI assumed she felt too guilty over Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s betrayal of its alliances. Aragonians despise her more than Astegal. Naked ambition, at least, they understand. But when Terre d\u2019Ange was invaded, Aragonia was the only country to send troops to its defense. When our turn came, Terre d\u2019Ange turned its back on us and the D\u2019Angeline heir married our conqueror.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault, any of it. Justina, can you still get access to Astegal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d she said warily. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunjata made a copy of his ring.\u201d I picked up my fork and pointed it at her. \u201cAnd you are perfectly positioned to make the exchange.\u201d</p><p>Justina was silent a moment. \u201cI want to talk to Sunjata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cDo.\u201d</p><p>The interminable days wore onward. Astegal amused himself, Bodeshmun brooded, the Aragonians quietly seethed. Sidonie continued to be withdrawn. Sunjata was close-mouthed about his discussion with Justina, and there was no word from her.</p><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for Kratos, I think I truly might have lost my wits in those days. Like old Carthage, the city had a public bath-house with a palaestra, although it was much smaller. Sunjata refused to take exercise there, as it had been overtaken by bored Carthaginian soldiers given to shouting crudities at him. But Kratos, sensing my rising frustration, decided to teach me to wrestle there.</p><p>It was a good release, although it left me bruised and scraped. At first the soldiers who used the palaestra as a training field were amused. They shouted crudities at me, too, but I didn\u2019t care. And Kratos allowed I was a much better pupil than he\u2019d expected me to be. After a few days\u2019 worth of training bouts, the soldiers weren\u2019t laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quick,\u201d Kratos said after the first time I nearly managed to pin him. \u201cStronger than I would have thought for a wiry fellow. Someone taught you before, eh? It\u2019s coming back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grinned. \u201cQuick, and a quick study, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for word to spread that Kratos had been a professional wrestler in Hellas in his youth. Once it did, a handful of soldiers challenged him to bouts. Kratos permitted himself to accept one a day, and although he must have been well into his fifties, he won with skill and cunning. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what he\u2019d been like in his prime and how he\u2019d come to lose enough matches to fall into penury. When I asked him, he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI got careless after I\u2019d worn a champion\u2019s crown a few years running. Squandered my winnings on women and wine. Let myself get soft.\u201d Kratos dusted his hands. \u201cBy the time I realized it, there was a new generation rising, younger and more fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said honestly.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d He clapped my shoulder. \u201cTake it as a lesson.\u201d</p><p>It was after Kratos had won five or six bouts that Astegal strolled into the palaestra, accompanied by a retinue of Amazigh guards. We watched him spar with his soldiers, laughing and jesting as their blades flashed in the wintry sun. Whatever else was true, the bastard was a gifted swordsman.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d Kratos muttered. \u201cCareless, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d I asked. I might not have been handy with a blade, but I knew enough to know Astegal was very good.</p><p>Kratos jerked his chin. \u201cLetting victory go to his head. He\u2019s won a battle, not a war. He ought to be drilling his troops in the field, not playing cock of the walk in the bath-house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give him any ideas,\u201d I said, and Kratos laughed.</p><p>Someone did give Astegal an idea, though, albeit of a different nature. After sparring for a time, he strolled over to the corner where Kratos and I trained.</p><p>\u201cLeander Maignard,\u201d Astegal said pleasantly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been an absent courtier. I brought you under my roof to entertain my wife, not roll in the dust with an aging Hellene slave.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth and bowed. \u201cKratos is a freedman, and I do but await a summons from your lady wife, my lord. It seems for the moment you\u2019ve kept her well entertained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Astegal smiled, heavy-lidded. \u201cIt does.\u201d He changed the subject. \u201cI wrestled in my youth, freedman,\u201d he said to Kratos. \u201cAnd I hear you\u2019re undefeated among my soldiers. Care to give me a bout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you jest, my lord?\u201d Kratos asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Astegal stripped off his tunic. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Astegal wasn\u2019t boasting; he had considerable skill at the game. And he had twenty years on Kratos and the advantage of reach and leverage. It was a hard-fought bout, but in the end, Astegal won. And he won ugly, wrenching Kratos\u2019 arm behind his back with such force that Kratos cried out in pain. Astegal leaned one forearm on the back of Kratos\u2019 neck, grinding his face into the dust. It was an unnecessary humiliation.</p><p>\u201cDo you concede, freedman?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kratos made a muffled sound of agreement. Astegal released him to the cheers of his men. He gave them a brief bow of acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cCarthage\u2019s supremacy is restored,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>Kratos didn\u2019t say anything then, only got to his feet with an obvious effort, rubbing his wrenched shoulder in pain. Later we had a good, long soak in the caldarium, which Kratos claimed would help the injury heal. We could see Astegal in a private room beyond the caldarium, the doorway guarded by a pair of ever-present and vigilant Amazigh. He was taking a massage, his muscles loose and languid, his eyes closed, his olive skin glistening with oil.</p><p>There was no one else in the pool at the moment. I entertained thoughts of killing him then and there. If I could have devised a plan that didn\u2019t involve me getting spitted on an Amazigh blade, I might have tried it.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Kratos said thoughtfully. \u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s your life\u2019s work to destroy that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The expression on Kratos\u2019 homely face was calm, but there was hatred in his voice. \u201cBecause I would very much like to assist you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Nine</p><p>It was some days before the Longest Night when Justina finally sent for me.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the seven hells took you so long?\u201d I hissed at her when we were alone in her villa. I expected a flare of the temper I remembered in reply, but Justina surprised me.</p><p>\u201cI needed to think,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s a grave danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Sunjata not confirm the truth of all I told you?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>Justina looked at me for a long time. \u201cYes,\u201d she said at length. \u201cYes, he did. But he\u2019s worried that you\u2019re being hasty and careless.\u201d She smiled wryly. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were . . . enamored . . . of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong feelings cloud the wits,\u201d I said, quoting her ladyship. \u201cYes, I know. But a task is a task. And hasty . . . Name of Elua, Justina! The Longest Night is nearly on us. We don\u2019t have forever. Come spring, Astegal will move against Serafin\u2019s rebels, and the opportunity will be lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Justina sighed. \u201cAstegal plans a f\u00eate to honor D\u2019Angeline tradition. I\u2019ve managed to get invited. I\u2019ll approach him then and tell him I\u2019ve been missing him. Beyond that, I can make no promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thanks,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great deal to ask, I know.\u201d</p><p>She gave me another long look. \u201c\u2019Tis an unlikely task. I\u2019d no idea her ladyship had such . . . strong feelings . . . for her estranged son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor does anyone else,\u201d I observed. \u201cHer ladyship is clever enough to use her own reputation and advice against her adversaries. By the Goddess, even Astegal and Bodeshmun think me an ally! Which makes it a perfect gambit, do you not think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Justina mused. \u201cI truly don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll help?\u201d I pressed her.</p><p>She sighed again. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to expect of the Longest Night. In her ladyship\u2019s household on Cythera, we simply celebrated with a masqued ball. I had vague memories of celebrating it in Terre d\u2019Ange as a child. Pine boughs and beeswax candles, snatched sips of joie. I\u2019d been permitted to stay awake long enough to witness the pageant of Winter\u2019s Queen and the Sun Prince the year before we had departed to prepare a household for her ladyship on Cythera. I remembered music and adults glittering in masks. I couldn\u2019t imagine Astegal would seek to re-create it for Sidonie\u2019s sake. Surely there were too many dangerous memories of Terre d\u2019Ange attached to it. He would not take the risk.</p><p>In that, I was right.</p><p>In some ways, it might have been any other night in New Carthage under the rule of Astegal the First. No masks, no pageant. No Sun Prince entering by chariot with his gilded spear to restore light to the world. There was much of what there had been every night at the palace: wine and feasting. All the guests had been carefully selected, so that there were none who would dare strain the fragile veil of illusions that bound Sidonie.</p><p>But there was music.</p><p>And dancing.</p><p>As the Chief Horologist, Bodeshmun himself declared the hour in a deep voice. The balance of the world had tipped, darkness giving way to light. The musicians struck up a measured tune. At the head table, Astegal arose and bowed to Sidonie, extending his hand to her. She rose and took his hand, and they danced together.</p><p>I swallowed bile.</p><p>They looked well together, loath though I was to admit it. Him so dark, and her so fair. She looked smaller in his arms. His hands, possessing her. Resting on her waist, caressing. Her face lifted to his, his head bent over her, solicitous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I whispered, miserable.</p><p>But then there was another tune and another. Others danced. I saw Justina approach Astegal and curtsy, voicing a request. I saw him accept, laughing. White teeth, wagging jaw. A narrow strip of crimson beard. The musicians picked up their pace. Justina glanced at me over Astegal\u2019s shoulder, her eyes flashing.</p><p>I approached her, ignoring the ever-present Amazigh.</p> <p>Sidonie.</p><p>\u201cWill you dance?\u201d I asked simply.</p><p>Her hand slid into mine. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>We fit; we fit so well together, I felt dizzy. Every step she took, I knew before she took it. Her body fit itself to mine. I led her and she followed. Effortless. I wanted to crush her against me. I was fairly trembling with the effort of not doing so.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I whispered hoarsely in her ear. \u201cYou asked me to come here. Why do you disdain me, Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do!\u201d I said in anguish.</p><p>Her head had been bowed, but she lifted it now. Her black eyes met mine. \u201cWhen first we met, I spoke of temptation and its lack. At the time, I spoke honestly. But this . . . \u201d Another shiver ran through her. \u201cI thought it would go away, and it hasn\u2019t. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you why in Carthage,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Sidonie shook her head. \u201cEven if that were true, it doesn\u2019t explain this.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what to say. I couldn\u2019t very well tell her that I reminded her of the love she had forgotten. It would only add another layer of unbelievable madness to my tale, and it wouldn\u2019t advance my cause with her. If I succeeded, she\u2019d remember soon enough. I shifted her hand from my shoulder, laying it on my chest so she could feel my heart beating fast and hard. \u201cMayhap the gods have their reasons.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand away. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make this more difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t shut me out altogether,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The song ended too soon. There was another of Astegal\u2019s hand-picked lords there, Gillimas of Hiram, waiting to claim a dance of her. He was a Guildsman, Sunjata had told me. I\u2019d not had occasion to deal with him. My diplomatic mission had ended in Carthage. So far as anyone here was concerned, I was a lap-dog, a harmless courtier . . . and a failed one, at that.</p><p>But they were satisfied it was because of the spell, because Astegal kept her contented. They were wrong. Although she didn\u2019t understand why, Sidonie was being wary because she did have feelings for me.</p><p>Strong feelings.</p><p>The knowledge filled me with elation. It lent me strength. I made myself play at being a perfect courtier that night. I danced with a good many Carthaginian ladies, and with Justina, who was one of the few Aragonians present\u2014or at least, a seeming Aragonian. She played her part so well I forgot myself.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I asked her, smiling falsely. \u201cAny luck this evening?\u201d</p> <p>Justina laughed as though I\u2019d said somewhat witty. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said, still smiling. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>If the night had ended there, it would have been perfect, or at least as near to it as it could be under the circumstances. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t. After the dancing, Astegal decreed a spectacle, announcing that the Amazigh would perform a ritual for us.</p><p>All of us returned to our seats at the long tables, clearing the floor. Two Amazigh took their places. They bowed to one another, then unwound the lower portions of their head-scarves, rewinding them in such a fashion that their eyes were bound and covered. With that, they drew their blades and commenced to spar.</p><p>What the point of it was, I couldn\u2019t say. A reminder of their skill, I suppose. To be sure, it was an impressive spectacle. Robed and faceless, they hardly looked human. They fought with a sword in the right hand and a dagger in the left, flowing back and forth across the floor. Their blades crossed and clashed, glinting in the light of many lamps and candles.</p><p>At length, one gained the advantage of the other. Feeling the other\u2019s sword-point against his throat, the defeated Amazigh dropped his blade, pressing the palms of his hands together in a curious gesture of surrender. I clapped politely along with everyone else.</p><p>\u201cDo any among you think to best my loyal Amazigh at their game?\u201d Astegal called. There were general utterances of denial. \u201cAh, but someone must try.\u201d He made a show of glancing around the room, his gaze settling on me. \u201cLeander Maignard!\u201d he said brightly. \u201cYou were invited here to provide entertainment. Do so.\u201d</p><p>I spread my hands. \u201cI\u2019m no swordsman, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Astegal laughed. \u201cThat will make it all the more entertaining! Don\u2019t worry, my pretty little friend. My men are skilled; you\u2019ll take no serious hurt.\u201d</p><p>The Carthaginian peers laughed. Even Bodeshmun allowed himself a sour smile. I glanced at Sidonie. She wasn\u2019t amused. If Astegal thought to lessen me in her eyes by humiliating me in public as he\u2019d humiliated Kratos in the palaestra, he was mistaken.</p><p>I rose and bowed. \u201cAs you wish, my lord.\u201d</p><p>One of the Amazigh loaned me his sword and dagger. Someone else bound my eyes with a length of cloth. I stood very still, focusing my breathing. The noise in the great hall was distracting, voices bouncing off the walls. They were making wagers, not on who would win, but how long I would last.</p><p>Strangely, the dual blades in my hands didn\u2019t feel entirely wrong, only . . . unbalanced. The Amazigh sword was heavier than the one I was accustomed to wielding, and it felt mismatched against the dagger.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Astegal shouted.</p><p>I took a silent, sliding step to my left and felt the wind of a blade\u2019s passage where I had been. I\u2019d always been good at her ladyship\u2019s training games. I could navigate the entire villa blindfolded, and I had sharp ears. I concentrated. Beneath the noise of the onlookers, I heard the soft scuff of my opponent\u2019s sandals as he advanced, thinking I\u2019d retreated. I poked him blindly with the tip of my sword, moving farther to the left as I did.</p><p>A great roar went up.</p><p>Circles, I thought. The Amazigh had battled to-and-fro in a straight line. If I could keep circling, I could keep him off guard.</p><p>For a while, it worked. Longer than anyone expected, I daresay. Long enough that the tables were turned, and the crowd began laughing at the sight of the Amazigh spinning, his robes flying as he tried to guess which way I\u2019d gone. I kept my blades crossed before me, concentrating on defending myself.</p><p>But while the Amazigh may have been fierce in battle\u2014who else would devise such a dangerous ritual?\u2014they were patient, too. My opponent stalked me until he began to catch my rhythm. He landed a blow with the edge of his sword on my dagger-hand, scoring a nasty gash and causing me to drop my blade.</p><p>His dagger swept my sword aside. I sensed the blow to follow and whirled away, instinctively taking up my heavy, borrowed sword in a two-handed grip. For a moment, we were both disoriented. The crowd grumbled as the Amazigh resumed his patient stalking.</p><p>I listened for him. This felt right, the sword angled across my body. The memory of Prince Imriel practicing in the garden flashed across my thoughts, watching him move through a fluid series of movements. What do you call it? I\u2019d asked him. Telling the hours. He\u2019d moved in circles. Blood trickled down the back of my left hand, tickling my wrist. I concentrated, trying to remember more.</p><p>I wondered if . . .</p><p>Careless. The Amazigh blade clattered against my sword. I pushed back in a panic and felt the prick of a dagger at my throat as he slipped inside my guard. I dropped my sword and put my hands together in surrender.</p><p>There was good-natured applause as I removed my blindfold. My Amazigh opponent readjusted the folds of his head-scarf. I bowed to him, my palms still pressed together. He returned the bow impassively.</p><p>\u201cWell done!\u201d Astegal chuckled and tossed me a gold coin, as if I were one of his hired performers. \u201cSpinning and dashing like a cornered hare. I\u2019ve never seen the like. You were right, my dear,\u201d he added to Sidonie. \u201cHe is entertaining. I can see why he made you laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her expression was unreadable, but there was somewhat working behind her eyes. Another memory stirred. \u201cThank you, Messire Maignard.\u201d</p><p>I bowed to her. \u201cFor you, your highness, anything.\u201d</p><p>Astegal waved a dismissive hand. \u201cGo, go. Enjoy the revel.\u201d</p><p>I went.</p><p>That night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. Although I\u2019d bound it, the gash on the back of my hand throbbed, keeping me awake. I played out memories of the night over and over in my thoughts. Dancing with Sidonie. The feeling of her in my arms, the inexplicable rightness of it. The duel with the Amazigh. Wondering if by some miracle I might have been able to re-create the elegant, deceptively simple movements I\u2019d seen Prince Imriel perform. Realizing that it was a damned good thing I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Harmless. I had to appear harmless.</p><p>It was all right, I\u2019d put on an amusing spectacle. All that Carthage had seen was a cornered hare\u2014and that\u2019s all I\u2019d been, really. Still, I tried to remember what I knew of the Cassiline Brotherhood.</p><p>Not much, really. Tales from childhood; but the Cassiline Brothers had fallen out of favor not long after I was born. I knew they were stern and celibate, and that they held strange beliefs. That they trained from the age of ten to be the best bodyguards in the world.</p><p>And I knew that Joscelin Verreuil, the consort of Prince Imriel\u2019s foster-mother, had been one such. In Terre d\u2019Ange, he was reckoned a hero. In her ladyship\u2019s household, he was reckoned an almighty irritant. I\u2019d forgotten all about the fact that he was a Cassiline. It must have been he who trained the prince.</p><p>And somewhat about a vigil . . .</p><p>Yes, there had been a vigil. It wasn\u2019t long after her ladyship had arrived on Cythera, where we had assiduously prepared for her. We got word her son the prince had taken sick after kneeling the whole night, the Longest Night, in the bitter cold. I remembered her ladyship being uncommonly distraught, uttering scathing words about the Cassiline Brotherhood in general and Joscelin Verreuil in particular. I remembered my mother commenting that it was likely one of the few things on which her ladyship and Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay might agree.</p><p>At the time, I\u2019d agreed, too. It seemed utter folly.</p><p>Now . . .</p><p>Well, it was folly. But it held a strange, stark appeal. I was a stranger in a strange land, truly and figuratively. I didn\u2019t know if I was D\u2019Angeline or Cytheran. I was in love, and I didn\u2019t know how to love. Blessed Elua did. And the longer I thought on it, the more the notion of laying this burden in his hands, of appearing before him in humility and subjecting myself to his will, appealed to me.</p><p>I rose quietly and dressed in darkness. The door to Sunjata\u2019s chamber was firmly closed. He had been invited to attend the festivities on this night, but he had declined the invitation. I didn\u2019t even know why. We were growing distant to one another, and it saddened me.</p><p>Kratos\u2014Kratos was snoring in his chamber.</p><p>The sound made me smile. I slipped from our quarters into the hallway. It was late and the palace would be locked and guarded for the night. Still, there was an inner courtyard that would suffice.</p><p>Torches were burning low along the corridors. There were guards at every corner, but they let me pass. I was Leander Maignard, harmless. The last one yawned, opening the brass-bound door onto the courtyard. Cool night air washed over my face. Overhead, stars spangled the sky, dimmed by a full moon. In the courtyard, flames danced from four torches arrayed in a square.</p><p>In between them, a figure knelt.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Her back was to me. It didn\u2019t matter. I knew her; I would have known her anywhere. I took a step forward. One of the torches peeled away. Indigo robes, flowing toward me. Intent Amazigh eyes in a narrow strip of visible face.</p><p>\u201cThis is not for you,\u201d he said briefly in Hellene.</p><p>Her bowed head rose and turned. Sidonie gazed over her shoulder at me.</p><p>\u201cIt is a D\u2019Angeline custom,\u201d I said softly. \u201cLike her highness, I do but seek to keep Blessed Elua\u2019s vigil.\u201d</p><p>The guard\u2019s finger wagged. \u201cNot here. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>I looked past him. Torchlight streaked her face. Like me, Sidonie prayed for guidance. She was frightened and confused. I wanted to go to her, wanted to embrace and kiss her. I wanted to tell her everything, and soothe away her fears with truths instead of subtle lies.</p><p>Instead, I bowed to the Amazigh.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for disturbing her highness\u2019 prayers,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI will go elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wise,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cGo, then.\u201d</p><p>I went.</p><p>And with every step I took, I felt her watch me go.</p><p>Fourty</p><p>So it was that I kept Elua\u2019s vigil in my own way. I kept it in the privacy of my bedchamber, kneeling before the narrow slit of a window that illuminated it, my knees aching on the flagstones as I sat on my heels.</p><p>I watched the moon move across the skies and prayed.</p><p>For what? I couldn\u2019t even have said. I just prayed. And somewhere, in the dim hours before dawn, I felt a presence surround me. It settled over me like a cloak of feathers, warm and golden. There was brightness, so much brightness; and somewhat blocking it. A sob caught in my throat, jolting me awake.</p><p>I straightened stiffly.</p><p>\u201cWill you break your fast, Leander?\u201d</p><p>I squinted at Sunjata, leaning on the sill of my window. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He moved away with careless grace. \u201cKeeping watch over you.\u201d</p><p>I broke my fast with bread and honey and strong tea imported from Bhodistan, and told Sunjata most of what had passed on the Longest Night. He listened without comment until I was finished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo she feels it?\u201d</p><p>I drizzled more honey on another piece of bread. Thin loops and coils of gold, sinking into itself. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Justina agreed to exchange the ring?\u201d Sunjata pressed.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I gave him a sharp look. \u201cSunjata, why didn\u2019t you attend last night? It would seem to me a passing good opportunity to forge new connections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYes and no. Whatever connections I make here will be no use to me if you succeed, and if you fail . . . Leander, hear me. This business has me uneasy, and the longer it goes on, the less I like it. If it goes awry . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s naught to implicate you,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I would have thought you of all people would wish to see Carthage brought low.\u201d</p><p>Sunjata gave me a bitter smile. \u201cWill it restore what was taken from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I was silent a moment. \u201cDo as you wish. Go, if you like. There\u2019s naught you can do to aid me here, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sunjata studied me. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName of Elua, man!\u201d My voice rose. \u201cEither tell me why, or stop moping!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhich?\u201d I asked wryly.</p> <p>That, at least, made him laugh. \u201cAh, gods! All right. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>It was passing strange. Justina had said I seemed odd. Well and fine, I hadn\u2019t denied it. I knew full well I\u2019d changed on this journey. But Sunjata was behaving oddly, too. He had almost from the beginning. And I\u2019d no idea why.</p><p>Since there was no merit in worrying about it, I left off. At last, we were getting closer to attaining our goals. Mayhap it made him nervous. Me, it filled with hope.</p><p>I dispatched Kratos to Justina\u2019s villa with the copy of Astegal\u2019s ring. And then, alas, it was back to the agony of waiting. I didn\u2019t know how long it would be before Astegal chose to call on her. Not long, I hoped. He was capable of patience, but he didn\u2019t strike me as a man fond of waiting to take his pleasures in life.</p><p>Gods, I couldn\u2019t think about that.</p><p>A day passed, then two. On the third, there was no word from Justina, but one of Sidonie\u2019s attendants, a Carthaginian girl with a sullen face, brought an invitation to a game of chess. I accepted with alacrity.</p><p>We met in the study of the chambers she shared with Astegal. It made me uncomfortable to see evidence of his presence there\u2014a half-written letter in Punic script, a map depicting the harbor of Am\u00edlcar. And a looming Amazigh guard, of course. That at least I\u2019d expected.</p><p>And Sidonie. She was wearing a gown of deep burgundy red today. The color suited her better than I would have thought.</p> <p>\u201cMessire Maignard,\u201d she said in a measured tone. \u201cThank you for coming on short notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said in surprise. \u201cMy lady, as your husband noted, I have no purpose here but to entertain. Truth be told, I\u2019d rather serve at your whim than his.\u201d I rubbed the back of my bandaged hand. \u201cChess is a bloodless sport.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cWere you badly hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d I glanced at the Amazigh on guard and smiled. He didn\u2019t smile back, at least not that I could tell. \u201cShall we play?\u201d</p><p>The board was set. As before, we sat opposite one another and began a game. For a time, we played in silence. Sidonie played badly from the beginning, and I could tell her thoughts were elsewhere. Ah, gods! I would have given anything for ten minutes alone with her. But no. Justina had the ring; she would have her liaison with Astegal sooner or later, and if she succeeded, the situation would be greatly changed. Now was not the time to take any unnecessary risks.</p><p>So instead I took them on the chess board, playing recklessly and foolishly. She was sufficiently distracted that she missed several opportunities I left her and presented me with unwontedly careless openings.</p><p>\u201cAh, Elua!\u201d Sidonie said in disgust as I took advantage of one such, capturing her second rook. It was the first genuine display of emotion she\u2019d shown that day; one of few since coming to New Carthage. \u201cWhy did I do that?\u201d</p><p>I made as though to tip her king. \u201cShall I or will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She studied the board a moment. \u201cOh, fine. Do it. But I want a rematch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you actually play this time, my lady?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>Sidonie made a face, wrinkling her nose at me. It made her look as young as she was, and it was so uncharacteristic that it made me laugh aloud in delight.</p><p>We played another game, this one more evenly matched. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the guards turning you away the other night in the courtyard,\u201d she said some way into it. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right.\u201d I advanced a pawn. \u201cDid you have a pleasant vigil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell asleep,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>She laughed and moved her knight. \u201cYou\u2019re honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d I said.</p><p>Her quick gaze flicked up at me. There was a question written there. \u201cYes, well, I\u2019m waiting,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s your move, Messire Maignard.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know, my lady. I know.\u201d</p><p>That was all we said of the matter. We both concentrated on our games. It took long enough that I saw the Amazigh\u2019s veil sucked inward in a yawn. In the end, the game was a draw.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Sidonie raised her brows. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>There was a sound in the outer chamber, Astegal returning from wherever he\u2019d been. I heard him exchange a few words in Punic with one of the other Amazigh. Shortly afterward, he entered the study, looking sleek and very pleased with himself.</p><p>I rose and bowed. \u201cWell met, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, young Leander!\u201d Astegal clapped a careless hand on my shoulder. \u201cFulfilling your duties at last, eh?\u201d He moved past me, caressing Sidonie\u2019s cheek. His ring glinted. \u201cI trust he was the perfect courtier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She glanced up at him. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Always and always.</p><p>Astegal gave a less-than-subtle glance at the Amazigh. The swathed face nodded imperceptibly. \u201cGood man, good man!\u201d Astegal smiled at me and made a shooing gesture. \u201cRun along, then.\u201d</p><p>Vowing silently to kill him myself, I returned his smile politely and withdrew.</p><p>When I returned to my own quarters, there was a message from Justina asking me to call on her. Sunjata was there, sorting through new acquisitions and scribbling out a manifest.</p><p>He glanced up as I read the message. \u201cGood news?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cNo news, just a summons. Did her messenger say anything?\u201d</p><p>Sunjata shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Well, I thought, mayhap Justina was being discreet, which was wise. Still, I had a sinking feeling. I\u2019d been with Sidonie all afternoon. If Justina had been with Astegal, if she\u2019d succeeded in exchanging the rings, there should have been some change, some shift.</p><p>There\u2019d been a small one, I supposed. Sidonie had bestirred herself after losing that first game. That lively spark of intelligence that had been burning dangerously low since Astegal had taken her arm on the docks of New Carthage and steered her away had reasserted itself.</p><p>Was it enough?</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel like it.</p><p>So I summoned Kratos to escort me and made my way to Justina\u2019s villa. She was there, awaiting me. As before, she had dismissed her servants. This time, there was no kiss of greeting. Justina was restless and pacing, seeming at odds with herself.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She thrust the suede pouch that contained the ring into my hand.</p><p>\u201cIs it . . . ?\u201d I hesitated.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Justina\u2019s eyes were bright with tears and anger. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, Leander. I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>I closed my hand on the pouch, feeling the hard knot of gold within it bite into my palm. I forced my voice to gentleness. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was scared!\u201d She rubbed impatiently at her eyes. \u201cOh, gods! You don\u2019t know; you have no idea. You\u2019ve been . . . well, no. No, never mind. I have a life and a role here in Aragonia, and I\u2019ve built it very carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said you were poised to tip the balance,\u201d I reminded her. Gently, gently. \u201cWhat for, if not for this moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this!\u201d Her dark eyes blazed. \u201cI\u2019m not some marketplace trickster, skilled at sleight of hand. If you want me to send a covert message to Serafin, yes, I can do that. If you want me to engage Astegal in leading pillow-talk, yes, I can do that, too. There\u2019s a lot I can do. But I tell you, it\u2019s not as easy as you might think to tug a ring from the finger of a man bent on love-making without his noticing! I hoped he\u2019d fall asleep, but he wouldn\u2019t stay. He\u2019s a glutton for pleasure, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lacking in satisfaction where his D\u2019Angeline bride is concerned. And if I\u2019d tried it and he did notice . . . gods, Leander, do you have any idea how many loyal Aragonians would suffer for it if Astegal suspected me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Justina.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t be. Just . . .\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment, then opened them. \u201cWhat if this is all for the best? Do you ever think on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarthage ascendant?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Justina nodded. \u201cDoes it really matter to us?\u201d</p><p>There was so much in the question. We were both prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of her ladyship, awed, admiring, and grateful. And yet we knew her one weakness. Her son, Imriel. I was here because Melisande Shahrizai loved her son. I was here because Ptolemy Solon loved her ladyship. I had assurances from the Council of Thirty that Solon\u2019s goodwill was accepted. Two months ago, this question would have been easy to answer.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>I sat uninvited, bowing my head. \u201cYes. It does to me.\u201d</p><p>She came to stand beside me, stroking my braids. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Justina. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI am sorry. I know . . .\u201d Justina paused. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Not really. But I can\u2019t do this. Not for you, not even for her ladyship. Can you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>I smiled bitterly. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>On that note, I took my leave of Justina, the false copy of Astegal\u2019s ring heavy in my pocket. Kratos walked beside me. They didn\u2019t use palanquins in New Carthage, or not yet, at least. I was glad of it. I took a grim satisfaction in feeling the muscles of my calves laboring as we climbed the hill toward the palace.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Kratos pursed his lips. \u201cThere\u2019s a ring, eh?\u201d</p><p>I shot a sidelong glance at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you overheard, but the less you know, the better for you, my friend.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cFriend, is it? Well, if you care to trust me, I\u2019ve an idea.\u201d</p><p>Overhead, the full moon was waning. I stopped and regarded Kratos. He returned my gaze evenly, his homely features silvered in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I said.</p><p>Kratos did.</p><p>Fourty-One</p><p>All the way back to the palace, I mulled over Kratos\u2019 idea. We didn\u2019t speak of it again until we were safely behind closed doors in my quarters.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge risk,\u201d I said to him. \u201cWhat if she betrays us?\u201d</p><p>Kratos shrugged. \u201cIf I understand rightly, it\u2019s no bigger a risk than you asked the lady Justina to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d need your help. I\u2019d need you to stand guard.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Sunjata blinked at us. \u201cWhat in the world are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I told him about Justina\u2019s refusal, which didn\u2019t surprise him. And then I told him about the idea Kratos had proposed. Sunjata\u2019s dark skin turned ashen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d risk everything to seek the aid of a bath-house attendant?\u201d he asked, aghast.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a better plan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sunjata glanced at Kratos, swallowing hard. \u201cYou\u2019re . . . you\u2019re that sure of the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstegal\u2019s favorite?\u201d Kratos shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure he always chooses the same one. And I\u2019m sure she\u2019d gladly see him and every other Carthaginian on the face of the earth dead. His men are getting bored. And they\u2019re not gentle. They take more than massages.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been back to the palaestra since Astegal had wrestled Kratos, but Kratos himself had continued to take exercise there. I\u2019d given him license, since we were all suffering from inaction and there was always the hope he\u2019d pick up some useful piece of gossip. I\u2019d known Astegal had been going more regularly and training with his men. I hadn\u2019t known he had a favorite attendant.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t known his soldiers were abusing the attendants, either. Not a surprise, I supposed. Still, it made me angry.</p><p>\u201cDoes she hate him enough to take such a risk?\u201d Sunjata was asking.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been forced to play the whore for a large group of increasingly bored soldiers?\u201d Kratos asked laconically. \u201cRisk, risk, risk. That\u2019s all I ever hear any of you talk about. Mayhap it\u2019s time to quit talking and take one.\u201d</p><p>I made my decision. \u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Sunjata looked at me, then looked away. \u201cLeander . . . don\u2019t take this amiss. I disagree with this choice. And I don\u2019t think we should both risk being exposed. With your permission, I\u2019d like to borrow Captain Deimos and your ship to run a load of cargo to Carthage.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI was thinking of asking anyway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need my permission,\u201d I said. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at me, his expression softening. \u201cI\u2019ll return in a week\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p> <p>So the matter was decided. Sunjata made his preparations to travel. Kratos haunted the bath-house, observing the daily movements of Astegal\u2019s favorite attendant. And I tormented myself with second-guesses, trying to think of another way.</p><p>The problem was, there wasn\u2019t one. Right now, everything hung in stasis. New Carthage\u2019s port was closed to foreign trade under Astegal\u2019s orders and we weren\u2019t getting news from elsewhere. Insofar as I knew, the game that Carthage had set in motion was at a stalemate, albeit a temporary one.</p><p>And it wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><p>We waited until Sunjata\u2019s ship had sailed. I didn\u2019t blame him for wanting to be gone when this took place. As Justina had noted, the Aragonians hated D\u2019Angelines almost more than Carthaginians. The girl at the bath-house might agree to aid us. She might refuse. Or she might say anything we wanted to hear, and then betray us.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances, the bath-house would close its doors for some hours overnight, opening at dawn. In occupied New Carthage, it never closed. There were soldiers who had taken up permanent residence there. Still, Kratos had noted that it was at its quietest in the hours before dawn when the attendants crept about the place, trying to clean and tidy it.</p> <p>\u201cThey must have had pride in their work once,\u201d he\u2019d observed.</p><p>It was still dark when we left the palace. By the time we reached the bath-house, there was merely the faintest suggestion of charcoal-grey in the eastern sky. Our footsteps echoed slightly in the marble halls. All the lamps were burning low. Here and there, soldiers slept, snoring. The pool-rooms were empty and unlit, dark water shimmering eerily.</p><p>Kratos led me directly to the girl. She was in the chamber where I\u2019d seen Astegal taking a massage, carefully filling small flasks of scented oil from a large jug. Another woman was with her, neatly folding clean linen towels. Both of them jumped when they saw us.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Kratos said to the second woman, jerking his thumb at the door. He didn\u2019t speak Aragonian and she didn\u2019t speak Hellene, but his meaning was clear enough. She gave us a glance filled with contempt, but she went.</p><p>\u201cWhere do they take them?\u201d I asked Kratos.</p><p>He pointed at a storage closet with a slatted wooden door.</p> <p>I grabbed the girl\u2019s arm and dragged her into the closet. She went without protesting, though I could feel her reluctance. Inside, I pressed her up against the shelves and put my hand over her mouth. Her face was striped with dim light filtering through the slatted door, and I could see the glaring hatred in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d I said in a low voice. \u201cTerre d\u2019Ange did not betray Aragonia willingly. There are dark magics at work here. You have a chance to help us undo them. Will you hear?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she nodded.</p><p>I took my hand away and fetched the suede pouch from my pocket. I showed the ring to her. \u201cHave you seen this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstegal wears it,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cHe wears one like it. It is one of the sources of his power.\u201d I\u2019d thought it wiser not to try to explain further. \u201cEvery time he comes here, he takes a massage from you. Do you think you could exchange the rings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gave me a calculating stare. \u201cI want money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cEnough to leave this place until the soldiers are gone,\u201d she said. \u201cTen gold doubloons.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDone. You\u2019ll get it when I get Astegal\u2019s ring.\u201d</p><p>A look of world-weary cynicism settled over her face. \u201cYou\u2019ll cheat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold out your hand,\u201d I said. She obeyed cautiously. I put the ring in her palm and closed her fingers over it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>She looked wary. \u201cEsme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEsme,\u201d I echoed. \u201cEsme, you\u2019re holding my life in your hand. If you choose not to trust me, show this to Astegal and tell him what I asked of you. He will have me tortured and killed. He will likely reward you, mayhap with more than ten gold coins. And Aragonia will lay beneath Carthage\u2019s yolk for the next hundred years, with Terre d\u2019Ange and other nations like to follow. If you believe nothing else in your life, believe this. I will not cheat you.\u201d</p><p>Her hand clenched on the ring. \u201cThis will weaken him? You swear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the name of Blessed Elua and his Companions, I do,\u201d I said.</p><p>Esme gave a sharp nod. \u201cI will do it.\u201d</p><p>I touched her cheek lightly. \u201cBe careful, Esme. May Blessed Elua hold you in his hand and keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>So it was done.</p><p>I left the bath-house in a strange state of heightened awareness, Kratos at my side. Either I\u2019d just advanced a pawn in the deadliest game I\u2019d ever played in my life, or I\u2019d sealed my own fate along with Kratos\u2019 and the girl\u2019s. It was a terrifying sensation. Oddly, it was an enlivening one, too. The sun was rising and the light felt brighter and clearer than I remembered. This, I thought, was what it was like to play the game as her ladyship played it. At the highest possible levels, with the greatest possible stakes.</p><p>And with fearful repercussions for innocent lives.</p><p>I will own, that part troubled me more than I liked to admit.</p><p>Kratos read the thought in my face. \u201cShe\u2019s been around those men day in and out, my lord. She knows the risk as well as you do. Mayhap better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He laid a hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thanks.\u201d I laughed. \u201cGods, Kratos! You were the best purchase I ever made in my life.\u201d</p><p>He smiled wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd compliment, but I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>It was another piece of irony in an affair fraught with it. I\u2019d arrived in New Carthage with one highly trained ally at my side. I\u2019d thought I\u2019d stumbled over a piece of great good fortune to find another in place, poised to do exactly what needed to be done. But for all the Guild training and skills her ladyship had imparted to her people, my fate now hinged on an idea conceived by an aging wrestler and executed by a young bath-house attendant.</p><p>I wished I were better at praying.</p><p>We wandered the streets of New Carthage for a time, buying spicy sausage pastries in the market once it opened. They were hot enough to burn my fingers and scald the roof of my mouth. I ate slowly, savoring the taste. If Esme betrayed us, it might be the last meal I enjoyed. And if she failed and was caught . . . well, I\u2019d have to confess. There was nothing else for it. If the girl didn\u2019t confess my role immediately, Astegal would have her tortured until she did. I would take the blame on myself, claim to have threatened her. Claim that Kratos had obeyed me with no knowledge of my plans. Mayhap Astegal would be merciful.</p><p>Although I doubted it.</p><p>After eating, we returned to the palace. Bodeshmun passed us in the great hall. He actually gave me a curt nod of acknowledgment. Astegal, hells! I hoped Bodeshmun would be merciful. Ptolemy Solon had told me what the man had done to create his demon-stone. He\u2019d slit open an infant\u2019s belly and stuck a gem inside it, managed to keep the babe alive long enough for a demon to devour it. I suspected the Chief Horologist was a fellow who knew a thing or two about inflicting hideous torment.</p><p>Astegal didn\u2019t go to the bath-house that day. The next, he spent most of the day closeted with Bodeshmun and other trusted advisers. I knew, because Sidonie told me when she invited me to call on her for another game.</p><p>\u201cAre they nearing terms for a full surrender?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>\u201cNo, I fear not.\u201d She frowned at the board. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with some grievance of King Roderico\u2019s. Astegal says he\u2019s addled. I met him when we arrived and he didn\u2019t seem addled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt this has been a trying time for him,\u201d I said diplomatically.</p><p>Sidonie captured one of my pawns. \u201cWell, I wish Astegal would permit me to join his conferences. Wait, wait, he keeps telling me. For what?\u201d She gave me a level look. \u201cI\u2019m perishing sick of waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience is a virtue worth striving for, my lady,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure your husband knows what he\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope to Blessed Elua someone does,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>To that, I made no reply. Since no one had come to take me away in chains, it seemed that for the moment, Esme had not decided to betray me, for which I was profoundly grateful. It might still happen, or like Justina, she might simply lose her nerve. But the thought had struck me that if she tried and failed, this might be the last time I saw Sidonie.</p><p>The notion was so ungodly painful, I felt unexpected tears sting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Leander?\u201d Sidonie asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d I forced my voice to lightness. \u201cYour beauty dazzles, your highness. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at me a moment, then shook her head. \u201cSome days I think everyone here is addled but me.\u201d</p><p>We played out our game, which I lost. I wished I could make the time last forever, slow the passage of the sun in the sky. But in time I had to take my leave of her. I went with a heavy heart and slow steps.</p><p>The next day, all hell broke loose.</p><p>Kratos and I were both losing our wits with the suspense of waiting. He went to the bath-house to seek a bout to distract himself. I went to the market, having conceived the notion of purchasing some romantic token for Sidonie that I could leave in my things to be found if matters went awry. At a bookseller\u2019s, I found an Aragonian translation of a famous correspondence between a pair of star-crossed D\u2019Angeline lovers. I\u2019d not actually heard of it, but the bookseller assured me it was a popular gift among courting couples.</p><p>At any rate, he was eager to make a sale, eager enough that he treated me with more courtesy than most Aragonians I\u2019d encountered in New Carthage, and eager enough that he gave me a good price. I daresay Astegal\u2019s men weren\u2019t doing much to keep the fellow in business.</p><p>So I bought the book, and then spent another hour wandering the streets and pondering what inscription I would write.</p><p>I returned to the palace to find it in an uproar.</p><p>Astegal was in a fury, shouting at Bodeshmun in the great hall. The Chief Horologist stood with folded arms and bore it, but his deep-set eyes glittered with rage of his own.</p><p>\u201cI did my part,\u201d Bodeshmun said ominously when Astegal finally paused to draw breath. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you forbid her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she was compliant!\u201d Astegal roared at him.</p><p>There was a considerable crowd gathered. I spotted Kratos\u2019 hulking form and made my way to his side. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a sidelong glance. \u201cSeems a short time ago, the princess took it in her head to go call on King Roderico.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014precious Amazigh should have stopped her!\u201d Bodeshmun retorted.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not\u2014\u201d Astegal gritted his teeth. \u201cNo mind. The damage is done. And you\u201d\u2014 he pointed at Bodeshmun\u2014\u201cyou need to trot over there and fetch her back before it worsens, cousin.\u201d</p><p>Bodeshmun went still. \u201cDo not speak to me thusly, cousin.\u201d</p><p>Astegal took a step toward him. \u201cI\u2019ll speak as I please.\u201d</p><p>They were both big men, both dangerous men in different ways. We all went quiet as they faced off against one another. Astegal\u2019s face was suffused with blood, his handsome features distorted. His hand hovered over his sword. Bodeshmun radiated dark, brooding rage. If Astegal moved against him, I thought, he\u2019d best kill him quickly. Because if he didn\u2019t, Bodeshmun would make him suffer. I didn\u2019t know how, but I knew it would be unpleasant.</p><p>A faint voice broke the tension. \u201cMy lords, why do you quarrel?\u201d</p><p>Astegal whirled. \u201cSidonie!\u201d</p><p>She stood in the entrance to the great hall, four Amazigh flanking her. Her face was very pale, and she was unsteady on her feet. \u201cIs somewhat amiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Astegal strode to her side, the crowd parting for him. \u201cI was frightened for you,\u201d he said, cupping her face. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that. I keep telling you, it isn\u2019t safe yet. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shivered. \u201cNo.\u201d She fixed her gaze on his face. Her eyes were like pools of darkness, wide and fearful. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Astegal, you were right. Roderico\u2019s mad. He said things, terrible things . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d Astegal unclasped his purple cloak and slid it solicitously over her shoulders. \u201cI know. I kept trying to tell you. I\u2019m sorry, my dear. I was trying to spare you that ugliness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She shivered again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have trusted you. I think . . . I think I would like to lie down. I haven\u2019t felt quite myself since the sunstroke. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>She was lying.</p><p>She was lying, and she was doing it so damnably well that I wanted to cheer and shower her with flowers. Oh, she was frightened and shaken, that was no act. And there was nothing she was doing to give herself away, not even anything a trained Guildsman could spot. But I could tell. I knew her.</p><p>Astegal steered her through the crowd, his hands on her shoulders. The Amazigh guards trailed behind them, looking as crestfallen as veiled warriors could under Bodeshmun\u2019s withering glare. When their procession passed me, I bowed.</p><p>\u201cMessire Maignard.\u201d Sidonie paused long enough to give me a tremulous smile. \u201cYou were kind to me before when I was ill. Mayhap when I feel stronger, we\u2019ll have another game. It seems chess calms my nerves.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Behind her, Astegal gave me a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I inclined my head. \u201cAs always, your highness, I am at your disposal.\u201d Once again, I forced myself to adopt a tone of levity. \u201cI shall hope and pray for your restored health, my lady. In the parlance of chess, I shall await your move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Fourty-Two</p> <p>\u201cHere you are, my lord.\u201d Kratos dropped the ring into my hand.</p><p>I examined it. A simple band, a gold knot. To all intents and purposes, it was identical to the ring Sunjata had created. For all I knew, it was the same ring. I hadn\u2019t dared set any distinguishing mark on the copy. I slid the ring onto the fourth finger of my right hand. It fit very well.</p><p>\u201cSo Esme succeeded?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Kratos chuckled. \u201cAh, the lass was brilliant! Yon Astegal does love to be cozened and pampered. She oiled him and worked him down to his fingertips.\u201d He kissed the tips of his own fingers. \u201cThe ring slid loose like a charm. I could see it all from the caldarium. You remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I said briefly.</p> <p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d Kratos smiled broadly. \u201cIt fell to the floor and bounced. Ch-chink, ch-chink! Our Esme scrambled after it in a panic. Astegal hadn\u2019t even begun to worry before she shoved the copy on his finger, babbling apologies. I watched. She retrieved his ring later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d I raised my right hand.</p><p>Kratos nodded. \u201cThat. So what happens now, my lord?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, we wait. I need to speak to Sidonie alone, and that\u2019s the one thing I can\u2019t fathom how to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and getting Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman,\u201d Kratos observed. Over the past days, I\u2019d taken him fully into my confidence and told him everything. \u201cIs he really as dangerous as all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPtolemy Solon thought so,\u201d I said, removing the ring and stashing it in the trunk with the false bottom. \u201cAnd so did Sunjata.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d</p><p>On that score, Kratos was wrong. The following morning, Astegal summoned Roderico de Aragon and his entourage to the great hall. The elderly former king struck a tragic, forlorn figure, standing with the remnants of his court in his former palace while Astegal paced back and forth like an angry lion. Bodeshmun stood behind him, silent.</p><p>\u201cMy wishes were clear,\u201d Astegal said. \u201cNo one was to give audience to my wife without my express permission. You defied me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange,\u201d Roderico said with dignity. \u201cWas I to refuse her when she was at my doorstep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Astegal said. \u201cYou told her lies that upset her. Last night, she could find no peace without the aid of a sleeping draught. Even now, she is too ill to rise.\u201d</p><p>Roderico\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cI told her no lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is what I say it is.\u201d Astegal\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cCarthage and Terre d\u2019Ange have always been allies. Aragonia provoked this war by permitting its fleet to prey unchecked on Carthaginian trade-ships. That is the truth, and from this moment onward, any man or woman who claims otherwise is guilty of treason. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>The former king didn\u2019t answer. One of the members of his entourage, a young man who couldn\u2019t have been much past his majority, muttered an expletive.</p> <p>\u201cYou!\u201d Astegal snapped. \u201cCome here.\u201d After a moment\u2019s hesitation, the young lord obeyed. Astegal surveyed him. \u201cThere are rumors circulating that Carthage is capable of wielding dire magics. Observe and learn fear.\u201d</p><p>He beckoned to Bodeshmun, who stepped forward. The young Aragonian stared at the Chief Horologist with hatred, a muscle jumping in his cheek. Bodeshmun raised one hand, palm upward, until it was level with the man\u2019s face. He blew out his breath gently over his palm. A brief puff of dust arose.</p><p>The young Aragonian gasped. One gasp, no more. His hands rose frantically to scrabble at his throat. His face worked. Not a sound emerged from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Roderico said sharply. \u201cIt shall be as you say. Spare the lad.\u201d</p><p>Astegal folded his arms. \u201cWhat is done cannot be undone. If you wish others to be spared this fate, remember this moment.\u201d</p><p>It was an awful thing. The great hall was filled with onlookers. Astegal meant this event to be witnessed. And in front of all of us, the young Aragonian lord slowly choked to death for no apparent cause. His face turned dark and his eyes bulged. It was a mercy when he finally sank to the floor. Several members of Roderico\u2019s entourage were weeping audibly, and silent tears ran down the former king\u2019s creased face.</p><p>\u201cIs it understood?\u201d Astegal repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Roderico\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cThe truth is whatever you say it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Astegal nodded. \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p><p>They went.</p><p>I let out a breath I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been holding. Kratos and I exchanged a glance. Well, that was one question asked and answered. Yes, Bodeshmun was that dangerous.</p><p>The memory of it made my skin crawl. There was no word from Sidonie, so Kratos and I proceeded to the bath-house. We engaged in a few training bouts, which left me bone-jarred and bruised. It didn\u2019t erase the memory of the Aragonian\u2019s strangled face, but it helped a bit. Afterward, I went to soak in the caldarium while Kratos accepted one of his friendly wagers.</p><p>There, I managed to spot Esme and catch her eye. She pointed to the table in her chamber. I nodded and emerged dripping from the bath. No one was around at the moment; the idle soldiers were cheering on their comrade in his bout against Kratos. I went to fetch the purse I\u2019d hidden in my things.</p><p>Esme gave me a startled look when I handed it to her. It was heavier than she\u2019d expected. I\u2019d doubled the amount.</p><p>\u201cYou did well,\u201d I said.</p><p>She tucked the purse away quickly. \u201cLay down. I\u2019ll massage you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cBetter if you\u2019re not seen with me. Vanish well and be safe until this passes, Esme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pray it\u2019s soon,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>As matters transpired, it was soon, at least where Esme was concerned. By the time Kratos and I returned to the palace, there was a whole new uproar in progress. Astegal and his councilors were closeted away once more and the place was abuzz with gossip.</p><p>\u201cWhat passes?\u201d I asked one of the guards I knew by sight.</p><p>His face was grim. \u201cWe\u2019ve had ships lying off the harbor at Am\u00edlcar. One of them intercepted an Aragonian ship bound for Terre d\u2019Ange. Serafin\u2019s pleading for aid from the D\u2019Angeline fleet.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cTrying to trade on their old alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the D\u2019Angeline fleet was incapacitated,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot the bulk of it,\u201d he said glumly. \u201cLooks as though we\u2019ll be fighting a winter war after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard luck,\u201d I said.</p><p>The guard shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a soldier\u2019s lot.\u201d</p><p>Better than a bath-house attendant\u2019s lot, I thought, but I kept my mouth shut. This particular guard seemed a decent enough fellow. Inwardly, I was pleased. If Astegal pulled his army out of New Carthage, the task of gaining access to Sidonie seemed marginally less insurmountable.</p><p>Things were finally beginning to move.</p><p>Fourty-Three</p><p>Once things began to move, they moved quickly indeed. By the time Sunjata returned from old Carthage, he was astonished at all that had transpired in his absence. Astegal might have enjoyed playing cock of the walk and being pampered, but when he moved, he moved swiftly and decisively.</p><p>Everywhere, plans were afoot. A small standing army would be left under Lord Gillimas\u2019 command to guard New Carthage. Bodeshmun would be in charge of administering the city and the surrounding areas, and after his display in the great hall, I doubted there would be much in the way of an insurrection.</p><p>Most of the Carthaginian fleet would be moved to blockade the harbor of Am\u00edlcar, leaving a handful behind to secure the harbor here. After studying the city\u2019s defenses, Astegal had determined that it would be best assailed by land. He himself would command the siege.</p><p>Well and good, I thought. Go. Go far, far away, Astegal.</p><p>Of all the events that had transpired, the one that astonished Sunjata the most was that Esme had succeeded in procuring Astegal\u2019s ring.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he said. \u201cDid it have an effect?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie had sent for me the day after Bodeshmun had killed the young Aragonian with a single breath, although of course the knowledge of that event had been kept from her. I\u2019d found her pale and guarded. I\u2019d brought the book of love letters with me and presented it to her as a gift. She\u2019d gazed at it for a long time, her brows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cI know this correspondence,\u201d she murmured at length. \u201cSomehow. Thank you; it will be a pleasure to read the Aragonian translation.\u201d</p><p>I bowed. \u201cI hope it may provide solace in your husband\u2019s absence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s absence.\u201d She raised her gaze to meet mine. The fear and uncertainty in her eyes had doubled. Underneath it was a terrified determination that nearly broke my heart. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>We had played our usual game. At first, I\u2019d thought that Sidonie was playing badly, walking into a rather obvious trap I\u2019d set. Then I felt the pressure of her foot against mine beneath the table as she studied the board.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a very precarious situation here, aren\u2019t I, Messire Maignard?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>I moved a piece, returning the unseen pressure. \u201cIndeed, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Her hand hovered over her queen. \u201cI confess, I don\u2019t fully understand what it is that you\u2019ve done. Will you be gallant enough to advise me?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI cannot divulge my secrets.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s head moved imperceptibly in the direction of the Amazigh guard. I gave the briefest possible nod. The guard stared past us, bored half out of his wits. I\u2019d wager they drew straws to avoid this posting.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cMayhap I\u2019ll find a way to make you talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap you will,\u201d I said. \u201cBut not today.\u201d</p><p>That was all, but it was enough. She knew. She knew something was very, very wrong. Bodeshmun\u2019s spell had been weakened. And Sidonie de la Courcel, terrified and uncertain, was nonetheless playing a cautious and meticulous game of her own.</p><p>It was hard, so damnably hard, not to be able to tell her.</p><p>Elua, she had courage! I broke into a cold sweat conversing under the Amazigh\u2019s bored gaze. How much worse must it be for Sidonie? She knew, but she didn\u2019t know. Missing memories, false memories. At least I had the surety of my own wits and a loyal ally or two.</p><p>Sidonie was all alone.</p><p>I didn\u2019t see her again until after the majority of the Carthaginian fleet had set sail and Astegal departed with the army.</p><p>The latter was an affair rife with pageantry. It was a vast army. Most of his troops were Carthaginian, but there was a sizable contingent of Nubian mercenaries with striking zebra-hide shields and long spears, and a mounted company of robed Amazigh. We assembled outside the gates of the city to see them off.</p><p>\u201cBastards,\u201d Kratos muttered.</p><p>The ceremony began with the sacrifice of a white heifer, a singularly gory and unpleasant ritual. Once the poor beast\u2019s struggles had ceased, the priests slit its belly and withdrew the steaming entrails for inspection. They pronounced the augurs to be good and invoked the blessings of Tanit and Ba\u2019al Hammon on the venture.</p><p>Astegal gave a stirring speech full of lies about the glorious era of peace and prosperity that would follow on the heels of Carthage\u2019s victory. His voice carried well, and the army cheered. Clad in gilded armor, he looked every inch the heroic general. Sidonie stood beside him, blank-faced as a doll. Astegal didn\u2019t care. He swept her into his arms and kissed her farewell, proclaiming the hope that he would return victorious to news that she was providing him with an heir to the vast new empire of Carthage. There were more cheers and long blasts on the trumpets.</p><p>Then he turned her over to Bodeshmun, who made a speech declaring that the Princess Sidonie and New Carthage alike were under his protection. When it was finished, Astegal mounted his horse and drew his sword.</p><p>\u201cOnward, Carthage!\u201d he shouted. \u201cOnward to victory!\u201d</p><p>The army roared its approval, soldiers beating their shields and stamping their feet, trumpets blaring. Astegal nudged his mount, and they were off, rank upon rank of soldiers falling in behind him, supply wagons groaning. It was a long time before the last column passed us.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cGood riddance.\u201d</p><p>Without an entire occupying army, New Carthage seemed much emptier than before. We returned with the remnants of the procession that had accompanied Astegal to the gates. On every street, Aragonians stared at us with bitter hatred, but it was hatred tempered by fear. Not a one of them dared speak. Perversely, I found myself glad for the presence of Bodeshmun and the remaining forces. I didn\u2019t doubt but that every man and woman we passed would gladly see all of us dead.</p><p>In that, I was more than right.</p><p>On the morrow, I received a message from Sidonie inviting me to accompany her on a stroll in the gardens. I met her at the appointed hour. It was an incongruous sight, the D\u2019Angeline princess surrounded by four veiled Amazigh.</p><p>\u201cYou look well, your highness,\u201d I greeted her. \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d It was true: she didn\u2019t look quite as pale. \u201cI thought the fresh air might help clear my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>The gardens surrounding the palace were actually quite lovely and extensive. We strolled through them, passing lemon and orange groves, eucalyptus trees, and others I couldn\u2019t name. Here and there, we passed Aragonian gardeners at work, pruning the trees and culling weeds. Like the bath-house attendants, I thought, they must have taken pride in their work once. Now they merely looked sullen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything is so green,\u201d Sidonie observed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouthern climes,\u201d I said. \u201cOn Cythera, the first orchids will be blooming soon.\u201d</p><p>We continued for some time in this vein, exchanging meaningless pleasantries. Bit by bit, Sidonie\u2019s pace increased, until we were walking quite briskly. I realized she was trying to put some distance between us and her guards.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t work. The Amazigh quickened their own pace, trailing behind us like so many indigo spectres. Sidonie gave an imperceptible shrug and slowed.</p><p>\u201cMayhap we might sit for a moment,\u201d I suggested, nodding at a marble bench beside a fountain in the shape of a fish spewing water. I was hoping that the sound of splashing water might provide some cover.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough to drown out our conversation. Gods, this was ridiculously frustrating! After a few more moments of inane talk, Sidonie sighed. \u201cThank you, Leander, you\u2019ve been very patient. Mayhap I should return.\u201d</p><p>I rose and bowed. \u201cOf course, my lady. You shouldn\u2019t tire yourself.\u201d</p><p>We returned the way we\u2019d come. And what happened next, I couldn\u2019t have said for the life of me how I knew. A lifetime of training to be observant, I suppose. It was the second gardener we encountered, one we\u2019d passed before. This time it was different. Somewhat about him, the way he peered furtively at us as we approached. The way his hands slid and twisted on the pruning shears he held. The way he collected himself and set his shoulders. It wasn\u2019t until we\u2019d actually passed him that it all came together in my mind. I glanced over my shoulder.</p> <p>Between two of the Amazigh, there was the gardener behind us. He held the blades of his pruning shears by the tip, poised for the throw. His arm shot forward. Metal flashed.</p><p>\u201cElua, no!\u201d</p><p>I flung myself on Sidonie without thinking, my weight bringing both of us crashing to the earth. Somewhat sharp stung my scalp as we fell. I landed hard atop her, driving the breath from her lungs. Her startled eyes stared into mine. Wet warmth trickled though my hair. Behind us, there were shouts of alarm and fury.</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>The feeling of her body beneath mine.</p><p>Neither of us moved.</p> <p>And then strong hands yanked me off her, pulled me upright. The Amazigh surrounded us, asking questions in a garbled panic. Behind them, the gardener\u2019s body was slumped on the ground. His head was a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice shook. \u201cThat man\u2014why?\u201d</p><p>They exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said. My heart was racing, and I couldn\u2019t tell if it was fear or the sudden shock of desire. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, love. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>She searched my face. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>I touched the back of my head. My fingers came away bloody, but not terribly so. \u201cIt\u2019s just a nick. Scalp wounds bleed a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried . . .\u201d Sidonie swallowed. \u201cOh, gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I rounded on the Amazigh. \u201cName of Elua! Why did you kill him? You should have taken him alive to be questioned!\u201d</p> <p>One of them shrugged. \u201cDesert justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesert idiocy, more like!\u201d I wrestled my temper under control. \u201cNo mind. Let\u2019s just get the princess safely back to the palace. Now.\u201d</p><p>The Amazigh formed a tight square around us. Sidonie clung to my arm, holding it pressed hard against her. I could feel her trembling. This time, I didn\u2019t think it was feigned, not in the least. Oh, gods, that had been a near thing! Fury and terror and tenderness broke over me in waves.</p><p>I loved her.</p><p>I loved her so much.</p><p>And I\u2019d nearly lost her.</p><p>Pandemonium broke loose the minute we entered the palace. One of the guards was dispatched at a run to fetch Bodeshmun, who came with alacrity, his black robes swirling around him.</p><p>\u201cAre you harmed, your highness?\u201d he asked Sidonie grimly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her nails bit into my forearm. \u201cLeander saved me. He\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscort her highness to her quarters,\u201d Bodeshmun said to the Amazigh. \u201cSend for the physician. After he\u2019s examined her, have him report to me.\u201d To me, he said, \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>I accompanied him to his quarters. There, Bodeshmun bade me sit and tell him all that had transpired. He listened intently, nodding into his black beard.</p><p>\u201cIdiots,\u201d he said when I told him the Amazigh had killed the gardener. \u201cThey\u2019re fierce and loyal enough, but they\u2019ve no head for intrigue.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll have every Aragonian attendant on the palace rounded up for questioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said, angry enough to mean it. \u201cWhy do they blame her? Surely they must know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bodeshmun interrupted me. \u201cNo, they don\u2019t, young Maignard. They may suspect something amiss, but they do not know it. Not for a surety. And I\u2019d prefer to keep it thusly. Folk are a good deal easier to control when their anger is scattered and misplaced.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did well out there.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cHow did you know? How did you notice what trained warriors failed to observe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarriors are trained to fight,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m trained to observe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Bodeshmun gave a thin smile. \u201cThe Guild\u2019s infamous arts of covertcy. Well, it was well done.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head. \u201cMy thanks, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The Carthaginian physician arrived in short order. He reported that Sidonie was unharmed, but distraught in the extreme, demanding that Astegal and the army be returned to protect her.</p><p>Bodeshmun snorted. \u201cGive her a sleeping draught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d the physician said. \u201cShe refused.\u201d</p><p>The Chief Horologist waved a dismissive hand. \u201cSee to this young man\u2019s head and try again. Tell her if she\u2019s breeding, she needs to rest for the child\u2019s sake. There is a good chance of it, is there not?\u201d</p><p>The physician bowed. \u201c\u2019Tis too early to tell, my lord. But her highness\u2019 weariness and distress augur well for it.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, tasting bile.</p><p>I took my leave of Bodeshmun and went with the physician, whose name was Girom, to his quarters. There, he undid my braids and cleaned the wound, swabbing it with something that stung like hell, then closed it with two stitches using a needle and waxed silk thread, which also stung like hell.</p><p>Once it was done, Girom dismissed me. I returned to my quarters and washed the drying blood out of my hair in the basin, telling Kratos and a wide-eyed Sunjata what had transpired.</p><p>\u201cName of Elua!\u201d I said in disgust. \u201cSidonie\u2019s as much a victim in this as any bath-house attendant. What are they thinking?\u201d</p><p>Sunjata shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking they saw her kiss General Astegal farewell outside the gates of the city before he rode off to conquer the rest of Aragonia. What else?\u201d</p><p>I yanked a comb through my damp hair. \u201cWe need to speak to Justina. If this is part of a larger conspiracy, she may be able to find out. She can help spread the word covertly that Sidonie\u2019s no more to be blamed than\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the outer door that made all three of us startle and fall silent. Kratos went to answer it.</p><p>\u201cMy lord Maignard.\u201d It was Girom, the physician. He looked harried. \u201cForgive me, but I require your assistance. Her highness has consented to take a sleeping draught if you will sit at her side until she sleeps.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cIt seems she feels you are the only one to protect her in General Astegal\u2019s absence. My lord Bodeshmun has consented.\u201d</p><p>Oh, clever girl.</p><p>I rose. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll come immediately.\u201d</p><p>Fourty-Four</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>An earthenware cup shattered against the wall of the bedchamber. One of the Amazigh dodged flying shards. Girom the physician raised his hands pleadingly. \u201cMy lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of you, out!\u201d Sidonie said in a perfect fury, pacing. She was wrapped in a dressing-robe, clutching it to her. Her hair was loose and unbound, falling over her shoulders. Her face was stark white, save for two spots of hectic color on her cheekbones. \u201cEveryone but Leander! You\u2019re worthless, all of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d Girom gestured to the Amazigh.</p><p>Sidonie pointed at the physician. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he said in a soothing voice. \u201cAs I promised, once you drink the sleeping draught.\u201d</p><p>Her breast rose and fell with sharp breaths. \u201cYou\u2019ll go, then? You\u2019ll go if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I promised,\u201d Girom repeated.</p><p>\u201cI want him to stay.\u201d Sidonie pointed at me. \u201cI want Leander to stay until I fall asleep. And then I want him to keep watch outside my door. He saved my life, and you won\u2019t bring me Astegal.\u201d</p><p>The physician sighed. \u201cDrink your draught, your highness.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie fixed her gaze on me. \u201cYou won\u2019t leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear it,\u201d I said to her. \u201cI\u2019ll stay at your side until you sleep, and then I\u2019ll guard your door until you wake. No one will pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll go if I do?\u201d she asked Girom.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cPlease, your highness. It\u2019s for your own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Sidonie picked up another cup from her night-stand, this one brimming with dark liquid. Her hands shook and the liquid trembled. She eyed Girom with suspicion. \u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, your highness!\u201d he said in frustration. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>She drank. \u201cThere. Now go.\u201d</p><p>Girom heaved another sigh, this one filled with relief. I didn\u2019t envy him. \u201cThank you, my lady,\u201d he said to her. \u201cNow lie down and rest. Leander will stay by your side. It\u2019s a potent draught; it will take effect swiftly.\u201d</p><p>She sat obediently on her bed. \u201cAll right. Go away now.\u201d</p><p>He backed through the door, closing it behind him.</p><p>We were alone.</p><p>Sidonie buried her face in her hands and shuddered. I crossed the room swiftly, kneeling before her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She dropped her hands. \u201cNot really.\u201d Her tone was unwontedly dry. \u201cI\u2019m scared half out of my wits, and that was the single most mortifying performance of my life.\u201d She touched the back of my head with infinite gentleness. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHow long until the sleeping draught takes effect?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers slid through my hair, trailed along my cheek. \u201cThe one I poured into the vase hidden behind the chamberpot under my bed and replaced with unwatered wine? A few more minutes at least if I\u2019d actually drunk it. Talk fast.\u201d</p><p>My entire body shivered beneath her touch. \u201cI\u2019ll try. Only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sidonie whispered, cupping my face with both hands now. There were tears in her black eyes. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The lover showers kisses on the face of the beloved . . .</p><p>It was gentle, it was frantic, it was terrified, all at once. I knelt before her, my face upturned. She kissed my eyelids, my temples, my cheeks, the corners of my mouth. Sweet, so sweet! I hadn\u2019t imagined so much sweetness existed in the world. She kissed my mouth.</p><p>My lips parted beneath hers, the tip of her tongue touched mine.</p><p>Imriel.</p><p>Ohgodsohgodsohgods! Knowledge and memory burst like a ripe seed-pod inside my skull. It filled me to overflowing.</p><p>Imriel.</p><p>I was Imriel.</p><p>I gasped and tore myself away from her, huddling and clasping my own arms, rocking on my knees and shuddering.</p><p>I was Imriel.</p><p>Sidonie drew back from me in alarm, her eyes widening. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>It flooded me; it flooded every part of me. Memories, crashing and churning. I remembered everything. I knew myself. I knew what had happened. Everything. All the plans, all the risk, all the uncertainty. All the fear and horror. My madness. My quest. Ptolemy Solon and his needle, stitching and stitching. Leander\u2019s voice, stitching a new tale, binding his memories to my flesh. I drew a breath, ragged and raw. \u201cOh, Sidonie!\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m me. Imriel.\u201d</p><p>She shrank back against the headboard of her bed. \u201cLeander?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know me.</p><p>Of course she didn\u2019t know me.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said in anguish. \u201cOh, Name of Elua, Sidonie! I\u2019ve loved you since you were sixteen years old. I\u2019m what you\u2019re missing. I\u2019m what you\u2019ve forgotten. You and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She hissed the word at me, eyes showing the whites all around in sheer terror. \u201cLeander, please! Don\u2019t do this to me. I can\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>I reached for her. \u201cSidonie . . .\u201d</p><p>She shrank back farther. \u201cGo away! Please, go away!\u201d</p><p>I sat back on my heels. \u201cWill you just please listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie shook her head, squeezing her eyes shut as though to block out the world. A pulse in the hollow of her throat beat frantically. \u201cNo, no, no, no. I thought you were . . . I don\u2019t know, but you\u2019re not. Just please, go away.\u201d</p><p>Ah, Elua.</p><p>I knew everything.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I said, desperate to reach her. \u201cAlais\u2019 dog was killed by a bear!\u201d</p><p>For a long moment, she didn\u2019t speak or react. I knelt silently, waiting, acutely aware of time dwindling. And then slowly, slowly, Sidonie\u2019s eyes opened. She watched me without speaking, breathing hard through parted lips.</p><p>\u201cIt happened in Alba,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you were right; there was a boar, too. Years earlier, at a hunting party. We stumbled over a boar. Your horse bolted. Alais\u2019 dog, Celeste, was gored, but she survived. I stitched her wound in the woods using Amarante\u2019s embroidery kit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI remember . . . parts,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Oh, gods, it nearly broke my heart to look at her. \u201cSomething Bodeshmun did pulled a whole thread out of your memory,\u201d I said gently. \u201cAnd everything that\u2019s left is partly unravelled. Is that what it feels like?\u201d She nodded slowly. \u201cSidonie, I can undo it. If you can find a way for us to be alone together again, for a little while longer, I can explain everything.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes dwelled on my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t dare push her. Not now. I was barely holding myself together. \u201cThink on it,\u201d I whispered. \u201cTry to sleep. I don\u2019t dare stay any longer. But I\u2019ll be on the other side of the door, guarding your dreams. And I promise you, Princess, no one will ever harm you while there\u2019s breath in my body.\u201d</p><p>I rose slowly and carefully. Sidonie looked so damnably vulnerable. My doing, my fault. It tore me up inside like I\u2019d swallowed broken glass. Still, it had to be done. I left the room quietly, closing the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cShe sleeps?\u201d Girom inquired.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I leaned against the door, my knees trembling. My voice sounded strange to my ears. I\u2019d entered that room as Leander Maignard, and left it as Imriel de la Courcel. \u201cYes, she was agitated for a time, but the draught took effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The physician nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll return in the morning to examine her.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAre you actually planning to stay? You needn\u2019t. It\u2019s a powerful draught; she won\u2019t wake for hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I let my knees give way and slid down the door, hoping I looked more like a man settling in for a long vigil than a man collapsing. \u201cI promised.\u201d I tried to find Leander Maignard\u2019s insouciant tone somewhere inside me. \u201cOne should always keep a promise to a lady, messire.\u201d</p><p>Girom shrugged. \u201cAs you like. Send one of the guards to fetch me if there\u2019s any difficulty before I arrive.\u201d</p><p>With that, he took his leave. The Amazigh regarded me with impassive disinterest. There were two of them on guard. They exchanged a few words in their native tongue. One went to stir the fire in the hearth, then took up a post where he could keep an eye on both me and the outer door. The other stretched his length on a couch, clearly prepared to nap.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have cared less.</p><p>Imriel.</p><p>I was Imriel.</p> <p>The knowledge pounded through me, over and over. I remembered everything. My madness, the flight to Cythera. My mother. Ptolemy Solon\u2019s spell. I remembered everything I\u2019d done as Leander, vividly. I even remembered Leander\u2019s own memories, although they\u2019d grown faint and ghostly, like somewhat read in a tale. But I remembered what I\u2019d felt as Leander.</p><p>And it was nothing to what I felt now.</p><p>I was going to have to act fast. Ptolemy Solon hadn\u2019t thought a mere semblance would fool Bodeshmun, and that was all I had now. I leaned the back of my head against the door, staring into the dim salon. The gouge in my skull throbbed. I had to get Sidonie out of here.</p><p>And I had to get Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman.</p><p>Ah, gods! What was happening at home? There hadn\u2019t been word of Terre d\u2019Ange since Carthage. The thought made me shiver. Leander Maignard hadn\u2019t cared overmuch.</p><p>I did.</p><p>It was a long night. I stayed awake, thinking. At some point, the Amazigh warrior on guard yawned and woke the other. They traded roles. Some hours later, another pair came to relieve them altogether. I watched the process through slitted eyes, thinking about the Amazigh garb hidden in my trunks.</p><p>A little after dawn, a Carthaginian chambermaid came with a tray of tea and fruit. She made to pass me and enter the bedchamber. I shook my head at her.</p> <p>\u201cNo one passes,\u201d I said. \u201cI promised.\u201d</p><p>The door opened behind me. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Sidonie said quietly. \u201cElissa may enter.\u201d</p><p>I got stiffly to my feet. \u201cDid you sleep well, your highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There were violet shadows under her eyes, but her gaze was clear and calm. Sidonie de la Courcel had come to a decision. \u201cThank you, Messire Maignard. Your presence helped. Would it be too much to ask you to return tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady,\u201d I said, bowing. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Fourty-Five</p><p>I made my way wearily to my own chambers, praying I didn\u2019t encounter Bodeshmun on the way. For a mercy, I didn\u2019t. I was going to have to avoid him, at least up until the minute I killed him.</p><p>And I was still working on that plan.</p><p>Sunjata was there, muttering over his latest manifest. The gem trade had fallen off since Astegal had pulled the army out of New Carthage. I stopped dead, staring at him and remembering.</p><p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d I said.</p><p>His head jerked up and he stared at me, recognition slowly dawning. \u201cYou . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d I said. \u201cYes. I know myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Sunjata said. \u201cYes. It was in her ladyship\u2019s letter.\u201d</p><p>I regarded him with a convoluted mixture of Leander\u2019s fondness and my own bitter memories of his voice whispering in my ear, the stab of a long needle, his hand tugging a ring from my finger. \u201cWhy did you have me strip?\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cI had to know. To see.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cYou could have refused me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeander would have been hurt,\u201d Sunjata murmured. \u201cIt would have been hard to explain. And . . . you nearly were him, at least at first. Even after I saw you.\u201d His throat worked. \u201cThis is a lonely business, your highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Imriel,\u201d I said wryly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been lovers.\u201d</p><p>Sunjata\u2019s dark skin flushed darker. \u201cI have something for you,\u201d he said, rising and going to his own bedchamber. He returned with the trunk I\u2019d brought from Cythera, the one inscribed with his name. \u201cThese are yours.\u201d</p><p>I was just opening the trunk as Kratos stumbled from the servant\u2019s chamber, yawning and scratching himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d he asked as I withdrew a pair of fawn-colored woolen breeches.</p><p>\u201cMy things,\u201d I said. Beneath the few items of clothing I\u2019d brought on my flight lay the rest. My sword and dagger, my rhinoceros-hide sword-belt, shiny with wear. A purse with nothing in it but a polished stone with a hole in the middle that I carried for luck and remembrance. My eyes stung. \u201cKratos, my friend, it seems I\u2019m not who I thought I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Kratos rubbed his stubbled chin. \u201cWho are you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d I said, withdrawing the vambraces Dorelei had given me, engraved with the image of the Black Boar of the Cullach Gorrym. A golden torc. \u201cImriel n\u00f3 Montr\u00e8ve de la Courcel.\u201d</p><p>Kratos stared. \u201cHas he lost his wits?\u201d he asked Sunjata.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sunjata said. \u201cFound them.\u201d</p><p>I stood and drew my sword. It rang faintly. It was a well-tempered blade, longer and heavier than anything Leander Maignard had owned. I moved softly through the first few forms of the hours. \u201cSunjata, how much of Leander\u2019s attire must I wear to preserve the semblance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a guess?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThe more you can manage, the better. Once someone\u2019s seen you as Leander, they won\u2019t unsee you, not unless you remove everything of his. But I wouldn\u2019t take any unnecessary risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I sheathed the blade. Kratos was still gaping at me. \u201cIs that why you came back?\u201d I asked Sunjata. \u201cFor this moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI owed you that much.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou should go now, Sunjata. I\u2019m going to have to act quickly. And I\u2019ll need Captain Deimos\u2019 ship. Can you arrange passage back to Carthage elsewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cYes, there are ships carrying information and supplies between old Carthage and new. It should be no trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I turned to Kratos. \u201cMy friend, you ought to go with him. I\u2019ll give you money to book passage to Cythera from thence.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI suspect my lady mother will find you a joy and a delight the likes of which she hasn\u2019t known since a clever and fearless fellow named Canis was in her service.\u201d</p><p>Kratos closed his mouth with an audible click, then blinked a few times. \u201cWhy are you dismissing me, my lord?\u201d he asked in bewilderment.</p><p>I laid a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a better ally than I could ever have dreamed. I ask for no more. The risks I\u2019ve taken thus far are nothing compared to the ones I mean to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Kratos scratched his chin again. \u201cThat\u2019s some well-sounding noble folly, my lord. You prepared to risk yon golden-haired princess\u2019 life for it?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201d A complacent smile spread over his homely features. \u201cBy all the gods, why shouldn\u2019t I stay? Whoever you are, you\u2019re an interesting fellow. What do you need me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure of this?\u201d I asked in a hard voice.</p><p>Kratos\u2019 heavy shoulders moved in a shrug. \u201cI said it, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I paced the room, thinking. \u201cMore than anything, I need a way out of the palace that\u2019s lightly guarded. Do you reckon you might find one?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOh, aye! I reckon.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes briefly, thinking back on that day in the slave-market. The Aragonian boy with the curly hair and the stricken face. So much depended on this: his life, the lives of so many others. Not just mine, not just Sidonie\u2019s. More than the fate of even Terre d\u2019Ange hung in the balance. Blessed Elua had guided my hand\u2014or Leander\u2019s\u2014the day I\u2019d chosen Kratos. And he was right. If I didn\u2019t want to bring this all crashing down on our heads, I couldn\u2019t afford to be soft-hearted.</p><p>\u201cMy thanks, Kratos,\u201d I said. An unexpected yawn overtook me. \u201cI need to take a few hours of sleep. Will you wake me around midday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you explain all this when I do?\u201d he retorted.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promised.</p><p>With that, I took to my own chamber and fell onto the bed, exhausted in mind and body alike. I fell asleep almost instantly and slept like the dead until Kratos shook me awake. It felt like no time at all had passed, but the room was filled with afternoon sunlight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s later than I asked,\u201d I commented, shaking myself awake.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Kratos\u2019 face was grave. \u201cI reckoned you needed it. And the eunuch saved you some time. He explained it all to me.\u201d He gave a short, wondering laugh. \u201cNever thought to find myself living something out of a bard\u2019s tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I rubbed my eyes. \u201cWell, let\u2019s just hope we live to hear the end of it, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Accompanied by Kratos, I made my way to the inn near the harbor where Captain Deimos and his men were lodging. Since the army had left, the inn was empty save for their presence. I bought a jug of wine and met with Deimos at an isolated table while Kratos stood watch. There, I told the captain that I needed him to ready the ship to sail on a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p>\u201cTo Carthage?\u201d Deimos asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cMarsilikos.\u201d</p><p>The captain was no fool. \u201cThat\u2019s a damned dangerous passage this time of year, my lord, even if we hug the coast all the way. Is it necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be,\u201d I said.</p><p>Deimos eyed me. \u201cWhat are you asking me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, better you don\u2019t know the details. If you\u2019re asking if it\u2019s dangerous, yes. And if you\u2019re not willing to do it, tell me now, Deimos. I\u2019ll not hold it against you.\u201d I touched the hilt of my sword. \u201cBut I swear to Blessed Elua, if you turn against me at the last minute, I\u2019ll make sure killing you is the last thing I do.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cDo you know, Ptolemy Solon made me swear a binding oath that I\u2019d render you any assistance you asked. I wondered why the old ape was being so adamant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you do it?\u201d I asked. \u201cI promise you, if you do, Terre d\u2019Ange will reward you beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an oath-breaker,\u201d Deimos said curtly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bribe me. The ship will be ready by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man,\u201d I said, sighing inwardly with relief. What I would have done if Deimos had refused, I couldn\u2019t say. Sunjata had been right about one thing. I was indeed lucky that my mother loved me.</p><p>After the harbor, Kratos and I stopped at the bath-house. It felt strange and empty without the presence of scores of soldiers, and I felt acutely self-conscious as I stripped. I\u2019d done it a dozen times without even thinking. Today, it was different. I could hear the faint echo of Ptolemy Solon\u2019s voice in my memory, a pinch at my earlobes. Surely they will serve as a last line of defense against the perils of nudity.</p><p>Elua have mercy, what an insane risk.</p><p>I washed and dressed quickly, feeling safer once I was clad. Back in my chambers at the palace, I sorted through my things, trying to decide how much risk I was willing to take. I needed to prove myself to Sidonie, but I had a feeling that if the first thing I did was strip mother-naked in front of her, it would strain her fragile trust. In the end, I donned a pair of my own breeches and underclothes, but everything else I wore was Leander\u2019s.</p><p>Sunjata had been gone, but he returned before nightfall. I admitted him when he knocked on the door of my chamber.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sailing for Carthage on the morrow,\u201d he said directly. \u201cI\u2019ve come to bid you farewell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thanks.\u201d I put out my hand. \u201cBe safe, Sunjata.\u201d</p><p>He paused, then clasped it. \u201cAnd you. Be careful, my lord. Don\u2019t forget that you still need to wear Leander\u2019s mask for a time, at least in public.\u201d He gave me his wry smile. \u201cA little less . . . intensity . . . mayhap.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u201cDuly noted.\u201d</p><p>Sunjata\u2019s smile turned wistful. \u201cI wish you luck.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Kratos\u2019 voice came from the far chamber, informing me that the physician had sent for me to attend the princess.</p> <p>\u201cMy thanks,\u201d I said to Sunjata a second time. I rummaged in my trunk and found my gold-knotted ring, sliding it on my finger and turning it inward to hide it. My heart began beating faster with a mix of hope and fear. I sensed it would be a long time before it slowed. \u201cI fear I\u2019m going to need it.\u201d</p><p>With that, I went to Sidonie.</p><p>Fourty-Six</p><p>In Sidonie\u2019s bedchamber, we reenacted the same ritual as the previous evening, only with considerably less drama. She drank the sleeping draught without protest, seeming weary and defeated. It wasn\u2019t until the physician Girom withdrew and closed the door that her demeanor changed.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay long,\u201d she warned me.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll do this as quickly as I can. Forgive me if it sounds\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her lips curved in a faint, tired smile. \u201cI made the guards drink a toast to Astegal\u2019s health when Girom went to fetch you. If his infernal draughts are half as effective as he claims, they\u2019ll be sleeping in minutes. You\u2019ve got to dispatch Girom before it happens.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. \u201cYou are a wonderment.\u201d</p><p>Her slender shoulders moved in a shrug. \u201cDesperation provides all manner of inspiration.\u201d</p><p>So it was that I waited quietly for only a few moments before going to inform the physician that she slept.</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Girom remarked in surprise.</p> <p>I spread my hands. \u201cGods, man, can you blame the lass? She\u2019s worn to the bone with fear and loneliness. My lord Astegal would have been kinder to leave her in Carthage until Aragonia was truly settled.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYes, well, Astegal wants his heir. I pray that\u2019s the cause of her highness\u2019 uncertain moods.\u201d</p><p>One of the Amazigh was already blinking conspicuously. \u201cWell, whatever it is, I pray her highness calms soon,\u201d I said, sinking cross-legged to take up my post before her door. I forced a yawn. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep better in my own bed. Go on. I\u2019ll send word if there\u2019s any difficulty.\u201d</p><p>Girom took his leave.</p><p>I waited.</p><p>After a muttered exchange, the blinking Amazigh stretched out on the couch. He was snoring within minutes. The other fellow was bigger. It took longer for the draught to affect him. I watched out of the corner of my eye, praying the draught Sidonie had poured into their wine had been large enough for both of them.</p><p>It had been. He paced for a while, shaking his head. Then he sat in a chair, as though thinking a few minutes\u2019 rest would refresh him. It wasn\u2019t long before his body grew slack and relaxed, head tilted back.</p><p>I got to my feet and crossed the room quietly. I shook first one, then the other of the Amazigh. Neither man woke.</p> <p>I opened the door to Sidonie\u2019s chamber. She was sitting on her bed, watching the door fixedly. I entered and closed it behind me.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me about this spell.\u201d</p><p>There was a mirror above a dressing table on the opposite wall. I glanced involuntarily at it and saw Leander Maignard\u2019s face return my gaze. It gave me a shiver. I hadn\u2019t known until that moment what I\u2019d see; but of course, the semblance hadn\u2019t been broken for me.</p><p>\u201cThere were three spells,\u201d I began slowly. \u201cThe first one bound everyone in the City of Elua the night the Carthaginian horologists displayed their marvel, convincing them that Terre d\u2019Ange and Carthage were allies, and that you had consented to wed Astegal. It binds them still, but only those who were in the city. The last I heard, Terre d\u2019Ange was on the verge of civil war.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s face paled. \u201cAnd the second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first spell holds only on D\u2019Angeline soil. The second one bound you to Astegal and convinced you that you were in love with him.\u201d I twisted the ring on my finger and showed it to her. \u201cThis was half of it. It . . . you gave it to me, Sidonie. It was a love-token.\u201d I saw doubt in her eyes and hurried onward. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You do know the ring, yes?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAstegal always wore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still thinks he does,\u201d I said. \u201cBut a few days ago, the day you took it into your head to call on Roderico de Aragon, I arranged to have it exchanged for a copy. And something changed in you that day, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie looked away, frowning. \u201cIt was strange. It was as though I\u2019d been startled out of a daydream. And I thought, why have I been waiting so obediently when I know I could be of use here? So I went to see Roderico . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cAnd he accused you of betraying Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s alliance with Aragonia,\u201d I said gently. \u201cThat\u2019s when you knew somewhat was truly amiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked back at me, her dark eyes wary. \u201cAnd I was willing to trust you wholly until yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the third spell. One wrought by Ptolemy Solon to disguise me so well I didn\u2019t know myself. It was the only way I could safely enter Carthage and find you. Bodeshmun would have seen through a mere semblance.\u201d I licked my lips, which had gone dry. \u201cSidonie, this one I can prove to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI have to take off most of my clothes.\u201d Gods, it sounded mad.</p><p>She raised her brows. \u201cFind another method.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThe charm\u2019s bound into Leander Maignard\u2019s entire wardrobe. Everything, every stitch of clothing, every gem and bauble. And I think that\u2019s what was done to you. I thought it was just one thing, like Astegal\u2019s ring, but it\u2019s everything. Just like it was with me. Let me show you.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to take her forever to weigh the decision. \u201cIf you lay a hand on me, I swear to Elua, I\u2019ll scream loud enough to wake the guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d I said fervently. \u201cI\u2019ll not move from this spot.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie didn\u2019t comment, only watched. I pulled off my boots and stockings, then removed the ruby eardrops and several gaudy rings. I unbraided my hair, dropping the ties atop the pile.</p><p>\u201cThe breeches are my own.\u201d I undid Leander\u2019s sword-belt and dropped it. \u201cSunjata had them, along with the rest of my things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gem-merchant\u2019s assistant?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I untucked my shirt and smiled wryly. \u201cThat\u2019s another story. There\u2019s a part of it like to amuse you one day. At any rate, the shirt\u2019s the last of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you remove it\u2014\u201d Sidonie began.</p><p>I did.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to look in the mirror. I saw it in her face, eyes wide and awestruck. Neither of us spoke. I kept my promise and stood where I was. It was Sidonie who rose and came to me, slowly and wonderingly.</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d she said softly, as though hearing the word for the first time.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d She splayed her hand on my chest. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t remember. But I know you.\u201d She gazed at the pink furrows that raked my flesh. \u201cThere was a bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bear that killed Alais\u2019 dog.\u201d I covered her hand with mine. \u201cYes. It did this to me. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t remember it clearly.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze to mine. \u201cAnd this spell . . . you think what\u2019s stolen my memories is the same? That it\u2019s bound into everything I possess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ah, Elua! I wanted to hold her so badly, but I didn\u2019t dare. I stood there, watching the thoughts flit across her features, watching her come to a decision.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Sidonie pulled away from me and began untying the sash of her robe. \u201cLet\u2019s find out.\u201d Beneath the robe, she wore only a thin shift of sheer linen. She\u2019d already prepared for bed. Her hair was loose, all her jewels removed for the evening. I held my breath as she pulled the shift over her head and dropped it atop the robe.</p><p>\u201cSidonie?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Her jaw tightened. She shook her head in wordless denial, embarrassment and despair in her face. My heart sank. Sidonie averted her face, then bent over to pick up her discarded clothing, her hair falling forward over her bare shoulders.</p><p>That was when I saw it.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods!\u201d I blurted.</p><p>Her head came up fast. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes briefly and swallowed hard. \u201cOh, love. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Moving gently and carefully, I touched her arm and turned her, then gathered her hair and tucked it over one shoulder. Lightly, lightly, I touched the spot between her shoulder blades where the falcon insignia of the House of Sarkal had been tattooed indelibly onto her fair skin. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shot me a single stricken glance, then crossed over to the mirror, craning her head to peer over her shoulder. When she looked back at me, her expression was adamant. \u201cCut it out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>Her eyes flashed. \u201cCut it out of me.\u201d She scrabbled on the top of the dressing table and came up with a sharp little knife for paring nails. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I took the knife, feeling sick. \u201cDo you have any idea how much this is going to hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said shortly, retrieving her robe and tugging the sash loose. She folded the sash into a thick wad. \u201cJust do it. Please.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, willing my hands to stop shaking. \u201cBrace yourself against the table and try not to move.\u201d Sidonie shoved the wadded sash into her mouth and obeyed. I tried to swallow, but my whole mouth had gone dry. \u201cArch your back,\u201d I said thickly, and she did. \u201cAll right,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll do this as quickly as I can. And please don\u2019t ask me to stop, because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll have the nerve to try it twice.\u201d</p><p>She made a muffled sound of assent.</p><p>My stomach roiled.</p><p>The tattoo wasn\u2019t very large, not much bigger than the engraving on Astegal\u2019s signet ring. It was stark and black against her skin. I laid the blade alongside it, breathing slowly and deeply. I could do this. I had to do this. Before I was born, the Skaldi warlord Waldemar Selig had attempted to skin Ph\u00e8dre alive on the battlefield of Troyes-le-Mont. If a man could do such a thing for spite, I could do it for love.</p><p>I cut into Sidonie\u2019s flesh.</p><p>Her entire body jerked and she uttered a stifled cry that brought tears to my eyes. Blood flowed, making the hilt of the little blade slippery. Cutting and cutting, all the way around it, shaking my head to clear my eyes of the tears that blurred my vision. Gods, it was awful. It was the most awful thing I\u2019d ever done.</p><p>But I did it.</p><p>I set the paring knife and the bloody disk of skin and flesh on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie spat out the sash, but her hands remained braced on the table, knuckles white. For a long moment, she didn\u2019t move or speak, only breathed hard, her ribcage heaving. Blood trickled down her spine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d she said at last in a low, savage voice. \u201cKushiel bear witness, I swear, I\u2019m going to kill him myself!\u201d She straightened and turned so quickly I had to step back. I saw the full helpless fury of the knowledge of what had been done to her written in her face. Everything, every violation.</p><p>Every night in Astegal\u2019s bed.</p><p>And then her expression changed.</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d Sidonie breathed, tears welling in her eyes. \u201cOh, Blessed Elua! How could I forget you? In a thousand years, how could I forget you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, my heart aching for her. \u201cNeither of us did. Sidonie, you found me inside Leander when I didn\u2019t even know myself. And I fell in love with you all over again. All the magic in Carthage couldn\u2019t stop us from loving one another, any more than all the politics of Terre d\u2019Ange could. You were right when you said Blessed Elua must have some purpose for joining us, because here I am\u2014\u201d</p><p>She reached up to me and stopped my mouth with a kiss, with a dozen kisses. I groaned aloud and gathered her to me, sinking one hand into her hair, wrapping my arm around her waist.</p><p>\u201cErase him from me,\u201d Sidonie whispered against my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>I slid both hands down to grasp her buttocks and lifted her gently. She clung to me, legs wrapped around my waist, arms twined around my neck, kissing my face as I carried her to the bed. I found clean towels by the washbasin.</p><p>\u201cEvery trace,\u201d I promised, bathing the blood from her skin while she knelt on the bed. The wound was still seeping, but slowly. I\u2019d made the cut as shallow as I could. \u201cEvery trace of him, gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d Sidonie whispered.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d My throat was tight, my heart overflowing. \u201cAlways and always.\u201d</p><p>There was no part of her I didn\u2019t touch that night. I kissed the top of her head, the nape of her neck. Behind her ears, and every inch of her face. I laid a trail of kisses down her spine, blowing softly on the raw wound where Astegal had laid his mark on her. I kissed her throat, her arms. The insides of her wrists, the palms of her hands, every fingertip.</p><p>With every kiss, I willed her to be whole.</p><p>I kissed her breasts, and the valley between them. I kissed her belly. I knelt beside the bed and kissed her feet, her calves. Her inner thighs. Whole and healed.</p><p>All of her.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t begun as desire, not truly. It was a more complicated need. But with every kiss, it grew simpler and simpler. Kneeling between her thighs, I tasted her desire, feeling it echo through my own body, sweet and insistent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sidonie tugged at my hair. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I rose and shed my breeches. There was a trace of uncertainty in her eyes, a lingering fear.</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d she said hesitantly. \u201cDoes it trouble you . . . ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I took her hand and guided it to my erect, aching phallus, curving her fingers around it. \u201cI\u2019m yours, Sidonie. I love you. You belong to me, and I to you. Every part of me. I won\u2019t let anyone take that from us. Not Bodeshmun, not Astegal. No one.\u201d</p><p>The last uncertainty vanished.</p><p>And . . . oh, gods.</p><p>It was everything, everything. All at once. Sidonie shook her head impatiently, straddling my lap with an inarticulate sound. My phallus throbbing in her fist. She fitted me to her.</p><p>Everything.</p> <p>I felt the impossibly glorious glide of entering her, slick and tight. And I felt . . . ah, Elua! I felt everything. All of it. I felt myself entering her, a wanted invasion. Full and stretched and welcome.</p><p>\u201cName of Elua!\u201d I whispered in awe.</p><p>There was no end to it.</p><p>It went on and on, pleasure doubled and redoubled. Mirrors reflecting mirrors. Bright, dark. Which was which? It didn\u2019t matter. Sidonie rocked atop me, rising and falling, her breasts pressed hard against my chest. I clutched her shoulder blades, struggling to be mindful of the wound between them. I captured her mouth with mine, my tongue seeking hers. I felt her pleasure rise and spiral, felt her breathe my breath. I felt the core of her. I felt myself inside her. Fullness. Opening, opening, convulsing. Over and over.</p><p>So good.</p><p>I cried aloud at the end. Sidonie\u2019s eyes widened. What I felt, she felt. The drive, the need, the acute, prolonged spasm of release. Still, she had the presence of mind to clamp one hand over my mouth.</p> <p>I collapsed onto my back.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Still straddling me, Sidonie leaned on my chest. Her black eyes gazed intently into mine. \u201cHow do we save Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d</p><p>I started laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jesting,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I know.\u201d I sank my hands into her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . I was afraid. Afraid of how you\u2019d react once you knew. Afraid of the damage done.\u201d I stroked her hair, winding it around my fingers. \u201cHeart of my heart, I didn\u2019t expect you to emerge from this ready to kill Astegal, make love to me, and rescue the realm.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie smiled ruefully. \u201cI may well fall to pieces later. If I do, I pray you\u2019ll be there to gather them. But for now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk fast?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>Fourty-Seven</p><p>I sat on the bed cutting Sidonie\u2019s shift into a long strip of bandage and told her everything I knew that had passed since the night of Carthage\u2019s spell, including my month of madness. She listened in horrified wonder, but she didn\u2019t comment until I mentioned seeking Barquiel L\u2019Envers\u2019 aid.</p><p>\u201cAnd he gave it?\u201d she asked in amazement.</p><p>\u201cSeems he loves Terre d\u2019Ange more than he hates me.\u201d I told her the rest, tearing the linen carefully. Cythera, my mother. Ptolemy Solon. The details of the spell\u2014the ghafrid-gebla and Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and my uncle,\u201d she mused. \u201cElua have mercy, I never thought I\u2019d have cause to be grateful to either of them, let alone both at once. You\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s happening in Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThere\u2019s been no word for weeks. I don\u2019t know if L\u2019Envers found the gem that holds the ghafrid. I don\u2019t know if he got the rest of the country to rally behind Alais. I\u2019ve no idea. Lift your arms.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie obeyed. I wound the long strip around her body, covering the seeping gouge between her shoulders. I had to crisscross the bandage between her breasts, wrapping it around her twice before I tied it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lucky you\u2019re handy with knots,\u201d she observed. I glanced up to see a faint spark of the old humor in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d I finished and went to rummage in her clothes-press for another shift. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a problem hiding that from your attendants, love. And it really ought to be dressed by a proper chirurgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She frowned in thought. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done for the latter, but I can hold my attendants off for a time. They\u2019re fairly well convinced I\u2019m deeply distraught. They\u2019ll leave me to bathe and dress myself in peace if I insist on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirom thinks you might be with child,\u201d I said softly, holding out the garment. \u201cLift your arms again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t protest, letting me help her on with the shift. \u201cWhat if I am?\u201d</p><p>I sat back on the bed and looked into her eyes. \u201cI had to answer that question for someone else, once. Lucius Tadius, you remember? Sidonie, I\u2019m the child of two traitors, and I\u2019m the man I am because Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin loved me despite it. Any child of your blood, I will love.\u201d I paused. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie smiled wryly. \u201cI married Astegal in Carthage. The rites were all Carthaginian. There was no invocation beseeching Eisheth for fertility.\u201d Her expression turned quizzical. \u201cAnd I never said a word about it. I must have known, somewhere deep inside me, that I didn\u2019t love him.\u201d</p><p>I laughed humorlessly. \u201cSo Astegal\u2019s efforts to get an heir were all in vain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d She nodded with bitter satisfaction. \u201cThough considerable.\u201d</p><p>I took her hands in mine. \u201cDid he harm you? Because I swear in Kushiel\u2019s name, if he did, it means the difference between Astegal dying and Astegal dying slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie gave her head a little shake, her gaze sliding away from mine. \u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t cruel and he didn\u2019t force me. He didn\u2019t have to. I was willing.\u201d Her throat worked as she swallowed. \u201cThat\u2019s what sickens me the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t willing.\u201d I squeezed her hands. \u201cSidonie, they took your will away and turned you against yourself. It\u2019s not your fault. None of it.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at me. \u201cI can get to Bodeshmun.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say it was too dangerous, then thought better of it. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way I dealt with the guards.\u201d Sidonie nodded at the door.</p><p>I did say it then. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, love. The Amazigh are going to be on alert after tonight. And Bodeshmun\u2019s twice as suspicious as any desert tribesman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards won\u2019t talk,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter the incident in the gardens, Bodeshmun put the fear of whatever gods they worship into them. I wouldn\u2019t risk it twice, not with them, but I\u2019d wager anything that they\u2019ll cover for one another rather than admit to Bodeshmun that they fell asleep on duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he sees that the spell\u2019s broken?\u201d I asked. \u201cPtolemy Solon told me he\u2019d see through a mere semblance.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shrugged. \u201cHe didn\u2019t notice when you broke the first half. Mayhap it\u2019s not the same. After all, I\u2019m still myself. I was all along. And Bodeshmun doesn\u2019t look at me, Imriel. I\u2019m just a necessary nuisance to him. I was a bored, pestering nuisance, and now I\u2019m a dithering nuisance.\u201d</p><p>I considered it. \u201cAnd you actually believe he\u2019d drink a toast at the request of a dithering nuisance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I brought him the great good news that I was carrying Astegal\u2019s heir, and that in the absence of the father, it was D\u2019Angeline custom that his nearest kinsman drink a toast to the health of the babe . . . yes. Particularly if I threatened to get hysterical if he refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think on it for a day,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure of it, then I believe you. But I still need to find a way to get you safely out of the palace and onto Deimos\u2019 ship. You\u2019re a bit hard to disguise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Sidonie noted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free to come and go.\u201d I twined my fingers with hers, thinking. \u201cIs it always at least four Amazigh who escort you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside the palace, betimes it\u2019s only one. But outside, yes.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cWhy?\u201d I told her about the Amazigh garb that Ghanim had obtained for me. \u201cIt won\u2019t work. Not outside the palace, not after the attack. We\u2019d be stopped.\u201d Sidonie got up and paced the room restlessly, grimacing at the pain of her wounded back. I glanced out the darkened window. Once again, time was dwindling. Soon I\u2019d have to take up my post outside her door. I rose and began cleaning up the mess at the dressing table, gathering the bloodstained rags and ringing them out in the basin. I\u2019d have to take them with me, hidden under my shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose we should do with this?\u201d I asked, reluctantly picking up the ragged disk of skin and flesh marked with the Sarkal insignia.</p><p>\u201cBurn it,\u201d Sidonie said briefly.</p><p>The brazier was burning low, but the coals flared when I blew on them. I laid the piece of flesh carefully atop them. It seared and sizzled, smelling disconcertingly edible. Sidonie shuddered with disgust, watching it blacken and shrink, her fingers unconsciously rolling and unrolling the sash of her robe.</p><p>It gave me an idea.</p><p>\u201cSidonie, did you ever hear the tale of the deposed Menekhetan queen who had herself smuggled before a Tiberian general rolled in a carpet?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She stopped and stared at me. \u201cYou\u2019re brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grinned at her. \u201cBut between the two of us, we manage to shine fairly brightly, love. If Kratos can find a discreet way out of the palace, I\u2019m willing to sling you over my shoulder and carry you to the harbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she asked simply.</p><p>\u201cGive me a day,\u201d I repeated. \u201cSend for me tomorrow like you did tonight. Don\u2019t risk drugging the guards. A few moments will be long enough to confer.\u201d I glanced at the window. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I ought to stay any longer. The second team of guards will be arriving soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, then.\u201d Sidonie took a deep breath. \u201cWill you hold me first?\u201d I gathered her into my arms, wishing I never had to let her go. She clung to me, pressing herself hard against me. \u201cI wish you didn\u2019t have to go,\u201d she whispered against my chest. \u201cImriel, once this is over, I never, ever want us to be parted again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I murmured against her hair. \u201cBelieve me, love, I know.\u201d</p><p>Leaving her that night was one of the hardest things I\u2019d done. It felt like I was tearing my heart out of my chest. I had mad fantasies of staying and barricading the door, holding the world at bay; or seizing Sidonie and trying to fight our way clear of New Carthage.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, I forced myself to let her go. She clung to me for a few heartbeats longer, then released me. I turned away reluctantly and left.</p><p>Outside her bedchamber, the Amazigh were snoring and the fire was burning low in the hearth. I stirred the fire back to life and laid another log on it, then took up my post outside Sidonie\u2019s door. There I sat, trying to contain the storms of emotion churning in my heart, trying to remember how to be Leander Maignard.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before fresh guards came to relieve the others. They startled at the sight of their sleeping fellows, then shook them awake after a hushed exchange and several darting glances my way. The Amazigh woke groggily, but they awoke. There was another hushed conference, this one with a furious undertone, and more anxious looks in my direction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve naught to fear on my account, lads.\u201d I shifted and stretched as though my limbs were stiff from a long night\u2019s inaction. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of Lord Bodeshmun\u2019s threats.\u201d I yawned, covering my mouth. \u201cAnd I do believe I caught a few winks myself. My silence for yours, good fellows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not happen again,\u201d one of the new guards said curtly, his Hellene heavily accented.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Well and good, Sidonie was right. The Amazigh might be fiercely loyal, but their personal loyalty was to Astegal. They obeyed Bodeshmun for his sake, but they didn\u2019t do it gladly.</p><p>As before, I waited until the chambermaid arrived a little after dawn with her breakfast tray. This time, I knocked on the door for her. Sidonie opened it. Our eyes met, a silent spark passing between us. But if nothing else, we\u2019d had a good deal of practice dissembling together in public.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my lady,\u201d I said. \u201cDid you rest well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce again, I thank you for your kindness, Messire Maignard.\u201d</p><p>I bowed. \u201cIt is an honor, your highness.\u201d</p><p>I lingered long enough to watch her turn and walk back into her chamber. I\u2019d carved a divot of flesh out of her back, and I knew she was hurting badly. It didn\u2019t show, not in the slightest.</p><p>That was my girl.</p><p>After what was surely the longest night of my life, I made my way to my own chambers. I was so exhausted as I was descending the tower stairs, I barely heard the deep rumble of Bodeshmun\u2019s voice in time. My pulse leapt like a startled hare, and I plastered myself against the inner wall of the stairwell. There I froze, praying like hell that Bodeshmun wasn\u2019t headed for the stairs.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him pass below me, his black robes swirling as he addressed Lord Gillimas. And for the first time, the thought occurred to me that it would be infinitely easier to get Sidonie out of New Carthage if we ignored the business of Bodeshmun and the talisman altogether.</p><p>Of course, that would leave a dangerous enemy at our backs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Terre d\u2019Ange in chaos.</p><p>I made it the rest of the way without event. In my chambers, I found Sunjata had already departed, and Kratos was all smiles.</p><p>\u201cGood news, my lord,\u201d he said in greeting. \u201cI think I\u2019ve found your passage. Will you see it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLater.\u201d I sat heavily on the couch and shrugged out of my shirt. A damp wad of bloodstained rags fell out.</p><p>Kratos\u2019 eyes bulged. \u201cWhat in the name of all the gods have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>I yawned. \u201c\u2019Tis a long story. My thanks for your good work, though.\u201d I pried off my boots. \u201cLet me sleep a few hours and I\u2019ll tell you everything,\u201d I promised, peeling off my stockings. \u201cMy head hurts, and I\u2019m perishing tired.\u201d</p><p>Kratos didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I glanced up at him and cursed myself. Kratos simply stared at me, his lips working soundlessly. I\u2019d taken off Leander\u2019s shirt, boots, and stockings. His rings, ruby eardrops, and the ties that bound his braids were in the pocket of my breeches. My breeches. I\u2019d pocketed the items without thinking, more worried about cleaning the bloody mess in Sidonie\u2019s chamber.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . .\u201d Kratos stammered at last. \u201cYou\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel de la Courcel,\u201d I said quietly, rising. \u201cWell met. Forgive me, Kratos. That was careless of me, very careless.\u201d</p><p>He stared blankly past the hand I extended. \u201cI know what the eunuch said, but . . .\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock. I know. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>Kratos shook himself all over like a wet dog. \u201cYou understate the case considerably, my lord.\u201d He did clasp my hand then, peering at my face in wonder. \u201cYou do have a bit of the look of him. Leander. Only . . . different. A lot different, somehow.\u201d He gave a short laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll wager you\u2019re a fellow knows how to wrestle. Bears, by the look of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my friend, is truer than you know.\u201d I released his hand. \u201cGive me a few hours, and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you wish, my lord,\u201d Kratos said with uncommon deference in his voice.</p><p>I took to my bed and dreamed of Sidonie.</p><p>Fourty-Eight</p><p>Kratos gave a subtle nod as we strolled past the heavy wooden door to the cellar where kegs of wine and ale were stored. The guard posted at the corner of the corridor stared straight ahead, incurious. I glanced to my left and saw the narrow servants\u2019 stair that led to the second floor. We kept walking, circling around and returning to our chambers.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said. \u201cOne guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad, eh?\u201d Kratos grinned.</p><p>\u201cNot bad at all, my friend,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you sure the outer door to the wine cellar isn\u2019t guarded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d He nodded. \u201cExcept when they\u2019re taking deliveries, it\u2019s kept locked tight from the inside.\u201d</p> <p>There was no outer defense wall around the palace in New Carthage, only roving patrols of Astegal\u2019s men tasked with keeping order in the streets of the city. The guards at the palace doors might question a lone Amazigh leaving in the small hours of the night with a rolled carpet slung over his shoulder. But out on the street, it would be a different matter. Elua knows what manner of errand Bodeshmun might have devised.</p><p>\u201cWell done.\u201d I clapped Kratos on the shoulder. \u201cDoes anyone suspect you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned again. \u201cOnly of being a wine-sot looking to steal a way into the cellar.\u201d</p><p>It could be done, I thought. And it would be a hell of a lot easier if Sidonie simply coaxed her guards into drinking another drugged toast. Then all I\u2019d have to do was wait for them to fall asleep and spirit her out of her chambers. There was still the guard in the hallway to dispatch, but I\u2019d be able to take him by surprise. Once I got Sidonie safely away, we could flee to Terre d\u2019Ange to seek aid from whatever army Barquiel L\u2019Envers had mustered. And there was Alba, too. Surely our combined forces would suffice to join Serafin\u2019s Aragonian rebels and defeat Carthage. Then we could deal with the spell.</p><p>That night, I proposed the idea to Sidonie.</p><p>She looked at me like I was mad. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, consider it!\u201d I pleaded. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot less dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor who?\u201d Her brows shot up. \u201cUs, yes. But how many hundreds or thousands of men would have to die before we got this close to Bodeshmun again? And who knows what manner of dire spell he might devise in the meantime? No.\u201d Sidonie shook her head. \u201cBelieve me, I don\u2019t harbor any romantic ideas about sacrificing myself for the good of the realm. But I couldn\u2019t live with myself if we didn\u2019t try, Imriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d say that,\u201d I murmured. \u201cAll right. Tomorrow, then. It\u2019s only going to get more dangerous the longer we wait. Go to Bodeshmun as late as possible. I\u2019ll have Kratos keep watch after the dinner hour. It would help if you can convince the guards only one needs escort you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other will grow suspicious when we don\u2019t return,\u201d Sidonie observed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him, too. But it will be easier to take them one at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I understood the question. I\u2019d killed men before in self-defense. This would be different. If I were quick and lucky, it would be outright murder. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She was pale, but her face was resolute. \u201cYou\u2019d best go. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again. \u201cIf things go awry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust know I love you,\u201d Sidonie finished the thought for me. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything else to say. I kissed her quickly and left to take up my post outside her door, fearful that if I lingered, it would be too agonizing to part. I didn\u2019t have to explain it to Sidonie. She understood.</p><p>That night, it was I who dozed under the watchful eyes of her Amazigh guards, my head propped against Sidonie\u2019s door. I\u2019d kept their secret, so I reckoned they\u2019d keep mine. And I would need every ounce of energy I could hoard to make it through the following night.</p><p>In the morning, Sidonie and I went through our cordial routine, both of us achingly aware that it could be the last time we saw one another alive. And then I took my leave of her once more, feeling lightheaded and hollow, as though I\u2019d left the better part of myself in her keeping.</p><p>I went to the harbor to inform Captain Deimos that we would be sailing on the morrow, as early as was humanly possible. He heard me out in laconic silence until I finished. \u201cCare to tell me what this is about?\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at Kratos, who was keeping watch. No one else was in earshot. Even so, I lowered my voice further. \u201cRescuing the heir to Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>Deimos stared at me, a muscle in his cheek twitching. \u201cFrom what I hear, the lady in question has no wish to be rescued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour information is wrong,\u201d I said. \u201cPtolemy Solon sent me to break the spell that bound her to Astegal. It\u2019s done. Now we\u2019re both in danger. So I will ask you one last time, will you do this or not?\u201d</p><p>His look turned hard. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m no oath-breaker. But I won\u2019t sail until I hear it from her own lips.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>After that, there wasn\u2019t much to be done except wait. I sent Kratos to procure clean bandages and a healing salve at an out-of-the-way chirurgeon\u2019s shop, worried about Sidonie\u2019s injury. I mixed grease and ashes from the hearth, testing it on the skin of my hands, until I had obtained a mixture that darkened my skin enough to permit me to pass as Amazigh, at least on brief, dimly lit inspection. I practiced tying the head-scarf and swathing my features. I practiced telling the hours. I packed the few items that mattered to me into a single trunk. I tried to sleep, and failed.</p><p>Waiting was always maddening, and this time it was compounded by a sense of helplessness. That day dragged onward like no other I could remember. But at last the daylight began to fade. Kratos and I dined in our quarters. I hadn\u2019t dared risk a meal in the great hall since I\u2019d known myself. Astegal, with his eternal revels, would have noticed my absence; luckily, Bodeshmun hadn\u2019t cared to continue the tradition.</p><p>Once we\u2019d finished, I dispatched Kratos to keep an eye on Sidonie\u2019s door. This was the first step in our end of the plan, and the most dangerous one for him. Her quarters and Bodeshmun\u2019s were both on the second story of the palace; ours were on the ground floor. There was no reason for Kratos to be lingering upstairs, but he had assured me he could manage it, and I had to trust him. I simply couldn\u2019t do everything myself.</p><p>I darkened my face and hands, donned my Amazigh garb over enough of Leander Maignard\u2019s clothing to maintain both guises.</p><p>An hour passed, and then another.</p><p>I was beginning to feel a quiet sense of panic rising when Kratos finally returned, red-faced and panting so hard he could barely speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he wheezed, bending over and bracing his hands on his knees. I let him catch his breath, swallowing my impatience. At last Kratos straightened. \u201cSorry. I started to get suspicious looks. Had to pretend I was running the stairs to work out leg cramps. Good cure, you know.\u201d</p><p>I made a concerted effort not to shake him. \u201cSidonie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone to see Bodeshmun,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cOne guard. He stayed posted outside Blackbeard\u2019s door. Gods, you look just like one of them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I didn\u2019t relax, but my panic and frustration ebbed, my thoughts slipping into a cool, calculating mode. I nodded at the trunk. \u201cCan you make it to the ship with that? You look knackered.\u201d</p><p>Kratos snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d I paused. \u201cKratos, I mean to be there well before dawn. If I\u2019m not there by the time the sun\u2019s clear of the horizon, it means this has gone very, very wrong. Tell Deimos to sail, and go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked briefly.</p><p>\u201cMarsilikos,\u201d I said. \u201cFind Jeanne de Mereliot, daughter of the Lady of Marsilikos. Tell her everything you know, everything we\u2019ve discussed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou imagine she\u2019ll believe me?\u201d Kratos asked in a dubious tone.</p><p>\u201cTell her Imriel de la Courcel said to tell her that he was grateful for the offer she made him before he sailed for Cythera,\u201d I said softly. \u201cEven though I refused it, I was grateful for her kindness and Eisheth\u2019s mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Kratos nodded and put out his hand. \u201cGods be with you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>I clasped it. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>With that, Kratos shouldered my trunk and exited our quarters. He paused in the hallway, glancing to make sure it was clear, then gave me a brief gesture of affirmation. I slipped through the door, clad in my Amazigh garb. Kratos strode toward the front of the palace without looking back.</p><p>I went in the opposite direction.</p><p>There weren\u2019t as many guards as there had been when Astegal was here. Bodeshmun had increased their number after Sidonie was attacked, but they were still spread thin. Mostly, he\u2019d settled for purging the palace staff of any Aragonians, having uncovered no organized conspiracy, but a deep vein of seething resentment when he put them to questioning.</p><p>None of the guards I passed gave me a second glance. If they had, they might have noticed small details amiss. The ash-dark hue of my skin, the color of my eyes. The cut of my sword-belt, the hilts of my blades. But they didn\u2019t. The guards were accustomed to letting Astegal\u2019s Amazigh pass without question. They saw what they expected to see, and I passed them like an indigo ghost and climbed the stairs.</p><p>I\u2019d decided to take care of the guard waiting in Sidonie\u2019s quarters first. He would be the safer kill, and the less I needed to move about the palace, the better. And too, I needed to allow time for the sleeping draught to take effect. Outside her door, I drew my dagger and held it reversed, the blade hidden under the flowing sleeve of my robe.</p><p>I knocked on the door.</p><p>There was a shuffling sound within, and then one of the Amazigh opened it. He asked me somewhat in his own tongue or in Punic; I couldn\u2019t have said. I shook my head and pressed a finger to the fabric muffling my mouth. He shrugged and admitted me, closing the door behind me.</p><p>He did take a second look.</p><p>I saw his eyes widen in the narrow strip of visible face, and didn\u2019t hesitate. I whipped my arm up, sleeve falling to bare the hidden blade. Plunged the dagger hilt-deep in his chest, one hand smothering his muffled mouth.</p><p>Quick.</p><p>I\u2019d always been quick.</p><p>The Amazigh died almost without a sound, his expression of alarm still fixed around the eyes. Somewhere far away, I felt a little sickened at the discovery that I\u2019d make a skilled and effective assassin. I pushed the thought farther away and concentrated on doing what needed to be done, dragging his body into Sidonie\u2019s bedchamber and hiding it on the far side of the bed where it was unlikely to be spotted at a careless glance. If anyone raised an alarm, every moment could be precious.</p><p>Once that was done, I yanked the dagger from his chest. His heart had long since stopped, and the wound didn\u2019t even bleed much. I cleaned my blade on his robes and gave it a quick whetting.</p><p>By now, the sleeping draught should have worked.</p><p>If it had worked.</p><p>I took a moment to gather myself, breathing slowly. The second guard, the one posted outside Bodeshmun\u2019s door, would be harder. I let myself into the corridor, listening. It was late and the palace was quiet. Downstairs, I could hear a few murmurs, but it seemed quiet upstairs. I soft-footed my way to Bodeshmun\u2019s quarters, holding the dagger low and hidden at my side.</p><p>I didn\u2019t give the second Amazigh guard time to react. I simply walked right up to him and pressed him against the door, shoving the dagger under his ribs, angling upward for his heart, clamping my left hand over his veiled mouth. He struggled briefly. I shoved the dagger harder, until I felt him shudder and go limp. With my left hand, I felt for the handle of the door and tried it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Locked.</p><p>I cursed silently, then listened intently for a moment. There were no sounds beyond the door. I eased my dagger from the guard\u2019s body, struggling to keep him braced upright. Worked the dagger in between the door and the frame, prying hard until I felt the latch give way with a brittle groan.</p><p>That done, I froze. If Bodeshmun wasn\u2019t unconscious, he would have heard the sound, and like as not, the scuffle, too. He might well be waiting on the far side of the door for me, smiling into his beard, prepared to blow a handful of death into my lungs.</p> <p>For a mercy, the door opened inward. Still holding the guard upright, I pushed the door open with one foot and heaved the guard\u2019s body inside, jumping quickly backward.</p><p>The guard\u2019s body fell heavily to the floor.</p><p>No Bodeshmun.</p><p>I glanced quickly around to confirm no one had come, then stepped inside, closing the door behind me. The narrow antechamber was empty but for the figure of the dead Amazigh. It was a dreadful thing to know how easily men died, fierce warriors or no. I didn\u2019t doubt the Amazigh\u2019s skills, but Bodeshmun had been right. They had no head for intrigue. I daresay Astegal had chosen them for their imposing and mysterious appearance, the very thing that had allowed me to deceive them.</p><p>There was a fire burning in the hearth beyond the antechamber, bright and merry. I thought about appearances and deception and drew my sword, approaching with care. A few paces before I reached the room, I paused and unwound my scarf.</p> <p>I remembered Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s training.</p><p>Leander\u2019s memories of my mother\u2019s training were with me, too.</p><p>I could smell wood-smoke and beeswax. Traces of a familiar aroma, sweet and faintly spicy. Perry brandy, doctored with herbs. An unexpected smell of soap.</p><p>And a sour odor beneath it.</p><p>Vomit.</p><p>I stepped into the salon, the blade angled before me. The fire crackled. Two chairs had been drawn up before it, a table between them. An open flagon of perry brandy sat on the table, two empty cups.</p> <p>Sidonie was slumped in one of the chairs, her head draped over one arm, a loose coil of hair dangling dangerously close to the fire. My heart leapt into my throat at the sight. I couldn\u2019t even tell if she was breathing.</p><p>As Bodeshmun would have planned.</p><p>He was slumped in the other chair, his bearded chin resting on his chest. One hand lay loose on his knee. The other arm hung at his side, fingers curled. I took a sharp breath, my thoughts racing like quicksilver.</p><p>\u201cSidonie!\u201d I whispered.</p><p>There was the merest sliver of a glint beneath Bodeshmun\u2019s eyelids.</p><p>I hurried to her side, stooped over her, and tucked the fire-heated lock of hair behind one ear. Felt at her throat for a pulse and sighed with genuine relief when I found it. Only then did I take a deep, surreptitious breath and hold it, turning toward Bodeshmun.</p><p>He was already rising from his chair, one palm cupped and raised, eyes glittering with triumph.</p><p>Lungs full, lips pursed.</p> <p>But I was ready, and I blew first.</p><p>I\u2019d always been quick.</p><p>Dust and ashes, a handful of gritty grey matter. What it was, I couldn\u2019t have said. Ptolemy Solon would have known. Bones of an innocent man hanged for a crime he didn\u2019t commit, mayhap. Gathered under a full moon, burned in a furnace fueled by heartwood, ground to dust by virgins with a mortar and pestle. It didn\u2019t matter. Bodeshmun expelled his breath in shock and gasped for air.</p><p>One gasp.</p><p>I didn\u2019t. I stepped backward with alacrity, wrenching Sidonie\u2019s chair out of the way. I held my breath until the dust settled, and then I watched Bodeshmun die.</p><p>He knew me.</p><p>Even dying, he saw through the semblance. I watched his face darken with recognition, fury, the onset of death. I waited, sword at the ready, until I was certain he carried no antidote to his own poison. Then I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou know me, don\u2019t you?\u201d I said to him. \u201cYou know who I am.\u201d</p><p>Bodeshmun glared, his chest heaving impotently.</p><p>I stooped over him, rummaging in his robes. I found it. It. The talisman, hidden in an inner pocket of his robes. A stiff piece of lacquered leather, wrought with an image. A whirlwind sprouting horns and claws. A word inscribed beneath it in Punic script.</p><p>A word I couldn\u2019t read.</p><p>Bodeshmun saw it; Bodeshmun knew. I read the bitter satisfaction in his dying face. I leaned down close to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAs it happens, Sidonie\u2019s been studying Punic. You\u2019ve only yourself to thank for it. And in case you wonder as you die, she was the architect of your downfall, not me.\u201d I settled onto my knees, my Amazigh robes puddling around me. \u201cIf you take no other thought into your next life, my lord, take this. It is not wise to meddle with D\u2019Angelines in matters of love.\u201d</p><p>Bodeshmun\u2019s eyes rolled into his head.</p><p>Bodeshmun\u2019s heels drummed.</p><p>Bodeshmun died.</p><p>Fourty-Nine</p><p>The sleeping draught was a problem.</p><p>\u201cWake up, love.\u201d I patted Sidonie\u2019s cheek gently, then not so gently. Nothing. I called her name sharply, as loudly as I dared, but she didn\u2019t respond. When I grabbed her shoulders and shook her roughly, her head only lolled in an alarming manner.</p><p>Her breathing was even and her heart beat steadily. Girom had said his draughts were potent. Elua willing, she would awaken; that I had to believe. But for the moment, she slept like the dead, and I was fearful that if I rolled her in Bodeshmun\u2019s carpet and hauled her all the way to the harbor, I was like to smother her in the process. Even if I didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t sure how Captain Deimos would react to the fact that I\u2019d abducted the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange, drugged insensible.</p><p>And if she didn\u2019t awaken by dawn . . .</p><p>Well, we had a few hours\u2019 grace. I\u2019d sooner have left the palace immediately, but no one was likely to notice aught amiss until the second shift of Sidonie\u2019s guards came to relieve their fellows.</p><p>I resolved to wait as long as I dared. I stowed Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman safely in my purse. I propped a chair under the door with the broken latch, lest anyone attempt to enter. I dragged the bodies of Bodeshmun and the guard into the far bedchamber. I cleaned and whetted my dagger a second time.</p><p>I waited.</p><p>Although it didn\u2019t seem to trouble her in the least, Sidonie\u2019s position in the chair looked uncomfortable. I eased her down to the carpeted floor, then cleared the carpet in preparation. I sat cross-legged, settling her head on my lap.</p><p>She looked younger sleeping, scarce older than the girl I\u2019d fallen in love with. We\u2019d known one another since we were children. I stroked the soft curve of her cheek, remembering. She\u2019d been a reserved child, unnervingly composed from an early age, regarding me with cool distrust. How not? She\u2019d grown up with the weight of the kingdom hovering over her, aware of the schisms that threatened to divide it.</p><p>And I . . . I\u2019d been damaged and brooding, filled with fierce passions and loyalties. How not? By the time I was eleven years old, I\u2019d seen and endured things no one should ever suffer.</p><p>Neither of us could possibly have understood the other.</p><p>It seemed so very long ago.</p><p>Ysandre used to force us to spend time together, the scions of House Courcel, hoping we would further our acquaintance. It made me smile now to think on it. Alais and I used to play cards together under the watchful eye of the Queen\u2019s Guard, while Sidonie ignored us and read a book.</p><p>I wished I could travel backward through time to address those childhood selves. To tell Sidonie that one day she would defy her mother and half the nation for the sake of this proud, wounded boy whom she regarded with such misgivings, that he would grow into a man she trusted beyond all reason. To tell my young self that this cool, haughty girl who galled him so would one day be the most precious thing in the world to him, that she would become a woman for whom he would willingly lay down his life.</p><p>I wished Sidonie would awaken.</p><p>An hour passed, then another. For a mercy, no one came to call on Bodeshmun. But Sidonie showed no signs of waking, either. I shook her, coaxed her, whispered and pleaded to no avail. Once, she sighed in her sleep and my heart leapt, but she only seemed to settle deeper into slumber.</p><p>At last I gave up. If I delayed any longer, I wouldn\u2019t reach the harbor in time. The palace would awaken and the alarm would be raised. I shifted Sidonie to the edge of the carpet.</p><p>\u201cSun Princess.\u201d I knelt beside her and kissed her sleeping lips. \u201cWe have to try this now. Don\u2019t you dare die on me, or I swear to Blessed Elua, I\u2019ll haunt you through a thousand lifetimes.\u201d</p><p>There was no answer. I raised her arms and crossed them in front of her face, hoping and praying that it would create a pocket of air that would keep her from smothering. Carefully, carefully, I rolled the most precious thing in the world to me into a carpet.</p><p>That done, I rewound the Amazigh scarf around my head and face. I moved the chair blocking Bodeshmun\u2019s door and checked the corridor.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I stooped and hoisted the rolled carpet with an effort, slinging it over my shoulder. It was heavy, heavier than I\u2019d reckoned. Sidonie sleeping was dead weight, and the carpet itself was dense and tightly woven.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. I could do it.</p><p>I carried her into the corridor, closing the door behind me, and made swiftly for the servants\u2019 stair. It was narrow and winding, and the ends of the rolled carpet scraped harshly against the stone walls. I had to use both hands to keep my burden balanced, navigating the narrow steps awkwardly. By the time I reached the bottom, the guard posted on the lower floor was already looking curiously toward the stairwell. Keeping my head averted, I laid down the carpet and beckoned to him, moving as though to unroll the carpet and reveal somewhat of interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Ba\u2019al\u2014\u201d he began, bending over to see.</p><p>In one swift motion, I unsheathed my dagger and drove it under his chin, angling for the brain. He made a choked sound, and I covered his mouth. His wide, terrified eyes met mine.</p><p>It was one of the Carthaginians, one I knew by sight. The guard who\u2019d told me that Astegal was likely to move against Serafin, one of the more decent fellows. I wished it hadn\u2019t been him. I remembered him grumbling about fighting a winter war. He must have thought himself lucky when he\u2019d gotten this posting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>His body went limp with death. Blood dripped onto the rolled carpet between us. I stepped over the carpet and wrestled him over to the wine cellar door. This one was unlocked; Astegal had preferred to set a guard on the wine-cellar rather than suffer any delays in his revels, and Bodeshmun hadn\u2019t bothered to alter his order. I dragged the guard\u2019s body into the dark cellar, then sprinted upstairs to retrieve Sidonie.</p><p>Still dead weight.</p><p>Once I closed the cellar door behind us, it was pitch black. I paused for a moment, willing my eyes to adjust, but there was simply no light. Step by step, I descended, balancing Sidonie and the carpet on my shoulder.</p><p>At the bottom, I stumbled over the guard\u2019s legs. The carpet lurched. I caught myself and steadied my burden. Kratos hadn\u2019t said where the outer delivery door was located, and I hadn\u2019t thought to ask. I wished there had been more time to go over the details of our plan with Sidonie. With her practical mind, it would have occurred to her that I\u2019d be mired in darkness here.</p><p>Gods, I hoped she wasn\u2019t suffocating.</p><p>I began making my way blindly through the cellar, one hand steadying my burden, the other outstretched. I blundered into kegs, barked my shins. I had to turn this way and that, losing all sense of direction.</p><p>No good.</p><p>I closed my eyes and breathed slowly. Darkness within darkness. I could do this. Leander Maignard could do it in his sleep. A child\u2019s training game, nothing more. I lowered the heavy carpet to the cool stones of the floor, turning it in such a manner that Sidonie\u2019s face was sideways\u2014or at least so I hoped.</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI have to leave you for a moment. But I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Without the burden, I was able to move more swiftly, both hands extended. Five paces forward, and my way was blocked by a wall of wine-kegs. I turned to the left. Seven paces, another wall of kegs. Right, and then right again. Step by step, I negotiated the mundane labyrinth until my hands encountered cool stone. I sidled along the wall until I felt wood beneath my fingertips.</p><p>A door.</p><p>I threw the bar and wrenched it open, feeling a blast of cool night air on my veiled face. Elua, it felt good!</p><p>There was no moon, but there were hazy stars. What light there was was faint, not nearly enough to illuminate the cellar, but I could make my way to it. All I had to do was retrace my steps in darkness. I sidled back along the wall. Twelve swift steps; I\u2019d counted. Left, then left again. Right, seven paces. Five paces forward. I stooped, feeling along the floor.</p><p>No carpet.</p><p>I closed my eyes again and fought off a wave of panic. What was wrong? I\u2019d been cautious on the outward journey. I\u2019d hurried back. I\u2019d taken bigger steps. Somehow, I\u2019d reached a wrong aisle.</p><p>I made my way back to the open door and tried again, taking careful little steps. When my reaching fingers brushed the rolled carpet, I nearly wept with relief. Once more, I shouldered my burden.</p><p>Outside, the air tasted so sweet, I had to loosen my scarf for a moment and breathe it deeply. I thought about laying Sidonie down, unrolling the carpet to make certain she was alive. But then I heard Carthaginian voices muttering in the gardens\u2014some of Astegal\u2019s guards, making their rounds. So instead, I retucked my scarf and set out at a brisk walk.</p><p>The carpet was still dead weight.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before my left shoulder began to ache. I shifted my burden to the other shoulder, heaving and ducking. Heavy, so heavy! I\u2019d carried Sidonie in my arms a dozen times, a hundred times. But this was the one that mattered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blessed Elua, please let her live.</p><p>At least it was downhill. We entered the streets of New Carthage. There were no Aragonians abroad at this hour, only Astegal\u2019s patrols. I strode past them, acknowledging their curious greetings with curt nods. I was a veiled Amazigh bent on some unspeakable errand.</p><p>I was a ghost.</p> <p>An aching ghost.</p><p>I carried Sidonie. I carried my guilt\u2014our guilt. The murdered guards. My slain wife, Dorelei. Our lost son. All of it. I carried all of it, tired and terrified. I kept going. I thought about the night that Ph\u00e8dre, Joscelin, and I had rowed to Kapporeth. Joscelin, his bleeding hands on the oars. We had both known failure once. In Skaldia, he\u2019d surrendered to despair. In Vralia, so had I.</p><p>Not there.</p><p>Not here.</p><p>I prayed to Blessed Elua and his Companions, making every step a word in my litany. And as I neared the harbor, with the night sky dimming, I felt the burden on my right shoulder stir feebly. I hurried my steps, hurried to the wharf.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d I shouted at Captain Deimos\u2019 ship. \u201cLend a hand!\u201d</p><p>Kratos hustled down the plank, blessed Kratos, his blunt-featured face suffused with alarm. He eased the carpet from my shoulder, carried it in both arms aboard the ship. I followed. Deimos was waiting, watchful, arms folded. On the deck of his ship, Kratos and I unrolled the carpet with reverent hands. I knelt beside it, anxious.</p><p>A very tousled Sidonie blinked sleepily at me. \u201cImriel?\u201d</p><p>My eyes stung. \u201cYes, love.\u201d</p><p>She blinked again, touching my veiled face. \u201cLook at you. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t want to drink, but Bodeshmun was suspicious. I had to do it. Are we aboard the ship? Why aren\u2019t we fleeing?\u201d</p><p>I nodded at Captain Deimos. \u201cTell him.\u201d</p> <p>Deimos leaned over her. \u201cYour highness?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed. \u201cName of Elua, go!\u201d</p><p>Fifty</p><p>Ptolemy Solon had chosen well in Captain Deimos. He was in truth a man of his word, and he knew a royal command when he heard one. By the time I escorted Sidonie down to the ship\u2019s hold, where we\u2019d both be out of sight until we passed the harbor patrol, the oars were out and the ship was moving.</p><p>Safe at last, at least for the moment, we held one another for a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your back?\u201d I murmured at length.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It hurts.\u201d She gazed up at me. \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cFine. I\u2019d nearly forgotten about it. Let me send Kratos to fetch my things. I brought salve and clean bandages.\u201d</p> <p>Sidonie glanced around the hold and wrinkled her nose. \u201cIt can wait until we\u2019ve cleared the harbor. I daresay it\u2019s cleaner above-deck. Imriel . . .\u201d She hesitated, almost afraid to ask. \u201cDid you get the talisman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I fished the piece of lacquered leather out of my purse and showed it to her.</p><p>She perched on a water barrel, studying it. \u201cSuch an insignificant scrap of a thing,\u201d she mused. \u201c\u2019Tis hard to believe it\u2019s the key for undoing a spell that put the entire City of Elua under its sway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike as not it\u2019s far more complicated and disgusting than it looks,\u201d I observed. \u201cHide tanned from the skin of a stillborn babe or somewhat. At any rate, according to Solon, it\u2019s the word of binding that matters. Can you read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElua, I hope so. I can speak more than a little, but I can\u2019t read much. I was only just beginning to learn the Punic alphabet.\u201d Her lips moved as she studied the Punic script. \u201cEmmen . . . emmenghanom. Emmenghanom.\u201d Sidonie looked up in triumph. \u201cIt means beholden.\u201d</p><p>I cupped her face and kissed her. \u201cGods be thanked that you\u2019re not one to suffer tedium in idleness, love. I told Bodeshmun you\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>There was somewhat adamant in her expression. \u201cTell me how. Tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>I told her all that had transpired. When I told her how Bodeshmun had died and what I\u2019d said to him at the end, she smiled with grim satisfaction. \u201cGood. How did you know what he was going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed a young Aragonian lord the same way.\u201d I kept forgetting there were gaps in her knowledge. \u201cIn front of an entire hall full of people.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shuddered. \u201cElua! No wonder they hated me so, thinking I\u2019d betrayed Aragonia to subject them to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know that. And I didn\u2019t give them any reason to think otherwise.\u201d She gazed into the distance, and I knew she was thinking of things she\u2019d rather not remember. I kept my silence, waiting until her gaze returned to me. The familiar spark leapt between us. Sidonie took my hand and kissed it. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m sorry for what you had to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I for what you endured,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, my end of it was easy.\u201d A little of her humor returned. \u201cAfter all, I slept through most of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed.\u201d I kissed her.</p><p>She returned my kiss. \u201cDo you know, I even love you covered in . . . Imriel, what are you covered in?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed at my face with one flowing sleeve. \u201cPork grease and ashes.\u201d I glanced down at my Amazigh robe. The dark indigo hid the stains, but the second guard had bled freely on me. \u201cAnd a fair amount of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshes and blood.\u201d Sidonie traced a line down my face. \u201cI pray this is the last of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI too,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d Kratos poked his head into the hold. \u201cWe\u2019re well under way; it\u2019s safe now.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cCaptain Deimos wants a word with you.\u201d</p><p>We emerged from the hold to find the sails full and the ship moving briskly. The Cytheran sailors went about their business, casting curious glances at us, or more accurately, at Sidonie. Deimos was pacing the foredeck, his hands clasped behind his back. He fetched up before us, offering Sidonie a bow.</p><p>\u201cYour highness,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cWelcome. I am Deimos Stanakides, in the service of his eminence Ptolemy Solon, the Governor of Cythera. I presume you are Sidonie de la Courcel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She inclined her head. \u201cWell met, my lord captain. On behalf of Terre d\u2019Ange, I extend our most profound gratitude to you and to Ptolemy Solon. The service you have rendered us today will never be forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Deimos smiled tightly. \u201cSave your gratitude. We\u2019re not safe yet. And I\u2019m not satisfied.\u201d He fixed his intent gaze on me. \u201cSolon doesn\u2019t suffer fools, Leander Maignard. Why did the princess call you Imriel?\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s my name,\u201d I said simply. I unbuckled my sword-belt and let it fall. Dragged the Amazigh robes over my head. \u201cDo you require proof of my words, my lord? Ptolemy Solon himself wrought this semblance with his magics, all the better to undo what Carthage has done.\u201d I pried off Leander\u2019s boots and stood barefooted on the deck. Undid the laces of Leander\u2019s shirt and hauled it off me. Once again, I\u2019d worn my own breeches. \u201cThere. See and believe.\u201d</p><p>Deimos paled.</p><p>An excited murmur ran around the ship.</p><p>I bowed. \u201cImriel de la Courcel, my lord. Well met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer ladyship\u2019s son,\u201d Deimos whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor better or for worse, yes,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>He glanced at Sidonie. \u201cAnd you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove him?\u201d she suggested. \u201cYes, very much so. As much as I love my country and wish to save it from the same foul magics that bound me.\u201d Her hand reached for mine, our fingers entwining. \u201cMy lord captain, I implore you. Make haste for Marsilikos. Lives beyond our own hang in the balance.\u201d</p><p>Captain Deimos licked his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>Once Deimos was convinced, all seemed well. We sailed northward, hugging the Aragonian coast. Three days passed without incident.</p><p>Sidonie and I shared the master cabin. The first thing I did was scour myself with soap and fresh water, washing the guise of grease and ashes from my skin. The second was to inspect the wound I\u2019d inflicted on her.</p><p>\u201cIs it bad?\u201d She craned her neck, trying to see.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good.\u201d The patch of raw flesh between her shoulder blades was red and angry, weeping clear liquid. I bathed it with unwatered wine, making her hiss between clenched teeth. I swabbed it with the salve Kratos had bought, bound it with clean bandages. \u201cYou need a proper chirurgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarsilikos,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cI\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>I made love to her at her insistence. Careful, always careful. Elua knows, it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want her, but I feared hurting her worse. I\u2019d injured her badly a-purpose, and I never wanted to do it again. But she knew us better than I did. Knew what she needed, knew what I needed.</p><p>Her.</p><p>Us.</p><p>Kratos was enchanted by her. It made me laugh. He\u2019d grown tolerably fond of Leander and some of that had passed on to me, mixed with a measure of newfound respect; but Sidonie enthralled him.</p><p>\u201cImagine!\u201d Kratos marveled. \u201cHere I was thinking my best years were behind me, prepared to die a broken-down useless slave, and instead I helped rescue a princess who\u2019s as brave as she is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie smiled at him with genuine warmth. \u201cAnd you\u2019re as gallant as you are clever, messire. Imriel told me you were the one conceived the plan to get Astegal\u2019s ring. For that alone, I\u2019m forever in your debt.\u201d</p><p>He turned red. \u201cIt was an honor, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never spoke that nicely to Leander Maignard,\u201d I observed to Sidonie. \u201cIn fact, you teased him rather mercilessly.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a sidelong glance. \u201cWell, not at the end. But you must admit, that pomade made a rather absurd first impression.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOh, I know. I\u2019ve not forgotten the stench of it.\u201d</p><p>Mostly, during those first days, Sidonie and I spent long hours talking\u2014or at least I did. She wanted to know everything, wanted all the gaps in her knowledge filled. And she wanted to know about Cythera and my mother and Ptolemy Solon. I talked myself dry, exploring feelings I hadn\u2019t had time to consider. I told her what it had been like believing myself Leander, and about the way he\u2019d changed. About the things that had affected him: her, the Aragonian boy in the slave-market. Sidonie listened gravely, although she didn\u2019t try to hide her amusement when I told her about Sunjata.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy yourself?\u201d she asked, eyes dancing.</p><p>\u201cLeander did,\u201d I said wryly. \u201cWhich is a passing odd memory to hold.\u201d</p><p>At that, Sidonie looked away. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove.\u201d I took her hand lightly. \u201cYou can speak of it. Believe me, there\u2019s nothing you could say that I couldn\u2019t bear to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her fingers stirred in mine. \u201cOne day I will. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it take as long as it takes.\u201d I stroked her fingers. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak of what the Mahrkagir did to me for months, and then only to Ph\u00e8dre. After that, it was years before I spoke of it again. Just don\u2019t close me out.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie squeezed my hand. \u201cI won\u2019t. But it\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI know. It\u2019s awful in a different way. I was there, I saw. And I have the misfortune of having escorted Astegal to Jasmine House, where his performance appeared to be received with considerable satisfaction by not one, but two adepts. So if you think you\u2019re going to shock and horrify me, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quirked. \u201cThere\u2019s a question most men would have asked by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I took her chin in my hand, turning her reluctant face toward mine. \u201cDo you want me to ask it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tears stood in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you said what?\u201d I asked gently. \u201cThat you never felt the very gods themselves were attendant on your love-making with Astegal? That you never experienced his feelings as surely as your own, as though you were one person in separate skins? That it wasn\u2019t intimate and glorious and terrifying all at once?\u201d</p><p>She smiled through her tears. \u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cSidonie, if I didn\u2019t know that without having to ask, I might as well go back to Carthage and take up with Sunjata.\u201d</p><p>That made her laugh and the moment passed. It was all right, I thought. Sidonie had borne the first blow of knowledge with amazing resilience, but she\u2019d warned me it might not last. It was good that we\u2019d begun to speak of it.</p><p>In time, she would heal.</p><p>And I knew a thing or two about dealing with the burden of unwarranted guilt. As long as we were together, we could survive anything.</p><p>Thus was my positive state of mind on the fourth day of our journey, when our luck changed.</p><p>It was Captain Deimos who summoned us to the aft deck of the ship and pointed toward the south. I shaded my eyes and squinted, making out the distant form of a war-ship riding the choppy grey waters behind us.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being pursued,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cAnd they\u2019re fast.\u201d</p><p>Fifty-One</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Sidonie asked, her voice strained.</p><p>Deimos gave a curt nod. \u201cFairly. The captain Astegal left in charge of the harbor reserve is no fool. I doubt it took him long to realize he granted us passage on the very day the princess and Leander Maignard vanished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve three choices. We can try to outrace them long enough to put ashore at the next port, but I reckon we\u2019re only a couple of leagues south of Am\u00edlcar, and it\u2019s blockaded. We can take to open water and pray they\u2019re not foolhardy enough to follow. Or we can surrender.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sidonie said.</p><p>We glanced at one another. \u201cOpen water?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPlease, my lord captain. It\u2019s very, very important.\u201d</p> <p>Deimos\u2019 lips moved in a silent prayer. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>He strode along the deck, shouting orders. His sailors scrambled to obey. The ship\u2019s prow swung toward the east, nosing away from the Aragonian coast.</p><p>Sidonie shivered. \u201cI thought we had enough of a lead to get away.\u201d</p><p>I took off the cloak I was wearing\u2014Leander\u2019s cloak, striped and gaudy\u2014and draped it over her shoulders. I didn\u2019t like her color. Her face was unwontedly pale, hectic slashes of pink high on her cheeks. \u201cSo did I. Lord Gillimas must have known enough to realize we took Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman and sent one of their fastest war-ships after us.\u201d I felt at her brow. \u201cYou\u2019re hot.\u201d</p><p>She shivered again. \u201cI feel cold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me have a look at your back.\u201d I led her to our cabin and examined her. The wound was worse, swollen and inflamed. I bathed it and dressed it as best I could, wishing I were one of Eisheth\u2019s scions with healing in my bones and trying not to let her hear concern in my voice. \u201cJust think, if you were an anguissette, this would be healing cleanly.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie made a face. \u201cYes, and you\u2019d have to worry about me bedding your mother.\u201d</p><p>I shot her a mortified look. \u201cPerish the thought!\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWell, at least mayhap I\u2019d be racing toward Terre d\u2019Ange with the Name of God rolling like thunder on my tongue, prepared to grapple with a servant of the One God himself, instead of hoping to free a demon from a stone using a term from my latest Punic language lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeholden,\u201d I said. \u201cLift your arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmenghanom.\u201d She said the word aloud. \u201cSay it, Imriel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmmeghamon,\u201d I echoed, winding the bandages around her.</p><p>\u201cEm-men-gha-nom.\u201d Sidonie enunciated each syllable with deliberate clarity. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>I tied the last knot and met her overbright gaze. \u201cEm . . . Emmenghanom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d She pulled up her gown and began lacing the bodice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to survive this, Sidonie,\u201d I murmured. \u201cBoth of us are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being practical,\u201d she said. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>She was right, of course. Practical and right. I said the word over and over, Sidonie correcting my accent and inflection.</p><p>When I had it to her satisfaction, she nodded. \u201cGood. You won\u2019t forget?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It was a long, unsettling day. Not long after we\u2019d turned into the open waters, a fierce headwind sprang up against us. There was a good reason Captain Deimos had feared this passage, a good reason precious few ships undertook major journeys during the winter months. Our ship bucked and surged like an unbroken horse, riding the waves, struggling to sail in the face of battening winds.</p><p>And our pursuer followed.</p><p>There was no doubt of it, not now. By the time the shrouded sun sank below the horizon, it had drawn near enough that we could all see the crimson-striped sail that marked it as Carthaginian and the triple bank of oars that lent it speed.</p><p>I slept fitfully that night, holding Sidonie in my arms.</p><p>Her skin was too hot, worrying me.</p><p>In the morning, our pursuer had drawn nearer. Our oarsmen rowed, groaning. Captain Deimos paced the deck. It didn\u2019t matter; none of it mattered. The headwinds from the north were too strong. The Carthaginian war-ship with its striped sail gained steadily on us.</p><p>I prayed for something, anything. I prayed for good winds. I prayed we\u2019d find the balance of the D\u2019Angeline fleet awaiting us.</p><p>No luck.</p><p>The Carthaginian ship overtook us. It came along broadside, blocking our passage. A trebuchet mounted on its central tower thrummed, sending bolts our way. One tore through our topmost sail.</p><p>We turned tail and fled.</p><p>Back, back the way we\u2019d come, racing before the wind now behind us. Deimos tried to make for land, but the Carthaginian ship raced alongside us, herded us onward. In the distance, I saw the harbor of Am\u00edlcar, blocked by a solid blockade of Carthage\u2019s fleet. Our pursuer was driving us into their arms.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d Captain Deimos accorded Sidonie an exacting bow. \u201cForgive me, your highness. I did my best.\u201d</p><p>Her voice rose. \u201cMy lord, we cannot surrender!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not be harmed,\u201d Deimos said. \u201cEither of you. You\u2019re too valuable as hostages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, mayhap.\u201d Sidonie shook her head in impatient despair. \u201cNot now. Astegal would never let either of us go, not knowing we have the key to undoing Bodeshmun\u2019s spell. The only reason to keep us alive is to keep Terre d\u2019Ange and Alba from acting by threatening them with our deaths.\u201d She eyed the rough seas. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019d serve my country better by drowning than being taken alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feverish, your highness,\u201d Deimos said to her, and to me, \u201cTalk sense to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain, she\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cIs there no chance of running the blockade? At least in Am\u00edlcar we\u2019ll find sanctuary of a sort.\u201d</p><p>He gestured. \u201cLook at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be able to make it.\u201d Sidonie clutched my arm. \u201cYou\u2019re a strong swimmer, Imriel. One man might be able to slip past the ships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too far,\u201d Deimos said. \u201cThe water\u2019s too cold.\u201d</p><p>I gauged the distance. \u201cEven so. If it\u2019s our only chance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire the ship,\u201d Kratos said abruptly behind me.</p><p>I turned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Kratos jerked his chin at the fast-approaching blockade. \u201cYou want to break their line? Set fire to the ship and bear down on them at full speed. I guarantee you, they\u2019ll move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that work?\u201d I asked Deimos.</p><p>He looked ill. \u201cMayhap. It\u2019s dangerous as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKratos, I adore you!\u201d Sidonie planted a kiss on his cheek. \u201cMy lord captain, please. A slight chance is better than none. You\u2019re not like to find much mercy from Astegal either.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in Deimos\u2019 jaw twitched. \u201cBy the Goddess,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m never swearing another oath as long as I live.\u201d</p><p>He gave the order, though. His men worked frantically, breaking open kegs of strong spirits and dousing the entire ship, others finding a last surge of strength at the oars. When it came down to it, I daresay no one wanted to be taken by Carthage after assisting in the abduction of Astegal\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cI want you to wait near the landing-boat,\u201d Deimos said to us in a taut voice. \u201cThe timing of this is going to be difficult.\u201d He pointed. \u201cThere are catapults on the fortress at the end of the mole. That\u2019s the point beyond which Carthage\u2019s ships don\u2019t dare venture. If we can get past it without foundering, we\u2019ll drop the landing-boat and row for shore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Captain Deimos.\u201d Sidonie met his gaze. Shivering and feverish, she was still very much in possession of her faculties. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry to have put you and your men in this position.\u201d</p><p>His face softened. \u201cYou didn\u2019t, my lady. My lord Ptolemy Solon did. But I reckon if I were D\u2019Angeline, I\u2019d be proud to serve you.\u201d</p><p>I fetched my things from our cabin, or at least what I could wear. My sword-belt, Dorelei\u2019s vambraces, the torc the Cruarch had given me. I found a piece of oilcloth and carefully wrapped Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman in it, stowing it in my purse along with the croonie-stone and a handful of coins.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we founder?\u201d Sidonie asked. \u201cYou\u2019ll be weighted down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t make it past the blockade?\u201d I countered. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be taken alive.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cDid Joscelin ever teach you how to perform the terminus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was the act of last, desperate measure for a Cassiline Brother unable to protect his charge, one that ended in the death of both protector and protected. \u201cSidonie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d She took my hand and laid it against her heart. \u201cBelieve me when I tell you I would far rather die by your hand than be restored to Astegal. Even if he is tolerably good in bed.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. I settled for nodding.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Sidonie released my hand.</p><p>We watched the blockade approach. All along the ship, Deimos\u2019 men stood by with lit torches. Gods, it was going to be a near thing. If he gave the order too soon, we\u2019d go up in a blaze before we reached the harbor. Too late, and the Carthaginian ships wouldn\u2019t have time to maneuver out of the way.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kratos?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>I glanced around. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Captain Deimos shouted.</p><p>The fire caught instantly in a dozen places, sudden and terrifying. It raced along the railing, crawled along the hull, raged upward along the lines. Now Deimos\u2019 men ran wildly to-and-fro, dashing buckets of water on the flames. It wasn\u2019t for the sake of show; the ship was at risk of becoming an inferno.</p><p>We were still under sail, bearing down on Carthage\u2019s blockade, close enough that we could hear shouts of alarm ringing out over the water. Through the flames and billowing smoke, I could see banks of oars churning the waters and ships moving, getting hastily out of our way. My eyes were stinging and my lungs starting to burn. I wrapped my arms around Sidonie as though I could protect her from the fire.</p><p>\u201cHere, my lord!\u201d Kratos\u2019 voice, harsh and coughing. He flung a sodden bed-linen sheet over my shoulders. \u201cDrape yourself and her highness. Cover your mouths.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed gratefully, then saw he hadn\u2019t one for himself. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Kratos shook his head. \u201cNo time.\u201d</p><p>It was a piece of madness. Sailors dashed, hurling buckets, but they\u2019d done their job too well. The entire ship was ablaze. The sails were on fire, and our progress was faltering. We\u2019d won our way past the blockade, but we hadn\u2019t cleared the mole.</p><p>High overhead, one of the yardarms gave way, crashing to the deck in flurry of fiery sparks. Someone cried out in agonizing pain. Sparks landed and sizzled on the damp linen wrapped around us. The ship wallowed, flaming.</p><p>And behind us, looming through the smoke and flames, the Carthaginian war-ship that had dogged our wake passed the blockade and continued its pursuit.</p><p>\u201cTo the landing-boat, men!\u201d Deimos\u2019 voice roared. \u201cTo oars!\u201d</p><p>They came, staggering, soot-blackened and singed. Not all of them. There were at least seven Cytheran sailors who didn\u2019t survive that desperate gambit. Those who did worked with frantic hands, undoing the knots that held the landing-boat, lowering it into the water. Two held it in place with grappling poles. Others clambered over the railing, dropping into the smaller vessel. The first to gain his feet reached up, gesturing to me.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I didn\u2019t wait for Sidonie\u2019s answer, but swung her over the railing, lowering her. The sailor below caught and steadied her. Kratos\u2019 linen sheet slipped from my shoulders. I felt a blast of heat against my back. Deimos was already in the boat, ordering his men to the benches.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Kratos shouted, shielding me.</p><p>\u201cYou first, old man!\u201d I stooped and caught him under the knee in a wrestling move he\u2019d taught me himself, heaving him unceremoniously over the railing. There were shouts below from the men who broke his fall. The sailors holding the landing-boat in place with grappling poles grimaced. I vaulted the railing and let myself drop. One of them followed suit.</p><p>The other didn\u2019t. The flames had caught him.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Deimos shouted. \u201cGo, go, go!\u201d</p><p>They were good men, Ptolemy Solon\u2019s men. They bent their backs to the oars, churning the grey waters to a frenzy. Behind us, the wreck of the ship foundered and burned, throwing off sparks of fire and burning matter. The Carthaginian war-ship was forced to give it a wide berth.</p><p>Before us, a scant twenty yards away, lay the mole and the fortress.</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d Deimos chanted.</p><p>I wanted to reach Sidonie, but I didn\u2019t dare. There was an open bench near me. I slid into it and grasped the oar shaft. I bent my back with the others, dipping and hauling for all I was worth. The light landing-boat shot across the choppy waters.</p><p>The massive trireme bore down on us, its sails full-bellied, propelled by three banks of oars.</p><p>From the fortress on the mole came a resonant thrumming sound. Am\u00edlcar\u2019s defenders were loosing the great catapults. The first missile, a boulder large enough that two men\u2019s arms couldn\u2019t have circled it, passed low over our heads and landed behind our stern. A geyser of water shot up.</p><p>\u201cRow, lads!\u201d Deimos shouted. \u201cRow, damn you!\u201d</p><p>We doubled our efforts.</p><p>I\u2019d taken a shift the night we\u2019d rowed to Kapporeth, Joscelin, Ph\u00e8dre, and I, following the stars. And I\u2019d pulled my weight on a Vralian ship during the storm that led to a shipwreck. Those had been long, grueling affairs. This was short and urgent. Life or death would be decided in a matter of yards. The wood of the oar shaft felt hot beneath my hands, burning from the friction of my skin.</p><p>We surged past the fortress.</p><p>The catapults thrummed and thudded.</p><p>But not against us. Am\u00edlcar\u2019s defenders were well-armed and determined. They might not know who we were, but they knew Carthage was against us. They loosed a barrage against our lone pursuer. At least one missile struck true. The Carthaginian ship slowed, taking on water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d Deimos said grimly. \u201cRow!\u201d</p><p>The port grew closer. We were well inside the mole. I spared a glance over my shoulder and saw the wounded Carthaginian ship beginning to founder. I whispered a prayer of thanks to Blessed Elua.</p><p>Our pace slowed as we drew into the harbor.</p> <p>Am\u00edlcar.</p><p>Even in the midst of terror and urgency, it made me feel strange seeing it again. I\u2019d seen it as a child. It was here that the Carthaginian slave-traders had sold me to a Menekhetan merchant. It was from this very harbor that I\u2019d set sail toward horror; and now I was back, seeking sanctuary in a besieged city. Strange, indeed.</p><p>There was a large contingent of armed men awaiting us on the dock. Archers with crossbows were arrayed in two ranks, one kneeling, one standing behind them. All held their weapons cocked and ready. A mounted man watched us intently, a lean fellow, his cheeks pitted with old pox scars.</p><p>\u201cPeace!\u201d I called in Aragonian. \u201cWe come seeking sanctuary!\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>Fifty-Two</p><p>I got carefully to my feet, raising my hands to show they were empty, and made my way forward to where Sidonie was shivering in the prow. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d I whispered to her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCold.\u201d</p><p>I helped her stand. None of Deimos\u2019 men moved. The archers on the dock kept their crossbows trained on us. \u201cWe bear her highness Sidonie de la Courcel, the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange,\u201d I called. \u201cFreed from Carthage\u2019s grasp.\u201d</p><p>The mounted man spat. \u201cCarthage\u2019s bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo longer.\u201d Sidonie was wavering on her feet, but her voice was steady. \u201cMessire, if you bear any love for either of our countries, you will welcome us ashore.\u201d</p> <p>For a long moment, he hesitated, surveying our exhausted, singed, sooty human cargo. Kratos was huddled in the prow, grimacing. Sidonie and I stood. Everyone else, Deimos included, simply leaned on their oars.</p><p>\u201cDown,\u201d the mounted man said at last to his archers. \u201cI am Vitor Gait\u00e1n, captain of the Harbor Watch,\u201d he said to us. \u201cI will take you into custody. What happens then is for Serafin to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my kinsman,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cI need to speak with him immediately.\u201d</p><p>Vitor Gait\u00e1n eyed her. \u201cThat\u2019s for Serafin to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs a chirurgeon is what she needs,\u201d I said. The man opened his mouth to reply. \u201cAnd no, that\u2019s not for Serafin to decide.\u201d</p><p>Gait\u00e1n\u2019s men secured the landing-boat and helped us ashore, then marched us through the streets of Am\u00edlcar. Gods, we were a sorry lot! Kratos was among the worst, blisters rising on his back, his shirt scorched to holes. To compound matters, he\u2019d broken a rib or two in the fall when I\u2019d heaved him over the railing. Still, he shrugged off my apologies. \u201cOne of the last fellows didn\u2019t make it,\u201d Kratos said soberly. \u201cLike as not that would have been me. I\u2019m not as quick as you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>There were a good many folk on the streets, watching with curiosity. The mood in Am\u00edlcar was markedly different than New Carthage. It was a city holding out in the early stages of a siege, tense, jubilant, and defiant.</p><p>That, I thought, would change.</p> <p>Vitor Gait\u00e1n led us to a park where a makeshift infirmary of tents had been erected and called for chirurgeons to attend our wounded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off to report to Serafin,\u201d he said to us. \u201cWhat happens then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go,\u201d Sidonie said wearily.</p><p>I sat with her on one of the cots while we waited. There were two chirurgeons on hand, but she wouldn\u2019t allow either of them to examine her, insisting that they tend first to the injured among Deimos\u2019 men.</p><p>\u201cHow many of them died?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>\u201cSeven or eight,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d I took her hand. \u201cSidonie, Bodeshmun threatened to have my eyes put out and my tongue cut from my head if I was merely careless. Astegal might have kept you alive as a hostage if they\u2019d caught us, but I think the rest of us would have been dead or wishing we were. And if we succeed, far more lives will be saved than lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She gazed into the distance. \u201cIt\u2019s still a hard cost to bear. None of them had any stake in this. They were just obeying orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said.</p><p>She glanced at me. \u201cThank you for not trying to soften it.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before we heard the sound of a carriage approaching, and then a woman\u2019s voice angrily addressing the guards Vitor Gait\u00e1n had left posted to watch over us. It was a voice I knew, and one I never thought I\u2019d be so grateful to hear. We got to our feet as Nicola L\u2019Envers y Aragon entered the chirurgeons\u2019 tent.</p><p>\u201cName of Elua!\u201d She stopped short, staring at Sidonie. \u201cIt is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell met, Lady Nicola,\u201d Sidonie said a bit unsteadily. \u201cI regret the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat . . .\u201d Nicola paused, then shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a spell,\u201d I said. \u201cDire magics. Half of Terre d\u2019Ange hasn\u2019t gone mad, and Sidonie didn\u2019t willingly betray Aragonia. We\u2019ll gladly explain the entire matter to you, but Sidonie needs to be seen by a chirurgeon. She has an injury that\u2019s healing badly and she\u2019s burning up with fever.\u201d</p><p>Nicola looked at me in bewilderment. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten half of my scorched attire was yet Leander\u2019s. Ptolemy Solon wove a tight spell. \u201cImriel, my lady.\u201d I sat on the cot and began hauling off Leander\u2019s boots. \u201c\u2019Tis another piece of sorcery\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Sidonie touched my arm. \u201cYou\u2019ll only have to go through it again. Better to do it all at once, so they\u2019ll believe. Your son Serafin\u2019s taken charge of the resistance and declared himself regent in exile?\u201d she asked Nicola.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She regarded us with continued bemusement.</p><p>Sidonie took a deep breath. \u201cThen we need to speak with him and whoever else is in command here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you see a chirurgeon,\u201d I added.</p><p>I daresay Lady Nicola thought we were both mad or fevered, but she escorted us both quickly from the tent and into her carriage. There the three of us sat in awkward silence. Sidonie was still shivering. I read the doubt and uncertainty on Nicola\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me a spotted horse,\u201d I said to her. \u201cYou said his name was . . .\u201d I searched my memory. \u201cHierax. Hierax, but the Tsingani who bred and trained him called him the Bastard.\u201d</p><p>Her violet eyes widened. \u201cBlessed Elua! Imriel?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe. But please, trust us long enough to hear us out.\u201d</p><p>Nicola leaned out the window and called to the driver. \u201cHurry, please.\u201d</p><p>She took us to the Count\u2019s palace\u2014or what had been the Count\u2019s palace. Count Fernan had been killed in a skirmish outside New Carthage. It was a solid building of grey granite, located in the Plaza del Rey at the heart of the city. There, she led us to a pleasant guest-chamber where we were able to wash the worst of the soot and smoke from our skin, and sent for her own chirurgeon, a capable Eisandine woman named Rachel. Lady Nicola stayed in the room while Rachel examined Sidonie. She caught her breath at the sight of the inflamed wound.</p><p>\u201cWhat did this to you?\u201d the chirurgeon asked.</p><p>Sidonie met my eyes. \u201cA paring knife. Does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d Rachel swabbed the wound. \u201cI need to apply a poultice to draw the poisonous humors. You\u2019ll have to be still for a full day and not disturb it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Sidonie shifted restlessly. \u201cNot until I\u2019ve addressed Serafin and the others.\u201d</p><p>The chirurgeon made a disapproving sound.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d I said to Rachel.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll clean and dress it, and give you willow-bark tea for the fever. But mind, if you don\u2019t heed me quickly, it will start to putrefy. And once that happens, a mere poultice won\u2019t suffice. I\u2019ll have to induce maggots into the wound to devour the rotten flesh. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie merely nodded. \u201cMy thanks.\u201d</p><p>The chirurgeon Rachel sent her young Aragonian assistant to brew the tea, then finished binding the injury. Sidonie was sitting up and drinking the willow-bark tea obediently when a man who could only be Serafin L\u2019Envers y Aragon entered the room unceremoniously. His olive-skinned features and straight black hair were Aragonian, but he had the violet eyes that marked so many of House L\u2019Envers.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you await my orders?\u201d he asked his mother.</p><p>Nicola raised her brows. \u201cTo receive my kinswoman, the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange? I wasn\u2019t aware it was necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at war with the woman\u2019s husband, Mother.\u201d Serafin turned to us. \u201cYou\u2019re Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cCousin Serafin, I presume?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question. \u201cYou\u2019ve one hell of a nerve coming here to beg sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea,\u201d Sidonie said dryly. \u201cWould you care to summon a council to find out what Carthage has done to both our nations, and what we might do about it, or do you wish to berate me a while longer?\u201d</p><p>Serafin\u2019s nostrils flared, but he held himself in check. \u201cYou\u2019ve knowledge that might shed light on this ungodly affair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe both do.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a hard look. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a brief bow. \u201cImriel de la Courcel.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d never met, so Serafin took me at my word, but it startled him nonetheless. \u201cThe missing prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore often than not,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cCall a council, Serafin,\u201d Nicola murmured. \u201cWhatever it is they have to say, I suspect we\u2019ll all want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded brusquely. \u201cEscort them to the great hall.\u201d With that, Serafin took his leave, accompanied by a handful of guards.</p><p>\u201cHe seems a touch . . . intemperate,\u201d I volunteered.</p><p>\u201cTerre d\u2019Ange\u2019s betrayal took everyone hard,\u201d Nicola said soberly. \u201cSerafin more than most. It\u2019s half his heritage. You won\u2019t find a lot of goodwill here, I fear. I\u2019ve felt the brush of suspicion myself, and I\u2019ve lived a good deal of my life in Aragonia.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie finished her tea. \u201cLady Nicola, do you know what passes in Terre d\u2019Ange these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve not heard?\u201d Nicola inquired.</p><p>Sidonie shook her head. \u201cThere was no information passing through New Carthage. Before that, I was kept ignorant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been isolated since the siege began,\u201d Nicola said. Her expression was deeply troubled. \u201cBut at last reckoning, Terre d\u2019Ange was divided against itself. Barquiel sought to install your sister, Alais, as Princess-Regent, using troops he raised and some of Alba\u2019s forces. Ysandre decreed them in rebellion against the Crown. They\u2019ve established a base at Turnone, while Ysandre holds the City of Elua.\u201d</p><p>I felt sick. \u201cAre they at war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet\u2014or at least they weren\u2019t. But it seems a precarious stalemate.\u201d She shifted her worried gaze to mine. \u201cNo one\u2019s known what to believe. I\u2019d never have thought Ysandre would grow power-mad, but there\u2019s an ambitious strain in the L\u2019Envers bloodline. Elua knows Barquiel\u2019s always had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ambition,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cNot this time.\u201d She rose and I took her arm to steady her. She gave me a fleeting smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go take your clothes off for the Aragonian council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you enjoy that part,\u201d I observed.</p><p>Her smile deepened briefly. \u201cI do, actually.\u201d</p><p>The council wasn\u2019t large. It consisted of Serafin and eight others, all men. His father, Ramiro Zorn\u00edn de Aragon was among them. I wondered how it was that Serafin had claimed the regency over his father\u2019s right, and suspected it had somewhat to do with ambition. Ph\u00e8dre had always said that Ramiro, a minor member of the House of Aragon who\u2019d long served as King\u2019s Consul, had a good deal of charm and little ambition.</p><p>I supposed she ought to know, since Nicola had been her lover for many years, which was why I\u2019d never liked her. Those feelings seemed distant and petty now.</p><p>The other members of the council consisted of Vitor Gait\u00e1n, the captain of the Harbor Watch; a grizzled veteran named Liberio who was in command of what remained of the army; and five other Aragonian lords whose names blurred together in my memory.</p><p>\u201cSo few,\u201d Sidonie said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cMany followed the King when Roderico surrendered,\u201d Nicola said quietly. \u201cAnd many others have accepted Carthage\u2019s terms.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie and I were ushered into chairs at the long table in the great hall, facing the council. To a man, they looked disapproving. I was glad that Lady Nicola stayed, unobtrusively taking a seat at the far end of the table.</p><p>\u201cSpeak,\u201d Serafin said with a curt nod.</p><p>Sidonie rose, resting her hands on the table. Elua, she looked young in those surroundings! She was young. But she was the daughter of the Queen of Terre d\u2019Ange and the Cruarch of Alba, and the only person in the room raised from birth to rule a nation.</p><p>\u201cMy lords,\u201d she said in a clear voice. \u201cThank you for hearing us. I am Sidonie de la Courcel of Terre d\u2019Ange, and for our mutual benefit, I wish to tell you what befell my country.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The youngest of the Aragonian lords actually had the temerity to hiss. Serafin shot him a look. \u201cShut your mouth, Jimeno,\u201d he said. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cLast summer, we received a suit from General Astegal, Prince of the House of Sarkal, wishing to pay tribute to Terre d\u2019Ange on behalf of Carthage. With some misgivings, Parliament voted to receive his delegation. My mother took the precaution of bringing the Royal Army within the City\u2019s walls and ensuring the Carthaginians were escorted by Admiral Rousse and several of his war-ships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we know,\u201d Liberio said laconically.</p> <p>Sidonie ignored him. \u201cDuring the course of his visit, Astegal made an offer for my hand. He implied that Carthage, Terre d\u2019Ange, and Alba might together force Aragonia into a peaceable surrender and build the beginnings of a mighty empire. That offer, we refused.\u201d</p><p>No one hissed this time. They listened.</p><p>\u201cAstegal appeared to accept our refusal with good grace.\u201d Her voice hardened. \u201cBut he had promised that his horologists would show us a marvel on the night that the moon was obscured. He insisted on keeping his pledge. We allowed it.\u201d Sidonie paused. \u201cMy lords, I cannot tell you what marvel I witnessed that night. It seemed to me that I saw somewhat wondrous, but when pressed to describe it, I cannot. All I can tell you is this: Blessed Elua knows, gossip carries. Much of this part of the world has known that for the past year, Terre d\u2019Ange had been divided over my desire to wed my royal kinsman, Imriel de la Courcel. I ventured out that night very much in love with him. I awoke the next morning with no memory of his existence.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, shocked silence.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Sidonie said thoughtfully, \u201cI believe was unique to an intimate spell that bound me, and me alone. But no one noticed, because we\u2019d all been caught in a greater magic. One that bound the entire City of Elua, man, woman, and child. I awoke that morning believing that Carthage and Terre d\u2019Ange were allies. That Aragonia had committed an act of aggression against Carthage. And worst of all, that I\u2019d fallen in love with Astegal of Carthage and gladly agreed to wed him.\u201d She glanced up and down the table. \u201cSo I believed. So everyone in the City of Elua believed. I had no memory that things had ever been otherwise. And two days later, I was escorted to the harbor with great fanfare, where I boarded a Carthaginian ship without a single D\u2019Angeline guard, without a single attendant, and sailed away to marry Astegal.\u201d She paused again, steadying herself. \u201cWhich, as you well know, I did. And I didn\u2019t begin to truly suspect aught was amiss until a man named Leander Maignard entered my life.\u201d</p> <p>My turn.</p><p>I rose, while Sidonie sat gratefully, careful not to rest against the back of her chair. \u201cMy lords,\u201d I said. \u201cMy name is Imriel de la Courcel, but the face I wear belongs to Leander Maignard. Listen, and hear what befell me.\u201d</p><p>They did.</p><p>I told them what had befallen me the night of the marvel, although I glossed over certain details. The Unseen Guild, Sunjata\u2019s identity. But I told them of the needle and the whisper, the stolen ring. The madness that followed. I told them about seeking Barquiel L\u2019Envers\u2019 aid and fleeing to Cythera. My mother. Ptolemy Solon and his knowledge, how he had deciphered the spells that bound Sidonie and Terre d\u2019Ange. The spell he\u2019d wrought to conceal me from myself.</p><p>\u201cA spell undone with a kiss,\u201d I said.</p><p>One of the Aragonian lords scoffed. \u201cA poet\u2019s tale! Why should we believe any of this nonsense? Simple greed\u2019s a lot more likely.\u201d</p> <p>Sidonie and I exchanged a glance.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>This time I played it for dramatic effect. I removed Leander\u2019s shirt first, smoke-scented and scorched. I knew what Serafin and his council saw. Leander Maignard, bare-chested before them, his torso smooth and lean. I\u2019d put in his ruby eardrops, and I made a show of removing them. I wasn\u2019t wearing much else of his.</p><p>\u201cYou know me,\u201d I said to Lady Nicola. \u201cImriel. You told me once to know myself. Do you see me?\u201d</p><p>Nicola shook her head, eyes wide and wondering. \u201cI see a man like to have Shahrizai blood in him. Not Imriel de la Courcel.\u201d</p><p>Ptolemy Solon wove a tight spell.</p><p>I dragged off Leander\u2019s boots and stockings, then stood bare-footed and -chested in the great hall of the Count\u2019s palace. There are few merits to having survived an attack by a bear\u2014or a shapeshifting magician in a bear\u2019s form\u2014but it makes for a fairly strong impression.</p> <p>Nicola gasped and covered her mouth.</p><p>Liberio came out of his seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat you see, I saw!\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice was urgent as she rose to join me, standing before them. \u201cAnd I knew him. I didn\u2019t remember, but I knew. So I stripped myself bare, thinking the same had been done to me.\u201d Her mouth twisted. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t. Astegal set his seal on me in a different way. He had the insignia of the House of Sarkal etched into my skin. A mockery of the marques the Servants of Naamah bear. The mark that made me his willing bride.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI begged Imriel to cut it out of me. He did. And I knew myself at last and what had been done to me.\u201d</p><p>There was another stunned silence, this one longer. It broke at length in a multitudinous clamor of questions and statements.</p><p>\u201c. . . can we be sure this isn\u2019t a Carthaginian trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . about the spell binding the City of Elua?\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . seen the wound with my own eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Serafin L\u2019Envers y Aragon pounded on the table. He leaned forward, his gaze intent. \u201cWhy was Carthage pursuing you? Were you discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, my lord.\u201d Out of the corner of my eye, I could see that Sidonie was racked by a fresh onset of shivers. Whatever good the willow-bark tea had done, it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cWe killed the horologist who wrought the spell and obtained the key to undoing it, then fled. Carthage seeks to thwart us. But if it lies within your power to get us from Am\u00edlcar to Terre d\u2019Ange, we can undo the spell and restore our alliance with Aragonia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need Terre d\u2019Ange,\u201d Liberio muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe need some ally,\u201d another voice countered.</p><p>\u201cDo you swear to this?\u201d Serafin asked without heeding them. \u201cBoth of you. Do you swear to it in the name of all your gods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Sidonie got the word out in a gasp, her knees buckling. I caught her before she hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cDo you really doubt?\u201d I asked Serafin with disdain.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He met my gaze squarely. \u201cBut we need to discuss this amongst ourselves all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d I said, cradling Sidonie in my arms and exiting the hall.</p><p>Fifty-Three</p><p>\u201cImriel, I hate this.\u201d Sidonie lay on her belly, chin propped on her hands, her face suffused with impatience.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d I said ruthlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re not moving.\u201d</p><p>The chirurgeon Rachel had applied a poultice the evening before, a disgusting mess of bread mold and mashed burdock root. She\u2019d ordered Sidonie to remain motionless for a solid day, allowing the poultice to work undisturbed. Over the course of the night, it had done a great deal of good, and now Sidonie was restless.</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI feel much better.\u201d</p><p>I drew a lock of hair away from her brow, feeling her skin. It wasn\u2019t nearly as hot as it had been, but it was still overly warm. \u201cSo you do. But you fell into a dead faint in front of Serafin\u2019s council yesterday. You\u2019re not moving until sundown.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door, and I went to admit Lady Nicola.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d I said. \u201cIrritable.\u201d</p><p>Nicola smiled. \u201cI would have expected Ysandre\u2019s children to be strong-willed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, will you please come tell us the news!\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice called from the bedchamber.</p><p>We went into the chamber. It tugged at my heart seeing her like this. She wore a shift of fine white linen with the back cut out, a thick crust of dried poultice slathered between her shoulder blades. The garment also had a disconcertingly low decolletage that tugged at other parts, particularly when Sidonie propped herself on her elbows as she did now, revealing the cleft of her cleavage.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, love. You\u2019ll crack the poultice.\u201d</p><p>She shot me an amused look. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. What news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much, I fear.\u201d Nicola sat in the chair I drew up for her, brows knitted. \u201cThe trouble is that Am\u00edlcar\u2019s a city under siege. You\u2019ve seen the blockade at the mouth of the harbor. Would that I could tell you there\u2019s some secret egress from the city proper, some tunnel escape into the foothills, but there\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a sortie?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs there any chance we could slip past Astegal\u2019s lines in the midst of a sally?\u201d</p><p>Nicola nodded. \u201c\u2019Tis the only chance, I fear. Not everyone is willing to take that risk.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy not? It doesn\u2019t seem like Am\u00edlcar\u2019s got many choices here, my lady. Forgive me for speaking bluntly, but Astegal\u2019s got a good portion of Aragonia well in hand. He\u2019s not lacking for supplies. Unless the current balance tips somehow, he can afford to wait you out until you starve.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYes, and for the moment, Am\u00edlcar is amply supplied. Betimes it takes desperate times to drive men to desperate measures. In the eyes of some, we\u2019re far from it. And then there\u2019s the problem to the north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat problem to the north?\u201d Sidonie asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cThe Euskerri,\u201d Nicola said. \u201cThey\u2019ve ranged far enough to hold all the mountain passes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sidonie stared at her, lips parted. \u201cDo you mean to tell me that despite everything that\u2019s happened, Aragonia is still at odds with Euskerria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak of it as though it\u2019s a sovereign nation,\u201d Nicola said dryly.</p><p>Sidonie swore softly and made to rise from the bed. \u201cI swear to Elua\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d I grabbed her by the nape of the neck, pinning her down. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere. Not until the chirurgeon grants permission.\u201d</p><p>She glared at me. \u201cImriel . . .\u201d</p><p>I shook her. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>She blew out her breath. \u201cFine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Lady Nicola was staring at both of us. \u201cYou two are oddly well suited to one another, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly, yes,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Sidonie settled back down, propping her chin on her fists again. \u201cTell me why Serafin hasn\u2019t sought an alliance with the Euskerri, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was planning to make overtures,\u201d Nicola said. \u201cBut he changed his mind when he learned they were continuing to negotiate behind our back. The Euskerri offered to betray us to Carthage in exchange for sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do they want sovereignty so badly?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re an ancient folk,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cLike the Maghuin Dhonn in Alba, they were here long before the Tiberians or the Carthaginians settled in Aragonia. They have their own language, their own laws. For centuries, they had an agreement with the kings of Aragonia that they\u2019d be given the right to govern themselves according to their own customs, but that was broken too many times for them to trust. Now all they want is sovereignty at any cost.\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to stare at her.</p><p>\u201cI sat in on the negotiations my mother oversaw,\u201d Sidonie reminded me. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me asking what you knew about them the night . . .\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I was struck by the sudden, vivid image of Sidonie kneeling, naked and obedient, her hands clasped behind her head. That was a conversation we hadn\u2019t ended up having. \u201cUm. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Carthage wasn\u2019t willing to meet their terms?\u201d Sidonie inquired of Nicola.</p><p>Nicola shook her head. \u201cNo. No, Astegal was confident that once he had Aragonia under his thumb, he could roll easily over the Euskerri. I suspect he underestimates them. There were a good many skirmishes between us before Carthage invaded. The Euskerri won as many as they lost. They\u2019re not terribly well organized, but they\u2019re fearless, stubborn fighters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the Euskerri\u2019s forces combined with Aragonia\u2019s would be able to defeat Carthage?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Nicola allowed. \u201cI\u2019m not a military strategist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d I asked Sidonie.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not asking for much,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small territory. Part of it lies on D\u2019Angeline soil, and my mother was willing to cede it. No deal was brokered because King Roderico\u2019s ambassador refused to do the same, and the Euskerri refused to accept aught less. I\u2019m thinking Serafin is a fool not to make the offer. Begging your forgiveness, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Nicola shrugged gracefully. \u201cMen tend to be proud, stiff-necked, and impractical. I agree. Unfortunately, my son is not as easily influenced as my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd more ambitious,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She glanced sidelong at me. \u201cThat too. But I think he might be convinced to relent on this point after what you\u2019ve told us.\u201d She was silent a moment. \u201cMy younger son, Raul, was in the City of Elua that night, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gods!\u201d I\u2019d forgotten. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, my lady.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wondered why I\u2019d had no word from him for so many months,\u201d Nicola murmured. \u201cSo, yes. I think it possible that Serafin might be convinced to make a treaty with the Euskerri once he\u2019s had time to think on it. It won\u2019t sit lightly on him, thinking of his brother bound to Carthage\u2019s thrall. \u2019Tis the others will be harder to convince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you sway your husband?\u201d Sidonie inquired.</p><p>Nicola didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s two votes,\u201d Sidonie mused.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Liberio\u2019s will depend on whether or not he believes we could defeat Carthage with the Euskerri\u2019s aid,\u201d Nicola said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s no chance the others will agree to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he does?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chance they could be persuaded,\u201d she said. \u201cNot a good one, but a chance.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie pushed herself back onto her elbows. \u201cI\u2019d like to address them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive me time to speak to Ramiro and Serafin,\u201d Nicola said to her. \u201cLet them take Liberio\u2019s measure, and we\u2019ll proceed from there. Prince Imriel is right; you\u2019re not to leave your bed today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me as soon as you know anything?\u201d Sidonie pressed.</p><p>\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d Nicola smiled at her. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie nodded, the gravity of her expression almost sufficient to offset the distracting display of cleavage. \u201cAnd you my thanks. Terre d\u2019Ange is fortunate to have someone with your presence and wits here in Am\u00edlcar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest.\u201d Nicola rose. \u201cTerre d\u2019Ange is also fortunate to have an heir of such singular will and determination, and I suspect they\u2019d wish to keep it that way. Of a surety, I have no wish to inform Ysandre that her valiant daughter succumbed to an injury from a paring knife.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and Sidonie smiled reluctantly. I escorted Nicola to the door, pausing there in the corridor.</p> <p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve behaved very rudely to you in the past, and I wish to apologize. All I can say is that I was young, and there was a great deal about love that I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Nicola said quietly. \u201cI knew what you\u2019d suffered. I understood.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Nicola L\u2019Envers y Aragon was the one person in whom Ph\u00e8dre had confided, the one who knew the worst details of what she\u2019d endured in Dar\u0161anga.</p><p>\u201cNonetheless,\u201d I said. \u201cI do apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I thank you for it.\u201d She touched my cheek. A garnet seal dangled from a gold bracelet on her wrist, bearing an incised dart. Kushiel\u2019s Dart\u2014the only lover\u2019s token Ph\u00e8dre had ever bestowed on a patron. \u201cWe will see this undone, Imriel. Carthage will not prevail. Not here, not in Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>I took her hand and kissed it. \u201cBlessed Elua grant it will be so.\u201d</p><p>Nicola took her leave, and I returned to tend to my restless beloved, pouring a cup of water from a jug beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I handed it to her. \u201cThe chirurgeon Rachel said you should drink a good deal of water to help flush the poisons.\u201d</p> <p>Sidonie drank obediently. \u201cImriel, if I promise to behave and lie abed, will you go to the infirmary to see how Kratos and the others are? I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already promised,\u201d I reminded her. She gave me a look. \u201cYes, of course. I\u2019m worried, too.\u201d I stroked her hair. \u201cSidonie, if it helps to think on it, when I was in Bryn Gorrydum, after Dorelei was killed, I had to lie abed a long time and obey the chirurgeon\u2019s orders. I did everything he said, thinking that the sooner I was mended, the sooner I\u2019d be free to seek vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut you were nearly disemboweled by a bear, not nicked by a paring knife. And in the end, it was more than vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I glanced at the poultice on her back. \u201cAnd that was no nick, love. But at the time, it helped. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWill you find me a book to pass the time?\u201d</p><p>I was leaving to do just that when Sidonie called me back.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d</p><p>I paused in the doorway. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She gazed at me with those dark, dark eyes. \u201cI meant it. I want to kill Astegal myself. I want to feel him die.\u201d</p><p>I bowed. \u201cSun Princess, if it lies within my power, I will grant it.\u201d</p><p>I found the palace\u2019s modest library and selected a tome for Sidonie: an Aragonian history that appeared to contain detailed and violent descriptions of various battles. I thought it might suit her mood.</p><p>Fierce.</p><p>Alais had said that once. It was during that terrible time when I was recuperating from the injuries Berlik had dealt me, the day I\u2019d let myself grieve for the first time: for Dorelei\u2019s death, for the death of our unborn son. I\u2019d wept savagely, racked by sobs and regret. And afterward, for the first time, Alais had spoken openly of Sidonie and me. I think she must love you very much, she\u2019d said. She\u2019s very fierce, even though it doesn\u2019t show.</p><p>Alais knew her sister well.</p><p>Gods, poor Alais.</p><p>Thinking on it, I nearly wished I believed myself Leander Maignard still, blithely unconcerned about the fate of Terre d\u2019Ange. It would have been a good deal easier than knowing myself Imriel and thinking with wretched horror of the stalemate Nicola had described, with the lives of those I loved hanging in the balance. Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, loyal to the Queen and ensorceled. Alais, the sister of my heart, struggling to hold the rest of the realm together.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I stooped and presented Sidonie with the book.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She reached up to tug on my hair, tugging my face down to hers, and kissed me with fierce ardor. \u201cGo. Tell Kratos I expect him to dance with me at our wedding.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>I made my way to the infirmary in the park, leaving a trail of stares and whispers behind me. Clearly, news of our performance and revelations had spread throughout Am\u00edlcar. At least the mood wasn\u2019t openly hostile, not like New Carthage. Still, I kept my hand hovering over my sword-hilt.</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel!\u201d Captain Deimos hailed me outside one of the tents. \u201cWhat passes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecious little,\u201d I replied. \u201cAre your men well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose that lived, aye,\u201d he replied soberly.</p><p>I winced. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, my lord captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d Deimos jerked his head at the tent. \u201cAmong the survivors, I daresay your manservant bore the brunt of it. He\u2019s within.\u201d</p><p>Inside, I found Kratos lying on his belly on a cot, his back covered with damp bandages. He was a more complacent patient than Sidonie. He lifted his homely face with pleasure, regarding me. \u201cMy lord! How fares her highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough.\u201d I sat beside him, cross-legged in the dirt. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>Kratos shrugged his meaty shoulders. \u201cIt hurts to breathe. But I reckon I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>I thought about Gilot, who had been one of Montr\u00e8ve\u2019s men-at-arms, the companion of my youth. He\u2019d died from injuries he sustained while trying to protect me: cracked ribs, a bone splinter. There in a gatehouse in Lucca, in the midst of a quarrel none of us had held stake in. If Gilot had stayed out of it, he might have lived. He\u2019d spent his life on the mechanism that raised or lowered a drawbridge. His efforts caused that splinter of bone to shift and pierce his lung.</p><p>Gilot had died a hero.</p><p>Elua, I was sick of heroes.</p><p>Once, I\u2019d wanted to be one. I\u2019d harbored glorious dreams of styling myself a hero in the manner I believed Joscelin to be. I\u2019d lost those illusions a long time ago, but I hadn\u2019t understood until now how much heroism meant living in terror that you wouldn\u2019t be able to protect those you loved.</p><p>Ptolemy Solon was right.</p><p>Happiness was the highest form of wisdom.</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d I gripped Kratos\u2019 shoulder firmly, feeling the solid meat and muscle of him. \u201cYou have to live, my friend. Sidonie is expecting you to dance with her at our wedding. And it\u2019s bad form to disappoint a lady.\u201d</p><p>Kratos blinked at me. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d I released his shoulder, rubbed my eyes with the heels of my hands. \u201cMay I give her your promise that you will?\u201d</p><p>Kratos nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, my lord.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him through blurred eyes. \u201cThank you, Kratos. That\u2019s all any of us can do.\u201d</p><p>Fifty-Four</p><p>The following morning I held my breath as the chirurgeon Rachel eased the poultice from Sidonie\u2019s wound. She\u2019d changed it the night before and refused to comment on the healing progress, which I suspected was as much as anything a ploy to keep Sidonie quiescent. Today she relented.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Rachel said with grudging satisfaction. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>Even I could see it was so. The swelling had subsided and the angry red flesh had turned pink.</p><p>\u201cAm I free, then?\u201d Sidonie asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The Eisandine healer gave her a stern look. \u201cNow it needs air and sunlight, highness. Give it another day. You need not remain confined to your bed, but do not cover the wound. I will give orders that for an hour after noon, the courtyard will be reserved in privacy for your usage. Sun is healing. Seek it.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie sat upright and made a disgusted sound.</p><p>\u201cEven the stunted tree seeks sunlight,\u201d I said to her. \u201cHear and obey, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObey.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at me. \u201cYou like that part, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled, sliding my hands up her arms as she straddled and kissed me, her shift riding high on her thighs. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The chirurgeon cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019ll return in the evening to examine you once more, your highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Rachel,\u201d Sidonie said absently, gazing at me.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t overexert yourself,\u201d I said when the chirurgeon had left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She wriggled further astride my lap. \u201cBut I can\u2019t bear being kept idle, and I can\u2019t go anywhere if I can\u2019t cover this thing, except to take sun in the courtyard. So . . .\u201d She kissed me again, her tongue darting between my lips. \u201cI want to feel like myself, Imriel. Stop treating me like I\u2019m made of glass. I won\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>I traced a line down her throat into the cleft between her breasts. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shook her head, her eyes grave. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d On a whim, I reached for the cup of water on the bedside table. I poured it slowly over the thin linen of her shift, soaking it until it became transparent. \u201cYou know you\u2019re driving me mad wearing this thing.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOh, good.\u201d</p><p>The sheer fabric was plastered to her breasts, pink nipples jutting against it. I slid my hands down to her buttocks, pulling her hard against me, then lowered my mouth, sucking and biting at her breasts through the linen. Sidonie sank her hands deep into my hair, sighing with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d I reached up and tore the neckline of her shift open, the thin, soaked fabric giving way easily. Sidonie made a small, startled sound of delight, then a deeper one as my mouth returned to her breasts, gliding over her silken, wet flesh. She pressed herself harder against me, hips moving involuntarily. When I felt her begin to shudder all over, I lifted my head and captured her mouth, forcing her to moan her pleasure into mine. I felt the sweet vibration of it all the way to my core.</p><p>It almost drowned out the knock at the outer door and the sound of Lady Nicola\u2019s voice. It seemed to be true that certain events in our lives were fated to be relived. We looked at one another.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to answer that,\u201d Sidonie said breathlessly.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cLet me fetch you a clean shift.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes danced. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your gown?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou can wear it with the stays undone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaken to be laundered,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one\u2019s returned it. I thought it was a ploy to keep me from leaving my quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re jesting,\u201d I pleaded. Sidonie just laughed. With a groan of dismay, I shifted her from my lap and went into the antechamber, closing the door of her bedchamber behind me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Imriel,\u201d Nicola greeted me, looking pleased. \u201cRachel tells me that Sidonie\u2019s much improved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said wryly. \u201cMuch, much improved. My lady, we have a . . . garment crisis.\u201d</p><p>Nicola raised her brows. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe escaped the ship with the clothes on our backs,\u201d I explained. \u201cSidonie\u2019s gown was taken to be laundered and hasn\u2019t been returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked my seamstress to take her measurements from it and alter a gown or two to fit her,\u201d Nicola said mildly. \u201cI had some of Serafin\u2019s clothing that would suit for you, but nothing for Sidonie. I\u2019ll send someone to investigate. But if she didn\u2019t mind receiving me yesterday clad in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s torn.\u201d I flushed. \u201cRather badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Her lovely face lit with mirth. \u201cMuch, much improved, I take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Nicola laughed. \u201cWell, \u2019tis good to know that love and laughter flourish even in the midst of war. I suspect we need it now more than ever, and I thank you for your unwitting gift of the latter. I can return later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The bedchamber door opened to reveal Sidonie artfully draped in a bedsheet. It looked almost like a Hellene peplos.</p><p>\u201cHow did you learn to . . . ?\u201d I gestured vaguely.</p> <p>She looked at me with amusement. \u201cPlay-acting with Alais when we were children. Lady Nicola, if you will forgive our state of considerable disarray, I would very much like to hear your news.\u201d</p><p>Nicola L\u2019Envers y Aragon was a diplomat\u2019s wife\u2014and like as not, twice the diplomat her husband was. She inclined her head. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>So I ushered her inside, where she told us that Serafin and Ramiro had both come around to thinking it was worth risking a sortie and attempting to send a delegation to treat with the Euskerri.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re willing to grant sovereignty to Euskerria?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>\u201cIf the Euskerri are willing to wage war on Carthage, yes,\u201d Nicola said. \u201cRamiro thinks several of the southern counties might renege on their treaties with Astegal and rise up against him if we\u2019re able to do this. And that if we don\u2019t make the effort, Aragonia will be devoured piecemeal, Euskerria included. After long thought, Serafin has agreed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about General Liberio?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Nicola spread her hands. \u201cThey\u2019ll speak to him today. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s one decision I stand no chance of influencing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, you might remind them . . .\u201d Sidonie searched briefly, then came up with the book I\u2019d procured for her yesterday. She flipped through it and found the place she wanted, passing the volume to Nicola. \u201cSome centuries ago, Alfonso the Second sought to gain control of Euskerri territory,\u201d she said. \u201cHis army outnumbered theirs ten to one, but the Euskerri harried his forces and drew them into the mountains where they suffered a terrible rate of attrition. The war went on for years and ended in a negotiated truce. But if there were a force ready to fall on the rearguard, as in Am\u00edlcar, the same tactics might be used to more immediate effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d Nicola sounded a trifle startled.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d such a head for battle,\u201d I said to Sidonie.</p><p>She raked an impatient hand through her hair. \u201cMy mother assumed the throne and inherited a war. She never wanted either of her daughters to be utterly reliant on the wisdom of others.\u201d</p> <p>Gods, I loved her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d Nicola rose, gazing at both of us, her expression complicated and unreadable. She gave her head a little shake. \u201cBlessed Elua have mercy! Astegal of Carthage truly grasped the tiger by the tail when he sought to divide the two of you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I reached for Sidonie\u2019s hand without thinking.</p><p>Her fingers tightened on mine. \u201cThis is for all of us, my lady. Aragonia and Terre d\u2019Ange, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if Liberio agrees, there will be others to be swayed,\u201d Nicola warned her.</p><p>Sidonie nodded. \u201cI know. Will they give me leave to address them again as an emissary of Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so,\u201d Nicola said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure how much weight your words will carry, my dear. With Terre d\u2019Ange divided against itself, you\u2019re not in a position to promise anything with certitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to be eloquent,\u201d Sidonie said calmly.</p> <p>\u201cVery,\u201d Nicola agreed.</p><p>The balance of the day passed without incident or further news. An assortment of clothing arrived for Sidonie, resolving the garment crisis. I accompanied her to the courtyard, where she sat in the sun for an hour, the stays of her bodice undone to expose her healing wound. She was quiet and withdrawn, thinking. I said nothing to disturb her thoughts. Diplomacy was her strong suit, not mine. If the council was to be swayed, the burden rested on her slender shoulders.</p><p>Afterward, she sent me on a quest to find a detailed map of Aragonia and paper, pen, and ink.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind leaving me for a few hours, Imriel?\u201d she asked apologetically when I\u2019d returned with the items. \u201cI need to compose my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I grinned. \u201cAre you saying I\u2019m a distraction?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie eyed me. \u201cThoughts of unfinished business between us, yes.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and kissed her. \u201cI\u2019ll go see how Kratos fares. I need to speak to Lady Nicola about making more permanent arrangements for him, and for Deimos and his men.\u201d</p><p>I left her sitting cross-legged on the bed, her head bowed over a writing tablet, her back bare in obedience to the chirurgeon\u2019s orders.</p><p>In the infirmary, I found Kratos in good spirits. His ribs were swathed in bandages, but he reported that he was able to move around a little and there was less pain when he breathed. It made me hopeful.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s to become of us, my lord?\u201d Kratos asked.</p><p>I told him what we were hoping to accomplish with the council and the Euskerri. He listened sagely, nodding.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be fools not to agree,\u201d he said when I\u2019d finished. \u201cAll of \u2019em. Wrestling\u2019s a good way to take a man\u2019s measure, and Astegal\u2019s ruthless. If they don\u2019t stand together, he\u2019ll take them down one by one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI pray we can convince them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d Kratos took a deep experimental breath. \u201cSo we\u2019re bound for Euskerri territory, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d I shook my head at him. \u201cOh, no. Elua willing, Sidonie and I, yes; and then on to Terre d\u2019Ange. But you, my friend, are staying in Am\u00edlcar to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d he protested. \u201cPut me astride a horse and I\u2019ll be fine. You can\u2019t abandon me here. I don\u2019t even speak the language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I laid a hand on his arm. \u201cKratos, I\u2019ve been responsible for too many good men losing their lives in quarrels not their own. I\u2019m not risking yours again.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cYou gave me my freedom. It\u2019s not your choice.\u201d</p><p>I gazed at his face: the blunt, worn features, the squashed nose. There was pride there, pride and courage and a canny intellect. Kratos had found hope and purpose long after he\u2019d thought it lost. It would be cruel to take it from him.</p><p>So be it.</p><p>\u201cIt is my choice,\u201d I said in a hard tone. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for Sidonie\u2019s safety. And I\u2019m sorry, Kratos, but you\u2019re not fit for travel. You might be able to ride, but could you mount in a hurry? Could you scramble over rocks if we had to flee on foot? No. You\u2019re staying here.\u201d</p><p>Kratos bowed his head. \u201cAs you will.\u201d</p><p>I felt bad for him, but not as badly as I would have felt if he\u2019d died like Gilot. \u201cWe\u2019d never have gotten this far without you, my friend,\u201d I said more gently. \u201cThink on that while you heal.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>I took my leave of Kratos and found Captain Deimos. His men were restless and concerned, trapped in a besieged city with the threat of Carthaginian reprisal hanging over them if Am\u00edlcar should fall. I promised to speak to Lady Nicola about dispersing them throughout the city so that they might not collectively be identified as the crew of the Cytheran ship that assisted in abducting Astegal\u2019s bride. Beyond that, there wasn\u2019t much else I could do.</p><p>When I returned to the palace, Lady Nicola was in conference with several Aragonian lords\u2019 wives, doing her best to persuade them to sway their husbands, I reckoned. Since I gauged it too early to interrupt Sidonie, I went to the palace stables and begged the loan of a horse.</p><p>Ever since we\u2019d arrived, I\u2019d wanted to get a look at Astegal\u2019s forces. I rode to the northwestern edge of the city.</p><p>Over the course of a day, word had spread of Sidonie\u2019s and my initial address to the council, and I found myself greeted with curiosity and wonder more than hostility. The squadron of guards posted in the northwest tower were glad enough to introduce me to their captain, who took me out onto the walls himself.</p><p>\u201cThere the bastard sits, your highness,\u201d the captain announced with a wave of his arm.</p><p>I gazed at the scene before me. There was the army we\u2019d sent off with fanfare from New Carthage, spread out across the plain at the base of the foothills. Am\u00edlcar was situated between two rivers, and Astegal\u2019s army occupied the ground between them, fortified by defensive trenches and earthworks. Soldiers bustled about, digging the trenches deeper and building the earthworks higher.</p><p>\u201cNo siege engines?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The captain, whose name was Aureliano, shook his head. \u201cThus far he\u2019s not bothered. I reckon he thinks he can wait us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Aureliano pursed his lips. \u201cUnless something gives, aye. Are the rumors true? Are you and the princess able to put an end to the madness in Terre d\u2019Ange and send aid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cIf we could get there, yes. But we\u2019re trapped here as surely as you are.\u201d I paused. \u201cWhat would you think of aid coming from another quarter? Euskerria, say?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBetter the devil you know than the one you don\u2019t. I\u2019d welcome the Euskerri if they could deal with Astegal.\u201d</p><p>I peered at the forces arrayed against us. \u201cIs he here?\u201d</p><p>Aureliano laughed. \u201cHimself? No, not today.\u201d He pointed toward the south. \u201cWe heard he\u2019s taken the palace of Montero for himself. Most days, he\u2019s there, living the good life while his men work and toil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareless,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe was here the day you arrived, though,\u201d Aureliano added. \u201cAnd the day after. Storming around on a big black horse, looking a fury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said.</p><p>The sun was growing low on the horizon, so I thanked Aureliano for his kindness and rode back to the palace. This time I found Lady Nicola free. There was no word yet regarding General Liberio\u2019s decision, but at least she readily agreed to send someone to ensure that Kratos, Deimos, and the others were taken care of to the best of Am\u00edlcar\u2019s ability. In a few days, I\u2019d come to depend so heavily on her generosity and competence, I felt guilty that I\u2019d ever thought ill of her.</p><p>That done, I returned to find Sidonie, still in her pensive mood.</p><p>\u201cFinished, love?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She moved a sheaf of paper. \u201cElua willing, there\u2019ll be an opportunity to address them again. Is there news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I sat beside her. \u201cWould you like to rehearse your words? Shall I play the audience for you?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie hesitated. \u201cI think not. What I\u2019m planning . . . Imriel, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll lose my nerve if I tell you ahead of time. Afraid it will sound foolish once I say it aloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d I tilted her chin up and kissed her. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve done a number of things I would never have thought I\u2019d do. Fall in love with you. Defy my mother. Wed Astegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe latter doesn\u2019t count,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just so much at stake.\u201d Sidonie shivered. \u201cElua! I\u2019ve addressed ambassadors and statesmen before, but there was never anything like this at stake. And I was always a representative of my mother. If they thought I was too young and inexperienced to listen to, she was always there to intercede. It\u2019s just so much damned responsibility. And I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do if I fail. Do you?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed her shoulders, bare beneath the unlaced gown. \u201cSpread the word emmenghanom until it\u2019s on the lips of every man, woman, and child in Am\u00edlcar, trusting that someone will carry it to Terre d\u2019Ange and Alais and L\u2019Envers to complete what we\u2019ve begun. And then lock the door and make love until Am\u00edlcar falls and Astegal comes to reclaim you. At which point I will take your life and my own, and we will die in a final flourish of terrible, wonderful romance about which the poets will sing for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie laughed, tears in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d much rather live a long and blessedly uneventful life with you. Although the part about the love-making sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that, I can oblige.\u201d I took her hands. \u201cSidonie, if you\u2019re given the chance, you won\u2019t fail. You won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She searched my face for signs of doubt, but there weren\u2019t any.</p><p>I believed in her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Sidonie touched my lips. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways and always,\u201d I echoed.</p><p>Fifty-Five</p><p>Lady Nicola was brief and to the point. \u201cLiberio agreed.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, a wave of relief washing over me. That was the one hurdle that had been cleared. I offered a silent prayer of thanks to Blessed Elua.</p><p>\u201cAnd the council?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>\u201cSeveral of the remaining five are opposed. But they\u2019re willing to hear the argument. There will be an open audience this afternoon.\u201d Nicola studied her. \u201cHave you taken a turn for the worse? You look pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sidonie murmured. \u201cMerely anxious. My lady, can you spare a chambermaid to assist me this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Nicola said gently.</p><p>We waited out the long, dragging hours until the council met. Lady Nicola\u2019s chambermaid arrived and I was temporarily banished from our quarters while she helped Sidonie dress and arrange her hair. Sidonie emerged just as a courtier came to fetch us. She wore a dark green Aragonian gown with a square neckline that had belonged to Nicola, a shawl of rich golden silk over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThose are nearly Montr\u00e8ve\u2019s colors,\u201d I commented. \u201cA good omen.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie gave me a brief smile. \u201cLet\u2019s hope.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The council met at the same long table in the great hall, but this was an open meeting with the hall filled with onlookers, murmurs rising to the rafters. Serafin motioned for us to be seated facing the council, our backs to the throng.</p><p>\u201cMy lords, ladies, and gentlefolk,\u201d he announced. \u201cI am Serafin L\u2019Envers y Aragon. In the abdication of Roderico de Aragon, the absence of ranking nobility and with the blessing of my father, I have assumed command here. Does anyone wish to gainsay this?\u201d</p><p>No one did.</p> <p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Serafin laid both hands on the table. \u201cWe are here to debate the merits of two grave issues. One is the possibility of assisting our kinswoman, the Dauphine Sidonie de la Courcel, in escaping Am\u00edl-car and fleeing to Terre d\u2019Ange. The other is the prospect of seeking an alliance with the Euskerri with her aid. I believe both issues possess the potential for desirable outcomes that outweigh the risks and costs. Here is my reasoning.\u201d</p><p>Serafin made his case in strong, calm terms, better than I would have reckoned, explaining that unless the balance of power tipped, Am\u00edlcar would eventually be forced to surrender. That this was a long chance, but it was a chance. I\u2019d called him intemperate, but he had some of his mother\u2019s cool-headed competence in him. The crowd listened to him in silence.</p><p>After he spoke, one of the opposing members was given a chance to address the council and the crowd: Rafael de Barbara. He was an older Aragonian lord with a dignified bearing and a tutored rhetorical style. He spoke of Sidonie\u2019s youth and lack of experience in terms that were at once disparaging and sympathetic, reminding everyone that with Terre d\u2019Ange in disarray, its heir was in no position to negotiate with the Eus-kerri for safe passage over the border, let alone a major treaty.</p><p>\u201cSo send your own ambassador,\u201d I muttered. Sidonie hushed me.</p><p>Rafael de Barbara held the floor for a long time, recounting the long history of animosity between the Euskerri and Aragonia, culminating in recent battles. He reminded them that when the most recent skirmishes had erupted, Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s only concern was that it not spill over the border into Siovale. And he finished by urging them not to undertake a desperate measure that would destroy the very realm in the process of attempting to save it. At that, there was scattered applause.</p> <p>When he had finished, Serafin\u2019s father, Ramiro Zorn\u00edn de Aragon spoke out in support of the plan, confirming his belief that other cities would seize the opportunity to rise up against Astegal. He wasn\u2019t eloquent, but he was precise, with names and facts and figures at his disposal. I saw Lady Nicola smile with quiet pride.</p><p>After Ramiro, there was another opposing member, an undistinguished, mousy fellow who made many of the same points as Rafael, only with less skill. Still, I could hear murmurs of agreement in the crowd behind me. I wished I could turn in my seat and gauge their faces.</p><p>General Liberio, the grizzled veteran, followed him. He stood to speak. \u201cWhat we are facing is a choice between a slow loss or a desperate victory,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cIn my opinion, this can be done. And we can use it to our advantage.\u201d He pointed one thick finger at Sidonie. \u201cWhat is the one thing we need to draw away some of Carthage\u2019s forces? A bait Astegal cannot resist. His wife.\u201d</p><p>I felt the blood drain from my face. I hadn\u2019t considered that.</p><p>At my side, Sidonie met Liberio\u2019s gaze without flinching.</p><p>She\u2019d considered it.</p> <p>The instant Liberio sat, the last opponent was on his feet, Jimeno de Ferrer, the youngest of the council. \u201cPrecisely,\u201d he spat. \u201cAstegal\u2019s wife. Serafin, I know she is your kinswoman, but can you ask us to trust to this tale of madness and parlor tricks? If there\u2019s an ounce of truth to it, it\u2019s that an impetuous young woman agreed to an ill-advised marriage. Now she seeks to flee home. Shall we spend precious Aragonian lives to help her?\u201d Jimeno shook his head. \u201cI think not. And I think there is no more to the tale than that.\u201d</p><p>He sat to mixed applause.</p><p>Serafin nodded at Sidonie. \u201cYou may speak.\u201d</p><p>She rose and inclined her head toward the council, then walked to the corner of the table, turning so she could address council and crowd alike. \u201cWhat is more likely, my lords and ladies?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat I am a fickle bride, or that half of Terre d\u2019Ange was plunged overnight into madness and betrayal for no reason whatsoever?\u201d</p><p>There was a tense, waiting silence. Sidonie let it stretch until I could feel my heart thudding in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI have spoken to the council of the spell that bound us,\u201d she said at last. \u201cHear now of my first suspicion that somewhat dire was amiss. I had ventured out to make an offering at the temple of Tanit. As I returned through the streets of Carthage, I overheard my guards directing my bearers to turn aside lest our route take us through the slave-market. At that moment, I began to know fear.\u201d</p><p>She swept her gaze over them, letting it rest last on Jimeno de Ferrer.</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel told me later what I would have seen there,\u201d Sidonie continued. \u201cWhat he saw. Aragonian folk taken as spoils of war at the sack of New Carthage, sold into slavery. A ten-year-old boy. There was a noblewoman looking for a pretty child to adorn her household. She declined to purchase him because he didn\u2019t speak Hellene. There was no way to determine whether or not he was sufficiently biddable.\u201d</p> <p>There were hisses, but they were meant for Carthage, not her.</p><p>\u201cThat is the war you are fighting, my lords and ladies,\u201d she said steadily. \u201cThat is the opponent you face. Am\u00edlcar has resisted Astegal. The siege has only just begun and your spirits are high. But there is no help coming from any quarter. None. And if none comes, week after week, month after month, your spirits will gutter. You will face the slow loss of which General Liberio spoke. Am\u00edlcar will be forced to surrender. When it does, Astegal will not be merciful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we surrender now?\u201d Jimeno challenged her. \u201cOthers have accepted his terms.\u201d He smiled, thin-lipped. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve something to offer in exchange. You and your paramour.\u201d</p><p>A gabble of comment arose. Sidonie waited it out until they fell silent once more, awaiting her reply.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said mildly. \u201cYou could do that, my lord. It may even be that Astegal would be merciful for that price. And Aragonia as you know it would cease to be. You would become a Carthaginian vassal state, subject to Carthage\u2019s laws, Carthage\u2019s customs, Carthage\u2019s demands for tribute. Astegal\u2019s rule and whims. Is that your desire?\u201d</p><p>There was a roar of protest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no one\u2019s wish,\u201d Serafin assured her.</p><p>\u201cThen what cost are you willing to bear for freedom?\u201d Sidonie asked, raising her voice, clear and carrying. \u201cIs the cost of a sovereign Euskerria too high? It is a minor territory that the Euskerri have inhabited time out of mind and will continue to do. Will Aragonia truly be destroyed if a small chunk of land is gouged out of its holdings?\u201d She faced the council directly and let the silk shawl slip from her shoulders onto the floor. \u201cI did not think so when I paid the price for my freedom.\u201d</p><p>The crowd broke into pandemonium, stamping and shouting. Sidonie turned to acknowledge them, and I saw Serafin catch his breath. I twisted in my seat to see that she\u2019d had the back of her gown cut low enough to reveal the still-raw wound, proof of her tale.</p><p>It was a long time before order was restored. Sidonie took her seat quietly. I retrieved her shawl, settling it over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Serafin finally succeeded in shouting the crowd silent. \u201cHas anyone aught else to say?\u201d he asked the council. No one moved. If any of the others yet opposed it, they weren\u2019t willing to follow Sidonie\u2019s performance. \u201cShall we vote?\u201d</p><p>Another outburst erupted.</p><p>\u201cWe want a voice!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>\u201cGive us a voice!\u201d</p><p>Ramiro leaned over and whispered to his son, who nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d Serafin said in a low voice. \u201cBut this is an Aragonian matter, and I think it must be decided by Aragonians. It\u2019s going to be mayhem if you stay. Let us have this debate, let the people have their say, and let the council vote. I will send word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d Sidonie rose, and I accompanied her.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Rafael de Barbara said sharply. \u201cI note that you did not address my concerns regarding your fitness as an emissary, young highness.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze. \u201cDid I not?\u201d</p><p>He gave a sour smile. \u201cThat was a cheap theatrical gesture at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Sidonie inclined her head. \u201cI would not have resorted to it were there not urgent need. I would expect a man of your rhetorical skill to understand.\u201d</p><p>We left the great hall unescorted; no one wanted to leave the debate. A guard closed the doors behind us, and we could hear a fresh clamor arise.</p><p>\u201cGods.\u201d Sidonie shuddered. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you swayed the crowd. And I pray the crowd sways the council.\u201d I cupped her face in my hands and kissed her. \u201cI think you were splendid. Sidonie, if they fail to aid us, it can be through no fault of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my best,\u201d she murmured. \u201cCheap theatrics and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were splendid,\u201d I repeated. \u201cAnd later, we can discuss this matter of serving as bait if they accede.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a tired smile. \u201cHow else did you suppose Astegal might be persuaded to divert his forces?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray we get the chance,\u201d Sidonie said soberly.</p><p>Fifty-Six</p><p>There was no word forthcoming that afternoon or evening. We stayed awake late into the night, hoping to hear. The chirurgeon Rachel came to examine Sidonie\u2019s injury, decreeing at last that it might be bandaged and covered, but she had no news. I fell asleep at length with Sidonie in my arms, waking briefly at the sound of her murmuring the word emmenghanom in her sleep.</p><p>Later I was told the debate raged late and long. After the commonfolk had given voice to their wishes and the council had voted, members were up until the small hours, hammering out details of the agreement they reached and laying the foundations of a plan.</p><p>We didn\u2019t find out what it was until Serafin sent for us.</p><p>Along with General Liberio, Serafin received us in the quarters that had once belonged to the Count of Am\u00edlcar. His violet eyes were bleary for lack of sleep, his face looking creased and older. Liberio was the fresher of the two. As an old military hand, I daresay he had experience doing without sleep. Sidonie appeared calm, but I could sense the tension in her.</p><p>\u201cTell us what was decided,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Serafin yawned. \u201cForgive me. In principle, everyone more or less came to agreement, with a notable exception or two. \u2019Tis too valuable a chance to waste. And yet, \u2019tis too desperate a chance on which to risk much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked warily.</p><p>He tossed a sheaf of paper at Sidonie. \u201cRead.\u201d</p><p>She skimmed it briefly. \u201cIt\u2019s a charter granting sovereignty to Euskerria.\u201d</p><p>Serafin nodded. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s contingent on their full support against Carthage. And my continued regency.\u201d</p><p>Ambition, I thought.</p><p>Sidonie glanced up. \u201cWill I be representing you as well as Terre d\u2019Ange, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherein lies the \u2018more or less\u2019.\u201d Serafin smiled wryly. \u201cYes. All the necessary assurances are in the charter. We\u2019ll do our best to give you a chance. What you make of it is up to you.\u201d He gestured. \u201cThe both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound as though you\u2019re sending us off on our own, unaided and alone,\u201d I observed.</p><p>Serafin and Liberio exchanged a look. \u201cNearly,\u201d Serafin admitted. \u201cYou\u2019ll be assigned a guide, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel, me, and a guide?\u201d Sidonie asked flatly. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>General Liberio cleared his throat. \u201cYour highness, I\u2019d send an entire squadron if I thought they could protect you. I don\u2019t. Astegal knows that you\u2019re here and he knows you\u2019re desperate to get to Terre d\u2019Ange. The moment we send out a sortie, he\u2019s going to be on the alert. This escape can succeed by only one of three means.\u201d He ticked them off on his thick fingers. \u201cStrength, speed, or guile. We don\u2019t have the strength. He\u2019s already routed this army once. If we had the numbers to meet him on the battlefield a second time, I\u2019d have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about speed?\u201d I asked, remembering what I\u2019d seen atop the battlements. \u201cAstegal\u2019s got his cavalry pinned behind his infantry, trapped between two rivers. They\u2019ll have to get through their own defenses to reach us.\u201d</p><p>Liberio gave me an approving look. \u201cTrue. However . . .\u201d He reached for a sketch on Serafin\u2019s desk. \u201cThere\u2019s an embankment here, and defensive trenches here and here. The bridge across the Barca River lies here, between the trenches. Astegal\u2019s cavalry will have to pass the embankment and a trench to reach it, but you\u2019ll have to cross a trench, too. We\u2019re still working out that part.\u201d</p><p>I studied the sketch. \u201cSo we\u2019ll not have much of a lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cAnd every mount in Am\u00edlcar\u2019s been on siege rations for the past weeks. Unless I miss my guess, Astegal will send his Amazigh after you. Those desert-bred horses they ride are swift, hardy, and well-fed. I don\u2019t like your chances in a foot-race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where does guile come into play, my lord general?\u201d Sidonie inquired.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Liberio nodded. \u201cWe mean to capture and hold the nearest trench long enough to get a small mounted company across it and over the bridge. Half of them will scatter, bound for the cities Ramiro discussed. The other half, with you among them, will race northward.\u201d He exchanged the sketch for a map and traced a line. \u201cAstegal will expect you to make for the nearest pass. They will. But you\u2019ll take your leave of them before his cavalry catches you and make your way secretly through the mountains to Roncal.\u201d He tapped the map. \u201cHere. It\u2019s a Euskerri stronghold with a pass beyond.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Sidonie said absently. \u201cJanpier Iturralde was from Roncal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Euskerri ambassador,\u201d Serafin said. \u201cOr as near as they have to one. That\u2019s who you\u2019ll treat with, Sidonie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I take it we\u2019re no longer serving as bait?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>The other two men exchanged another glance. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not changed,\u201d Liberio said somberly. \u201cI expect the Amazigh will catch the men they\u2019re pursuing, your highness. And when they do, my men will have orders to betray you, leading the Amazigh into a Euskerri ambush. You\u2019ll have a lead on them, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to force the Euskerri\u2019s hand,\u201d Sidonie observed.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cInto the ambush, aye. Whether or not they\u2019ll agree to more is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mislike this.\u201d I frowned. \u201cWould it not be simpler to abandon the notion of forging an alliance with the Euskerri altogether? All we need to treat for is safe passage over the mountains. If Sidonie and I can reach Terre d\u2019Ange, we can undo Carthage\u2019s spell. Terre d\u2019Ange and Alba alike will send aid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Serafin poured a cup of water from a ewer and drank. \u201cThere is that option. And there is fear among certain quarters that you will take our aid and do exactly that.\u201d He set the cup down. \u201cThe Euskerri are near. Despite the hostilities between us, they are a known quantity. Terre d\u2019Ange is far. And despite the long alliance between us, it is currently very much an unknown quantity. The consensus was that at this juncture the Euskerri are a better wager. And that is the price of our aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Sidonie was quiet a moment. \u201cSo Imriel and I and a lone guide are to make our way to Roncal, where I will inform Janpier Iturralde that I\u2019ve brought a hostile Carthaginian force into Euskerri territory, then expect him to treat gladly with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to succeed.\u201d Serafin met her gaze squarely. \u201cOnly to try. The Euskerri want sovereignty very badly. And there are those still very much opposed to granting it. You were the one tipped the balance. Are you unwilling now to stand by your words?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed.</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d I held up my hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree to this. Neither of us expected it to be quite so dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there were a safer way, I\u2019d offer it,\u201d Liberio murmured. \u201cThere isn\u2019t. As it is, a good many men may die for this venture.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any other choice, Imriel,\u201d Sidonie said simply. \u201cOther than staying and awaiting defeat. I was quick to speak of sacrifice yesterday. How can I refuse to take the risk? I\u2019d give a lot more than a few ounces of flesh for Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>So it was decided.</p><p>We wouldn\u2019t be able to act immediately. In accordance with General Liberio\u2019s plans, it would be a night sortie, the better to sow confusion. In order to see well enough to execute his plan, we\u2019d need to await a tolerably clear night with a good moon, and the moon was yet a waxing sliver. He counseled patience and put his men to work building a portable gangplank to bridge the defensive trench.</p><p>I spent a good deal of time telling the hours in the palace courtyard, honing the skills that had been neglected during my tenure as Leander Maignard. I was keenly aware that in the days to come, I would be Sidonie\u2019s sole protector. And that was the one area of the Cassiline discipline that Joscelin had neglected to teach me\u2014the sphere of defending one\u2019s ward. He\u2019d taught me everything I needed to know to ward my life. Neither of us had dreamed that one day I\u2019d be playing such a role.</p><p>At least I\u2019d learned how to fight from the saddle. Gods, it seemed like a long time ago that I\u2019d advised Claude de Monluc to trick Barquiel L\u2019Envers into lending his own Akkadian-trained Captain of the Guard to teach the Dauphine\u2019s Guard. It hadn\u2019t been much more than a whim that had led me to train with them, posing as an anonymous guard among guardsmen. Now I was glad of it. With Liberio\u2019s permission, I visited the armory and appropriated a small buckler, a leather hauberk with metal scales, a helmet with a peaked crest, and a short bow and quiver.</p><p>For her part, Sidonie spent long hours in the palace\u2019s library, reading everything she could find on the Euskerri. Whether or not it would prove of use, I couldn\u2019t say, but it helped pass the interminable waiting.</p> <p>Blessed Elua be thanked, her wound continued to heal cleanly. At her insistence, some days after the council met, I took her to see Kratos. With Lady Nicola\u2019s assistance, he\u2019d been lodged in a boarding-room where a good-natured Aragonian widow was paid to look after him.</p><p>\u201cYour highness!\u201d Kratos looked thunderstruck when he answered our knock. \u201cYou came to see me?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie laughed at his expression. \u201cHow are your burns, Kratos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealing.\u201d He peered over his shoulder as though he could see through his tunic. \u201cAnd your injury? You were passing feverish, my lady. I worried.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a sidelong look. \u201cMuch, much improved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the ribs?\u201d I asked Kratos.</p><p>He took a deep breath, his chest swelling. \u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>I was glad.</p><p>We passed a pleasant hour talking with Kratos. Somewhere in the back of my thoughts, I\u2019d hoped he\u2019d have some clever perspective on our plan for escape that no one had conceived; but he didn\u2019t. He merely shook his heavy head, running one hand over his cropped, greying hair.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, my lord,\u201d Kratos said soberly. \u201cI\u2019d only slow you down. It\u2019s dicey, but I don\u2019t see another way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray for us?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTo all the gods I know,\u201d he affirmed.</p><p>Sidonie stooped and kissed his cheek. \u201cRemember your promise.\u201d</p><p>A blush suffused his homely face. \u201cTo dance at your wedding?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cTo dance with me at my wedding, Kratos. I mean to make it a point not to forget those who\u2019ve saved my life. And the other thing, too. The word I taught you. Keep the knowledge quiet, but don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmenghanom,\u201d Kratos said softly.</p><p>Sidonie nodded. \u201cExactly right.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t spread the word throughout the entire city. At this point, it was dangerous. Blockaded, besieged Am\u00edlcar was a hotbed of gossip. If it were to fall in our absence or failure, if word were to leak that we\u2019d disseminated the key to undoing Carthage\u2019s spell far and wide . . . well, it was Sidonie\u2019s fear that Astegal would have every man, woman, and child put to the sword rather than risk word carrying to Terre d\u2019Ange. And with that, I agreed.</p><p>But we made sure it wouldn\u2019t be lost.</p><p>General Liberio agreed in a bemused fashion that those soldiers serving as couriers carrying word of Am\u00edlcar\u2019s plan to neighboring cities would carry it. I\u2019m not sure he believed, not entirely. He was a pragmatic fellow. Still, he agreed. And Sidonie and I taught the word to half a dozen bright-eyed, impassioned young men. If any of them survived, the word would be passed onward.</p><p>Emmenghanom.</p><p>Beholden.</p><p>We taught the word to Captain Deimos, lodged in a harbor inn, posing as the captain of a fishing vessel. He didn\u2019t want to hear it, not really, but he\u2019d been Ptolemy Solon\u2019s man too long. In the end, the desire for knowledge won out.</p><p>\u201cEmmenghanom,\u201d he whispered, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf all else fails, the Wise Ape of Cythera will know what to do with it,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd if we succeed, I will keep my promise. Terre d\u2019Ange will reward you.\u201d</p><p>Deimos shuddered. \u201cGoddess save me from wisdom. I hope to be an ignorant man in my next life.\u201d</p><p>We gave the word unto the safekeeping of Nicola L\u2019Envers y Aragon. To her, I showed the talisman; the scrap of lacquered leather filched from an inner pocket of Bodeshmun\u2019s robes. A whirlwind sprouting horns and claws, a word inscribed in Punic.</p><p>\u201cThis is it?\u201d Nicola inquired. \u201cOn this you pin your hopes?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cEmmenghanom,\u201d Nicola murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite it down,\u201d Sidonie said, fetching pen and paper. \u201cWrite it as it sounds when I speak it, my lady.\u201d She knelt beside Nicola\u2019s chair, her face earnest and pleading. \u201cI know it sounds absurd. But if we fail\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nicole cut her off. \u201cYou won\u2019t fail.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shrugged gracefully. \u201cBut if we do . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmenghanom,\u201d I echoed. \u201cBeholden. We are beholden. We will all be beholden to you. Sidonie and I, Ysandre, Alais, Drustan, Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, your son, Raul, the whole of Terre d\u2019Ange . . .\u201d</p><p>Nicola raised her hand. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>She wrote the word, mouthing the syllables to herself.</p><p>There was little else we could do, save wait.</p><p>Fifty-Seven</p><p>Slowly, slowly, the moon waxed. At its halfway point, it would have shed enough light to stage a sortie, but the weather was foul: cold, grey, and drizzling. The mood in the city grew tense and strained. When the weather showed no sign of breaking, Lady Nicola decided to hold a f\u00eate.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s wise?\u201d I asked her. I couldn\u2019t help but think of Gallus Tadius\u2019 orders during the siege of Lucca. He\u2019d have been apoplectic at the waste.</p><p>\u201cPeople need something to keep their spirits up,\u201d Nicola said pragmatically. \u201cAnd my husband\u2019s wine-cellar can withstand the blow. Besides, there\u2019s someone who\u2019d like to meet you, but he\u2019s felt awkward about it. This will provide a nice opportunity.\u201d</p><p>I was intrigued despite myself. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an extravagant affair. With Carthage\u2019s troops camped outside the walls and the spectre of death hanging over those who hoped to assail them, that would have felt unseemly or desperate or both. But it was a pleasant affair. The food that was served was modest and less than abundant, but the wine flowed freely. Skilled musicians played in a distinctly Aragonian style, rapid rhythms punctuated with clapping. An air of defiant gaiety permeated the great hall.</p><p>A young Aragonian lieutenant begged leave to teach Sidonie one of their national dances. I watched her try to follow his lead and master the quick, intricate steps, laughing when she tripped over his feet. He was flushed and nervous. She looked bright and beautiful, her color healthy. I thought about that last day on the ship, her skin fevered and hot to the touch, and I was filled with gratitude.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s Ysandre\u2019s daughter,\u201d a melodious voice beside me murmured.</p><p>I turned and blinked. For a moment, I thought I was seeing an older version of my cousin Mavros with lines at the corners of his twilight-blue eyes and his black hair threaded with silver. Then I realized who he must be and tensed. \u201cMarmion,\u201d I said. \u201cMarmion Shahrizai.\u201d</p><p>Many years ago, after Skaldia\u2019s invasion, Marmion had placed country over family and betrayed my mother into the Queen\u2019s custody. He in turn was betrayed by his sister, Persia, who placed family over country and helped my mother escape. In the end, Marmion\u2019s men had unwittingly set fire to Persia\u2019s manor house in a botched spying attempt. Marmion himself was stripped of his title and sent into exile. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect of him.</p><p>He read it in my face and smiled wryly. \u201cI bear you no ill will, Prince Imriel. But I must confess myself terribly curious to meet Melisande\u2019s infamous son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I infamous?\u201d I asked lightly.</p><p>Marmion\u2019s gaze shifted back to Sidonie. \u201cI thought so when I heard you\u2019d seduced the Queen\u2019s heir. Now it seems mayhap I was mistaken.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cMelisande\u2019s son risking life and limb on behalf of Ysandre\u2019s daughter. Who would have thought to see the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d I said. \u201cBut mayhap the gods themselves have ways of redressing old wrongs.\u201d</p><p>He turned a measuring look on me. \u201cYou look a lot like her, you know. You must hear it often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so very often,\u201d I said. \u201cPeople seldom speak of my mother to me unless they\u2019re telling me what horrors her actions visited on their families.\u201d</p><p>Marmion laughed without mirth. \u201cI suppose so. Is it true that you\u2019ve seen her?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOn Cythera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelisande.\u201d He was silent a moment. \u201cIs it true that her sentence was commuted to exile in exchange for her aid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p><p>He shook his head again. \u201cSo after all she\u2019s done, our sentences are the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lord,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cI understand that your sister\u2019s death was an accident. It was a terrible tragedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Marmion gathered himself. \u201cTell me, is she happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother?\u201d I thought about it. \u201cI think she has found a certain calm and acceptance. I wouldn\u2019t call her happy.\u201d</p><p>Whether or not the answer pleased him, I couldn\u2019t say. Marmion studied me. \u201cI see a good deal of House Courcel in you, too. It\u2019s not as obvious, but it\u2019s there. You\u2019ve a look of Prince Rolande, Ysandre\u2019s father. I remember him from when I was a boy. Too impetuous for his own good, but he had a streak of high nobility.\u201d He touched my arm, light and unexpected. \u201cI wish you well, of course. All of us pray you succeed. But it would please me to know you restored honor to House Shahrizai\u2019s name. That\u2019s all I desired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It touched me. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel!\u201d Sidonie joined us, eyes sparkling. She greeted my exiled kinsman. \u201cYou must be Lord Marmion. Well met, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cJust Marmion, your highness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I will be just Sidonie,\u201d she said. \u201cSince it is my hope that we will be near-kin one day.\u201d</p><p>Marmion smiled. \u201cI do believe that would please me, too. Blessed Elua hold and keep you, Sidonie. And when you see your mother . . . tell Ysandre that I think fondly of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Sidonie promised.</p><p>With that, he took his leave of us. I gazed thoughtfully after him. \u201cDo you suppose he was ever your mother\u2019s . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie shook her head. \u201cNo, I actually asked her about that one of the few times we spoke about you without acrimony. I remembered hearing that he was one of her favorite courtiers before he was exiled. She was fond of Marmion. He made her laugh. But she never took him as a lover.\u201d She gave me one of her quick, flickering smiles. \u201c\u2019Tis a pity. She might have been more sympathetic toward us if she had.\u201d</p> <p>I slid one arm around her waist, pulling her against me. \u201cDo you suspect your mother of harboring perverse desires?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie looped her arms around my neck. \u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p><p>All in all, Lady Nicola\u2019s f\u00eate was a considerable success. We were all strung tighter than overtuned harps, and we needed the distraction. None of us forgot about Carthage\u2019s army camped outside Am\u00edlcar\u2019s walls. None of us forgot that come the first clear night, we would attempt a desperate venture. But for now, we were alive and free, and we celebrated that fact, Aragonian and D\u2019Angeline alike.</p><p>If the food was scant and the great hall dim and a trifle cool for a scarcity of lamp-oil and hearth-wood, it didn\u2019t matter. Keg after keg of wine was breached, and Ramiro Zorn\u00edn de Aragon urged folk to drink with mournful enthusiasm, making everyone laugh and Lady Nicola smile with fond indulgence. The musicians played until sweat dripped from their brows.</p><p>We were alive.</p><p>We were free.</p> <p>And at the end of the night, I got to retire with my beloved.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d In our darkened bedchamber, Sidonie breathed my name. I found her mouth and kissed her. She tasted like wine and honey on my tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your desire, Sun Princess?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She sank to her knees, her hands gliding over my chest. I felt her fingers undoing my breeches. I felt my taut phallus spring free. I groaned as she licked the underside, swirling her tongue around the crown like a child with a sweet. Groaned louder when she took me into her mouth, sinking my hands into her hair and freeing its coils, feeling her nails digging into my buttocks.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I gasped.</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s eyes gleamed in the faint light. \u201cIs that a signale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word emerged as a growl deep in my throat. \u201cCome here, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Beneath her gown, Sidonie was still bandaged, clean strips of white linen laced across her shoulders, crisscrossing her breasts. For the first time since I\u2019d wounded her, I ignored her injury. I laid her on her back and spread her thighs, fitting myself between them, propped on one arm. I teased her, taking my phallus in my hand and rubbing its swollen crown against her slick cleft until she gasped and begged, her back arching, hips thrusting helplessly.</p> <p>Then I took her.</p><p>Deep.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>\u201cElua!\u201d Sidonie\u2019s last ragged gasp burst in my ear, her inner muscles milking my shaft. I burst in her, spending myself, seeing a sparkling darkness behind my closed eyelids. Good, so good. Where did Sidonie begin and Imriel end? I couldn\u2019t even tell anymore. This could be the last time. I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>I never wanted to know.</p><p>Our bodies quieted in the aftermath of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYour back?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s all right.\u201d Her voice was low and different. It always was after love-making. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, it was worth it.\u201d</p><p>I rolled off her, sliding my arm beneath her. \u201cSleep, love.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie lay in the crook of my arm. \u201cLook at the window. It\u2019s almost dawn.\u201d We watched the light seep through the shuttered window. \u201cIt looks as though the weather might have cleared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>We looked at one another. \u201cRight.\u201d Sidonie nodded. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>In the morning\u2014or later in the morning\u2014when we arose, we found it was true. The weather had broken and the day was clear and bright, giving every promise of a clear, cloudless night.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do it tonight,\u201d I said to Sidonie. \u201cNot after the f\u00eate.\u201d</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>In the early afternoon, Captain Aureliano, the soldier I\u2019d met atop the walls of the city, sought us out, finding us in the palace library. He\u2019d struck me as a competent, easygoing fellow when I\u2019d met him. Today he was as serious as death.</p><p>\u201cWell met, your highness,\u201d he said when I introduced him to Sidonie. \u201cGeneral Liberio sent me to confer with you.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie paled. \u201cIs it tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Aureliano took a deep breath. \u201cThe general had us let the word slip to Astegal\u2019s men that there was a f\u00eate last night. We do a fair bit of taunting back and forth, you know. Not much else to do. But he reckoned that in the event the weather cleared today, they\u2019d never expect us to pull a stunt tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cLiberio\u2019s a clever fellow,\u201d Aureliano said. \u201cI\u2019ll be in command of your company. He\u2019s sent me to go over every instruction with you to be sure there are no mistakes made tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us what we need to know,\u201d Sidonie said in a resolute tone.</p><p>Aureliano went over the plan step by step. Saddlebags would be delivered to our quarters. We were to pack our things and be ready by nightfall\u2014nothing more than we could carry on horseback. That part at least was simple\u2014neither of us possessed more than we could carry.</p><p>\u201cWhat about supplies?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYour guide will be carrying enough to get you through the first night or so. Once you\u2019re north of Am\u00edlcar, you\u2019ll find villages willing to trade. Carthage\u2019s sway lies to the south yet.\u201d</p><p>The sortie was to take place some hours after midnight. Aureliano and his men would come to fetch us and escort us to the western gates of the city.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re opening the gates?\u201d I asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cNo choice,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cThere are sally ports to the north and south, but they\u2019re too small to admit aught but foot-soldiers. Not horses, and surely not that movable gangplank.\u201d</p><p>The balance of the plan was simple. Liberio\u2019s infantry men would essay a pair of sorties; the first from the southern sally port to provide a distraction, and the second from the northern port. Once the latter had secured the trench, the gates would be opened. A company of soldiers would rush forth with the gangplank to bridge the trench. As soon as it was in place, we\u2019d follow. A second company, the one that would scatter across Aragonia, would follow in our wake.</p><p>\u201cGetting across the plank\u2019s going to be the worst of it,\u201d Aureliano warned us. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go single file. Do you ride well, your highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTolerably,\u201d Sidonie said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He gave a brusque nod. \u201cGetting to the bridge proper is the second worst. We\u2019ll be crossing ground held by Carthage. With luck, they\u2019ll be too confused and in disarray to act swiftly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Astegal will be fuming his way from Montero,\u201d I observed. \u201cWhere he\u2019s been careless enough to ensconce himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Aureliano smiled briefly. \u201cThere are ten of us escorting you. Once we\u2019ve crossed the plank, I want you to fall into the following formation. Four lines of three abreast. Your highness, you\u2019ll be in the middle of the second rank, directly behind me. Prince Imriel, you\u2019ll be in the middle of the third rank. The last rank will form your rearguard. Is that too difficult to understand?\u201d</p><p>The question was directed at Sidonie. On any other occasion she would have shot him a cool look. Today she shook her head somberly. \u201cNo, my lord captain. I think I can manage it.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, he took her at her word. \u201cGood. Once we\u2019ve crossed the bridge, we ride like hell. There\u2019s a squadron of archers will try to follow in our wake. They\u2019ll hold the bridge behind us as long as they can to delay pursuit. When your guide Paskal gives the word, you\u2019ll split off from the company. Do you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sidonie said.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cYou and the men who drew this assignment . . . how were you chosen?\u201d</p><p>Aureliano met my eyes. \u201cWe volunteered. What do you reckon our odds are?\u201d</p><p>I thought about the Amazigh guards beheading the assassin in the garden. Desert justice. \u201cDo any of you speak Hellene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGive yourselves up before the Amazigh catch you of their own accord,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t give them an excuse to kill you out of hand. Try to convince them you\u2019ve information you\u2019ll give only to Astegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tell Astegal you were forced into cooperating,\u201d Sidonie added. \u201cTell him Serafin and Liberio threatened to kill your wives and children. Tell him you want to swear loyalty to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it work?\u201d Aureliano asked.</p><p>Sidonie shrugged. \u201cIt might. He takes a certain pleasure in getting folk to betray their loyalties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thanks.\u201d He bowed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you anon. Take some sleep if you can. It\u2019s going to be a grueling night.\u201d</p><p>Fifty-Eight</p><p>At the hour of midnight, we gathered in the great hall to wait.</p><p>The mood was quiet and subdued, the palace nearly empty. Most folk were either sleeping or elsewhere along the city walls. But Lady Nicola waited with us, for which I was grateful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve everything in readiness?\u201d she asked for the third or fourth time. It was unsettling to see her unsettled.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Nicola shuddered and wrapped her arms around herself. \u201cIt\u2019s the waiting. It drives one mad, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie didn\u2019t comment. I watched her gathering herself, gathering her courage. Mostly I just watched her, etching her features on my memory over and over again. I wasn\u2019t afraid for myself, but I was terrified for her sake. I wondered if Joscelin had felt that way. Probably, I thought, and with a great deal more regularity.</p><p>Still, it was awful.</p><p>It almost seemed too soon when Aureliano and his men came for us. He introduced us to Paskal, our guide. Paskal was a short, dark, broad-chested fellow who seemed disconcertingly young. I\u2019d hoped for someone steady and authoritative, someone like Urist. But Paskal\u2019s mother was Euskerri. He knew the language and the territory. I supposed that was more important than age.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Aureliano asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie glanced at me, then reached for my hand, gripping it hard. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We bade farewell to Lady Nicola, who embraced us both. \u201cI\u2019ll not say good-bye to you,\u201d she said steadily. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet again. But yes.\u201d She forestalled Sidonie\u2019s question. \u201cEmmenghanom. I remember. And I have it written and saved in a safe place.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie smiled quietly. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Another leavetaking.</p><p>Gods, I hated them.</p><p>We rode through the moon-silvered streets of Am\u00edlcar, the city silent and tense. The first sortie hadn\u2019t been launched yet. General Liberio wanted to be certain every element was in readiness. Once they struck, things would move very quickly.</p><p>Our company gathered inside the western gate, behind the stalwart company of soldiers responsible for maneuvering the gangplank into place. I didn\u2019t envy them their task. They\u2019d be slow-moving and exposed.</p><p>A runner went to inform the General that we were ready. We waited. My horse shifted under me, cocking one hip. I wished I had the Bastard. He\u2019d make a target, though, his speckled white hide gleaming in the moonlight. We rode dark horses, wore dark clothing. Our armor was darkened with ash and grease. Sidonie was shrouded in a man\u2019s black cloak, the hood drawn up to hide her hair.</p><p>We waited.</p><p>The first sortie struck.</p><p>On the far side of the wall, a clamor of chaos and confusion arose to the south of us. The sound of bowstrings twanging. Shouts of pain and anger, battle-cries. A clash of weapons. Horns blaring an alarm. I wished I could see what was happening.</p><p>Then the second sortie.</p><p>The sounds of battle intensified. South and north. Men screaming, men dying. We\u2019d be riding through it. I glanced at Sidonie. She met my gaze, her eyes wide: twin pools of blackness in her pale face.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens, I love you,\u201d she said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let Astegal have me?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>More horns blared\u2014ours, in the tower of the gatehouse. \u201cBe ready,\u201d Aureliano said briefly.</p><p>It was a proper portcullis, massive and heavy. Somewhere in the gatehouse a gear cranked, raising the grate. Two men wrestled with the heavy bar of the inner gates. Four men in concert shoved at the doors themselves, hurling them open.</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>The infantry soldiers carrying the portable bridge raced forward, dashing for the trench some thirty yards away. The fighting was north and south. Before us, the moon-shadowed ground was open. At Aureliano\u2019s signal, we moved forward into the open gateway. He raised one hand, bidding us wait. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We waited.</p><p>Liberio\u2019s soldiers scuttled under their burden. Dim figures peeled away from the fighting on both fronts. I couldn\u2019t tell if they were Am\u00edl-car\u2019s men or Carthage\u2019s. Both, I thought. Metal clashed on metal. I settled my buckler on my left arm and drew my sword. Our fellows wrestled the gangplank into place, bridging the trench.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Aureliano shouted.</p> <p>He led the charge, spear lowered. One by one, we followed.</p><p>Single file.</p><p>This was the hardest part, the worst part. I fell in behind Sidonie. The speed of our passage had blown her hood back, loosened her hair. It streamed, silver in the moonlight. I saw a figure racing to intercept her on foot, wielding a throwing-axe. I dug my heels hard into my mount\u2019s flanks, passing her. I rode him down before he had a chance to throw, trampling him. My mount balked and shied.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d I shouted at Sidonie, pointing with my sword toward the improvised bridge.</p><p>She went.</p> <p>Several of Aureliano\u2019s men passed me. I wrestled my mount under control, cursing him. The rearguard checked their horses, yelling at me. I rejoined the column. We thundered toward the trench, toward the gangplank. Overhead, the moon shone, placid and bright. All around us, men fought and died.</p><p>One, two, three . . . I was the ninth to cross. I could feel the planks dip and give under the weight of my mount, but they held. A Carthaginian soldier veered out of the darkness unexpectedly, jabbing at me with a thrusting spear. I kneed my horse hard and it swerved.</p><p>\u201cFall in!\u201d Aureliano was shouting. \u201cFall in!\u201d</p><p>We obeyed, all of us. Falling into the formation he\u2019d ordered: four ranks of three. Or mayhap three ranks. I didn\u2019t know if the rearguard had made it, and I didn\u2019t know if the archers meant to hold the bridge were following. I didn\u2019t dare look. All that mattered was that I could see Sidonie in front of me, alive. And in front of her was Aureliano and his line, clearing the way with lowered spears. Astegal\u2019s infantry fell away before their onslaught, unprepared.</p><p>And beyond, the bridge across the Barca River.</p><p>Somewhere, more horns were raising an urgent cry. Ahead of me, a racing figure hurled a javelin. The soldier to the left of Sidonie went down, his mount rolling and squealing horribly.</p> <p>\u201cMove!\u201d I shouted at the soldier on my left. \u201cMove up!\u201d</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>I swore and urged my mount past him, cutting him off. Not such a bad horse, really. I fell in beside Sidonie, taking my place at her side. I saw a Carthaginian archer kneel, taking aim in the moonlight. His bow twanged. I twisted in the saddle, leaning low, and caught the shaft on my buckler.</p><p>And then there was the bridge and a double line of men determined to defend it. Aureliano rode them down without hesitation. The soldier to his right went down. I chopped mercilessly with my sword, hacking at blurred faces in the moonlight, shoving at them with my arrow-pierced buckler.</p><p>We cleared the line.</p><p>We crossed the bridge, dark, moonlit water sliding beneath us.</p><p>Behind us, more bows twanged. Ours or theirs? I couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cRide!\u201d Aureliano\u2019s voice rose. \u201cRide for your damned lives!\u201d</p> <p>It was a strange and surreal flight, hurtling ourselves across the moon-drenched landscape. We rode at a hectic pace, clinging to our saddles. Bit by bit, the sound of fighting faded. Pursuit was coming, but not yet. We followed the road as it curved along the coastline, rising into the foothills.</p><p>Within a quarter of an hour, there was dense pine forest crowding the western edge of the road. Not long after they appeared, Paskal drew rein and whistled sharply. Our company halted.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d I asked Paskal.</p><p>Our guide shrugged. \u201cBetter sooner than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d I said to Aureliano. \u201cGive them a good chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sidonie added soberly. \u201cMore than I can say. May the gods be with you and your men.\u201d</p><p>Aureliano gave a brusque nod. \u201cAnd you, your highness.\u201d</p><p>That was all. There was no time to waste or spare. Aureliano raised one hand in farewell and ordered his men to move. Paskal beckoned for us to follow, turning his mount into the forest.</p><p>We had to travel slowly. The dense pines blocked out the moonlight until there was barely enough to see by. Branches reached for us, prickling and tangling as we made our way between the trees. The foothills weren\u2019t steep, but the grade was deceptive. Our horses had been ridden hard, and I could feel mine laboring. The slow pace made my skin itch.</p><p>But we were alive.</p><p>And the very factors that slowed us protected us. The road had been utterly blocked from our view within twenty paces. The thick pine mast muffled the sound of our horses\u2019 hooves. There was no way the Amazigh could suspect we\u2019d turned off the road, no way they could track us here at night.</p><p>Not long after we entered the forest, we heard the sound of hoofbeats in the direction from which we\u2019d come. Many hoofbeats, racing along the road. The sound rose and rose, then faded as they continued onward.</p><p>\u201cAstegal\u2019s cavalry,\u201d Paskal said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cLikely,\u201d I said. \u201cPray for your friends and press onward.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we rode that night. Hours. I found myself haunted by the memory of my long search for Berlik, wandering through the endless Vralian forests. And I thought, too, of the night that Clunderry had staged a cattle-raid, the night that my bindings had broken and I\u2019d ridden into the woods alone, compelled by Morwen\u2019s summons. And then there was the night I\u2019d entered the standing stones with Morwen, that terrible night, and the race through the woods afterward.</p><p>It was a relief when the grey light of dawn began to filter through the trees. Paskal halted. \u201cThe forest should break in another league.\u201d He pointed westward. \u201cUnless I\u2019ve led us astray, there is a shepherd\u2019s hut where we can take shelter for a few hours. Can you keep going, your highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie looked weary, but her voice was adamant. \u201cThank you, messire, but you needn\u2019t ask. I can ride as long and hard as need be. Just don\u2019t let the horses founder.\u201d</p><p>Paskal glanced at me for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cShe means it,\u201d I said. \u201cOn both counts.\u201d</p><p>So we pressed onward. The going was easier in daylight, and despite my misgivings about his youth, Paskal was a good guide. We emerged from the pine forest to bright green hills, a stone hut visible in the distance.</p><p>\u201cWell done!\u201d I commended him.</p><p>He smiled with pride. \u201cI can always find my way to anyplace I\u2019ve been. My mother says it is because birds sang to me in the womb while she carried me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d Sidonie murmured.</p><p>Paskal\u2019s smile widened. \u201cThank you, your highness.\u201d</p><p>He led us down the valley and up the far side to the shepherd\u2019s hut. After being trapped in besieged Am\u00edlcar, I had to own, I felt my heart rise at the sight of all that open space surrounding us, green hills as far as I could see. We were exposed, but no one could come upon us unseen, that was a surety.</p><p>There was a little stream where we were able to water the horses. Paskal carefully laid out the contents of his packs: a measure of grain for our mounts, bread and cheese and sausage for us. I bade Sidonie sit on the lumpy pallet in the hut and set about building a small fire in the pit in the middle of the floor. Elua knows, after Vralia, that was a skill I\u2019d mastered beyond compare.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take first watch or shall I?\u201d I asked Paskal after he\u2019d fed the horses.</p><p>He looked surprised. \u201cI will keep watch, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cPaskal, we\u2019re dependent on you to reach Roncal before Astegal\u2019s men. Once they discover they\u2019ve been tricked, they\u2019ll ride like the devil. We need you with your wits and astonishing bird-sense about you. That means we\u2019re sharing duties, you and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d I said. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>Paskal flushed. \u201cNineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods,\u201d I muttered. He seemed younger; but then, I doubted he\u2019d lived through anything close to what I had by the time I was his age. \u201cJust do as I say, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst watch, then.\u201d He glanced at Sidonie. \u201cI daresay her highness would appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>With that settled, Paskal went outside to keep the first watch, while I joined Sidonie on the lumpy pallet. \u201cAre you all right, love?\u201d I asked softly, folding my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I could keep going if we didn\u2019t need to breathe the horses. And I don\u2019t mind taking my turn at watch.\u201d She shivered a little. \u201cMy first real glimpse of war, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I tightened my arms around her. \u201cSorry you had to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie was quiet a moment. \u201cNo, I think it was important that I did. Important that I understand what it is that I\u2019ve asked Aragonia to do and what I will ask the Euskerri to do. Not only in abstract terms of freedom and country, but the real cost of blood and horror.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips to her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a remarkable Queen someday.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie rested her head on my shoulder. \u201cNot for a long, long time, I hope. My mother\u2019s a remarkable ruler in her own right. I\u2019d be more than happy to spend the balance of my days as a remarkable heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my love, isn\u2019t in question,\u201d I observed.</p><p>After that we slept for a time. It felt like only a few minutes before Paskal came to wake me with a tentative shake, but I could see that the sun had shifted. I freed myself gently from Sidonie. Paskal curled up in a blanket on the other side of the hut, and I went outside to keep watch for another hour or so.</p><p>I hated to wake them. The little fire I\u2019d built had warmed the hut until it was almost cozy and they both looked so peaceful: the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange and the nineteen-year-old soldier-lad with a good sense of direction on whom our lives currently depended. But the horses were rested, the day was fleeting, and we had nearly a hundred leagues to cover before we reached Roncal.</p><p>\u201cTime to go,\u201d I said.</p><p>A short time later, we were on our way.</p><p>Fifty-Nine</p><p>We pushed the horses as hard as we dared on that journey. It was far from the worst trek I\u2019d known in my life, but it wasn\u2019t pleasant. The little villages that clung to the sides of the hills were few and far between, and those we encountered offered nothing in the way of comfortable lodgings.</p><p>In the villages, we were greeted with a mix of suspicion and awe. I was apprehensive each time we entered one, remembering the hostility in New Carthage and the attempt on Sidonie\u2019s life. Here in the north, it was better. They hadn\u2019t felt the sting of defeat yet. But neither were they willing to wholeheartedly believe a wild tale from the lips of two D\u2019Angelines and a lone half-Euskerri guide riding out of the hills. And even if I\u2019d been inclined, I couldn\u2019t play out my transformation from Leander Maignard\u2019s semblance. I had abandoned the last of his tattered, scorched attire in Am\u00edlcar, and I didn\u2019t trust a pair of eardrops and a couple of gaudy rings to sustain Ptolemy Solon\u2019s spell for any length of time. I\u2019d pushed my luck far enough.</p><p>So Paskal and I continued to sleep in shifts, in villages or out of them. There were several nights when we were forced to make camp in the open, sleeping on the cold, hard ground. I didn\u2019t mind on my behalf and Paskal seemed a hardy sort, but I knew Sidonie was uncomfortable. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to this sort of hardship. Still, she bore it without complaining.</p><p>On one such night, she came to join me while I kept watch during my shift, wrapped in my cloak.</p><p>\u201cUnable to sleep?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Sidonie nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s perishing cold without you to warm me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could huddle with Paskal,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019d rather sit with you.\u201d</p><p>I opened my cloak. \u201cCome here, then.\u201d We sat together in companionable silence until I could feel her growing warmer and relaxing beneath my arm. \u201cI wish I had my flute,\u201d I said. \u201cI could charm you to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still remember the tune?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I tried to hum the charmed melody with which Morwen had haunted my dreams in Alba, the song that had won my freedom in Vralia, sending my gaolers to sleep. But the notes and the cadence were gone, slipping from my memory. My voice faltered and at last I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cIt might have been useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap D\u2019Angelines weren\u2019t meant to meddle with magic,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d she mused. \u201cOr mayhap we never bothered, content with the magic that lay within ourselves and the arts Elua and his Companions taught us. If we\u2019d known more, if we\u2019d been wiser in the ways of the arcane arts, we might not have succumbed to Bodeshmun\u2019s spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I might have been able to protect myself from Morwen\u2019s charm instead of having to rely on the ollamhs,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Sidonie stirred. \u201cWe could found an academy to study it. That could be our legacy, you and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I smiled into the night. \u201cI thought our legacy was going to be ensuring the enduring survival of House Courcel by providing it with a multitude of heirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHordes,\u201d I said promptly. \u201cHordes and hordes of brooding boys and haughty girls who will grow up and surprise everyone, including themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t do both,\u201d Sidonie observed. \u201cAfter we finish saving the realm.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I squeezed her shoulders. \u201cThere is that.\u201d</p><p>Another silence settled between us. I was beginning to think mayhap she\u2019d drifted into sleep when she broke it, her voice low. \u201cDo you often think about the son you lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I swallowed. My unborn son, the child who would have grown into a tyrant. \u201cNot so much as I did in the first year, but yes. Of course.\u201d I tried to make out her face in the dim light. \u201cDoes it frighten you to think on it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie gazed at me with that expression of utter trust that nearly split my heart in two. \u201cYou asked me that once before, and my answer is the same. No. There\u2019s nothing that lies between the two of us that frightens me, Imriel. We defied Blessed Elua\u2019s precept and others paid the price for it. We have to live with that, you and I. If we survive this, I think we might at least reckon ourselves forgiven in part.\u201d She smiled slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel about hordes, mind you. But I think we could manage a brooding boy and a haughty girl or two. \u2019Tis a pleasant thing to contemplate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife and hope,\u201d I murmured, holding her closer.</p><p>\u201cAnd love,\u201d she added.</p><p>Two days later, we reached Roncal.</p><p>That last leg of our journey was the most difficult and the most beautiful. The hills grew ever steeper, the views breathtaking. In the distance, to the north, we could see snow on the peaks of the mountains; and yet, the slopes themselves were a bright, vivid green, even in winter, except where they were blanketed with darker pines. The air was crisp and cold, and our breath came short. Still, I could understand why the Euskerri loved their territory.</p> <p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d Paskal pointed as we crested the seventh peak of the day, our mounts huffing. \u201cRoncal.\u201d</p><p>As strongholds went, it didn\u2019t look like much. It was a village of charming red-roofed buildings nestled in the valley. But the river that snaked through the valley had carved a passage through the mountains beyond, wide enough to be easily traversed, yet narrow enough to be easily defended. I could appreciate the strategic value of the place. The best thing of all about it was that there was no sign that Astegal\u2019s cavalry had arrived before us.</p><p>We descended into the valley. The houses were whitewashed with red or green shutters, designs and words painted over the doorways. I asked Paskal what they meant.</p><p>\u201cThose are the names of the houses,\u201d he said. \u201cOf their families. And the symbol of the sun to greet the dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEguzki,\u201d Sidonie said, half to herself. \u201cThe sun.\u201d</p><p>Paskal gave her a startled look. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Curious faces peered from a few of the houses and a man with a large wheel of cheese on his shoulder passed by, giving us a hard stare. Paskal led us along the valley, reading the names of the houses aloud. At one of the largest, he halted.</p><p>\u201cThis is the house of Iturralde,\u201d he said with shy pride.</p><p>\u201cPaskal, you\u2019re a genius,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grinned. \u201cJust lucky like a bird.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie took a deep breath. \u201cWell, \u2019tis time to face the second test of diplomacy.\u201d There was a trace of dismay in her voice. \u201cWould that I could bathe first.\u201d</p><p>There weren\u2019t many folk in Euskerri territory who would recognize the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange if she turned up on their doorstep, but Janpier Iturralde was one of them. It was a woman who answered Paskal\u2019s initial knock. Sidonie and I waited. I\u2019d dismounted and stood holding her bridle, which was as close as we could come to presenting any manner of formal appearance. But she sat upright in the saddle, her posture regal and her expression composed.</p><p>The woman glanced over at us, eyes widening. She and Paskal exchanged words in the Euskerri tongue, and then she vanished. Paskal returned to join us. A few moments later, a man emerged. He was a sturdy, barrel-chested fellow with black hair and dark eyes set close to a long, straight nose. He stood on the doorstep for a long moment, staring at us, then at last approached.</p><p>\u201cI did not believe it,\u201d he said in accented Aragonian. \u201cBut it is true.\u201d</p> <p>Sidonie inclined her head. \u201cGreetings, etxekojaun. It is a pleasure to see you once more.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked. \u201cThe daughter of the Queen of Terre d\u2019Ange comes to my house and greets me with a Euskerri courtesy. Why? I thought your country had gone mad and you\u2019d run away to marry the Lion of Carthage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has and I did,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cNow I come bearing a tale of dire magics, a pursuing army, and an offer for Euskerria\u2019s sovereignty on behalf of both Aragonia and Terre d\u2019Ange. Will you hear them?\u201d</p><p>The blood drained from Janpier Iturralde\u2019s face. \u201cDo you jest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBlessed Elua bear witness, I have never been more serious in my life.\u201d</p><p>He ushered us into his home with alacrity. Several hasty introductions were made, and then Sidonie poured out our tale to the Iturralde clan, while Janpier offered hurried translations for those who spoke no Aragonian.</p><p>It was hard to gauge their reaction. It was intense, but I couldn\u2019t say whether they were hostile or sympathetic. Janpier\u2019s pallor darkened ominously throughout the telling of our story. His wife covered her mouth with one hand and sat staring wide-eyed. Their eldest son clenched and unclenched his fists. When Sidonie had finished, there was a burst of Euskerri exchanged.</p><p>\u201cHow long before Carthage\u2019s men come?\u201d Janpier Iturralde demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sidonie said steadily. \u201cA day, mayhap. Mayhap hours. We saw no sign of them, but they\u2019ll be riding hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAstegal\u2019s cavalry numbers three hundred horse. I don\u2019t know how many he\u2019ll send.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree hundred!\u201d His brows rose. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a siege army,\u201d I observed. \u201cThere are thousands of infantry troops and a massive naval force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah!\u201d Janpier waved a dismissive hand. \u201cBut they\u2019re not here, are they?\u201d He turned to his sons\u2014there were three of them all told\u2014and issued a stream of orders in Euskerri. The lads nodded and departed in a hurry. The women of the household began bustling about without any orders given.</p><p>\u201cWhat passes?\u201d I asked Paskal in a low tone.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re marshaling the village,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Janpier Iturralde overheard us. He pointed a finger at Sidonie. \u201cEuskerria\u2019s hand will not be forced. We are not children to be bought by a simple bribe. We will defend ourselves and slaughter these men of Carthage. Only then will we decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairly said, etxekojaun,\u201d Sidonie agreed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was not my wish to imperil Euskerria. But Carthage would have come for you sooner or later. And if Am\u00edlcar falls, it will not be three hundred horse. It will be ten thousand on foot. Can you stand against them?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question. \u201cGo with Laida and the girls. They will take you to a safe place.\u201d He pointed to Paskal and me. \u201cYou and you will fight with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d I protested. \u201cIt is imperative that her highness Sidonie and I continue on to Terre d\u2019Ange. Will you not grant us passage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d Janpier shook his head. There was a spark of righteous fury in his gaze. \u201cYou have led this army to our doorstep. Either you stand beside us to fight them, or we will give them what they want. You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fight beside you!\u201d Paskal sounded eager.</p><p>Sidonie and I exchanged a glance. \u201c\u2019Tis a fair request,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cImriel . . .\u201d Her eyes glistened. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to lose you.\u201d</p><p>Janpier Iturralde overheard that, too. \u201cWhat makes you think I could bear to lose a single Euskerri life?\u201d he asked in a cold tone. \u201cDo you imagine you love your kinsman more than I love my own sons? My own flesh and blood?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he stands with us,\u201d Janpier said.</p><p>Sixty</p><p>There was a point north of the village where the pass narrowed so that the Amazigh would be forced to ride no more than three or four abreast, their line strung out and attenuated. It was there that we waited, hidden in the pine forests that flanked the pass on both sides.</p><p>Unorganized, Lady Nicola had called the Euskerri. Elua knows, that was true. There was little in the way of a command structure or a battle plan. A few of the younger lads were posted on lookout, perched high on the pines. When the Amazigh arrived, they\u2019d whistle sharply. We were to rush out with slings and javelins and slaughter Astegal\u2019s men.</p><p>That was the plan.</p><p>The women and children of Roncal had been evacuated to a campsite high in the hills above us where they would be safe, Sidonie among them. We\u2019d parted an hour before sundown. I could still feel her anguished farewell kiss lingering on my lips.</p><p>We waited.</p><p>The Amazigh didn\u2019t come that night. The sentries in the treetops kept their vigil. Those of us on the ground dozed, spread throughout the forest. I reckoned there were less than three hundred men of fighting age in the village, but the Euskerri seemed unconcerned about numbers.</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel?\u201d Paskal\u2019s voice reached out to me in the darkness, sounding young and uncertain. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBattle?\u201d I tilted my head in his direction. \u201cMuch like escaping from Am\u00edlcar.\u201d</p><p>He rustled. \u201cNo. Love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I remembered Leander Maignard asking me the same question outside a temple in Cythera. I leaned back against the trunk of the pine tree beneath which I was sitting, the rough bark snagging my hair. \u201cIt\u2019s a force to make a man yearn for a lifetime of peace, Paskal.\u201d</p><p>His reply sounded bewildered. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray you have the chance to do so,\u201d I said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long after dawn when the lookouts\u2019 sharp whistles roused us. I bounded to my feet, snatching my dagger from its scabbard and holding it by the tip. Since I didn\u2019t have a javelin or a sling, it was the best I could do. Ululating cries burst through the forest, men racing forward. I ran, too.</p><p>Astegal\u2019s Amazigh.</p><p>They were strung out in a long line throughout the pass. Nowhere to go, nowhere to maneuver. The Euskerri fell on them, hurtling javelins and stones from the high embankments. I threw my dagger as Joscelin had taught me and one of the Amazigh rocked back in the saddle, slumping. I leapt down and darted between horses, yanking at the reins of a second opponent whose panicked mount had him half-unseated. He cursed and chopped at me with his sword, trying at the same time to regain his balance. I parried with my arms raised above my head, vambraces crossed. Dorelei\u2019s gift. His blade skittered off their surface.</p><p>I caught his robes and jerked.</p><p>He fell.</p><p>I had my sword out before he hit the ground. I plunged it into his heart. His riderless horse reared above me, hooves flailing. I ducked under it, catching a glancing blow to the helm I\u2019d borrowed from Am\u00edl-car\u2019s armory. Before me, another man clutched at the javelin sprouting from his ribcage and toppled from the saddle, falling hard and bearing me down in a swirl of indigo robes. I scrambled out from underneath him, a little dizzy, and dealt him the mercy-blow.</p><p>Another figure sought to ride me down, sword swinging. I stepped sideways and parried in the Cassiline manner, my sword angled over my head. An unexpected maneuver, meant to defend against a foe on higher ground. His momentum carried him onward until a flung stone from an unseen enemy knocked him insensible.</p><p>Javelins and stones.</p><p>Ululating cries.</p><p>After that it was over very quickly. Janpier Iturralde hadn\u2019t been boasting. The Euskerri won that day, and they won handily. This was their territory and they knew every inch of it. There was no mercy. They swarmed the narrow pass with brutal efficiency, dispatching any who lived. They gathered the horses, herding them back toward the village. They tended their own dead and injured with care. They dragged the Amazigh dead into mounds.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Janpier studied me, blood-spattered. \u201cYou kept your word.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my chin at the piled dead. \u201cYou might want to strip the corpses. If you\u2019ve any thought of accepting Aragonia\u2019s offer, believe me, those robes make an almighty disguise.\u201d</p><p>He regarded me inscrutably, then issued an order in Euskerri and strode away.</p><p>They stripped the dead.</p><p>So many men! Faces laid bare, tawny limbs flopping. Some of them were a good deal younger than one would have reckoned behind the veils and robes. It was such a vulnerable thing, mortal flesh. I thought about Ghanim, the Amazigh slave who had extended such fierce loyalty to me when I\u2019d promised him his freedom. I wondered what bribe it was that Astegal had given these tribesmen in exchange for their loyalty, and I wondered if they\u2019d reckoned it worth the cost as they died.</p><p>The women emerged from their secret encampment. Wails of mourning for the Euskerri dead arose. Their losses had been light\u2014I\u2019d not counted more than a dozen\u2014but dead was dead. It was a small village. Every man slain was someone\u2019s brother or son, husband or father. In the midst of it Sidonie and I found one another.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d she whispered with profound relief. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cA few bruises.\u201d I wanted to hold her, but I didn\u2019t dare. I was covered in blood and filth.</p><p>\u201cPaskal?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d I assured her. \u201cHelping with the wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour highness!\u201d Janpier hailed her, picking his way back toward us through the dead. \u201cYou should be proud. Your kinsman fought well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s skilled with a blade.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s tone was neutral. \u201cI congratulate you on your victory, etxekojaun, and I grieve for your losses. What passes now?\u201d</p><p>Janpier Iturralde fixed her with a hard gaze. \u201cToday we celebrate and mourn. Tomorrow we send word of our victory and your offer throughout Euskerria. The day after, the debate begins. You will remain here until the matter is decided, of course. Laida will show you to the guest-house.\u201d</p><p>To the north, the empty pass beckoned. I had an overwhelming urge to snatch a pair of horses yet milling around us, grab Sidonie, and flee. I couldn\u2019t, of course. Sidonie had come to them as an emissary of Terre d\u2019Ange and Aragonia. She had to play the role in good faith on behalf of all the parties involved. Still, I yearned to move onward.</p> <p>All together, we made the long trek back to the village amid mixed jubilation and despair. There was more of the former than the latter. The women were somber, but the young, untried men among the Eus-kerri were filled with excitement, reliving the battle, while the older ones smiled with dour pride. The Amazigh horses were reckoned a serious prize.</p><p>And beneath it all, everyone was buzzing at the prospect of a free and sovereign Euskerria. Even without understanding the language, I could feel it. I prayed they would reach a swift decision in the days to come.</p><p>For a mercy, there actually was a guest-house in Roncal. Paskal explained to us that it was used during times of celebration when Euskerri from neighboring communities would come to stay and mingle. A good many marriages were arranged that way. But for now, its lodging-rooms were at our disposal. Through Paskal, Janpier\u2019s wife, Laida, introduced us to the etxekoandere, or mistress of the house, a dignified woman named Bixenta. And through Paskal, Bixenta assured us that we would be cared for in a manner befitting our stature.</p><p>\u201cIs it possible to have a bath?\u201d I asked with longing.</p><p>Bixenta unbent enough to smile a little when Paskal translated the question. \u201cThis will be arranged,\u201d Paskal told us. \u201cShe recommends that I do the same once you have finished.\u201d</p> <p>True to her word, Bixenta took good care of us. The hospitality was homely, but it was warm and unstinted. Sidonie and I took turns bathing in the wooden washtub in a tiny room off the guest-house\u2019s kitchen. Sidonie insisted on letting me go first.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fight a battle today,\u201d she murmured, undoing the buckles of my vambraces. \u201cI want to see for myself that you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>I was.</p><p>I had myriad bruises blossoming and a knot on my skull where a horse\u2019s hoof had dented my helmet, but my skin was whole. I let Sidonie examine me to her satisfaction before I clambered into the tub and scrubbed myself thoroughly. Elua, it felt good. Afterward, the water was so filthy it had to be changed. While fresh water heated, Bixenta took my dirty things to be laundered and brought clean, simple clothing in the Euskerri style: black breeches and vest and a white shirt with loose sleeves. There was a shadow of sorrow in her dark eyes, and I wondered who the clothes had belonged to.</p><p>And then it was Sidonie\u2019s turn.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your back, love,\u201d I said gently to her, unwinding bandages that hadn\u2019t been changed for two days.</p> <p>\u201cElua,\u201d she muttered, leaning forward in the bath and wrapping her arms around her knees. \u201cImriel, I look forward to the day when neither of us has to examine the other\u2019s wounds.\u201d</p><p>It looked good. The disk of scabbed flesh between her shoulder blades was beginning to crack and peel, revealing pink new skin underneath. I soaped it carefully, kneeling beside the tub, watching water and suds run down her spine. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Bixenta had brought clean attire for Sidonie, too. The dress had a fitted black bodice embroidered with elaborate needlework and a two-tiered skirt of white and crimson below. After I\u2019d applied fresh salve and clean bandages that Rachel had given us, I helped Sidonie don the dress. It smelled of cedar, as though it had been carefully preserved in a clothes-press.</p><p>We ventured out of the bathing-room to find Bixenta waiting. She pressed her hands together, raising them to her lips when we emerged. Her large dark eyes were bright with tears.</p><p>\u201cEtxekoandere.\u201d Sidonie hesitated, then framed a halting question in the Euskerri tongue, augmented with many gestures. It seemed she\u2019d put her time in the library of Am\u00edlcar to better use than I\u2019d reckoned. Bixenta replied in a torrent of Euskerri, her hands flying and gesticulating.</p><p>They communicated as women do, better than men. Bixenta pointed between the two of us, raising her brows and clasping her hands.</p><p>\u201cI think it was her wedding dress,\u201d Sidonie said to me in a soft voice. \u201cShe reckoned it was the only finery that would suit the occasion. I\u2019m not sure whether those are her husband\u2019s clothes or her son\u2019s that you\u2019re wearing. If I understand rightly, she\u2019s lost both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell her I\u2019m grateful?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>She nodded and did. Bixenta merely shook her head and urged us into the kitchen, where she fed us an ample meal of stewed red beans and spicy sausage.</p><p>That evening there was a celebration in the town square. As in the City of Elua, the square was dominated by a large oak tree. Paskal explained to us that the Euskerri reckoned any agreements made beneath the oak tree to be sacred and binding.</p><p>Tonight, though, there were no politics or debate, only music, song, and dance, fierce in expressing joy and sorrow alike. We watched while our hosts pressed cup after cup of strong cider on us. Some of the instruments seemed ancient and strange: high-pitched horns made from the horns of oxen, thick staves used to beat out a complex rhythm that echoed from the sides of the valley. One could well imagine that the Euskerri had been here from time out of mind, honing their arts long before Blessed Elua wandered the earth.</p><p>As the sun was beginning to set, a group of Euskerri men performed the final dance of the evening: a sword dance accompanied by flute and drum. The men faced one another in a double line, moving in deliberate, complex steps. Their blades glinted as they maneuvered them, periodically bringing them together with a loud, metallic clash. The lowering sun stained their white shirts with ruddy light.</p><p>The dance ended with a final flourish, clash, and shout at the precise moment the sun\u2019s lower rim touched the western edge of the mountains lining the valley. The drums and flutes fell silent. Everyone turned as one toward the west, touching their brows and breasts in a salute to the dying sun.</p><p>It gave me a shiver, even as Sidonie and I followed suit. There were traditions in Terre d\u2019Ange older than Blessed Elua, such as the arrival of the Sun Prince on the Longest Night.</p><p>This was a living embodiment of a very, very ancient faith.</p><p>And then the celebration was over. Along with Paskal, Sidonie and I returned to the guest-house where Bixenta had laid the beds in our chambers with linens smelling of soap and a hot iron\u2019s touch. It had been an arduous journey, a long night, and a fierce battle, and it was a blessed relief to lie in a warm, clean bed, feeling the silken warmth of Sidonie\u2019s bare skin against mine.</p><p>I meant to tell her, but I was asleep before I could get the words out.</p><p>Sixty-One</p><p>On the morrow Euskerri from all across the mountains began pouring into Roncal.</p><p>I was surprised at how quickly the news had travelled. Paskal explained to us that the beating-staves used at the previous night\u2019s celebration had carried word as far as two leagues. Dozens of messengers had departed at first light to spread the news farther, riding the swift Amazigh horses captured in the battle.</p><p>More and more Euskerri came.</p><p>They were all cut from a similar cloth, men and women alike. A dark-haired, dark-eyed folk, proud and rugged. Very few of them spoke aught but their own tongue. I wished I could understand them.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sidonie said ruefully when I voiced the thought. \u201c\u2019Tis frustrating. I understand only a little myself. I\u2019ll have no way to gauge whether or not my words have swayed them, no way to gauge what they\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the outcome is in doubt?\u201d I asked in surprise. \u201cI have the sense they\u2019re hell-bent on gaining sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She knit her brows. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Mayhap I\u2019m overanxious. I can\u2019t stop worrying over what\u2019s happening at home. It goads me somewhat fierce to be so close.\u201d</p><p>On the following day, the debate began.</p><p>It was held in the village square, crowded to overflowing. A small dais had been constructed at the base of the oak tree. Sidonie stood atop it, flanked by Paskal and me. In the midst of a sea of dark-haired folk, she stood out like a beacon, far more than I did. She told our tale in a strong, clear voice, pausing after every few sentences for Janpier Iturralde to translate her words into Euskerri.</p><p>There were no interruptions. We had been told that the debate would follow on the heels of her words. Sidonie talked and they listened.</p><p>She told the story well. There were no dramatic embellishments; it was compelling enough on its own merits and any clever twist of rhetoric or theatrical gesture would fail to translate. She expressed regret for leading the Amazigh to Roncal while making it clear that the situation in the south was growing desperate, and that if the Aragonians and the Euskerri didn\u2019t stand together against Carthage at this juncture, they would fall separately. She enumerated Astegal\u2019s forces in succinct terms.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think the Euskerri doubted her, at least not in a broad sense. We might not have had a parlor trick to play to lend credence to our tale of ensorcelment, but the essential reality of the situation was self-evident. Terre d\u2019Ange was in disarray to the north and Aragonia besieged to the south. The Amazigh had come in pursuit as Sidonie had said they would. Janpier Iturralde could vouch for her identity.</p><p>She presented Iturralde with the written charter of sovereignty that Serafin\u2019s council had prepared and described it in clear detail for the benefit of the audience. She recited from memory the terms of the accord to which her mother had been willing to agree well over a year ago, detailing the D\u2019Angeline territory to be ceded. She gave her word on behalf of Terre d\u2019Ange that not only would the accord be kept if the Euskerri agreed to it, but that Terre d\u2019Ange would use its sway to ensure that Aragonia didn\u2019t break faith with Euskerria.</p><p>When Sidonie finished, a great roar arose, not cheers, but merely the sound of thousands of voices rising in simultaneous argument as the Euskerri turned to one another in the square, taking up their individual concerns and ignoring her presence. She blinked, taken aback.</p><p>Janpier Iturralde moved closer to us. \u201cThere will be debate for many hours,\u201d he said frankly. \u201cPerhaps for days, as others come to Roncal. There is nothing more you can do. Wait in the guest-house and I will send word if there is a decision or further questions.\u201d</p><p>I glanced involuntarily toward the north. \u201cMy lord, is it not possible\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sidonie laid a hand on my arm. \u201cWe will await your word, etxekojaun,\u201d she said calmly.</p><p>In the days that followed\u2014and it did take days\u2014the debate raged heatedly. If there was a system of governance in place among the Eus-kerri, I failed to grasp it. Of a surety, there was no single ruler. It didn\u2019t appear that there was a formal parliament or governing council, either, nor any form of elected republic. As best I could determine, each village had its own headman or woman, but they were not allowed to represent the views of the village until concord was reached.</p><p>And once it was, the headmen and women of the villages argued the matter all over again amongst themselves. Only when they had come to agreement did they select spokespersons to carry out their will.</p><p>There was a certain fairness to it, but it was a messy process and a frustrating one. Like Sidonie, I chafed at our nearness to the D\u2019Angeline border. Along with every other house in Roncal, the guest-house where we were lodged was now filled to overflowing, half a dozen women aiding Bixenta in cooking and cleaning for the contentious horde. Every night, I entertained thoughts of laying claim to a pair of swift horses and fleeing north.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Sidonie said irritably when I proposed the idea for a second time. \u201cImriel, I agreed to this. If we flee, it undermines all our credence. There will be no agreement, no alliance. The best we could hope is that Am\u00edlcar holds until we can send aid. And then we\u2019re talking about sending D\u2019Angelines to fight and die in the Euskerri\u2019s stead. In the end, I\u2019m accountable to our people.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cI know! It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She blew out her breath in an impatient sigh. \u201cGods! I think about it every hour of every day. Do you think it\u2019s not killing me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grasped her shoulders hard, rubbing her collarbones with my thumbs. It calmed me. I could feel her body yielding beneath my touch, ceding what her determined sense of honor and propriety wouldn\u2019t. \u201cNo, I know. I do. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shook her head and reached for me.</p><p>We took out our frustrations on ourselves, on each other. In the midst of turmoil and uncertainty, we found surety. Helpless to rearrange the world to my liking, I was at least able to control this. Unable to relinquish her role, Sidonie was at least able to surrender in our bed. We made love like war. I pinned her wrists high above her head with one hand, feeling her arch beneath me. I plowed her relentlessly, driving her to climax after climax, until I had to release my grip and spend myself deep within her. I felt her nails score my back, her thighs tightening around hips.</p><p>\u201cSo Astegal didn\u2019t take that from you,\u201d I murmured into the crook of her neck.</p><p>\u201cAstegal took nothing from us!\u201d Sidonie whispered fiercely in my ear. \u201cYou promised me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I meant it.\u201d I propped myself on one arm. \u201cNothing he did could ever alter my love for you. But\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou wondered if having my innermost will perverted would curb my penchant for violent pleasure.\u201d Her mouth twisted wryly as I nodded. \u201cSo did I, actually.

I don\u2019t . . .\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that somewhere deep inside, I knew enough to withhold my trust from him, to keep the most vulnerable part of me safe. But in truth, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She lifted one shoulder in a slight shrug. \u201cIt may simply be that he never knew me well enough to suspect it was there. Although in a way, I don\u2019t suppose he could have when there was so much we could never discuss.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time she\u2019d spoken of what had passed between her and Astegal. \u201cNo?\u201d I asked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cNo. The first night . . .\u201d Sidonie pulled away from me to sit upright, drawing her knees up and wrapping the sheet around them. \u201cOn the ship. I remember I asked him if he\u2019d ever been in love before. He laughed and told some tale of a married woman he\u2019d adored when he was little more than a youth. Then he told me that he wasn\u2019t going to ask the same question. That as far as he was concerned, whatever lay in my past, it was all washed clean away the moment he laid eyes on me. That we were born anew for one another, and only the future mattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery romantic,\u201d I observed.</p><p>She shot a glance at me to see if I was mocking, but I wasn\u2019t. \u201cI thought so at the time. But it was just a means to keep me from discussing the past, lest I realize how much my memory was lacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what did you talk about?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe future.\u201d She gave another wry smile. \u201cThe glorious, peaceful, and just alliance of nations we would build. He laid out a bold, sweeping vision of the reforms he imagined for Carthage\u2019s role in this empire, such as eliminating the slave-trade. Nothing that could be accomplished immediately, mind you, but things that would come in time if we were patient and diligent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe played to the best in you,\u201d I said softly.</p> <p>\u201cMayhap.\u201d Sidonie raked a hand through her disheveled hair. \u201cOr mayhap to a strain of that L\u2019Envers\u2019 ambition I didn\u2019t know I harbored. Noble aspirations are no excuse for conquest. I don\u2019t know. It shames me to remember it.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI believed him, though,\u201d she said. \u201cIn him, in his vision. And there\u2019s a part of me that wonders . . . in the beginning, when it was all new and fresh, it truly seemed Astegal believed it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did it change?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it started in Carthage.\u201d She hugged her knees. \u201cOn the ship, he\u2019d led me to believe I\u2019d be involved in matters of import once we were there. That I\u2019d have a voice, responsibilities as I\u2019d had in Terre d\u2019Ange. But once we arrived, he kept telling me that the Council wasn\u2019t ready, that it wasn\u2019t Carthage\u2019s way. That I had to be patient, and everything would change after Aragonia fell. So I was. Dumb, patient, and obedient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to hear Bodeshmun tell it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt got worse after Astegal left,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cThat was when I became restless and bored. But I didn\u2019t begin to doubt until you entered my life.\u201d She smiled wistfully. \u201cOr at least Leander Maignard did, reeking of pomade, beating me at chess and stirring strange thoughts and yearnings in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention gazing at you like a lovelorn pup,\u201d I added.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She glanced at me, tears in her eyes. \u201cThat too. And I\u2019m so grateful that you came for me, but . . . oh, gods! I wish none of it had ever happened. I wish I could forget it. And I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I slid behind Sidonie and embraced her, holding her while she wept, her body shaking with an anguish she\u2019d not let herself feel until now. My heart ached for her and I wished there were words I could say that would ease the pain, but there weren\u2019t. That was one truth I knew all too well. Hurting was part of the healing.</p><p>\u201cIt gets better, love,\u201d I said. \u201cThat, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She laughed through her tears, sniffling. \u201cGood. Because I hate this.\u201d</p><p>I smiled against her hair. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Afterward, Sidonie slept. I stayed awake for a time, watching her and thinking a thousand thoughts. But at length, I slept, too.</p><p>In the morning there was word.</p><p>The Euskerri wished to meet with us in the hall of the guest-house.</p><p>Sixty-Two</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice cracked with outrage when she heard the Euskerri\u2019s terms. A few of them flinched. There was no sign of last night\u2019s wounded young woman in her. This was Ysandre de la Courcel\u2019s heir in a rare fury. \u201cWhy in Blessed Elua\u2019s name would you insist on such a thing?\u201d</p><p>The Euskerri were demanding that she accompany them to Am\u00edlcar.</p><p>And that I join them in battle.</p><p>\u201cYou said you would ensure that the Aragonians keep their word,\u201d Janpier Iturralde reminded her. \u201cWe do not trust them. If we are victorious over Carthage, the agreement with Aragonia must be witnessed. As the arbiter of this accord, it is your duty.\u201d</p><p>She struggled for control. \u201cI pledged my word, not my person. I have a duty to my country. And Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s role in this will be meaningless if we\u2019re not able to free her from the spell that binds it.\u201d</p><p>Janpier translated her words. There was a rapid spate of argumentative Euskerri, resulting eventually in nods. \u201cTerre d\u2019Ange\u2019s role may be meaningless anyway,\u201d Janpier said calmly. \u201cWe do not believe that you have the authority to speak on behalf of Terre d\u2019Ange, not with your country divided against itself. It is Aragonia that concerns us. What passes for leadership in Aragonia has granted you authority on their behalf. Your presence is our surety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy presence,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cAs your hostage.\u201d</p><p>He colored slightly. \u201cI would not use that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d I said grimly.</p><p>There was another long exchange in Euskerri. \u201cIt is not so simple,\u201d Janpier said. \u201cAragonia seeks this bargain because they are desperate, but they have betrayed us in the past. We long for our freedom, but the price is very high.\u201d There was sympathy in his face. \u201cIt will take a very great gesture of good faith for us to accept this offer. That is what is required of you. Without it, we must decline.\u201d</p><p>I rose from the table. \u201cThen decline. We will be on our way and wish you well.\u201d A pair of brawny men moved to block the door to the hall. I stared at Janpier. \u201cYou would refuse to grant us passage to Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged in apology. \u201cWe do long for freedom.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie made a strangled sound. \u201cAh, gods! Do I understand this aright? If we agree to accompany you, the Euskerri will take arms against Carthage\u2019s army? And if we refuse, you will turn us away in spite? Despite the fact that it\u2019s in your own best interests to let us pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Janpier\u2019s face hardened. \u201cWho are you to tell us what is in our best interests? You led an army to our doorstep, highness. In the minds of my people, if you are not willing to do this thing, you have acted in bad faith and we would rather take our chances with Carthage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstegal will never grant you sovereignty,\u201d she said. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Janpier offered another stoic shrug. \u201cThen we will fight him here in the mountains. Nothing will have changed but the enemy\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze to the rafters. \u201cI begin to understand why Aragonia has been so reluctant to deal with the Euskerri.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe are a proud and stubborn folk. Those are our terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other passes through the mountains,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Janpier glanced at me. \u201cAll of which we hold, Prince Imriel.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie steepled her fingers and bowed her head. I saw her chest rise and fall as she took a deep breath and composed herself. When she spoke, her voice was quiet and even. \u201cEtxekojaun, I understand. Please understand that I, too, love my country. Imriel and I hold the key to her freedom. Grant us this compromise. I will accompany you willingly. But I pray you let Imriel continue onward to Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie . . .\u201d I murmured.</p><p>She shook her head at me. \u201cDon\u2019t argue.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. The point was moot. Janpier translated her words for the others. There was a long, heated argument. At the end of it, he turned back to us. \u201cNo,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI am sorry, highness. If the decision were mine, I might grant your request. But there is anger and fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnger and fear,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cAnger because twelve men have died already,\u201d Janpier said soberly. \u201cAnger at the thought that your kinsman, who is a valuable warrior, would refuse to share our risk while others died. Fear because your country is in the grip of strong magic. We do not doubt this, highness. We know such things in the mountains. I myself am afraid. I fear that if we allow your kinsman to pass, matters will worsen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d Sidonie closed her eyes briefly. \u201cWe hold the key to undoing the spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr unleashing war among your people,\u201d Janpier said. \u201cCan you swear it will not take that to accomplish your ends? Can you swear that it will not end with the army of Terre d\u2019Ange arrayed against us?\u201d</p><p>I felt sick.</p><p>Of course we couldn\u2019t swear to it. We knew far too little of what had passed in Terre d\u2019Ange since I left; and of what little we knew, none of it boded well. We had no idea if Barquiel L\u2019Envers had succeeded in finding the demon-stone, no idea what transpired save that madness yet reigned, and Ysandre had declared Alais, her own daughter, in rebellion against the Crown.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sidonie said quietly. \u201cI cannot.\u201d</p><p>Janpier nodded. \u201cThen we shall deal with what is known and nothing else. We have Aragonia\u2019s offer. You have our terms. In an hour, we will convene in the square. You will give us your decision and your word beneath the oak.\u201d</p><p>With that, we were dismissed.</p><p>In the small room we shared, I could feel the fury radiating from Sidonie like heat from an overstoked oven. Elua knows, I was angry, too, but I\u2019d had more experience with life\u2019s unfairness, and I hadn\u2019t been raised to carry the weight of the realm on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve left us no choice, have they?\u201d she said in a tight voice.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d I said. \u201cAssuming they\u2019re not actually planning to restrain us, we could go southeast and try the coastal towns north of Am\u00edl-car. We might be able to find a ship willing to carry us to Marsilikos in another month\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a month\u2019s time, Astegal\u2019s likely to have discovered what happened here. Do you imagine he won\u2019t have his navy patrolling the coast?\u201d Sidonie asked. \u201cLike as not he already does after our last attempt. He\u2019s not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the western coast?\u201d I asked, thinking. \u201cDoes he have ships there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as many.\u201d She scowled. \u201cBut the goddamned Euskerri control the northernmost ports on the western coast and those to the south have agreed to Astegal\u2019s terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happily,\u201d I observed.</p><p>Sidonie glanced sidelong at me. \u201cHe\u2019ll be looking for us. And you and I aren\u2019t exactly the most inconspicuous people in Aragonia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I frowned. \u201cSidonie, I\u2019m not afraid of battle. I don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019ll do it. If that were the only term, I\u2019d swallow my bile and accept it. Risking your life and the whole of Terre d\u2019Ange for no good reason is another matter. And the only way I\u2019m willing to accept their terms is if the Euskerri pledge to have a company standing at the ready to whisk you north and across the border at the first sign of defeat.\u201d</p><p>She searched my face. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s our best option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d I nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI want a courier. That\u2019s my demand. A courier sent north immediately bearing a letter for Alais and my damned uncle in Turnone. I don\u2019t care if the Euskerri are frightened. If we can do nothing else here, we can send the key home. After all, that\u2019s what truly matters, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd if the Euskerri don\u2019t agree . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . we take our chances elsewhere,\u201d Sidonie finished my thought. Her anger had drained away, leaving weariness in its wake. \u201cBlessed Elua grant they see reason. I have a feeling that\u2019s not the first time those words have been uttered.\u201d</p><p>A short time later we returned to the village square, escorted by Janpier Iturralde and the committee of Euskerri we\u2019d met with an hour ago. The square was thronged with people, even more crowded than it had been the other day. As we pushed our way through to mount the low dais beneath the oak tree, it gave me an uneasy memory of the night we\u2019d gathered in Elua\u2019s Square to witness a marvel promised by Carthaginian horologists.</p><p>Janpier raised his hands to quiet the crowd. \u201cHave you reached a decision?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie faced him. \u201cWe will agree to your terms if you will agree to ours. There is one condition without which I will refuse. There is one condition without which Prince Imriel will refuse.\u201d</p><p>He nodded impassively. \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie presented our terms. Janpier Iturralde translated them for the crowd, and the now-familiar roar of argument arose, delegates on the dais shouting back and forth with the villagers they represented. I studied Janpier\u2019s face. He met my gaze squarely, but his nostrils flared in a defensive manner.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not bluffing, my lord,\u201d I said to him. \u201cYou have forced our hands, but we will walk away from this agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cAnger and fear.\u201d I cut him off. \u201cYes. Believe me, I am passing familiar with the emotions this day. Whatever it is you fear from Terre d\u2019Ange, it will come more surely without the key than with it. It is a malevolent magic that binds our realm. Do not be a fool.\u201d</p><p>Janpier pointed at Sidonie. \u201cAnd her? Is her safety worth more than the safety of our wives and sisters and daughters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is to me,\u201d I said calmly.</p> <p>He bristled. \u201cYou would dare to claim\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I raised my voice. The blood beat in my ears, clashing like bronze wings. \u201cYes, Iturralde. As surely as you place Euskerria\u2019s concerns far, far above mine. And your wives and sisters and daughters will be far from the battlefield. I pledged my loyalty to Sidonie de la Courcel long ago. Even before I knew I loved her, I swore to lay my life down in her defense.\u201d My hand hovered over my sword-hilt. \u201cIf you want me to fight and mayhap die at your side, that is the price. Her safety. I will not be forsworn.\u201d</p><p>Janpier looked startled and impressed. \u201cI will tell them.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed a little. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Whether or not that made the difference, I couldn\u2019t say. All in all, we were asking little compared to the sacrifice the Euskerri asked of us. The price they would pay for their freedom was like to be high, yes. But in the end, it was their choice. Ours was forced upon us, and it made me ache inside to turn my back on Terre d\u2019Ange when we were so very close.</p><p>And after another hour of clamorous discussion, they agreed to accept our terms.</p> <p>There beneath the oak tree at the center of Roncal, we swore our oaths. Sidonie and I swore in the name of Blessed Elua and his Companions, I that I would fight at the side of the Euskerri, and she that she would bear witness to the signing of the agreement that granted Euskerria sovereign status in Aragonia\u2019s eyes in the event of our victory. The Euskerri called the sun to bear witness and pledged to fight Carthage unto the death.</p><p>The matter was settled.</p><p>Once again, we were at war with Carthage.</p><p>Sixty-Three</p><p>Once the matter was settled, things moved quickly.</p><p>The Euskerri who had descended on Roncal dispersed like the wind, carrying word to every town and village perched in the mountains. There would be a great force amassing, Janpier Iturralde assured us. Six or seven thousand, he thought, although the Euskerri had never mustered in force before.</p><p>Sidonie and I wrote a letter to Alais on a piece of much-scraped parchment Janpier procured for us.</p><p>I watched her outline the important details in her neat, precise hand. The truth of what had befallen us, the accord to which we had agreed. The key to undoing the spell: the word, emmenghanom. Beholden. And then I watched her falter.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you say, Imriel?\u201d Sidonie asked me in bewilderment. \u201cHow do you say it?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d written too many such letters.</p><p>\u201cTell her you love her,\u201d I said gently. \u201cTell them all. I will, too.\u201d</p><p>I liked the courier Janpier found for us: a bold-faced fellow named Nuno Agirre whose family originally hailed from the D\u2019Angeline side of Euskerri territory. His grandfather had been an ardent scholar and all his descendants spoke fluent Caerdicci along with their native tongue. He swore without hesitation beneath the oak tree that he would do his utmost to see the letter delivered.</p><p>\u201cIt will be an honor,\u201d he added. \u201cIs there any sign by which they will know it is genuine?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Sidonie, who looked dismayed. I thought about how I\u2019d sent my ring, the gold knotted ring, back to her from Skaldia. Alais wouldn\u2019t know the significance of the ring, but there was another item that would suit. I eased the gold torc from around my neck.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I handed it to Nuno Agirre. \u201cAlais will know this. Her father the Cruarch gave it to me with his own hands on my wedding day. I wear it in honor of the wife and child I lost.\u201d</p><p>Nuno stowed it in his packs along with the letter. \u201cVery well, your highness. May the sun shine brightly on your venture!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlessed Elua hold and keep you,\u201d Sidonie said in reply.</p><p>With that, Nuno mounted and departed, lifting one hand in farewell. He was riding one of the swift, tireless Amazigh horses; Janpier hadn\u2019t stinted. We watched his figure dwindle as he reached the far end of the valley and began to climb toward the longed-for and forbidden pass. Sidonie\u2019s lips moved in a silent prayer. I uttered one myself in my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll make it?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>I took her hand. \u201cOf course. He knows the territory, and he strikes me as a man with his wits about him. I reckon his odds are better than ours.\u201d</p><p>We sent another courier in the opposite direction during those days of preparation. Paskal had been a great help to us in Roncal. With Janpier\u2019s permission and all the enthusiasm of youth, he had managed to recruit a score of men to serve as Sidonie\u2019s personal guard. A few of them were no older than he was, inflamed by the romanticism of the notion, but I was pleased to find that most appeared to be solid fellows, family men to whom the idea of beating a safe retreat to the mountains appealed more than dashing into battle. And two of them spoke Aragonian, which was a blessing.</p><p>Once that was done, Paskal approached us with his idea. \u201cSend me ahead to scout,\u201d he suggested. \u201cGeneral Liberio sent men to the cities nearest Am\u00edlcar, to Badalon and Coloma and Tibado, begging them to rise up against Carthage. If any of them got through, I can tell them the Euskerri are coming. Perhaps it will convince them.\u201d</p><p>It was an excellent idea, albeit a dangerous one. And so Paskal was dispatched, brimming with enthusiasm. I watched him go, shaking my head and praying he\u2019d find his way safely.</p><p>Two days later we departed Roncal.</p><p>Sidonie and I bade farewell to Bixenta, who had taken such good care of us. She embraced us both and uttered a blessing in the Eus-kerri tongue. And then we saddled our mounts and rode south with the others.</p><p>There was no fanfare, no great proclamation. The Euskerri had gotten all of that out of the way during their debate. The decision to go to war had been made, so to war they went.</p><p>There was also precious little in the way of a plan. Euskerri from all over the mountains were to make their way to the foothills above Am\u00edl-car. Mayhap there would be six or seven thousand of them. Janpier was convinced of it. If it was true, we would have numbers to equal Astegal\u2019s, as there were a good four thousand Aragonian soldiers in Am\u00edlcar itself, and thousands more dispersed across the country, subject to the terms of Roderico\u2019s surrender.</p><p>But even so, we had no way of mounting a coordinated attack; and the Euskerri\u2019s idea of warfare was to swarm their enemy from a position of strength. We wouldn\u2019t have that on the plains surrounding Am\u00edlcar. What we would have was a ragtag army of thousands with no form of organized leadership. As more and more Euskerri trickled toward the south, it became increasingly obvious that we would be mismatched on open ground.</p><p>\u201cIf we simply fall on Astegal\u2019s forces from behind, I\u2019m afraid it will be a slaughter,\u201d I said to Sidonie as we rode. \u201cHe might have gotten lax about drilling in New Carthage, but they\u2019re disciplined enough to hold formation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She frowned in thought. \u201cI get the sense the Euskerri are simply hoping to lure them into the hills and ambush them. I\u2019m not sure Astegal\u2019s going to be so easily lured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny suggestions?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou know him better than anyone, and it seems you\u2019ve got as good a head for battle as anyone here.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie gave me a wry look. \u201cDo you imagine the Euskerri would actually listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled. \u201cBut they might listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think on it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Our journey back to Am\u00edlcar took a day longer than our flight from it. Euskerri from east of Roncal had already reached our destination and made camp in a deep basin of a valley some half a league from the city. I was glad to see that at least there were sentries posted atop every hill. Still, it made me feel anxious and exposed, being so close to Carthage\u2019s army and so unprepared to engage it.</p><p>Roncal\u2019s company made camp in the farthest northern end of the valley. I spoke to Gaskon, the Aragonian-speaking member of Sidonie\u2019s guard I reckoned the most sensible, and made it clear to him that if there was any sort of attack, they were to flee without hesitating. He understood and agreed.</p><p>And then we spent several agonizing days waiting.</p><p>It was a tense and strangely lonely time. Little by little, in dribs and drabs of a hundred men here, two hundred men there, Euskerri arrived. Janpier was right, their numbers did swell into the thousands. And none of them shared our language or our cause. They were here to fight Carthage, but they would just have gladly fought Aragonia if they\u2019d thought it would gain them sovereignty.</p><p>At least they treated Sidonie with deference and her guard was decent. On the very first day, Gaskon brought a crude oilcloth tent he\u2019d bartered for among some of the other soldiers. When Sidonie thanked him, he smiled quietly into his mustaches.</p><p>\u201cI have a daughter no older than you,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not want her sleeping exposed among so many men.\u201d</p><p>Then you shouldn\u2019t have dragged her here, I thought; but I bit my tongue on the comment.</p><p>On the third day we got a piece of good news. Paskal rejoined us, beaming from ear to ear. The word he carried spread quickly throughout the camp. He\u2019d encountered no luck at the first two cities\u2014they were fearful of Astegal\u2019s ire\u2014but the Duke Leopoldo of Tibado was a crusty firebrand seething under Carthage\u2019s yolk. He\u2019d pledged a thousand men to the cause. Several dozen Euskerri headmen commenced to argue about the best method to mount a joint attack.</p><p>\u201cHow swiftly can he marshal them?\u201d Sidonie asked Paskal.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cImmediately.\u201d</p><p>She turned to me. \u201cCan we have a look at the battlefield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Paskal knows a route to a safe vantage point,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do,\u201d Paskal said cheerfully.</p><p>We left the Euskerri to argue and rode out of the camp, crossing several valleys and heading up a wooded slope. On Paskal\u2019s orders, we left the horses and climbed the remaining yards on foot. At the top of the slope, the woods ended. We lay on our bellies and peered downward. We were northwest of the city, but we could see Am\u00edlcar spread below us and Astegal\u2019s army much as we\u2019d left it, except the trenches had grown deeper and the earthen bulwarks were higher.</p><p>\u201cWhere does Tibado lie?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>Paskal pointed south. \u201cA day\u2019s ride. If there\u2019s to be an attack, the Duke would ford the river to the west and position his troops between the rivers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish there was some way of alerting Am\u00edlcar,\u201d she said absently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of trying to slip through Astegal\u2019s camp,\u201d I warned her.</p><p>\u201cLike Ph\u00e8dre did at Troyes-le-Mont?\u201d She gave me a quick smile. \u201cElua, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they\u2019ll be on the lookout,\u201d I said. \u201cThey know there\u2019s a chance that aid is coming. But there\u2019s no way for them to mount a full-scale counterattack if we can\u2019t draw off some of Carthage\u2019s forces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s three hundred Amazigh horse and all those robes and veils,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cThree hundred men could cross the bridge and ride right up to the camp in guise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s good for one strike, love. Then they\u2019d have to flee or die. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me. \u201cWhat if they stopped short?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstegal\u2019s clever,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s vain. He likes knowing things and he likes being in control of things. You told me to think about what might lure him out of his camp, Imriel. What if his three hundred loyal Amazigh rode up to the verge of the river and stopped short there? Simply waited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would gall him,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt would drive him mad. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d do anything foolish, not right away. He\u2019d send a small delegation. But if you killed them and fell back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d send a larger delegation,\u201d I finished. \u201cAnd if we continued to fall back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could lead them into ambush,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd then the Duke\u2019s men could fall on the others from behind!\u201d Paskal\u2019s eyes gleamed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be horribly outnumbered,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cWell, what if we divided our forces?\u201d Sidonie suggested logically. \u201cWe could send the bulk of the Euskerri to join the Duke of Tibado and keep a thousand in reserve for the ambush. I can\u2019t imagine more than that could maneuver efficiently in those woods anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if the ambush succeeded, we could capture the bridge and mount a rearguard attack on Astegal,\u201d I said. \u201cMayhap hold the ground long enough for Liberio\u2019s forces to get free of the city.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cIf Tibado and the Euskerri stage a slow retreat of their own, it might create more of an opportunity to . . . Imriel, why are you staring at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwe,\u201d I said. \u201cAwe and adoration. I\u2019d no idea you\u2019d prove quite such a brilliant strategist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank my mother and Leander Maignard.\u201d She gazed down at the city. \u201cTo be honest, I doubt such a risky notion would ever have occurred to me if your Leander hadn\u2019t forced me to play a better game of chess.\u201d Sidonie shivered. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a good deal more terrifying when the players are real. Do you suppose it might work?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve not heard a better idea.\u201d</p><p>We retreated carefully back down the slope, retrieved our mounts, and returned to the campsite. The argument was still in full sway, joined now by hundreds. If the din was any louder, they would have heard it in Am\u00edlcar. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I said to Paskal. \u201cI\u2019m going to propose our plan. You\u2019re going to translate. And so far as you know, this is entirely my idea. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Sidonie. \u201cI believe I do.\u201d</p><p>I kneed my horse forward and rode close to the loudest knot of arguers, then took a deep breath. I thought about Gallus Tadius who had commanded the Red Scourge in Lucca through sheer force of will. \u201cRight!\u201d I shouted over the uproar. It dimmed slightly, heads turning in my direction. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, lads. You\u2019re a disorganized, contentious, piss-poor excuse for an army. These aren\u2019t your precious mountain passes. If we don\u2019t have a decent strategy, we\u2019re all dead. Lucky for you, I have an idea.\u201d</p> <p>Paskal translated.</p><p>I talked.</p><p>They listened. And somewhat to my shock, the Euskerri came to agree with me without a great deal of argument. There was a certain sense of relief once it came to it, as though they\u2019d been waiting for someone to assume command here. We settled in quickly and began sketching maps in the dirt and working out the details.</p><p>By the end of the day we had a plan.</p><p>Sixty-Four</p><p>Two days later our plan was ready to be implemented.</p> <p>Elua knows, it wasn\u2019t perfect. It was messy and dangerous and difficult to coordinate. But it was ready.</p><p>The bulk of the Euskerri army had withdrawn to the west, taking one of Paskal\u2019s careful routes through the hills to a point where they could ford the Barca River unseen and establish a new camp within a reasonable striking range of Astegal\u2019s forces. Paskal was to continue onward to alert the Duke of Tibado, whose men would join them there. And there, they would post sentries and await our move.</p><p>I was to be among the disguised Amazigh. After some discussion, we had decided it would be best if the majority of the apparent Amazigh were on foot. It would give Astegal greater incentive to give chase and the horses would be more effectual on the primary battlefield. Only thirty of us would be mounted, that we might move swiftly to secure the bridge if we were successful.</p><p>Come dawn, we would find out.</p><p>The Euskerri gave Sidonie and me a wide berth that night before the attack was to be launched, for which we were both grateful. I\u2019d spent the better part of the day teaching three hundred men how to secure their Amazigh head-wraps and face-scarves. The balance of the day, I\u2019d spent tending my mount and checking my gear. Dusk fell all too quickly.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Sidonie lay in my arms inside our rough tent. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t do anything foolish and heroic. That you won\u2019t take any unnecessary risks.\u201d</p><p>I stroked her hair. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to gaze at me. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. I feel like there are so many things I should say, but I don\u2019t know what they are except that I love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s all I ever needed. Sidonie, if this goes awry, promise me you won\u2019t hesitate. Don\u2019t think about me. Don\u2019t wait in the hopes of finding out what happened. Just flee with Gaskon and his lads, as hard and fast as you can. Don\u2019t pause until you reach Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d I traced the line of her brows, so similar to my own. \u201cPlease? It\u2019s the only way my mind will be at peace.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated only a heartbeat. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>I kissed her. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should sleep.\u201d Sidonie touched my lips. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to make love to you until the sun rises, I\u2019d sooner have you go into battle well rested.\u201d</p><p>I caught her hand and kissed her fingertips. \u201cBlessed Elua grant us a thousand more nights, Sun Princess, that I might make this one lost night up to you a thousandfold.\u201d</p><p>Her black eyes glittered with tears. \u201cOnly a thousand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen thousand,\u201d I vowed. \u201cA hundred thousand.\u201d</p><p>She laid her head on my shoulder. \u201cI pray he does.\u201d</p><p>We lay like that for a long time, neither of us moving. I held Sidonie in my arms, listening to her breathe, feeling the heart beating steadily in my breast. And I prayed that Blessed Elua would prove merciful on the morrow. I prayed that our plan wouldn\u2019t fall to pieces; I prayed that Astegal would take our bait. I prayed that this ragtag band of Euskerri wouldn\u2019t be slaughtered, that Am\u00edlcar\u2019s forces would recognize us as allies and rally in time. I prayed that Sidonie would be safe.</p><p>And at the end, I allowed myself one selfish prayer that I would survive the coming battle. That I would live to see Terre d\u2019Ange free of ensorcelment, to see my loved ones once more. To see the wondrous light of love in Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s eyes, the pride in Joscelin\u2019s face.</p><p>All of them.</p><p>And to wed the woman I loved and spend a lifetime of peace with her.</p><p>Blessed Elua grant us mercy.</p><p>I slept.</p><p>The day dawned grey and drizzling. The foot-soldiers committed to ambush were the first to depart, slipping over the hills and into the pine forests that lined the road to Am\u00edlcar. Two of Sidonie\u2019s guards went to take up vantage points and serve as sentries observing the course of the battle. Three hundred Euskerri fussed and fidgeted with their Amazigh robes and scarves, making ready to stage our appearance. I checked my gear and my mount\u2019s hooves one last time.</p><p>All was in readiness.</p><p>It was time to go.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me,\u201d Sidonie said quietly. Fine raindrops glinted in her hair. \u201cMay Blessed Elua and his Companions watch over you all and grant us victory.\u201d</p><p>I kissed her, then fastened my scarf in place. \u201cBe safe, love.\u201d</p><p>That was all. I mounted my horse\u2014one of the Amazigh horses, a spirited bay with a strongly arched neck and a willing gait. I glanced around at my three hundred veiled and robed companions. Fearless Euskerri eyes gazed back at me in the slits between their indigo scarves. I adjusted my flowing sleeves to hide the gleam of my vambraces beneath them.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said.</p><p>Janpier Iturralde echoed the command in Euskerri.</p><p>Atop the crest of the first hill, I turned and looked back. Sidonie was standing, watching us, a small figure in the far end valley, determinedly regal and upright. Her guard surrounded her. Their mounts were saddled in the picket-line, ready to flee on a moment\u2019s notice. Good. I raised one hand in farewell, then rode out of sight.</p><p>We crossed the green hills, then plunged into the woods. I could hear men muttering and swearing as pine branches plucked at their robes. I told Janpier to bid them be silent, and he did. After that there was only the soft tramp of hooves and feet on the pine mast. I could smell the rich loam beneath. The earth was growing warmer. Spring was coming.</p><p>I prayed I\u2019d live to see it.</p><p>The journey that had seemed endless by night went quickly by daylight. We made our way down the forested hills north of Am\u00edlcar and emerged from the woods to find the road empty. Beyond it stretched the sea, grey and wrinkled beneath the cloudy skies.</p><p>South lay Am\u00edlcar.</p><p>We went south. Thirty horsemen in the front, riding five abreast. I was in the center of the front rank. I\u2019d assumed a position of command. It was expected; the plan we were executing was mine. The others followed on foot. We passed the pine-covered slopes where our comrades were hidden. I looked for them, but there was no sign.</p><p>And then there before us was the Barca River, cutting a wide, winding course through the plains. There was the bridge across which I\u2019d fled with Sidonie and Paskal and Captain Aureliano and his men, our valiant decoys. I wondered if they\u2019d survived. I prayed they had.</p><p>And beyond it . . . Am\u00edlcar and Astegal\u2019s army.</p><p>There were sentries posted at the near end of the bridge. They hailed us with shouts as we came into view. We made no reply, but advanced steadily. Some fifty yards shy of the bridge, I drew rein. Our company halted.</p><p>There we made a stand and waited. The skies spat a fitful rain at us and gusts of wind tugged at our damp indigo robes. The Carthaginian sentries at the bridge conferred in consternation. One left his post and headed for the main encampment. Another came forward at a jog, approaching us. I lifted my hand, bidding my company to wait.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d Janpier Iturralde muttered urgently beside me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d I drew my sword and heeled my horse. He sprang forward eagerly, hooves clattering on the road. The Carthaginian sentry slowed, uncertain. Beneath the brim of his helmet, his face was young and perplexed. It was uplifted toward mine, a span of bare skin showing under his chinstrap.</p><p>I didn\u2019t slow.</p><p>I leaned in the saddle and beheaded him at a single stroke. Desert justice, the Amazigh had called it. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw his head bounce. His headless body slumped. I wheeled my horse and returned to the line.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said briefly.</p><p>Janpier translated.</p><p>We waited, as still as statues. We watched the news ripple through Astegal\u2019s encampment. Horns blared a summons. A pool of blood ebbed from the headless trunk of the dead sentry\u2019s neck. Astegal took to the battlefield himself: Astegal of Carthage, Prince of the House of Sarkal. Riding a black charger, his gilded armor the brightest thing under the grey skies. He rode back and forth along the river, gauging us. I knew him by his splendid arms, by the crimson strip of his beard. All too well, I remembered the satisfaction in his heavy-lidded eyes. I stared at him between the folds of my Amazigh scarf.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d I whispered. \u201cLet me make your wife a widow today, Astegal.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Sidonie was right; Astegal was no fool. I wished he was. I longed to cross blades with him. Longed to erase her shame. But no, he wasn\u2019t going to commit himself. Still, I could tell by his restless movements that curiosity was eating at him.</p><p>We waited for at least an hour before he made his first move. The Euskerri might be a contentious folk, but they were capable of great patience, too. No one threatened to break our ranks. No one spoke. At last Astegal sent a small company of archers across the bridge to test our resolve.</p><p>We retreated out of bowshot. For every pace the archers advanced, we retreated, until I could see their uncertainty and reluctance. I had to smile behind my veil. They were increasingly isolated from their comrades. They might get off a flight or two, but we could take them.</p><p>It took another hour for Astegal to lose patience with that particular game of cat and mouse and call his archers back. I promptly ordered the Euskerri to advance and we returned to our initial position.</p><p>In the end, I don\u2019t think the gambit would have worked if it hadn\u2019t been for the Amazigh guises. Astegal had sent his loyal Amazigh on a mission of crucial import to his plans. He had to know they\u2019d failed. He had to know this was a trap. But our silent, veiled presence maddened him. I watched him stare across the river. I watched his gestures grow more and more curt.</p><p>I watched him come to a decision.</p><p>Astegal wasn\u2019t taking any chances. When he committed forces against us, he did so in a large way. At a guess, I\u2019d reckon he mustered a good two thousand of his troops. And I had to own, the sight of the endless line of them snaking over the bridge and advancing toward us made my blood run cold.</p><p>\u201cRetreat,\u201d I said. \u201cSlowly.\u201d</p><p>Step by step, we did. The Carthaginians broke into a jog and began closing the distance between us, their armor rattling. I could feel the Euskerri\u2019s resolve beginning to weaken. Beneath my Amazigh robes, cold sweat trickled. My mount grew restive, sensing my fear. I waited until I could see the dense pine forests to the west out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d I shouted. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>The Euskerri didn\u2019t wait for a translation, breaking into a dead run. I could hear the roar behind me as I eased my horse into a swift trot. Carthage was in full pursuit.</p><p>A poorly thrown javelin soared over my right shoulder and clattered harmlessly on the paving stones in front of me. The skin between my shoulder blades itched. I was wearing my hauberk beneath my robes, but I wasn\u2019t sure it would turn away a well-thrown weapon. I fought the urge to heel my spirited mount to a gallop and flee.</p><p>Two thousand. I hadn\u2019t thought Astegal would send so many against so few.</p><p>Still, the Carthaginian line was strung out the length of the road. When the Euskerri troops hiding in the forest burst forth with their fierce, ululating cries, I thought I\u2019d never heard a sweeter sound.</p><p>This was the Euskerri\u2019s preferred method of battle. Hundreds of Carthaginian soldiers were slain during that first onslaught, brought down by javelins and stones. But there were hundreds more yet coming.</p><p>There was no question of risk or heroism. It was an ugly, bloody melee. I fought from the saddle, chopping and hacking on both sides, simply doing my best to stay alive. Men cried aloud, fell, and died. Our men. Their men. The roads grew slick with blood and gore, cluttered with bodies. Somewhere in the distance, horns were blaring an insistent alarm and that sound too should have been sweet to my ears, for it meant the rearguard attack had begun. But at the moment, I was too busy trying to survive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If it hadn\u2019t been for the horns, I\u2019m not sure we would have won our skirmish. Astegal\u2019s soldiers fought hard and they were more skilled than the Euskerri when it came to hand-to-hand fighting\u2014more skilled and better armed. But when the horns grew ever more strident, several hundred of those closest to the city peeled away in answer to the summons, mayhap suspecting that this attack was a mere decoy.</p><p>The rest we killed.</p><p>Gods, it was a grim sight. I\u2019d seen battle, but never carnage on this scale. Over a thousand Carthaginian dead and hundreds and hundreds of Euskerri dead or grievously wounded. I reckoned there were no more than four hundred yet fit for battle.</p> <p>And this was only the beginning.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said wearily. \u201cJanpier?\u201d</p><p>Janpier Iturralde was dead. The surviving Euskerri argued among themselves and finally produced a boy younger than Paskal who spoke Aragonian. He looked to be in a state of shock, his eyes stretched wide enough to show the whites, but he translated obediently for me.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, lads,\u201d I said in tones far more gentle than aught Gallus Tadius had ever used. \u201cWe need to take the bridge and the ground outside Am\u00edlcar\u2019s gates between the trenches. We have to give Aragonia a chance to mount a full attack on the rear of Astegal\u2019s forces, or there\u2019s going to be a slaughter. So gather your courage and strip the dead of any arms or armor you can use.\u201d</p><p>It was an ugly business. I dismounted and shed my damp Amazigh robes. I used the head-scarf to bind a deep gash in my left thigh. Working quickly, I scavenged a helmet, a pair of greaves, a shield, and a spear. The Euskerri followed suit and outfitted themselves with the spoils of the dead. We were a desperate, ragtag bunch, but at least we could no longer be mistaken for Amazigh.</p> <p>I mounted. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We went. All four hundred of us.</p><p>Short of the river, we paused. Astegal wasn\u2019t a fool. There was a battle raging in the distance that dwarfed our skirmish, and Astegal himself must have joined it, for he was nowhere in sight. But he had left a company of archers to defend the bridge; and beyond them was another company holding the ground between the trenches: his Nubian mercenaries with their long spears and zebra-skin shields, a thousand strong. Their dark faces were set and grim. I thought of Sunjata with an unexpected pang. Atop the walls of the city, I could see Aragonian sentries watching and waiting for an opening. I prayed they\u2019d be swift to seize it when we gave it to them.</p><p>Someone asked a question in Euskerri.</p><p>The boy translated. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>In the distance, I could hear the hue and clamor of war. I gazed at the blank stone walls surrounding Am\u00edlcar, the waiting archers, the waiting soldiers. I thought about Sidonie in the valley. Safe. She would be safe. She\u2019d wanted me to promise I wouldn\u2019t take unnecessary risks. This wasn\u2019t. Without Aragonia\u2019s full aid, the Euskerri and the troops from Tibado would be slaughtered, and Astegal\u2019s hold on the nation more certain than ever.</p> <p>I had to do this.</p><p>I had to try.</p><p>\u201cWe charge the bridge. And then we fight and live or die.\u201d I settled my spear like a lance. \u201cRiders to the fore. Infantry follow.\u201d</p><p>We charged.</p><p>Astegal\u2019s archers knelt and shot. I caught the first arrow on my shield. The second took my horse. I was pitched over his head as he went down hard, poor valiant beast. I lost my shield and my spear. I rolled and came up fighting, ripping the sword from my sheath. The Euskerri surged after and around me.</p><p>We took the bridge and plunged into enemy territory.</p><p>In a poet\u2019s tale, every thrust and blow, every individual act of heroism would be catalogued and recorded for posterity. This was no poet\u2019s tale. It was war. Just war. I fought well because it was what I\u2019d been taught to do. It didn\u2019t matter that it wasn\u2019t a style suited for the battlefield. Not in the midst of this chaos. I told the hours over and over\u2014beyond fear, beyond weariness, beyond thought. I defended the sphere of my own person and the bodies mounted around me.</p><p>Our Aragonian allies answered my prayers. They rushed from the sally ports to join the fray, scrambling to clear the first trench. Gears ground. The portcullis lifted to admit the bulk of Aragonia\u2019s army onto the battlefield.</p> <p>What an ungodly mess it was.</p><p>It stank. It stank of death and desperation. Gore churned into mire, bowels spilled in death. We heaved bodies into the trenches, forging a gruesome causeway. Sharp hooves carved dead flesh. Onward, onward. Feet trampling the dead. Horns blowing. Men scrambled in and out of trenches. Aragonia\u2019s army seized control of the ground between them. They hewed at the earthen bulwarks with battleaxes to forge passages. They raced over open ground, falling on Carthage\u2019s army from the rear.</p><p>And in the end, we won.</p><p>I never saw the main part of the fray. When the last of the Aragonian army had passed, the surviving Euskerri asked me if we should follow them. We\u2019d lost half our remaining number before the Aragonians had emerged and there wasn\u2019t a survivor among them that wasn\u2019t trembling with exhaustion. In the aftermath of battle, I could feel a profound weariness settling into my bones.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>When we heard the horns blowing a retreat, I wasn\u2019t sure who it was signaling. It wasn\u2019t until a lone Aragonian rider came racing back bearing the news that we knew. Astegal had been captured alive, brought down by a Euskerri javelin that had struck his helm hard enough to knock him insensible. Additional troops from nearby Coloma had arrived, defying their leaders to join the rebellion.</p><p>Pinned between two forces, leaderless, the Carthaginian army had mounted a concerted attack and broken through the western line. Even now, they were fleeing, likely to retreat to New Carthage and make a stand there.</p><p>There was cheering from atop the walls of the city and, impossible as it seemed, from the devastated Euskerri. But I was surrounded by dead men, many of whom I\u2019d led into this battle. I was weary and soul-sick, and I couldn\u2019t feel aught but a grim relief.</p><p>\u201cIs General Liberio pursuing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The courier\u2019s battle-grin faded. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to. We took too many losses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Euskerri?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey were hit hard.\u201d</p><p>The news had spread through the city. It wasn\u2019t long before every manner of chirurgeon, physician, and healer in Am\u00edlcar came pouring out to tend to the injured. I reckoned my leg could wait and helped as best I could, setting aside my weariness to serve as a bearer for litters ferrying the maimed and wounded to the makeshift infirmary in the park. They\u2019d prepared well; there were hundreds of new tents erected. They would be needed.</p><p>The surviving remnant of the army came trickling back, many carrying injured comrades. I missed seeing Astegal escorted into the city with his arms bound behind his back, which I regretted. I kept an eye out for Sidonie and her guard. Their sentries must have reported the news, but I knew she\u2019d be worried for me.</p><p>It was nearing sunset when they came. I was sitting with Miquel, the young Euskerri who spoke Aragonian, giving him sips of water from a skin and waiting for a litter. He had a broken spear-head lodged in his ribcage.</p><p>I rose when I saw them.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Miquel said in a hoarse voice. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t, though. All I could do was stand and watch as they rode toward us. No one had even begun to tend to the dead; the task was too enormous. I watched the blood drain from Sidonie\u2019s face as she took in the extent of the horror. Her gaze met mine. Not even the relief of finding me alive could alleviate it.</p><p>\u201cGods have mercy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis is victory?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t find my voice to answer and I didn\u2019t try to stop her when she dismounted, when she reached up to touch my cheek. I needed her too badly. I needed the one bright and shining thing in my life to believe any of this was worthwhile. I wrapped my arms around her and held her close, pressing my face against her hair.</p><p>\u201cCousin,\u201d a tired voice said. \u201cYou bring us cause to rejoice today.\u201d</p><p>I looked up to see Serafin L\u2019Envers y Aragon seated on a fine chestnut horse. Aragonian soldiers were bringing the last of the wounded to the city. It was to his credit that he\u2019d not left the battlefield until it was done. I could tell he\u2019d fought hard; his gilded armor was splashed with blood.</p><p>Still.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ambitious man, my lord,\u201d I said, releasing Sidonie. \u201cSo is Astegal of Carthage. Behold the cost of his ambition. Look on it well. And if you find that greater Aragonia is not so willing as you had believed to anoint you the king\u2019s successor, or if you find yourself thinking to break faith with the Euskerri, I bid you remember this sight.\u201d</p><p>Serafin nodded curtly. \u201cI take your meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pray we all do,\u201d Sidonie murmured.</p><p>Sixty-Five</p><p>Once more we were ensconced in the palace of Am\u00edlcar.</p><p>In the great hall, Lady Nicola wept at the sight of us. \u201cBlessed Elua! Why in the name of all that\u2019s holy did the Euskerri insist on sending you back here?\u201d</p><p>I shifted, leaning on Sidonie\u2019s shoulder. My leg had begun to stiffen and it hurt badly. \u201cBecause they are a proud and stubborn folk who don\u2019t trust Aragonia. Also a very brave folk. My lady, when your chirurgeon has seen to those in urgent need, I\u2019d be grateful for her attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Nicola said. \u201cI\u2019ll send her immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Nicola.\u201d Sidonie hesitated. \u201cWhat\u2019s to become of Astegal?\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s face turned grim. \u201cHe\u2019ll be executed at dawn in the Plaza del Rey on the day after tomorrow. Surely you don\u2019t plead for clemency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sidonie said shortly.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to kill him with her own hand,\u201d I said.</p><p>Nicola looked startled, but only for a moment. \u201cI can understand. But he\u2019s responsible for the deaths of thousands of Aragonians. I suspect the council will wish for justice to be administered in the Aragonian fashion.\u201d</p><p>I felt Sidonie\u2019s shoulders tighten beneath my arm. \u201cThen I\u2019ll settle for watching him die,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can understand that, too,\u201d Nicola murmured.</p><p>We were given the same room in which we\u2019d been housed before; indeed, the clothes-press still held clean attire that Lady Nicola had provided for us, which was a mercy. Servants came to fill the bath, which was also a mercy.</p><p>\u201cElua!\u201d Sidonie breathed when she unwound the Amazigh scarf and peeled away my blood-soaked breeches. I glanced down. It looked worse than I\u2019d thought, muscle welling in the deep gash. She sank to her knees and covered her face. \u201cNo more, please. I can\u2019t bear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove.\u201d I grasped her shoulders and raised her. \u201cIt\u2019s over. After today I never want to draw a sword again, I promise you. Whatever\u2019s happening in Terre d\u2019Ange, we\u2019ll see it settled peaceably.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie nodded. \u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>It was awkward bathing, but I managed; and shortly afterward, the Eisandine chirurgeon Rachel came to tend me. She offered no comment, washing the gash with unwatered wine and sewing it in neat stitches. It hurt like fury. She spread salve over her work and bound it with clean bandages.</p><p>\u201cYou should take rest,\u201d Rachel said when she\u2019d finished. \u201cStay off it for a week. But you won\u2019t, will you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWe have to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmenghanom.\u201d Rachel said the word softly and smiled at our surprise. \u201cI was one of the people Lady Nicola entrusted with it lest aught go awry. When nations fall, healers are among the first to be spared. Our services are always needed. And I am D\u2019Angeline. My loyalties will always lie with Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElua willing, the key has already been delivered,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cBut we need to be sure. We\u2019ll stay to ensure that the accord with the Euskerri is fairly concluded. I gave my word. And then we must go.\u201d</p><p>Rachel bowed her head. \u201cAs you must.\u201d</p><p>She left us then. I lay on the bed, my head in Sidonie\u2019s lap. She ran her fingers through my hair, rhythmic and calming. My leg throbbed. Every part of my body was bruised and aching. Behind my closed eyelids, I saw only carnage. Myself in the midst of a raging storm of violence, my sword rising and falling. Men dying. I\u2019d no idea how many I\u2019d killed that day. But I\u2019d a good idea of how many I\u2019d led to their deaths.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to speak of it?\u201d Sidonie asked in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I concentrated on the soothing feeling of her hands stroking my hair. \u201cOne day. But not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d I agreed, my eyes still closed. \u201cOne day we\u2019ll tell our horde of brooding boys and haughty girls how their parents fought for freedom against a man who would be a tyrant. One day we\u2019ll discuss the terrible price the Euskerri were willing to pay for their own freedom. One day it will make a wondrous tale, Princess.\u201d I opened my eyes and gazed at her inverted face. \u201cBut not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie leaned down to kiss me. Her lips lingered on mine, soft and sweet, a promise of Blessed Elua\u2019s mercy. \u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and slept.</p><p>On the morrow we learned further details. The losses were staggering, especially among the Euskerri. Of the nearly six thousand who had gone into battle, no more than fifteen hundred survived. The troops from Tibado and Coloma had taken heavy losses, too. Until the forces from Am\u00edlcar had arrived, it had been very nearly what I feared\u2014a slaughter. But in the end Carthage hadn\u2019t fared much better. They hadn\u2019t been prepared for the speed and ferocity of the attack on their rearguard. Astegal\u2019s troops had been slow to respond to orders. Duke Leopoldo of Tibado had taken advantage of the confusion and rallied his men, and the Euskerri had done the same. Carthage found itself caught between the hammer and the anvil. When Astegal had fallen, their resolve broke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought about Astegal in New Carthage, playing at being a king. Feasting and tossing coins to dancing-girls in the evenings, sparring and jesting with his men in the palaestra during the days. I remembered what Kratos had said. If Astegal had been more diligent in drilling his army, he might have been victorious yesterday.</p><p>The war wasn\u2019t over. Astegal\u2019s wounded army would retreat to New Carthage, where they held the city and a good number of potential hostages. We\u2019d arisen to find that the navy blockading Am\u00edlcar\u2019s harbor had fled, likely for the same destination.</p><p>But Bodeshmun was dead and Astegal soon would be. It was the arcane skills of the former and the determined ambition of the latter that had driven Carthage to seek empire. There had been men uneasy with the scope of Astegal\u2019s goals. After my time there as Leander Maignard, I thought there was a chance the matter could be resolved diplomatically.</p> <p>I prayed so.</p><p>There was a ceremony that afternoon to mark the historic transfer of sovereignty to Euskerria. It broke my heart to see how few of the village headmen who had pledged their acceptance in Roncal were there to see it.</p><p>Serafin spoke well. \u201cThere has long been enmity between our people,\u201d he said. \u201cYesterday that history was erased in a tide of blood. If we take no other lesson from this tragedy, let it be this: We have learned we are alike. We suffer and bleed alike. We grieve alike for our lost brethren. And we value our freedom above our safety.\u201d He paused. \u201cEuskerria has earned the freedom we bestow on her this day. As you well know, it is not wholly mine to give on behalf of Aragonia. But I pledge to you on behalf of all here assembled that we will accept no terms that do not honor this agreement. And that which Euskerria has earned that is mine to grant, I pledge freely. My friendship, honor, and respect.\u201d</p><p>There were tears in the eyes of many of the Euskerri present when his words were translated. One of them rose to speak.</p><p>\u201cYesterday we gained a nation and lost the flower of a generation,\u201d he said simply in accented Aragonian. \u201cWe will strive to make Euskerria into a nation worthy of their sacrifice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour highness?\u201d Ramiro Zorn\u00edn de Aragon said to Sidonie.</p><p>She rose. \u201cOn behalf of Terre d\u2019Ange, this concord is heard and witnessed. Like my kinsman, I lack the full weight of authority to speak for my country. But as I am my mother\u2019s heir, I swear in the name of Blessed Elua and his Companions that while my memory lives, I will do all in my power to see that this accord is kept in good faith.\u201d</p><p>So it was done.</p><p>There was no rejoicing among the Euskerri; the cost had been too high. And Am\u00edlcar was a city torn between victory and loss, aware of the struggle that lay ahead. But it was done.</p><p>Afterward I yielded to wisdom and retired to my bed to ease my leg. The wound appeared clean enough, but it felt as though someone were holding a hot poker to my thigh. And I reckoned if there were any folk who could be trusted to make travel arrangements with swift efficiency, it was Sidonie and Lady Nicola. I slept fitfully and woke to find Sidonie perched on the side of the bed and gazing at me.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>She smiled for the first time in days. \u201cI found Captain Deimos. With Lady Nicola\u2019s aid, he\u2019s procured a new ship and reassembled his crew, and he\u2019s willing to carry us to Marsilikos.\u201d</p><p>I pushed myself upright. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cHe\u2019s impatient to be free of Am\u00edlcar and he thinks the seas will be calm enough. He also thinks your mother will have his head if he doesn\u2019t see you home safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news,\u201d I said. \u201cDid you find Kratos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Her smile deepened. \u201cHe was very excited. He embraced me and turned fifty shades of red while apologizing for the importunity. His burns are well on their way to healing. He wishes to travel to Terre d\u2019Ange with us and plans to meet us tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Deimos make ready to sail on the morrow?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks so,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least by noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Astegal\u2019s execution,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Sidonie took my hand. \u201cI spent an hour in the infirmary visiting the wounded. It\u2019s . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s awful, Imriel. I\u2019m willing to cede my own need for vengeance. But I need to see him die. For everything he did.\u201d She was quiet a moment. \u201cI talked to several of Duke Leopoldo\u2019s men in the infirmary. Paskal fought alongside them after he brought word of our plan. One of them remembered seeing him slain on the battlefield. And I asked after Captain Aureliano and his men, the ones who helped us escape. They never returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Elua!\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sidonie sighed with sorrow and regret. \u201cDo you know, I begin to understand my mother better. I pray to Blessed Elua that the likes of this never comes again in our lifetimes. But if one of our haughty girls declared herself in love with Astegal\u2019s son, I suspect my reaction would be less than rational.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed her hand. \u201cYour father tried to tell me as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wise man,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>My throat tightened. \u201cAre you sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you?\u201d Sidonie gave me a quick look. \u201cNo! Gods, no. About a thousand other things, yes. I wish I\u2019d had the courage to trust in Blessed Elua\u2019s precept years ago and defy my mother. I wish I\u2019d argued more forcefully against letting Bodeshmun show us his damned marvel. I wish I didn\u2019t have the weight of thousands of dead Euskerri on my conscience.\u201d She freed her hand and laid it on my breast. \u201cBut I will never, ever regret loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor I,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAlways and always,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cI understand more, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll knowledge is worth having,\u201d I observed. \u201cSo on the morrow we watch Astegal die, then sail for home?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>Sixty-Six</p><p>We greeted the dawn in the Plaza del Rey.</p><p>There was a massive crowd in the main square at the center of Am\u00edlcar. Everyone in the city\u2014everyone within ten leagues of the city\u2014wanted to see Astegal of Carthage executed.</p><p>A certain macabre enthusiasm pervaded the square. I understood it, although I didn\u2019t share it. Not quite. It wasn\u2019t just that I\u2019d had my surfeit of death. I did want to see Astegal die. He\u2019d earned his death a thousand times over. But I would take no joy in it. As with Am\u00edlcar\u2019s hard-won victory, there would be only a grim satisfaction.</p><p>It would be done.</p><p>Finished.</p><p>The skies were still leaden when we assembled. Sidonie and I would be very close to the executioner\u2019s block, standing with Lady Nicola and her husband and son, with the council members and Duke Leopoldo of Tibado, his weathered face seamed by a sword-cut. There were a good many of the walking wounded in that crowd. I myself leaned on a gilt-headed walking stick that the chirurgeon Rachel had procured for me, and I was grateful for its aid.</p><p>Dawn broke in the east, streaking the skies with fire. Along the route from the palace\u2019s dungeon, drums began to beat. The crowd chanted.</p><p>\u201cAs-te-gal! As-te-gal!\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Sidonie; her chin lifted, her profile achingly pure. \u201cAre you all right, love?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, wordless and pale.</p><p>The executioner waited, his heavy broadsword angled over his shoulder. His face was impassive. The wooden block, with a niche for Astegal to lay his neck, sat at his feet. I thought about Berlik kneeling in the swirling snow, baring his neck for my blade. This was different, so different. When all was said and done, I\u2019d understood why Berlik did what he did. Why he\u2019d killed Dorelei, why he\u2019d killed our unborn son. And I had wept for his death.</p><p>No one here would weep for Astegal.</p><p>The drums continued beating, steady and unrelenting. The blood beat in my veins. A rush of sound in my ears, a bronze clash of wings. I saw Astegal of Carthage drawing near.</p><p>His hands were bound behind his back beneath his battle-frayed purple cloak, but his head was high, his eyes glaring. Proud. He was a proud man. The crowd pushed and shoved, clamoring for his blood. Astegal ignored them. There was only one person his gaze sought. As the guards ordered Astegal to halt before the executioner, Sidonie took a step forward.</p><p>I would to Elua she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Everyone there knew the tale that lay between them. A hush fell over the crowd. And in that moment, Astegal moved, quick and sure. His shoulders jerked and the ropes binding his wrists parted and snapped. Somehow he\u2019d managed to fray his bonds during his imprisonment and hide his handiwork. Astegal grabbed the executioner\u2019s sword by the blade with his bare hand and wrested it from him, heedless of the wound it inflicted. In two swift strides, he seized Sidonie and held her pinned against him, the blade to her throat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Astegal shouted at the surging guards. His face was suffused with rage. \u201cShe\u2019ll be dead before you can strike!\u201d</p><p>My head rang.</p><p>\u201cHold!\u201d Serafin ordered the guards. He ground his teeth. \u201cWhat the hell do you think to accomplish, Carthaginian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Prince of the House of Sarkal and I\u2019ll not be executed like some common galley slave,\u201d Astegal spat. \u201cBring me a horse or I\u2019ll cut her throat.\u201d</p><p>I gazed at Sidonie. She wasn\u2019t struggling; he had the blade pressed hard enough to her flesh that a thin line of blood was visible. But she wasn\u2019t frightened, either. She was furious. Our eyes met and the ringing in my head quieted, leaving a strange sense of calm in its wake.</p><p>I dropped my walking-stick and stepped forward. \u201cLet her go, Astegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten Astegal didn\u2019t know. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for a while. You knew me as Leander Maignard in New Carthage. Your cousin Bodeshmun isn\u2019t the only man on this earth to master sorcery.\u201d I drew my sword. \u201cLet her go, and I\u2019ll grant you what you don\u2019t deserve. A warrior\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>He bared his teeth at me. \u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook around you, Astegal.\u201d I gestured with my blade. Members of Vitor Gait\u00e1n\u2019s Harbor Watch had pushed through the crowd to surround us, crossbows drawn and trained on Astegal. \u201cYou\u2019re a dead man. Do you think you can mount a horse without withdrawing that sword from Sidonie\u2019s throat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll walk,\u201d Astegal said grimly. \u201cMy dear wife and I.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s eyes flashed with fury.</p><p>Elua help me, I almost smiled. \u201cAll the way to New Carthage?\u201d I asked. \u201cThen you\u2019d best not lower your blade for an instant, because one of us will be there to kill you the moment you do. And you\u2019d best not sleep, because Sidonie will slit your throat herself.\u201d I watched the knowledge sink into him and spread my arms. \u201cCome. Surely you\u2019re not afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf a man half-crippled?\u201d he asked in contempt. \u201cBa\u2019al have mercy, no.\u201d Astegal tightened the blade against Sidonie\u2019s throat. \u201cMake it worth my while, D\u2019Angeline. Because right now, I\u2019ve no reason to do aught but die knowing I caused you grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I nodded. \u201cKill me and you\u2019ll be given a sporting chance to live. A swift horse and an hour\u2019s lead.\u201d</p><p>The crowd had been spell-bound and silent, but that raised a gasp. \u201cYou can\u2019t make that offer,\u201d Serafin said in a tight voice. \u201cAragonia will not countenance it.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cI won\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>There were a hundred debates we could have had, but I couldn\u2019t marshal the will to argue them. The ringing in my head had quieted, but I could feel Kushiel\u2019s presence over me like a mantle. This was what I was meant to do. I was as certain of that as I\u2019d ever been of anything in my life. And Serafin L\u2019Envers y Aragon was half D\u2019Angeline. There was Kusheline blood in the line of House L\u2019Envers. He returned my gaze for a long moment, and mayhap the bronze wings beat faintly in his blood, because in time he nodded.</p><p>\u201cA swift horse and an hour,\u201d Serafin said. \u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>There was a roar of protest at his words, but Astegal jerked the blade again. Blood trickled down Sidonie\u2019s throat and she closed her eyes. The roar faded. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you,\u201d Astegal said to Serafin.</p><p>Serafin shrugged. \u201cBring him a horse.\u201d</p><p>It was done. I watched Astegal weigh the decision, wondering if he could trust Serafin\u2019s word, wondering if there was some other way. I picked my words carefully, driving them like a wedge into the fault-lines on his soul. \u201cI killed your kinsman, Astegal. I watched Bodeshmun die. I led your Amazigh into ambush and killed three of them with my own hand. Are you sure you\u2019re not afraid?\u201d</p><p>He lowered the sword and shoved Sidonie violently from him. \u201cCome and see!\u201d</p><p>Fingers tightened on the triggers of crossbows. \u201cHold!\u201d Serafin shouted. \u201cGive him his chance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked Sidonie, steadying her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I kissed her lips and went to fight her husband.</p><p>Astegal was waiting for me. He\u2019d wrapped his cloak around his left arm to serve as a makeshift shield. The end was dangling and I thought he might try to use it to foul my blade or distract me. He had the hilt of the executioner\u2019s sword firmly gripped in his bleeding right hand. I wished I\u2019d donned my vambraces and I wished my leg didn\u2019t hurt so damnably much. It would slow me down, and my speed had always been one of my advantages. Astegal was reasonably quick, too. I\u2019d seen him spar. And he was a tall man. He had a few inches of reach on me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked forward to killing him.</p><p>He circled around to my left, angling to get the rising sun in my eyes. It made me smile. Elua knew, Astegal wasn\u2019t going to defeat me that way. I pivoted right on my good leg and positioned myself behind him. He jumped to face me before I had a chance to land a blow.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you smiling at?\u201d Astegal growled.</p> <p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>His left arm snaked forward, folds of cloak unwinding in the direction of my face. I ignored it and parried the low thrust I knew would come beneath it. His breathing quickened as he took a step backward and rewound his cloak around his arm. For the first time, I saw fear in him.</p><p>We traded a few blows, testing one another. If Astegal had had a shield, we might have been evenly matched. We weren\u2019t. I didn\u2019t press him yet. I didn\u2019t want to risk making any mistakes, fearful that my leg would give out beneath me if I made a careless move. But when I parried his blows with ease, I saw the realization dawn on him that he was truly in grave danger.</p><p>He was good with a sword.</p><p>I was better.</p> <p>Still, Astegal was a fighter. He sought to goad me as I\u2019d goaded him, sending a pointed glance in Sidonie\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cVery romantic, seeking to defend your beloved,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cShe\u2019s a wanton little thing, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>He essayed a quick jab at my face, hoping to force me off balance. I held my ground and parried, sweeping his blade to one side. \u201cSo willing and eager,\u201d Astegal said, taking a step backward to regroup. He licked his lips. \u201cShe tastes sweet like honey.\u201d</p><p>I kept silent, holding my sword angled before me.</p><p>Astegal\u2019s expression hardened. He came at me fast and our blades crossed and locked. Both of us strained for leverage. My left leg trembled. I tensed my muscles and willed it to steadiness. He leaned toward me, close as a lover. \u201cShe suckled my root like no one has ever done,\u201d he whispered in a confidential tone. \u201cI miss that.\u201d</p> <p>I held my tongue.</p><p>Patience.</p><p>\u201cBetimes . . .\u201d Astegal raised his voice. \u201cBetimes when I was finished with her, she would beg me for more.\u201d The crowd around us murmured. He searched my face for a reaction and found none. I felt frustration weaken his resolve and took a quick step backward, resettling myself. \u201cGods!\u201d Astegal spread his arms slightly, dropping his guard. \u201cAnd you call yourself a man?\u201d</p><p>I plunged my sword hilt-deep into his belly. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Astegal\u2019s mouth gaped. The executioner\u2019s sword dropped from his nerveless right hand. For a moment he merely stood and swayed. Then he sank slowly to his knees. And as he sank, I withdrew my blade with a ruthless wrench.</p><p>\u201cAll that passion you\u2019re so quick to boast of didn\u2019t belong to you, Astegal,\u201d I said in a cold voice. \u201cIt never did. You took it and twisted it to your own ends, you and Bodeshmun. And I will tell you what I told him while I watched him die. It is not wise to meddle with D\u2019Angelines in matters of love.\u201d</p><p>On his knees, Astegal grimaced and clutched the wound in his belly with both hands, holding his entrails in place. \u201cYou promised me a warrior\u2019s death,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cGrant me the mercy of the battlefield and make it swift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy.\u201d I placed the tip of my blood-stained blade over his heart. \u201cMercy is not mine to grant.\u201d I turned my head toward Sidonie and addressed her formally. She was my beloved, but she was also the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange. \u201cYour highness?\u201d</p> <p>If there was anyone present who would have denied her the right, they stayed silent. I would have given her the sword if she had wished. Instead, Sidonie approached and laid her hand over mine on the hilt.</p><p>We would do this together.</p><p>She gazed down at Astegal. When she spoke, her voice was cool and venomous. \u201cHow fitting that in the end you should plead for the sweet release of one final thrust.\u201d</p><p>Astegal didn\u2019t reply. Through the pain that racked his features, I saw a complex mix of emotions: anger, shame, bitterness, and regret. I couldn\u2019t see Sidonie\u2019s expression, and mayhap it was just as well.</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s hand tightened on mine.</p><p>Together we drove the blade home and granted Astegal mercy. I could feel a shudder the length of the blade as he died. Sidonie never flinched.</p><p>Sixty-Seven</p><p>On the heels of Astegal\u2019s death, there was a great outcry of bloodthirsty cheers in the plaza. It hadn\u2019t been Aragonian justice, but it had been a spectacle beyond their wildest dreams. The executioner dragged Astegal\u2019s lifeless body into place, positioning his head on the chopping-block. He retrieved his sword with grim determination and hewed Astegal\u2019s head from his body.</p><p>At that Sidonie turned away and hid her face against my chest. I held her gently. Astegal would have been a tyrant, but she\u2019d believed herself in love with him for long months. In the beginning she had seen glimmers of nobility in him about which she still wondered.</p><p>I understood.</p><p>The executioner mounted Astegal\u2019s head on a long pike. I found myself thinking once more of Berlik. He\u2019d looked peaceful in death. Astegal didn\u2019t. He looked sad and foolish, his face fixed in a grimace. His mouth hung open, his narrow crimson beard looking like blood drooling over his chin. His heavy-lidded eyes were half-open, showing the whites.</p><p>\u201cBehold!\u201d Serafin L\u2019Envers y Aragon shouted. \u201cThis is the fate of those who would seek to conquer Aragonia!\u201d</p><p>The crowd roared their approval. Sidonie shivered and raised her head.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she said. \u201cOr I will be.\u201d She searched my face. \u201cYou could have killed him cleanly, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cYou keep your promises,\u201d Sidonie murmured. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go home?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>It was a few hours before we were able to depart. Captain Deimos didn\u2019t have his new ship in full readiness. Lady Nicola insisted that her chirurgeon tend to the cut Astegal had inflicted on Sidonie\u2019s throat. It wasn\u2019t serious, but it was deep enough to warrant bandaging.</p><p>\u201cI am so perishing sick of blood,\u201d Sidonie said as I washed the dried residue from her throat and chest while we waited for Rachel.</p><p>\u201cSo am I, love,\u201d I said. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>It was a bit before noon when Kratos came from the harbor to report that Deimos\u2019 ship was ready to sail. I greeted him with pleasure. His blunt, homely face was filled with awe.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to get close enough to see,\u201d Kratos said. \u201cBut I heard how you killed that bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Sidonie said.</p><p>\u201cDone, and done well.\u201d He pointed a thick finger at her. \u201cYou and my lord here did exactly what was needful. Don\u2019t you ever be ashamed of it, your highness. Not for one instant of one day.\u201d</p><p>It made her smile, which gladdened me. \u201cThank you, Kratos. I\u2019m not. I just want to go home and see my own country safe.\u201d</p><p>A sizable party assembled to escort us to the harbor. We said our farewells there on the docks. Another leavetaking, but at least this one wasn\u2019t fraught with deadly peril. Elua willing, we would live to see one another again in times of peace.</p><p>\u201cWe will pray that the news be swift and joyous,\u201d Lady Nicola said. \u201cFor all our sakes. It will be much easier to effect a diplomatic resolution with Carthage if Terre d\u2019Ange stands behind us once more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will do our best to make it so,\u201d Sidonie promised.</p><p>In the end there was little left to say that hadn\u2019t already been said. We boarded the ship and Captain Deimos gave the order to raise the anchor. The rowers leaned their backs over the banks of oars. Within a few minutes, we were under way, leaving the harbor we\u2019d entered in flames. Sidonie and Kratos and I stood on the deck and watched the figures on shore dwindle.</p><p>\u201cTerre d\u2019Ange!\u201d Kratos marveled. \u201cNot a sight I ever thought to see.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie looked worried. \u201cPray we find her whole.\u201d</p><p>It was a slow journey. The sea was far more calm than when we\u2019d essayed it before and the winds less forbidding, but it was still rough going. Deimos kept us in sight of land and we crawled up the coast of Aragonia. During the days, Sidonie and I passed the time by beginning to teach Kratos the rudiments of D\u2019Angeline.</p><p>The nights, we had to ourselves.</p><p>On the first night, she was quiet and withdrawn. I let her be and waited for her to speak. She\u2019d learned what it was like to feel a man die by her hand that day. No matter how much Astegal had deserved his death, it was a grave thing. And I had a good idea that it wasn\u2019t the only thing troubling her.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking on it,\u201d Sidonie said at length. \u201cWatching him die. Betimes it sickens me. And then I think about what he said to you today . . .\u201d Her jaw tightened. \u201cAnd I wish I could kill him all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it only to goad me,\u201d I said.</p><p>Her shoulders moved in a slight shrug. \u201cIt was true, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I ran a lock of her hair through my fingers. \u201cI know, love. And I\u2019m so very sorry for it. I swear, while there is breath in my body, I will never suffer anyone to hurt you again in word or deed.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cDo you suppose that when we tell our brooding, haughty horde the glorious tale of their parents\u2019 exploits, we might leave that part out of it?\u201d</p><p>I smiled in the dim light of the cabin. \u201cI think we might.\u201d</p><p>The following day dawned as fair as the previous one. I hobbled through my Cassiline exercises on the deck, reckoning it was better to keep the muscles of my leg from stiffening. Sidonie commented on the likely folly of such a notion, but she didn\u2019t try to dissuade me. Instead she watched. As I told the hours, I caught glimpses of her standing against the railing, the sea breeze tugging at her honey-gold hair and the pretty blue scarf Lady Nicola had given her to hide the bandage around her throat. When I finished, I limped over to join her.</p><p>\u201cYou look pained,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>Sidonie cocked her head. \u201cHow badly?\u201d</p><p>I felt the blood quicken in my veins. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking what I think, not that badly, Sun Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised me a hundred thousand nights if Blessed Elua spared you.\u201d She took my right hand in hers and raised it to her lips, kissing my knuckles. \u201cImriel, Astegal is dead. Whatever he said, whatever he did, whatever I did . . . it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s over. And I mean to begin putting it behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my help?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>She nodded gravely, but there was a wicked spark of humor and passion lurking deep in her black eyes\u2014still there, wondrously unextinguished. \u201cOh, yes. A great deal of it.\u201d</p><p>The days passed slowly.</p><p>The nights fled.</p><p>It was a strange time, suspended between one thing and another. Both of us were grateful to be alive. Both of us were fearful of what we would find in Terre d\u2019Ange. We were both haunted by our memories. Some of them, like our flight from New Carthage and the terrible carnage outside the walls of Am\u00edlcar, were shared. Some weren\u2019t. Sidonie bore the stigma of her time as Astegal\u2019s willing bride. And the nearer we drew to Terre d\u2019Ange, the more I remembered my time of madness there, the awful things I\u2019d said to those I loved.</p><p>But we were able to lose ourselves in each other.</p><p>It was a gift of Blessed Elua, and of Naamah, whose blessing I\u2019d sought before our first liaison. I felt their presence attendant on our love-making, which was by turns tender and violent. Once nights had been my bane, the province of bloody nightmares that woke me screaming.</p><p>Now they were my joy.</p><p>It lasted all the way up the coast of Aragonia and well after we\u2019d passed the mountains and caught sight of Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s coastline, a sight that made my heart swell. It lasted until the morning we drew near the mouth of the Aviline River and saw a fleet of dozens of war-ships clustered there, anchored offshore outside the harbor of Pellasus. The town was smaller than Marsilikos, but it did a lively trade with ships bound up the Aviline. These weren\u2019t trade-ships and the pennants flying from their masts were not the silver swan of House Courcel, but solely the lily-and-stars of Terre d\u2019Ange itself.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked Sidonie.</p><p>She wore her troubled look. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s an indication that they\u2019re not in the service of the Crown. It\u2019s not an auspicious sign. Do you think Nuno failed to deliver the key?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>One of them raised its sails and hailed us, heading out in our direction. \u201cYour highness?\u201d Captain Deimos inquired. \u201cWhat will you?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie and I exchanged a glance. \u201cIf the country\u2019s still torn apart, we\u2019re better off dealing with those not in the Crown\u2019s service,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not as though we could outrun an entire fleet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for them,\u201d she said to Deimos.</p><p>We lowered our sails and waited as the D\u2019Angeline war-ship made its way alongside us. I felt ungodly tense, and although Sidonie\u2019s face was composed, I knew she felt the same way.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d A sturdy fellow aboard the war-ship shouted through cupped hands in crude Aragonian. \u201cWhat passes? Is anyone speak D\u2019Angeline?\u201d And then the ship drew nearer, the gap closing between us. He caught sight of Sidonie and me. His hands fell and he stared. Everyone on the war-ship stared.</p><p>Separately, they might not have known us, not for a surety. None of them had seen us before. But I bore the unmistakable stamp of House Shahrizai on my face, and Sidonie looked enough like her mother that they\u2019d seen the like of her profile on a thousand coins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And we were together.</p><p>The war-ship drew alongside and men scrambled to secure the ships\u2014ours heedless of the stares, theirs wondering.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in command?\u201d I called.</p> <p>A brown-haired man in the tattered jacket of the Royal Navy approached the railing. \u201cCaptain Henri Voisin,\u201d he said hesitantly. \u201cYour highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel de la Courcel,\u201d I said in confirmation. \u201cWe come bringing her highness Sidonie de la Courcel, the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange, home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d Henri Voisin\u2019s gaze slid toward Sidonie. \u201cIs she . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSane?\u201d Sidonie inquired. \u201cMercifully, yes. What passes here, my lord?\u201d</p><p>His expression was torn between hope and doubt. \u201cA great deal. We thought you were a ship out of Aragonia. You\u2019re flying Aragonian flags. We hoped you\u2019d have news.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cCome aboard and we\u2019ll share it in exchange for yours.\u201d</p><p>With some difficulty, Voisin made the crossing. He was breathing hard as he clambered over the railing onto our ship. The realization that our crew was not Aragonian did nothing to alleviate his trepidation. I couldn\u2019t blame him. Insofar as I was aware, the last he knew of either of us, Sidonie had gone off to wed Astegal, and I\u2019d vanished after screaming my throat raw in a month-long fit of madness. Still, he gathered himself and made a careful bow. \u201cWell met, your highnesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, my lord,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cTell me, who do you serve?\u201d He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cIs Terre d\u2019Ange at war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Henri Voisin said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s divided? And growing worse?\u201d She read the answer in his face. \u201cWho do you serve? My mother or my sister?\u201d</p><p>His throat worked. The fact that the question could put a man in fear made my blood run cold. \u201cYour sister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo the City of Elua remains under a foul enchantment?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo key to undoing the madness was found?\u201d</p><p>The D\u2019Angeline captain licked his lips, glancing from one to the other of us. \u201cNo. There was some talk, some wild rumors of magic, after . . .\u201d He nodded at me. \u201cAfter you vanished, your highness. But it came to naught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me be swift,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cThere was a spell cast, a dire spell. I was bound by it myself. It was Imriel who freed me from it.\u201d I started, struck by an awful realization. Sidonie continued. \u201cSince then, we have been working to undo what was done. Carthage\u2019s forces were dealt a grievous defeat at Am\u00edlcar. General Astegal is dead.\u201d Her face hardened. \u201cEven now, his head adorns a pike in the Plaza del Rey. And Imriel and I possess the key to undoing the spell that binds the City of Elua and all who were in it that fateful night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d I touched her arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t go ashore.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I felt sick. \u201cI\u2019m a fool. In all that\u2019s happened, I forgot. You\u2019re free of the spell that had you believing yourself in love with Astegal. The one that was worked on you alone. Not the other, not the ghafrid-gebla. The demon-stone.\u201d I could see Henri Voisin\u2019s expression out of the corner of my eye and I realized I sounded mad, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. \u201cPtolemy Solon said it would reassert itself if you\u2014or anyone\u2014returned to D\u2019Angeline soil.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie closed her eyes. \u201cAh, gods!\u201d</p><p>Sixty-Eight</p> <p>If it hadn\u2019t been for what had befallen Drustan mab Necthana earlier in the year, I daresay Henri Voisin would never have given full credence to our tale.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t swift. In the end, all of us talked ourselves dry. Sidonie and I related the entire tale of what we had endured. In turn, Voisin told us what had happened in our absence.</p><p>Some of it, we knew. Barquiel L\u2019Envers had raised a delegation and sent for Alais. She\u2019d come. All together, they\u2019d sought to persuade Ysandre and Drustan that they and the entire City were ensorceled. Ysandre had declared them in rebellion against the Crown. Alais and L\u2019Envers had retreated to Turnone and begun the reluctant work of raising an army. Since late autumn, Alais had served as the de facto ruler of Terre d\u2019Ange, aided by a shadow Parliament of lords and ladies from the Lesser Houses, with L\u2019Envers serving as her Royal Commander. Throughout much of the realm, Turnone was regarded as the new seat of rule.</p><p>The Royal Army was ensconced in the City of Elua, guarding it fiercely. Quintilius Rousse and his six ships were blockading the harbor of Marsilikos, monitoring who came and went. L\u2019Envers had ordered Henri Voisin and his ships, those who had not been present in the City the night of the marvel, to ward the mouth of the Aviline River, fearing an assault from Carthage should they prevail in Aragonia.</p><p>As far as an incised emerald gem went, Voisin knew nothing.</p><p>But what he did know was that Drustan mab Necthana had returned to Alba with the intention of bringing an Alban army to Terre d\u2019Ange to support the Queen. And there, his wits had cleared.</p><p>Until he returned to Terre d\u2019Ange with a larger force at his back, bent on talking sense into Ysandre.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only rumors,\u201d Voisin said. \u201cBut they say the Cruarch went mad again once they landed. Him and the honor guard that had travelled with him the first time. When his officers tried to reason with him, he accused them of treason and lit out for the City with his guards. No one tried to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the spell,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s malevolent at its core.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cAs her highness said, matters are growing worse.\u201d He paused, then delivered the worst news yet. \u201cLast week, at the spring equinox, her majesty issued a threat.\u201d He spoke the words as though they pained him. \u201cShe said if her highness Alais and your uncle and every man and woman aiding them did not surrender and plead for clemency by the next full moon, she would declare war on them.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him in shock. \u201cThat soon? Was she serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Voisin said. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, gods! That means we\u2019ve precious little time. We need to talk to Alais and my uncle,\u201d Sidonie muttered. \u201cWe need to know. We don\u2019t dare ride blind into the City of Elua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, love,\u201d I observed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go alone.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glittered. \u201cIs there no way?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say no, and my thoughts went to the croonie-stone I carried in my purse\u2014smooth and polished granite, a hole at its center. A reminder of what I had endured. A reminder of what I had lost\u2014Dorelei and our son. I remembered its weight around my neck, the bindings of red thread around my wrists and ankles. Alban magic. It had been given me by an ollamh. It had protected me from the power of a talisman wrought of my own aching desire.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if it would protect her.</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d I said, as cautious as Henri Voisin.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Sidonie demanded.</p><p>I told her.</p><p>Henri Voisin looked sickly fascinated by it all. I don\u2019t know how much of it he believed. Enough to give us a chance.</p><p>\u201cI mean to try it,\u201d Sidonie said with grim determination. \u201cIf it works, so much the better. Our stories are stronger together. If it fails . . .\u201d She lifted her shoulders in a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m the only one it will affect. I give you leave to overpower me and haul me back to Am\u00edlcar. At least it will give proof to our claims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe have to try. My lord captain, will you hear my orders?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a dubious look. \u201cI\u2019ll hear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have you keep our presence here quiet for the time. Bid your men to do the same. Find us a discreet escort to Turnone, then take your fleet to Am\u00edlcar,\u201d Sidonie said in a steady tone. \u201cWith or without me, depending on how matters fall. There\u2019s naught to be done at sea here. I would have Terre d\u2019Ange honor her alliances. The presence of a D\u2019Angeline fleet will hasten negotiations with a weakened Carthage.\u201d</p><p>It heartened him. \u201cI believe your sister and uncle would agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cShall we attempt the charm?\u201d</p><p>I racked my wits, trying to remember the items the ollamh Aodhan had used when he wrought the charm of protection that warded me against all who sought to bind me. \u201cI need salt. Salt, and rowan and birchwood.\u201d I closed my eyes, grateful for Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s training, and recalled the scent of camphor. \u201cAnd pennyroyal. Oh, and red thread, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Henri Voisin echoed doubtfully.</p><p>In the end, he had to return and put ashore to collect some of the items\u2014and failed to find them at that. Salt, we had aboard the ship, and Sidonie picked red threads out of the Euskerri wedding dress that Bixenta had given her, braiding several lengths. Voisin found incense imbued with oil of pennyroyal in a small Temple of Azza, but rowan and birch were a lost cause. He returned with dried bundles of juniper and wild rosemary instead, claiming an old herb-wife in the marketplace insisted they held protective properties.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a try,\u201d I said.</p><p>There was a stone firebox on the deck of the ship used for what little cooking was done; mostly we subsisted on sailor\u2019s fare of hard biscuits and salt cod. I kindled a fire with the fragrant wood under Captain Deimos\u2019 watchful eye and cast a handful of incense on it. I had Sidonie remove her shoes and stockings and stand barefooted on the deck while I poured a line of salt around her in a circle. Henri Voisin and his men watched the proceedings as though we were absolutely mad, for which I didn\u2019t blame them; but Deimos and the Cytherans took the matter in stride. They served Ptolemy Solon.</p><p>Kratos merely shrugged. \u201cAfter what I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019ll believe most anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall the exact words of the invocation,\u201d I said to Sidonie. \u201cBut I\u2019m praying it doesn\u2019t matter. When Firdha had to renew my bindings, her invocation wasn\u2019t exactly the same as Aodhan\u2019s. She said it was due to differences between the traditions of the Dalriada and the Cruithne. But they both worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo as you think best,\u201d Sidonie said, her face pale.</p><p>I knelt and bowed my head before I began. I prayed silently to Blessed Elua and his Companions that they would guide my hand this day. And I prayed to all the gods of Alba, great and small, that they would lend me their magic. I had honored them and done my duty as a Prince of Alba in joy and in sorrow, and Sidonie was the Cruarch\u2019s eldest daughter. I prayed to Dorelei\u2019s merciful shade to intercede with Alba\u2019s gods on our behalf. I prayed they would listen. I held the solid weight of the ollamh\u2019s croonie-stone in my hand and prayed that it retained enough of Aodhan\u2019s magic and learning to anchor my fumbling spell.</p><p>I thought of Berlik bidding me do my duty with a humble heart, and I prayed to sea and stone and sky as the Maghuin Dhonn did. I prayed that there was some debt owed for the honorable death I\u2019d granted him.</p><p>I made my heart humble.</p><p>I prayed without words for a miracle.</p><p>And then I began.</p><p>\u201cThe charm of Nerthus ward thee, the charm of Lug defend thee, the charm of Brigit protect thee, the charm of Crom shield thee,\u201d I chanted. There was a faint stirring in the air. The trickling smoke rising from the fire smelled sharp and pungent. I thought it would be meet to include the gods of Terre d\u2019Ange. \u201cBlessed Elua and his Companions hold thee and keep thee from all harm.\u201d</p><p>I circled her three times. \u201cTo ward thee from the back,\u201d I said, tying the red threads around her right wrist. \u201cTo guard thee from the front.\u201d I tied another length around her left wrist, then stooped and did the same to her ankles. \u201cFrom the crown of thy head to the sole of thy foot, be thou protected.\u201d</p><p>I stood and hung the croonie-stone around her neck, its weight settling into place. \u201cFrom all that seeks to bind thee, be thou protected!\u201d</p><p>I clapped my hands as Aodhan had done.</p><p>Unlike me, Sidonie didn\u2019t jump. \u201cIs that all? Is it done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I can remember,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI think so. Do you feel anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut then I suppose I wouldn\u2019t, would I? Not until I set foot ashore.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my sweating palms on my thighs, then began to scoop up the circle of salt, giving it back to the sea from whence it had come. \u201cI reckon we\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>Henri Voisin returned to his ship and preceded us. We would be putting ashore at the harbor of Pellasus. Voisin would secure the harbor and procure an escort from among his men, then signal us to make landfall.</p><p>I spoke to Captain Deimos and thanked him for his service, which had gone so far beyond aught he could have imagined when he gave his oath to Ptolemy Solon. \u201cI\u2019ll ask no more of you, my lord,\u201d I said to him. \u201cReturn to Cythera and tell my mother you saw me safely delivered to Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cAnd . . . thank her for me.\u201d</p><p>Deimos smiled wryly. \u201cMothers, eh?\u201d</p><p>In the matter of Melisande, it was such an understatement it made me smile in return. \u201cTell her I\u2019ll send word when I can, Elua willing,\u201d I said, surprising myself by meaning it. \u201cAs well as a generous reward for you and your men. Terre d\u2019Ange owes you a great debt.\u201d</p><p>He put out his hand. \u201cLuck, your highness. I gather you\u2019ll yet have need of it.\u201d</p><p>I clasped it. \u201cSafe travels to you.\u201d</p><p>I spoke to Kratos, too, giving him one last opportunity to return to Cythera with Deimos and his men to take service with my mother rather than continue on into unknown danger with Sidonie and me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be safe,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt my mother would be delighted by you. And they speak Hellene.\u201d</p><p>Kratos looked at me as though I\u2019d gone mad. \u201cMy lord, after all this, do you think I\u2019d miss seeing the tale through to its end?\u201d He shook his greying head. \u201cOh, no! Besides, without me, you\u2019d still be trying to figure out how to get that damned ring off Astegal\u2019s finger.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cAll right, my friend.\u201d</p> <p>It was late in the afternoon before Henri Voisin\u2019s ship signaled us, the slanting sun turning the harbor\u2019s waters to gold. The oarsmen brought us to the wharf and secured the ship\u2019s moorings. The ship rocked gently on the protected waters. Voisin was waiting ashore. He had managed to clear the harbor of onlookers and to procure an unmarked carriage and mounts and pack-horses for a dozen men.</p><p>\u201cResourceful fellow,\u201d I commented.</p><p>Sidonie shivered beside me as the gangplank was lowered. \u201cIf the charm doesn\u2019t work, you promise you\u2019ll send me back to Am\u00edlcar no matter how much I rage and protest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you again,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose me again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d I grasped her shoulders. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. I have the key. Emmenghanom. I have Bodeshmun\u2019s foul talisman in my purse. You can go back to Am\u00edlcar with Voisin and his men. Or even stay anchored in the harbor if he\u2019s willing to spare a ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She looked past me at the land beyond the city, the gentle hills beginning to green with the advent of spring. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re both needed, Imriel? I have to try.\u201d</p><p>I released her with a sigh. \u201cAs you will.\u201d</p><p>We said our farewells to Captain Deimos and his men. Henri Voisin and his were waiting. Better if we didn\u2019t delay. Every minute gave rumor a chance to spread. Kratos went before us, carrying the trunk that held our few possessions and lashing it to the carriage.</p><p>Sidonie caught my hand in a terrified grip. Her face was white, black eyes stark. \u201cLet\u2019s find out.\u201d</p><p>We descended.</p> <p>Nothing happened when we stepped onto the wooden docks. When we stepped off the dock onto the cobbled stones of the harbor square, her body jerked and her hand tightened on mine. \u201cThey itch and burn,\u201d Sidonie said in wonderment. She lifted her free hand and regarded the binding of red thread around her wrist. \u201cAnd this . . .\u201d She touched the croonie-stone lying in the hollow of her throat. \u201cIt feels heavy.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>She let go my hand and reached up to cup my face, kissing me in answer.</p><p>She knew me.</p><p>She knew herself.</p><p>I kissed her back with relieved, desperate ardor, then lifted my head to find that every D\u2019Angeline sailor in the harbor had gone to one knee and bowed their heads. To her. To us. I saw tears in Sidonie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour highnesses.\u201d Henri Voisin rose to his feet, his face grave. \u201cI am not entirely certain what has transpired here this day, but I sense the hand of Blessed Elua in it. Tell Princess Alais and his grace the Duc that the Royal Navy of Terre d\u2019Ange has obeyed the orders of the Dauphine. We wish you the gods\u2019 own speed.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie drew a deep, shaking breath. \u201cAnd you, my lord. And you.\u201d</p> <p>Our escort mounted.</p><p>Kratos opened the carriage door and ushered us inside. The stiff cushions creaked as we settled ourselves. Kratos himself took a seat atop the carriage alongside the driver. A whip cracked and hooves drummed on the paving-stones.</p><p>We were off.</p><p>Sixty-Nine</p><p>We made our way in haste to Turnone.</p><p>The city lay some sixty leagues west of the City of Elua, perched atop a steep hill. Marc Faucon, the sensible young lieutenant that Henri Voisin had appointed to lead our escort, told us that Barquiel L\u2019Envers had selected it because it was easily defensible.</p><p>\u201cSo he would make a stand if my mother makes good on her threat?\u201d Sidonie asked soberly.</p><p>Faucon, riding alongside the carriage, glanced through the window at her. \u201cNothing is certain, your highness. If it comes to it, he\u2019s chosen a place that could be defended for long months without engagement. But in the end . . .\u201d He shrugged and didn\u2019t finish the thought.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t possibly succeed.\u201d I felt sick at having to utter the words. \u201cNot against the entire country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Faucon\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cBut her majesty has a very large, very well-trained army at her disposal. If she will not relent, we face the choice between suffering ourselves to be ruled by madness and lies or enduring terrible bloodshed.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie buried her face in her hands. \u201cOh, gods! It\u2019s not their fault. The spell . . . it\u2019s like an awful sickness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I pray your highnesses possess the cure in truth,\u201d Faucon said gently. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, I fear thousands may die of this disease.\u201d</p><p>We eschewed the towns and made camp along the roadside, choosing isolated stretches. Neither Sidonie nor I wanted word of our return to be known\u2014not until we knew what we were going to do. Marc Faucon apologized profusely for the discomfort. Sidonie, who had endured worse during our sojourn among the Euskerri, waved his apologies aside. For my part, I couldn\u2019t have cared less.</p><p>At night we watched the moon rise.</p><p>In a little less than three weeks, it would be full; and Ysandre would make good on her threat.</p><p>War.</p><p>I checked Sidonie\u2019s bindings obsessively, still half-disbelieving that the charm had worked. It seemed too good to be true. I\u2019d seen the hours and hours that it had taken Ptolemy Solon to wreak his charm of semblance, and I knew the horrific measures to which Bodeshmun had gone to create his vast spell. It was true that Aodhan\u2019s charm had been wrought as swiftly as mine, but he was an ollamh. It took years and years of study to attain that rank.</p><p>\u201cMayhap the magic lies in the croonie-stone,\u201d Sidonie offered. \u201cAfter all, it was an ollamh\u2019s gift.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough alone. Morwen was able to summon me when one of the bindings broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, mayhap there\u2019s an untapped gift for magic in your bloodline,\u201d she said. \u201cOr mayhap it was some arcane gift of the Maghuin Dhonn in exchange for granting Berlik a noble death and urging mercy for those who remained. Mayhap it\u2019s because the spell that lies over the City wasn\u2019t meant for me and me alone.\u201d She rubbed her left wrist. \u201cOr mayhap it\u2019s simply that every now and then the gods do grant our prayers. Whatever it is, I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it still itch and burn?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAll the time,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cYours didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I frowned. \u201cOnly when Morwen summoned me or when I thought of you. It was all tied to my desire and longing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose Bodeshmun\u2019s spell is a constant.\u201d She glanced involuntarily toward the east. \u201cIt does seem to get a little easier to bear as we travel. Or mayhap I\u2019m merely growing accustomed to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d I said. \u201cAt any rate, we\u2019ve plenty of quandaries for the academy of magic you envision us founding for our legacy to study.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shuddered to the bone. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019d be overjoyed to earn the legacy of having averted civil war in Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>It took us three days to reach Turnone. We arrived shortly before sunset and waited at the base of the steep, winding road while Marc Faucon and a couple of his men went to alert the palace and ensure our entry into the city was secure. I leaned out the window of the carriage and gazed up at the forbidding walls. It would indeed be a difficult place to besiege; in that L\u2019Envers had chosen wisely. But in the end that would only prolong the inevitable.</p><p>Dusk was falling as Faucon rode back to inform us that all was in readiness. We closed the carriage curtains and began our ascent, jolting upward in muffled darkness. It seemed to take forever, but at last the road leveled. We heard Faucon exchange a word with the guards in the gatehouse, then the creak of the gates being opened. The carriage moved forward.</p><p>I could hear the sound of other horses, other carriages, occasional voices calling out greetings to friends. Not many. For a D\u2019Angeline city at nightfall, it was quiet. Then again, I suppose there wasn\u2019t much revelry in the cities of Terre d\u2019Ange these days. I remembered the uncertain mood that had gripped Marsilikos before I left. That could only have deepened.</p><p>Our carriage drew to a halt.</p><p>\u201cPut up your hoods,\u201d Marc Faucon said in a low voice beyond the window. That had been part of Henri Voisin\u2019s resourcefulness; he\u2019d provided us both with heavy cloaks with deep, concealing hoods.</p><p>I tucked an errant lock of Sidonie\u2019s hair into hers. \u201cMind it doesn\u2019t blow off this time, love.\u201d</p><p>She nodded without smiling.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see much of the palace as we entered. I kept my head lowered, and the hood obscured the sides of my vision. It was large enough that our footsteps echoed. By the chill that permeated the place, I guessed it was old and poorly heated. It smelled like stone. I could hear Kratos\u2019 heavy, familiar tread behind me. His presence felt reassuring. He believed more strongly than anyone that this unlikely tale into which he\u2019d found himself thrust would end happily. I wished I had his faith.</p><p>Faucon spoke to another guard. A door opened and Sidonie and I were ushered into a warmer room while the others waited. I could hear a fire crackling. The door closed behind us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said. I recognized it.</p><p>I lifted my head and drew back my hood. Beside me, Sidonie did the same.</p><p>\u201cOh, Elua!\u201d Standing before us, Alais covered her mouth. Her violet eyes glistened with tears as she gazed at both of us. \u201cIs it true? Is it really true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear,\u201d Sidonie said softly.</p><p>Alais caught her breath on an indrawn sob, took a step forward, and flung her arms around Sidonie\u2019s neck. Sidonie closed her eyes and embraced Alais, whispering words I couldn\u2019t hear into her ear. When all was said and done, I might regard Alais as the sister of my heart, but Sidonie was her flesh and blood. They were Ysandre and Drustan\u2019s only heirs and the bond they shared ran deep.</p><p>I found myself left to meet Barquiel L\u2019Envers\u2019 gaze: the same lovely eyes as his niece and grandniece, set in a lined face grown ten years older since last I\u2019d seen it. For the first time in my life, there was nothing but respect in it.</p><p>\u201cSo you did it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou found her and freed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>Alais released Sidonie, although she caught her older sister\u2019s hand in a hard grip. With the heel of her other hand, she rubbed at her tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just been so awful. You can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sidonie squeezed Alais\u2019 hand. \u201cBut I\u2019ve a passing good idea, love. You need to tell us everything. Did our messenger not arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Euskerri lad?\u201d L\u2019Envers inquired. \u201cYes, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bore the key,\u201d I said. \u201cA word, the word.\u201d I fumbled in my purse and fetched out Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman. A scrap of lacquered leather, a whirlwind sprouting fangs and horns. \u201cEmmenghanom. What happened? Did you not use it?\u201d</p><p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers spread his arms. \u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie and I exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t find the demon-stone,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d L\u2019Envers\u2019 face was set and hard. \u201cI received the letter you sent from Cythera. Before matters with Ysandre came to a head, I searched to the best of my abilities. So did others. We found no emerald gem inscribed with sigils on the premises of the Palace or anywhere in the City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s there.\u201d Sidonie freed her hand from Alais\u2019 clasp and scratched impatiently at her bindings. \u201cIt has to be. Did you search the whole of the treasury? Did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d I interrupted her. \u201cOnce we start this conversation in earnest, I suspect we\u2019ll be at it all night. I know time\u2019s short, but I\u2019m road-weary, dirty, and hungry, and my leg aches. I imagine Kratos and Faucon and his men are waiting on us, too. Do you think it might wait an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElua!\u201d It was Alais who answered in a guilt-stricken voice. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Of course you are! I ordered a room made ready for you and there\u2019s space in the barracks for your men . . . Let me tell the chamberlain to have a bath drawn, and I\u2019ll have supper served here so we can speak privately, and . . . Imri, do you need a chirurgeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled at Alais, my heart aching for her. \u201cBut I need a proper greeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Alais whispered. She wrapped her arms around me. I rested my chin atop her black curls and returned her embrace, feeling a measure of nervous tension ebb from her. Her body felt thin and frail. The months of strain and uncertainty had taken a fearful toll on her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, love.\u201d I forced all of Kratos\u2019 assurance into my tone. \u201cWe\u2019ll see everything put right. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Alais sniffled. \u201cDon\u2019t patronize me.\u201d Still, when she pulled away, I could see she\u2019d taken heart from it.</p><p>\u201cAnd he does need a chirurgeon,\u201d Sidonie added acerbically. \u201cEven if it\u2019s healing clean, I imagine it\u2019s time for those stitches to be pulled.\u201d</p><p>Her sister nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll send Nathaniel Montague. He can be trusted. Almost everyone here can. How were you wounded, Imriel?\u201d Alais paused, knitting her brow. \u201cAnd why do you both want to be so secretive? It would bring everyone a great deal of hope and joy to know that you\u2019ve returned safely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cImriel was injured in a battle. And we\u2019re being careful because we\u2019re not safe, dear,\u201d Sidonie said in a gentle voice. She turned out her hands, showing the bindings on her wrists. \u201cImriel\u2019s charm in the only thing standing between me and madness.\u201d</p><p>Alais gave me a startled look. \u201cYou wrought an ollamh\u2019s charm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd if we survive this, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on it. But it\u2019s not just that, Alais.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cWe need that gem. And if it means Sidonie and I have to go to the City to search for it, I\u2019d sooner your mother think us allies than enemies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe grieving widow and her deranged but harmless cousin,\u201d Sidonie murmured.</p><p>\u201cWidow?\u201d L\u2019Envers asked sharply. \u201cIs Astegal dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo you really did marry him,\u201d Alais said to her sister in wonderment. \u201cYou sailed away to Carthage and married him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie didn\u2019t offer anything further.</p> <p>After a moment, Alais gathered herself. \u201cI\u2019ll go speak to the chamberlain.\u201d</p><p>In a short while, Sidonie and I donned our hooded cloaks and were shown to a bedchamber where a steaming bath awaited. When I asked Alais if the household staff would find our mysterious presence suspicious, she gave me a look that was world-weary and old beyond her years.</p><p>\u201cThese days? No.\u201d</p><p>Once we\u2019d bathed, there was a discreet knock at the door. A voice beyond it announced himself as Nathaniel Montague. I admitted the chirurgeon, who was a slight fellow with blond hair and brown eyes that lit with a spark of hope at the sight of us. He bowed low. \u201cIt is my very great pleasure, your highnesses.\u201d</p><p>The gash was knitting cleanly, and Montague confirmed that the stitches should be pulled. I sat on the bed while he knelt and snipped each stitch with a tiny pair of shears, then tugged the lengths of black thread out of my flesh. Sidonie stood at my side. When Montague had finished, he remained on his knees, gazing up at us like a supplicant.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried,\u201d he said simply. \u201cAll of us who follow Eisheth\u2019s teaching. Tried and tried to find a cure for this madness. Tried and failed. Is it true you bring hope?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA very slender thread of it,\u201d Sidonie said.</p><p>He kissed both our hands, then rose. \u201cI will pray.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Sidonie when he\u2019d left. Her shoulders had slumped under the burden of so many folks\u2019 hope, but when she saw me looking at her, they straightened. She lifted her chin. The warm lamplight illuminated her fair skin, the mark of Astegal\u2019s sword healing but visible on her bare throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I kissed her. \u201cNor am I.\u201d</p><p>Seventy</p><p>I was right; we talked until dawn.</p><p>Sidonie and I told our story first. If anything happened to us, it was important that the truth be known. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen Barquiel L\u2019Envers astonished, but he was astonished that night. Alais gasped aloud when Sidonie told of bidding me to cut the mark of the House of Sarkal out of her flesh.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you did it?\u201d she asked me in horror.</p><p>\u201cI had to,\u201d I said.</p><p>Alais looked at her sister. \u201cMay I see?\u201d</p><p>It was an odd request, but I understood it. It was such an outrageous tale, I didn\u2019t blame Alais for needing to see the physical truth of it. Sidonie must have understood it too, for she didn\u2019t answer, only turned her back to me. I unlaced her stays carefully, parting the back of her gown. Her hair was coiled in a loose chignon. The slender line of her back was bare, the disk-shaped scar showing like a brand between her shoulder blades, fresh and pink.</p><p>\u201cGods!\u201d Alais breathed. Barquiel L\u2019Envers hissed through his teeth.</p><p>I laced Sidonie\u2019s stays and we told the rest of the tale. Bodeshmun\u2019s death, finding the talisman. Our flight from New Carthage, our desperate entrance into Am\u00edlcar and our violent escape from it. The Euskerri and their insistence on an act of good faith. That part, they had learned from Nuno Agirre.</p><p>\u201cI nearly throttled him,\u201d L\u2019Envers said shortly.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d Sidonie murmured. \u201cAnd the Euskerri paid an awful price in the end.\u201d</p><p>The war.</p><p>Astegal\u2019s death.</p><p>I told that portion of our story while Sidonie was silent. I left out Astegal\u2019s goading comments, but I told them of Sidonie\u2019s role in Astegal\u2019s death. That was the part that had Barquiel L\u2019Envers staring in astonishment at his eldest grandniece. Sidonie returned his gaze with equanimity. Alais wasn\u2019t surprised. She knew her sister far better than most people did.</p><p>And then it was our turn to listen.</p><p>Some of it we\u2019d already heard from Henri Voisin, but I listened carefully lest there be some further clue in the details. There wasn\u2019t. What there was instead was a palpable sense of how awful it had been when Ysandre had turned on them in a rage, accusing them of sedition and betrayal.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not herself, Sidonie,\u201d Alais whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s just . . . not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Father?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>Alais shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019d left before I arrived and she\u2019d expelled us before he returned. Our paths didn\u2019t cross. I never saw him in the grip of it.\u201d She shivered. \u201cI\u2019m just as glad.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cDid you see Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Alais looked at me with sympathy. \u201cThey\u2019re not . . . I don\u2019t think it\u2019s taken them as hard as some. Ph\u00e8dre wasn\u2019t angry or harsh. She\u2019s heartbroken at your disappearance. She just kept pleading with us to see reason and seemed hurt and confused when we wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She looked at her uncle. \u201cAnd Joscelin was just . . . Joscelin. Only worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave them your letter,\u201d L\u2019Envers said dryly. \u201cApparently it wasn\u2019t convincing\u2014or at least I was an unconvincing messenger. Messire Verreuil thinks I\u2019ve disposed of you in some dreadful fashion.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cDo you blame him?\u201d</p><p>To his credit, he answered with candor. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie sighed. \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to have to face them all. Because if we stand any chance of averting this conflict, Imriel and I have to go to the City and find this damnable demon-stone before the full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not there?\u201d L\u2019Envers asked. \u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t even exist?\u201d</p><p>She glanced unerringly toward the east. \u201cThere\u2019s somewhat there.\u201d Sidonie rubbed unthinking at the bindings on her wrists. \u201cI feel it. I feel it tugging at me. Even here, even now. It\u2019s better, but I still feel it.\u201d</p><p>I laid my hand over hers. \u201cDon\u2019t fret at them, love.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cTell us where you searched, Uncle.\u201d</p><p>To the best of his ability, Barquiel L\u2019Envers had done a thorough job. He\u2019d searched the entire contents of the Royal Treasury. Those folks he\u2019d recruited had scrutinized everyone with whom they came in contact, every inch of the City that they could scour. But a gem was a small thing and the City was large.</p><p>And in the end, they\u2019d found nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you propose to better my search?\u201d L\u2019Envers asked frankly.</p><p>\u201cDoes my mother know about it?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe had an inkling I was up to something, but I didn\u2019t tell her what it was. When matters worsened, she accused me of trying to loot the Treasury for my treasonous plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Sidonie allowed herself a faint smile. \u201cThen I\u2019ll get the entire City searching for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you propose to do that?\u201d L\u2019Envers inquired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them it\u2019s an extremely valuable talisman that Bodeshmun left behind to defend the City against all who would assail it,\u201d she said steadily. \u201cAnd that its charm must be invoked anew after Bodeshmun was foully murdered by an Aragonian assassin. With his dying breath, he bade me to flee to the City and see it done . . . but tragically, he perished before he could tell me its whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers ran a hand over his cropped hair. \u201cNot bad, child,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cIt plays to their paranoia.\u201d He looked at her with concern. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up to the task? It\u2019s going to take one hell of a performance, especially on your part. Right now I\u2019m not convinced you can utter Astegal\u2019s name without sounding like you\u2019re spitting poison, let alone play the grieving widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can do it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the feat the two of you managed to achieve in New Carthage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be different. You\u2019ll not be dealing with enemies. You\u2019ll be dealing with folk you know and love turned horribly against everything they hold dear.\u201d L\u2019Envers sounded more somber than I\u2019d ever heard him. \u201cIt\u2019s going to break your hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Sidonie said quietly. \u201cAll I can do is try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have much time.\u201d Alais\u2019 brow furrowed with anxiety. \u201cNo matter how well you spin your tale, it\u2019s bound to be exposed soon. Sidonie, you and Imriel killed Astegal with all of Am\u00edlcar watching. Now that they\u2019re not under a blockade and trade will be resumed, that news will spread. We can try to contain it, but you know what gossip\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can contain it until the full moon, Alais,\u201d L\u2019Envers said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t find this cursed gem by then . . .\u201d</p><p>He fell silent.</p><p>We all did.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cI suppose . . . I suppose we need to discuss what\u2019s to be done if we fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that decision falls to the Dauphine,\u201d Barquiel L\u2019Envers murmured.</p><p>It surprised me a bit. It had always irked L\u2019Envers that Ysandre had proved more strong-willed and independent than he\u2019d hoped, and I would have expected him to have wrung every possible ounce of power and control out of this situation. But instead it seemed the opposite had occurred. He looked old and tired and more than willing to let Sidonie take responsibility for the decision. Alais just looked relieved. It wasn\u2019t a decision anyone wanted to make.</p><p>I watched Sidonie square her shoulders once more. \u201cWhat are our choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can withstand a siege for a few months.\u201d L\u2019Envers rubbed his temples. \u201cI chose Turnone with that in mind. To buy time if things worsened. Unfortunately, it seems Ysandre has found a means to counter that gambit.\u201d His mouth twisted. \u201cIn hindsight, we should never have sent so many delegates. We should never have let her know that the entire country is arrayed against her. I thought it would help convince her, but it didn\u2019t. It angered her. She remembers. And she\u2019s prepared to . . .\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say it.</p><p>Alais did.</p><p>\u201cMother\u2019s threatened to start sacking villages if we don\u2019t surrender.\u201d Her voice shook, but she continued. \u201cOne a day until Uncle Barquiel and I kneel at her feet and beg for clemency.\u201d</p><p>I felt the blood drain from my face.</p><p>\u201cElua have mercy!\u201d Sidonie whispered.</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell you.\u201d Alais shivered. \u201cIt is worse than you can imagine, Sidonie. We tried everything we could think of. We tried reasoning with her. We offered proof from the archives, testimony from hundreds of delegates from outside the City. All she could see was a vast conspiracy.\u201d She shivered again. \u201cWe tried pleading, too. Uncle Barquiel and I offered to stand down, to beg for clemency, to do aught that she desired if only she would come with us to Alba. Nothing worked. And it\u2019s not just her. It\u2019s all of them. Everyone who was in the City that night.\u201d Alais fell silent, and Barquiel L\u2019Envers reached over to squeeze her hand.</p><p>Sidonie met her sister\u2019s gaze. \u201cDo you truly think she means it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Alais said in a broken tone. \u201cThis spell . . . it\u2019s horrible. It twists everything. And yes, I am very much afraid that Mother means to make good on her threat.\u201d</p><p>L\u2019Envers nodded in mute agreement.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Sidonie gazed into the distance for a long time. When at last she spoke, her voice was low and anguished. \u201cThen I think we all know the answer. Do I have to say it aloud?\u201d No one replied. She closed her eyes briefly. \u201cDo we at least have the numbers to prevail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d L\u2019Envers said gently.</p><p>\u201cThen if Imriel and I fail, Terre d\u2019Ange must fight.\u201d She dashed impatiently at her tears. \u201cRouse the countryside. Send urgent word to Talorcan in Alba for as much additional aid as he can send. Is there aught the Master of the Straits can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s reluctant,\u201d Alais murmured.</p><p>\u201cBeg him to think on it,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cIf you can amass enough strength and numbers to overpower them, and with his magic, mayhap . . . mayhap you can force them to surrender without giving battle. Take them prisoner. And then you could ferry the survivors and the women and children to Alba.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the army takes to the battlefield, I fear none will allow themselves to be taken prisoner, no matter how overwhelming the odds,\u201d L\u2019Envers said. \u201cYou can\u2019t think about them as though they\u2019re rational.\u201d</p><p>The entire Royal Army, slaughtered. It would be worse than the carnage at Am\u00edlcar.</p><p>Sidonie shuddered. \u201cThe women and children, then.\u201d</p><p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers nodded. \u201cAs many as we can save.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So it was decided. We\u2019d committed to a course that would lead to civil war in Terre d\u2019Ange. I remembered the words of the Euskerri who had spoken at the ceremony in Am\u00edlcar. Yesterday we gained a nation and lost the flower of a generation. I felt sick and hollow inside.</p><p>I daresay all of us did.</p><p>Seventy-One</p> <p>After the awful decision was made, we discussed getting into the City as quickly as possible without arousing suspicion. L\u2019Envers and Alais determined that our best ploy would be to return the way I left, hidden on a merchant-barge. We could tell everyone that we had hired them in Pellasus and travelled secretly upriver.</p><p>\u201cThe fellow who ferried you before, Gilbert Dumel, knows how to keep his mouth shut,\u201d L\u2019Envers said. \u201cHe\u2019s moored at the village of Yvens. Ought to be a short journey if you meet him there.\u201d</p><p>He left us for an hour or so to send advance word to Dumel and begin the terrible process of making arrangements for the war; and I think also to give Alais and Sidonie some time alone together, something for which Alais was clearly yearning. When he left, she curled up beside her sister, resting her head on Sidonie\u2019s shoulder. I had to own, either Barquiel L\u2019Envers had more sensitivity in him than I\u2019d reckoned, or this experience had altered him. Or mayhap both were true.</p><p>\u201cShall I leave, love?\u201d I asked Alais.</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t. I\u2019ve missed you both and been so horribly worried.\u201d She gathered herself and sat upright. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to act the baby. It\u2019s just such an ungodly relief to know this spell can be thwarted.\u201d Alais traced the bindings on Sidonie\u2019s wrist. \u201cI\u2019ve an idea why the charm might have worked. You\u2019ve an affinity for its magic in your blood, Sidonie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do?\u201d She sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cOf course. We both do. It comes from Grandmother Necthana\u2019s bloodline,\u201d Alais said. \u201cThe Maghuin Dhonn claim that our gifts, like my dreams, come from them. That we intermingled long ago and there\u2019s a strain of their blood in ours. The Cruithne deny it, but it\u2019s true that a lot of the ollamhs\u2019 lore, at least the part that\u2019s to do with magic and not history and poetry and law, comes from the Maghuin Dhonn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we survive this, Sidonie wants to establish an academy to study magic in Terre d\u2019Ange,\u201d I informed her. \u201cIt\u2019s to be our legacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Alais asked.</p><p>Sidonie smiled with sorrow. \u201cIt\u2019s a notion from a time when Imriel and I hoped that the key written on Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman was all we needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea, though.\u201d Alais hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ve come to a realization over the course of these past months. I do not, not want this responsibility. Not here. I never wanted it here. And not in Alba, either. I thought I did, but I was wrong.\u201d She met her sister\u2019s gaze. \u201cI know my duty. But what if I can fill it in a way no one considered? If we do survive this, I want to return to Alba to continue my studies and become an ollamh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn ollamh,\u201d Sidonie echoed.</p><p>\u201cIn Alba, an ollamh is the Cruarch\u2019s equal,\u201d I said, remembering my first encounter with one.</p><p>Alais nodded. \u201cIf I could attain that rank, I would wield a good deal of influence, which is all that the carping D\u2019Angeline peers ever cared about. All that business about the succession was only ever about power anyway. And as for Talorcan . . .\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love him,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Alais glanced at me. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. But no, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t wed him.\u201d Sidonie stroked her sister\u2019s unruly black curls. \u201cAfter this, I suspect the peers of the realm may prove rather receptive to the idea of having a member of the royal family grown wise and powerful in the ways of arcane lore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the ollamhs might be able to help us now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Alais shook her head. \u201cOnly with charms of protection like yours and that will help only if we\u2019re able to get folk across the Straits. But I think the Maghuin Dhonn know things we\u2019ve lost. You said the demon in the stone was an elemental, a desert spirit. The Maghuin Dhonn\u2019s magic is old and wild and rooted in nature. If you should fail . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t fail,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut if we do, you\u2019ll look for further answers among the Maghuin Dhonn,\u201d Sidonie said firmly. A glance passed between them.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t fail,\u201d I repeated, willing myself to believe it.</p><p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers returned shortly thereafter to inform us that the preparations were under way. \u201cI sent a swift courier to alert Gilbert Dumel,\u201d he said, sounding ragged. \u201cHe ought to reach Yvens a half day before you.\u201d</p><p>I got to my feet. \u201cIs our carriage ready?\u2019</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d L\u2019Envers pointed at me. \u201cThere are fourteen members of our shadow Parliament here in Turnone, representing the seven provinces. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of sending for them.\u201d He shifted his gaze to Sidonie. \u201cYou need to address them. I know time is short. Alais and I will tell them the whole of your tale later. But they need to see and hear you. They need to believe the madness can be broken. They need to believe that this battle is worth the cost, and to carry that word home with them. They need hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they shall have it,\u201d Sidonie said.</p><p>Gods, I loved her.</p><p>There was no time for sleep, but it didn\u2019t matter. We could sleep in the carriage, jolting our way toward Yvens. We waited for the fourteen members of the shadow Parliament to assemble, woken from their own slumber in the grey hours of dawn. Alais sent her chamberlain to the kitchens. We broke our fast with bread and apricot preserves and many pots of strong tea.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re ready for us,\u201d L\u2019Envers said.</p><p>Sidonie and I donned our cloaks and hoods. We were ushered to another room, a small chamber adjacent to a larger room, one that might have served as a musical salon in happier times.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he said to us; and to Alais, \u201cDo you know what to say?\u201d</p><p>She looked ashen but resolute. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the best of plans. The door to our chamber was thick and heavy, and L\u2019Envers had closed it\u2014all the better to make a theatrical gesture. I supposed it ran in the family. Still, it meant that whatever Alais said, we couldn\u2019t hear it, only her muffled voice. But in the end, it didn\u2019t really matter. When Alais finished, L\u2019Envers wrenched open the door.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>We walked out together. I\u2019d emerged bareheaded; it was close and airless in the storage chamber. Sidonie didn\u2019t push her hood back until we emerged. I heard fourteen voices gasp.</p><p>There was only one face I recognized: Frederic Guillard, a young Azzallese baron who\u2019d spent a summer at Court some years ago. I\u2019d played piquet with him in the Hall of Games. I didn\u2019t know the others. They were peers of the Lesser Houses, man and woman, old and young. It didn\u2019t matter. They were there to represent their folk. They stared at us with wonder and uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cMy lords and ladies,\u201d Sidonie addressed them in a somber tone. \u201cI wish to thank each of you for your courage in defending Terre d\u2019Ange in a time of sorrow. And I wish to apologize for my own role in it.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cYou have heard rumors that there is dire magic behind the madness that grips all who were in the City of Elua on that fateful night. We are here to tell you it is true. And we are here to tell you that it can and will be defeated.\u201d</p><p>I saw the first glimmers of hope in their faces.</p><p>\u201cThe tale is long and time is short,\u201d Sidonie continued. \u201cI will leave the full telling of it to my royal kin. But know this: For months on end, I was in the grip of the same madness. I believed lies. Neither my wits nor my will were wholly my own. And yes, in the grip of this madness, I wed Astegal of Carthage.\u201d She glanced at me, her eyes bright. \u201cBut love, true love, is a persistent and abiding force. Imriel de la Courcel found a way to break the spell and save me.\u201d There was a second collective gasp. Sidonie held out one hand. \u201cIt is a method that will work only if the victim has been removed from D\u2019Angeline soil,\u201d she said gently. \u201cIt will not work on those poor afflicted souls in the City. But there is another method that may succeed and yet avert the shadow of war that hangs over us.\u201d</p><p>They listened hungrily.</p><p>\u201cI will make no false promises,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cThe challenge is a difficult one. Imriel and I will depart immediately for the City. We will do everything in our power to succeed. If we fail, the burden will fall to you\u2014to you and to all the folk of Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d Her voice was strong and steady. \u201cAnd if we do fail, I call upon you to rise up and prevent the slaughter of innocents. To do whatever is necessary. I call for war.\u201d</p><p>There were nods and murmurs, looks of grim determination. As awful a choice as it was, there was a certain relief in hearing it stated aloud.</p><p>\u201cI call upon you to do so knowing that those who can be captured can be saved.\u201d Sidonie gestured, showing her bindings. \u201cThere is magic in Alba that can shield against the effects of this foul spell. One way or another, it will be broken. And know this.\u201d She took another deep breath. \u201cWe go forth in every hope of success. Over the past weeks, I have witnessed great and terrible things. And I bear glad tidings out of them. Carthage\u2019s army has suffered a great defeat.\u201d</p><p>That caught them by surprise; I\u2019d forgotten that they didn\u2019t know. But we were the first bearers of the news, and we\u2019d bade Marc Faucon and his men to stay silent.</p><p>Sidonie smiled grimly. \u201cAstegal of Carthage is dead. Even now . . .\u201d She had to raise her voice to be heard above the rising excitement. \u201cEven now, his head adorns a pike in the Plaza del Rey in Am\u00edlcar! And even as I speak, the bulk of the D\u2019Angeline fleet hurries to Aragonia to honor our alliance and make war on those who sought to divide our fair country against itself!\u201d</p><p>It stirred their blood like strong spirits and brought them to their feet, cheering. And Elua, yes, it gave them hope. A fierce, proud, violent hope, but hope nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cWe go now to the City in an effort to save her!\u201d Sidonie shouted above the noise. \u201cWe ask that your prayers ride with us! We pray to Blessed Elua and his Companions that we may show the world once more that there is no magic so dire that love cannot defeat it!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think anyone heard her final words. It didn\u2019t matter. They surged forward to offer their support and gratitude, weeping and laughing and clamoring. I couldn\u2019t even see Sidonie in the throng that surrounded her, but they acknowledged me, too. I found myself embraced, my cheeks kissed, my hands clasped. It struck me more forcibly than I could have reckoned, and somewhere beneath it, I realized that for the first time in my life, I was being wholeheartedly accepted by my fellow countrymen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought dreadful things of you, Prince Imriel,\u201d a beautiful old L\u2019Agnacite woman whispered to me, tears on her wrinkled cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for them.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed against the lump in my throat. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, my lady. Just lend us your prayers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She pressed my hands between her soft palms. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>At length the crush subsided. Barquiel L\u2019Envers pushed his way through with Alais at his side. \u201cI fear their highnesses must depart,\u201d he announced. \u201cTime is of the essence. But they have endured grave dangers to be here today. Let us take heart from their words and resolve to be no less worthy of Terre d\u2019Ange!\u201d</p><p>The cheer was resounding.</p><p>My heart ached.</p><p>And then it was time for one more damnable leavetaking. This one hurt. Marc Faucon and his men came to fetch us. They had Kratos in tow. I introduced him to Alais and L\u2019Envers, reckoning he deserved no less. They\u2019d heard the tale, they knew his role and treated him with respect. Still, I took a certain pleasure in the bemusement of the watching peers, wondering what in Elua\u2019s name an aging Hellene wrestler with a squashed nose was doing in the midst of everything.</p><p>And it drew out the inevitable a few precious moments longer.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Alais whispered fiercely against my neck when I hugged her. \u201cBe safe. Please be safe. And keep Sidonie safe.\u201d</p><p>I held her hard. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers clasped my hand. \u201cI misjudged you,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI\u2019ll not apologize for it. Blessed Elua knows, your mother was a pox on this land, and you struck fear into our hearts when you turned my sensible grandniece\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>It made me smile. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>L\u2019Envers snorted. \u201cNever thought that you might actually love her.\u201d He watched Sidonie and Alais say their farewells, clutching one another\u2019s hands and speaking in low tones. His face softened. \u201cI suppose I should have. Never approved of Ysandre and Drustan\u2019s union either, but it seems to have produced a remarkable pair of offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cSpeaking of Drustan, I nearly forgot.\u201d L\u2019Envers untied a silk pouch from his belt and handed it to me. \u201cThe token you sent with the Euskerri messenger. It was a gift of the Cruarch, was it not? He\u2019ll expect to see you wearing it in his niece\u2019s memory.\u201d</p><p>I opened the pouch to find the torc that Drustan had given me the day I\u2019d wed Dorelei in Alba. I\u2019d always admired Drustan. I\u2019d been proud to receive it from his hands. What an awful thing it was to contemplate all his quiet strength and dignity twisted awry. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers offered a curt bow. \u201cBlessed Elua hold and keep you. I wish you all the luck in the world.\u201d</p><p>Time to go.</p><p>Again.</p> <p>Sidonie and I raised our hoods and shrouded our faces. We left as we\u2019d come, cloaked and anonymous. I kept my head lowered, watching the foot-worn granite blocks as I passed. I felt fresh air on my face, damp with spring\u2019s promise. I climbed into the carriage, sliding across the horsehair seats. Sidonie joined me. I felt the carriage dip as Kratos took up his post alongside the driver. Someone drew the curtains. I pushed back my hood. Beside me, Sidonie did the same.</p><p>A whip cracked; a voice issued a command.</p><p>The carriage lurched forward.</p><p>Gods, I was tired. I hadn\u2019t reckoned how much so until I took my place in the carriage. I hadn\u2019t slept and I could feel the weight of all that hope riding on my shoulders. And if I was feeling it, I knew Sidonie was feeling it more. I slid my arm around her and she nestled close against me.</p><p>\u201cYou were magnificent,\u201d I murmured against her hair.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of what we\u2019ll find in the City. I\u2019m afraid of facing it, Imriel. And I\u2019m afraid of failing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I drew her closer. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Sidonie lifted her head and gazed at me, yearning for reassurance.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThey didn\u2019t. You did what you promised. You gave them hope.\u201d</p><p>We paused at the gates of Turnone, and then the carriage nosed steeply downward. The horses plodded steadily, the carriage creaking and groaning. Sidonie yawned and settled her head on my shoulder. I held her, reveling in her warm presence, feeling the undercurrent of exhaustion tugging at the both of us.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d I whispered. \u201cSleep, love.\u201d</p> <p>She did.</p><p>So did I.</p><p>Seventy-Two</p><p>The farther we went toward the City of Elua, the more Sidonie\u2019s bindings troubled her. She didn\u2019t complain, but she answered honestly when I asked. She said it felt as though her wrists and ankles were twined with stinging nettles.</p><p>It worried me.</p><p>It worried me a lot.</p><p>\u201cI can bear it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThe itching\u2019s worse than the pain, and it\u2019s actually starting to hurt more than it itches. It\u2019s an improvement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about your ability to endure pain, love,\u201d I said. \u201cI carved a chunk of flesh out of your back on your orders. But what if Bodeshmun\u2019s spell overwhelms the charm when we reach the City?\u201d</p> <p>Sidonie looked away. \u201cWe can\u2019t let ourselves think thusly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to!\u201d I raised my voice. \u201cSidonie, if you fall prey to Bodeshmun\u2019s spell in the City of Elua, I\u2019m not going to be able to wrestle you kicking and screaming back across the sea. I\u2019m going to be surrounded by folk in the grip of the same cursed spell, and they\u2019re not going to allow mad Prince Imriel to lay violent hands on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou needn\u2019t shout.\u201d</p><p>I forced myself to speak calmly. \u201cI think we should discuss the possibility of your staying out of the City. You could go to Am\u00edlcar or Alba. Anywhere far, far from that cursed demon-stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how is mad Prince Imriel going to convince everyone in the City to search for that cursed demon-stone?\u201d Sidonie looked back at me. \u201cYou need me. We have to take the chance.\u201d She paused, frowning. \u201cImriel, if anyone should stay outside the City, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if the spell does reassert itself?\u201d She searched my face. \u201cWill it wipe away my memories of these past months? Or will it merely twist them? Will it have me believing that you ensorceled me against my will? That you conspired with your mother and Ptolemy Solon to work some dark charm to seduce me, to abduct me, to persuade me to help you kill my own beloved husband? What happens to you if I denounce you before the entire City?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cAh, gods. I hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry about me, and I worry about you,\u201d Sidonie said softly. \u201cAnd between the two of us, you\u2019ll be in worse danger, mad Prince Imriel. Can I persuade you to stay safely away?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d She touched my cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if there are further changes in the bindings. And of a surety, I\u2019ll warn you if I feel my wits are about to crumble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have the chance,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I pray I do,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cIn the meanwhile, let me bear the pain without fretting over what it might betoken, because there\u2019s naught either of us can do about it. Not if we stand a chance of averting this war. And you know damnably well both of us will take any risk to make that happen, no matter how long the odds.\u201d Unexpectedly, she summoned a hint of a smile. \u201cI\u2019m trying to imagine that it\u2019s a pain associated with somewhat far more pleasant. Somewhat involving you and tightly knotted ropes. It helps, actually.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cOh, indeed?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glimmered. \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>Gods, I wished there was time. I wished we could halt the world for a day and banish all that surrounded us. The looming war. The jolting carriage, the jogging guards surrounding it, Kratos sitting alongside the driver, singing tunelessly in Hellene.</p><p>A day, one day . . .</p><p>We didn\u2019t have a day. Not even an hour. Only duty and hope and the desperate prayers of a nation. There on the stiff horsehide cushions, I settled for pulling Sidonie against me, kissing her until I felt her soft lips part, her body yielding sweetly, arms around my neck.</p><p>\u201cWe will prove it,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThere is no magic so dire.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie kissed me again. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>I found myself thinking about the day when everything had changed between us: the day of the hunt when a boar had gored Alais\u2019 dog and Sidonie\u2019s horse had bolted and thrown her. I\u2019d flung myself atop Sidonie, thinking to protect her. As it happened, my effort was unnecessary; but in that moment, a spark had been ignited. I could still remember the thrilling shock of it. The feeling of her body beneath mine, the sight of realization dawning in her dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the hunt?\u201d I asked, not bothering to explain.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOh, yes. You know I do. Gods, I thought about it for days and days. \u2019Tis no wonder that when Leander Maignard saved my life in the garden, I felt so strongly for him. For you.\u201d She was silent a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s so very peculiar the way the events in our lives cast reflections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought it since Cythera. Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin went on a quest to find the Name of God and bind an angel. You and I seek to free a demon with a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we succeed, Terre d\u2019Ange will be indebted to Melisande Shahrizai,\u201d Sidonie added. \u201cIt feels as though we\u2019ve been on a long, strange journey to bring the circle around to a full close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother persuaded Ptolemy Solon to aid me for her own reasons,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t erase the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it changes the future,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cIf we do come out this whole, I don\u2019t think anyone will ever ever dare question your integrity again.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cAnd our horde won\u2019t have to grow up knowing their father was responsible for having his own mother executed. Elua help me, but I\u2019m glad of that.\u201d</p><p>I thought about my last glimpse of Melisande: standing at Ptolemy Solon\u2019s side on the docks of Paphos as she watched me sail away into danger, believing myself to be Leander Maignard. About her parting words. Be safe. Just be safe. Almost the same words Alais had spoken. There had been genuine love in them. Whatever else was true of her, I didn\u2019t doubt that my mother loved me.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Sidonie cocked her head. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet her someday.\u201d</p><p>I tried to envision it and couldn\u2019t. My cool, regal beloved with her startling streak of hidden fire; my damnable mother and the deep, ineffable spell she cast. \u201cI suppose anything is possible.\u201d</p><p>The doubt in my voice made her laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>At night we made camp in isolated areas as we\u2019d done on the journey to Turnone. We talked strategy with Kratos, explaining the situation in the City of Elua to him in detail. Kratos listened and nodded sagely.</p><p>\u201cSo all in the City believe you mad, my lord?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I stared at the campfire. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Until we\u2019d caught sight of the shores of Terre d\u2019Ange, I\u2019d avoided thinking about it; but the nearer we drew to the City, the more it preyed on my mind. I still bore traces of scarring on my wrists and ankles where I\u2019d chafed my flesh raw against my restraints, screaming horrible threats at those I loved and plotting their deaths. Scars. An echo of the bindings I\u2019d once worn to protect me against Morwen\u2019s talisman, an echo of the increasingly painful bindings that protected Sidonie against Bodeshmun\u2019s spell. And that in itself was an echo of the ropes I\u2019d knotted around Sidonie\u2019s willing wrists more than once, the memory of pleasure that helped her endure the pain.</p><p>The bright mirror and the dark.</p><p>The things I\u2019d said in my madness . . . ah, Elua!</p><p>\u201cKratos.\u201d Sidonie touched his thick forearm. \u201cNo one in the City knows you. \u2019Tis my thought to tell them that you were my lord Astegal\u2019s most loyal bodyguard, the cherished comrade of his boyhood. That he trusted you with my safety, and that you have repaid it a thousandfold. That I now trust you with my poor deluded kinsman\u2019s care. Are you up to the task of playing this role?\u201d</p><p>Kratos bent his head toward her. The firelight danced over his blunt features, his bristling hair. \u201cI will arise to any challenge her highness sets me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t deserve you, Kratos,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>He turned his hard, shrewd gaze on me. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, my lord. I was plucked from a slave-market by a foppish young D\u2019Angeline to serve as his bearer. I saw something in him worthy of serving. When I spoke, he listened. You listened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeander listened,\u201d I said. \u201cBy the time I knew myself, I\u2019d already seen the measure of your worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well.\u201d Kratos glanced back at Sidonie. \u201cI suspect there was a fair bit of you in there all along, my lord.\u201d</p><p>On the third day, we reached the outskirts of Yvens, an unassuming little village on the Aviline known for its olives. As before, Sidonie and I waited while Marc Faucon and a couple of his men rode ahead to secure the way.</p><p>It was a lovely spring day, clear and almost balmy. We waited alongside an olive grove. They were venerable old trees with gnarled trunks. The afternoon sun slanted through their leaves, through the clusters of delicate white flowers blooming on their branches. Sidonie and I walked in the grove while Kratos and Faucon\u2019s men kept watch.</p><p>\u201cIt seems impossible to think of war on such a day,\u201d Sidonie said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I laid my hand on a sun-warmed trunk, thinking about the night years ago when I\u2019d stood atop the walls of Lucca with Deccus Fulvius, watching the ancient olive groves outside the city go up in flames. \u201cBut even without magic\u2019s urging, men will make war despite all the beauty in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a child, one of my favorite stories was hearing how my mother averted a civil war in Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d She glanced unerringly toward the north. \u201cHow she refused when Lord Amaury begged her to raise an army in Caerdicca Unitas and rode toward the City with only a small escort, throwing coins to the folk along the way that they might know her face, that they might know their Queen had returned, alive and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a throng of people trailed after her,\u201d I said softly. \u201cFarmers and weavers, beekeepers and chandlers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd children.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice broke on the word.</p><p>\u201cAnd children,\u201d I echoed. \u201cAnd when they reached the City of Elua, they never halted. Arrows rained down upon them, and they answered with showers of coin. Ysandre de la Courcel rode forward, flanked only by the ranks of the Unforgiven. The rebel soldiers gazed at the coins in their hands and wept, knowing they\u2019d been fed a lie. They laid down their arms and knelt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie wiped her eyes.</p><p>I was quiet. I knew the tale well; indeed, the coins had been Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s idea. But it was different for Sidonie. Ysandre was her mother as well as the Queen. If Terre d\u2019Ange went to war, it would be on her order. To have that great legacy of courage and valor lost forever was an ache too deep for words.</p><p>And Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin . . .</p><p>That, I couldn\u2019t bear to think.</p><p>\u201cThey averted a war and restored peace,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will do the same. We\u2019ll bring the circle around to a full close. We won\u2019t fail them, Sidonie.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, only nodded.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Marc Faucon returned with word. Gilbert Dumel had received L\u2019Envers\u2019 message and he was prepared to ferry us into the City, but he advised that we wait until nightfall to enter Yvens. And so once more, we waited. Faucon\u2019s men had brought savory meat pies, fresh bread, and goat cheese back with them from the village, but the thought of food made my stomach churn.</p><p>Come nightfall, we entered the village.</p><p>It had the same eerie quietude as Turnone and every other town we\u2019d passed through on our journey. Through a gap in the curtains, I could see that lamplight glowed in the windows of the houses, but the streets were empty. We passed Yvens\u2019 single inn and it appeared almost empty. On a pleasant spring evening like this, the village should have been alive with music, young lovers turning out in droves to court one another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cElua!\u201d Sidonie whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s like the realm\u2019s already in mourning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear it is,\u201d I said soberly.</p><p>The barge was waiting at the wharf. I remembered its captain, Gilbert: a taciturn fellow who\u2019d given me a wide berth when he\u2019d brought me to Marsilikos, the tales of my raving madness fresh in his mind. I must have looked godawful, worn to bone and sinew from a month of deprivation, my wrists scabbed. Now he gazed at our hooded figures in wonderment as we boarded the barge. Once he\u2019d escorted us to a cabin, he asked the question it seemed nearly everyone did. \u201cIs it true?\u201d</p> <p>Gods, there was so much pain in the question. He didn\u2019t gasp when we shed our hoods, but tears glittered in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Sidonie said to him. \u201cWe\u2019re here to try to undo the madness.\u201d</p><p>Gilbert Dumel was a man of few words; he went to one knee and bowed his head, then left us.</p><p>My injured leg was aching. I sat on the narrow bunk. Sidonie stood in the cabin. Both of us listened to the sounds of the barge making ready to depart. Kratos\u2019 heavy tread, other footsteps. Faucon and six of his men would accompany us to the City of Elua, posing as barge-hands. If there was any news to impart, good or ill, they would serve as couriers. We listened to the soft calls of the real barge-hands, Gilbert\u2019s terse orders.</p><p>And then there was the sound of oars dipping. The barge slid slowly into the darkened river.</p> <p>\u201cHow long do you suppose?\u201d Sidonie murmured.</p><p>\u201cAbout a day and a half,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re like to reach the City on the morning after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>A single lantern hung from a hook in the cabin\u2019s ceiling, swaying gently. \u201cImriel.\u201d Sidonie gazed at me. \u201cWill you forgive me in advance for all that I might have to say or do to convince them of our tale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed you ask?\u201d I said.</p><p>She smiled sadly. \u201cFor my sake, yes. I fear Alais and my uncle are right. This is going to be harder than either of us imagine. And I fear . . .\u201d She laughed, but it was a tired, broken sound. \u201cI fear I\u2019ll have to find a new way of thinking about the pain of these damned bindings. Once we\u2019re in the City, I don\u2019t think I can allow myself the risk of thinking about you as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot while playing the grieving widow,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Sidonie nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll need to pull away from you. Elua knows, I don\u2019t want to. I need you beside me now more than I ever did. But I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do this if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d I reached out and she came over to take my hand. \u201cAnd yes, I forgive you in advance for aught you might have to say or do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d I squeezed her hand. \u201cDo you need me to leave you alone tonight? I can sleep in the bunks below.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet, please.\u201d Sidonie shivered. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, tonight I\u2019d like you to hold me and tell me for the hundredth time that we will succeed, because the closer we get, the more frightened I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will,\u201d I said.</p><p>And so I did, over and over, while the barge glided through darkness, bearing us toward the City of Elua and our fears. I spun a tale of gladness and joy and made promises there was no way I could possibly keep. It didn\u2019t matter. If we failed, no one in the world would care that for once I hadn\u2019t kept my promise. And Sidonie knew my promises for lies, but the words comforted her nonetheless.</p><p>At length, she slept.</p> <p>I lay awake and prayed to Blessed Elua and his Companions to grant mercy to their children and turn my lies to truth.</p><p>Seventy-Three</p><p>The next day, Sidonie withdrew from everyone, spending long hours in the prow of the barge, cloaked and hooded, kneeling in a private vigil.</p><p>\u201cIs her highness wroth?\u201d Marc Faucon asked me with concern.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cOnly preparing for what lies ahead. Leave her be.\u201d</p><p>I passed the day helping Kratos acquire a few more words of D\u2019Angeline. All along the banks of the Aviline, there were signs of spring\u2019s return: trees bursting into green-leafed glory, flowers blooming. Any other time the sight would have gladdened my heart, but it didn\u2019t. Last night\u2019s false promises tasted like ashes in my mouth. I was frightened, too. Elua knows, I\u2019d known fear before, but not the kind of fear that accompanied having the fates of so many people I loved riding on my shoulders.</p><p>And my role was easier than Sidonie\u2019s. She had to convince the entire City she was mourning a man who had violated her very will, had to convince them to believe an intricate web of lies and truth. All I had to do was let them go on believing I was disordered in my wits. We\u2019d considered telling them I\u2019d been cured in Carthage, but that raised in turn the problem of explaining why the rest of the realm couldn\u2019t be cured of their own apparent madness. In the end we had decided that the simplest, safest course was to let them continue believing as they did.</p><p>When the sun was sinking low on the horizon, Sidonie rose. She paused briefly to address us. \u201cI\u2019ll be retiring for the night. Kratos, would you be kind enough to bring me something to eat?\u201d</p><p>He rose. \u201cAt once, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shifted to meet mine. She gave me a quick, sad smile that broke my heart. \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the morrow,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>That night I made my bed belowdeck on a narrow bunk, surrounded by the snores and wheezes of men deep in slumber. And if I\u2019d let myself, I could have lain awake all night in futile thought or desperate prayer, but there was no merit in it. My thoughts would only turn in helpless circles, and if Blessed Elua hadn\u2019t heard our prayers by now, he never would. So instead, like a soldier preparing for battle, I forced myself to sleep.</p><p>By the time I rose and made myself break my fast, the City was in sight.</p><p>Like spring, the sight of those white walls shining in the distance had always been cause for gladness. Not today. I remembered all too well watching them recede as this very barge had carried me away. It had been summer then. Three seasons had passed since I\u2019d left. The spell that gripped the City was malevolent at its core.</p><p>How much worse had it gotten?</p><p>Some distance from the City, Gilbert Dumel ordered his oarsmen to cease progress. We waited until Sidonie emerged into the sunlight. She looked pale and hollow-eyed. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d slept like a soldier. She gazed toward the City, expressionless.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll not be able to enter unchallenged, your highness,\u201d Gilbert informed her. \u201cThey\u2019ll raise the chain and insist on searching the barge before we\u2019re allowed to enter the harbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to them,\u201d Sidonie said.</p><p>Gilbert gave a curt nod. \u201cWe\u2019ll take our lead from you, highness.\u201d</p><p>The oarsmen resumed their stroke. Before long, we could see that the massive chain used to protect the harbor from invasion was already raised. A swift, sleek galley with a ballista mounted on its prow hailed us.</p><p>\u201cState your business!\u201d came the shout.</p><p>Sidonie was silent.</p><p>We followed her lead.</p><p>The galley bore down on us fast. As it drew nigh, I saw there were additional ballistae mounted on the sides and aft. Every one was manned, and there was a sizable contingent of armed men aboard, a thicket of crossbows pointing at us.</p><p>\u201cHalt the barge,\u201d Sidonie said quietly. Gilbert gave the order. As we drifted slowly to a halt, the galley turned broadside to us.</p><p>\u201cState your business,\u201d the galley\u2019s captain repeated. He had a hard face. They all had hard faces. Sidonie stood in the prow without moving, Kratos and I a few paces behind. Although the captain didn\u2019t notice me, I watched his face as he recognized her. It only got more grim. \u201cYour highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy business is the business of Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d There was a raw edge to Sidonie\u2019s voice, but it held a note of command, too. \u201cAnd I will state it only to her majesty the Queen.\u201d</p><p>The captain gestured and his men lowered their crossbows. \u201cYou bring tidings out of Carthage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bring tidings of woe,\u201d Sidonie said, low and savage. \u201cTidings of death and defeat and bitter betrayal. But I will not deliver them to you, messire. Lower the chain and let us pass, or you may go join my sister and her rebel army.\u201d</p><p>If the captain harbored any doubts, those words erased them\u2014that, and the unfeigned emotion behind them. She didn\u2019t have to pretend. All of the very real grief and fury at what had befallen Terre d\u2019Ange was there.</p><p>\u201cLower the chain!\u201d the captain shouted. \u201cSend to the Palace! Tell them the Dauphine has returned! Now!\u201d</p><p>Unseen gears ground somewhere ashore. The mammoth chain sank beneath the waters. Our would-be adversary became our escort as the galley swung back around to precede us into the harbor. As our progress resumed, Sidonie stood motionless, her black cloak hanging in folds around her. The garment that had served as a tool of concealment now appeared a badge of mourning.</p><p>Our oarsmen bent their backs. The barge slid past the white walls.</p><p>We entered the City of Elua.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t sense any immediate change, but I saw Sidonie\u2019s shoulders tighten and I knew the pain had gotten worse. I prayed that was all it was. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked under my breath.</p><p>She nodded without turning. \u201cThus far.\u201d</p><p>Gods, it was hard not to go to her, to offer the simple comfort of my presence. To share the burden. But I couldn\u2019t, or at least Sidonie couldn\u2019t accept it if I did. Not with the eyes of the City watching.</p><p>So I didn\u2019t.</p><p>The response to the galley captain\u2019s order had been swift. By the time we were docked at the wharf, there was a royal escort awaiting us: a company of soldiers led by Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion himself. His broad, good-natured face was set in harsh lines. And unlike the galley captain, Ghislain noticed me immediately as we disembarked, his eyes widening in shock. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave no fear, my lord,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cHe\u2019s no danger.\u201d</p><p>Ghislain\u2019s face darkened, but he proffered a bow. \u201cWe will see, your highness. I would welcome you home, but I fear your return portends ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She met his gaze squarely. \u201cI need to speak to my mother. Immediately. Is my father in residence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSo much the better. Take me to them, please.\u201d</p><p>There was a carriage with the insignia of House Courcel waiting. When I made to follow Sidonie into it, Ghislain caught my arm. \u201cI think it best if you ride, Prince Imriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord Ghislain!\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice was sharp. \u201cI tell you, it\u2019s fine. Imriel labors under the delusion that he\u2019s enamored of me. It is inconvenient, but he poses no threat.\u201d She pointed to Kratos. \u201cAnd Kratos here is . . . was . . . my lord Astegal\u2019s most trusted and loyal bodyguard. No harm will come to me while he is present.\u201d</p><p>Kratos folded his arms and looked impassive.</p><p>Ghislain hesitated, then shrugged. \u201cAs you will.\u201d</p><p>Inside the carriage, we sat in silence for most of the ride. Unlike the rest of Terre d\u2019Ange, the City of Elua was abuzz. People thronged the streets, staring as our entourage passed. But there were no greetings shouted, only a rising tide of speculation. It held an edge of anger that made my skin prickle.</p><p>\u201cFeels like a hornets\u2019 nest,\u201d Kratos muttered. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how I imagined one of the great cities of Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not how it is.\u201d Sidonie glanced at him, pain in her eyes. \u201cAll that you will see and hear in these days . . . it\u2019s a lie, a foul lie wrought by Bodeshmun\u2019s magic. I beg you to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>And then there was no more time for talk. We clattered into the courtyard of the Palace. There were more guards on duty than I ever remembered seeing, and the ostlers who came to attend to mounts and carriage-horses worked with martial efficiency.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Ghislain snapped his fingers and his men formed a cordon around us, ushering us into the Palace.</p><p>It was another moment come around full circle. Members of the Court turned out to stare, wondering at Sidonie\u2019s unexpected return, wondering at my unexpected presence. There were hard-eyed guards posted everywhere. When we passed the Hall of Games, there was a scuffle taking place. A woman\u2019s voice rose to a shriek, haranguing some unseen companion with accusations of cheating. It should have been a shocking breach of decorum, but no one batted an eye.</p><p>Sidonie was right.</p><p>This was not our City.</p><p>We halted outside the door of one of Ysandre\u2019s private salons while Ghislain exchanged a word with the guards. I watched Sidonie\u2019s shoulders rise and fall as she took a deep breath, bracing herself. Kratos placed himself at her side, unbidden. She gave him a look of gratitude. Good. That was all right. No one had cause to believe he was aught but Astegal\u2019s loyal man. He could lend her the support I couldn\u2019t, and no one would think twice at it.</p><p>The door was opened.</p><p>We were ushered into the salon.</p><p>Ysandre and Drustan were awaiting us. They stood side by side: the Queen of Terre d\u2019Ange and the Cruarch of Alba, united. I saw Ysandre take in my presence, and I saw suspicion dawn on her features. Drustan\u2019s expression was unreadable behind his woad tattoos. Ghislain and a dozen of his men remained as the door was closed behind us.</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d Ysandre uttered her daughter\u2019s name without a trace of warmth. Drustan said nothing, only watched his eldest, the black eyes she\u2019d inherited hard and appraising. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour majesties.\u201d Sidonie curtsied deeply and held it. She spoke without lifting her head. \u201cMy husband Astegal, Prince of the House of Sarkal, General of Carthage, is dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As before, there was a world of grief behind the words, not for Astegal, but for the City of Elua, for her mother and father, and all who dwelled in the City. It didn\u2019t matter. It was real. It sufficed.</p><p>Ysandre paled. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie straightened. \u201cIt was the Euskerri. Serafin L\u2019Envers y Aragon made a treaty with them. Together they defeated Astegal\u2019s army outside Am\u00edlcar. Astegal . . .\u201d She paused. \u201cI am told . . . I am told he was captured and executed. He had left orders for me to flee for my own safety. And there is more\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHouse L\u2019Envers!\u201d Ysandre hissed the word, nails digging into her own forearms. \u201cI should have known it. This conspiracy grows vaster by the day. I swear to Blessed Elua, I could claw that cursed blood from my own veins if I could!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold.\u201d Drustan lifted one hand. \u201cYou said there was more,\u201d he said to Sidonie. \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ray of hope.\u201d She gazed at her father. \u201cOne last gift of my lord\u2019s kinsman Bodeshmun. It is why I was sent swiftly and in secret.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre and Drustan exchanged a glance. \u201cThen let us hear this tale in its entirety,\u201d Ysandre said. She pointed at me. \u201cAnd you may begin with how and why Melisande Shahrizai\u2019s oft-vanished son comes to reappear in your company.\u201d</p><p>There were nods and mutters of agreement among Ghislain\u2019s men.</p> <p>Sidonie inclined her head and began to speak.</p><p>In the end, I daresay it was Barquiel L\u2019Envers\u2019 long-standing and well-known dislike of me that sold my end of the tale. They knew he\u2019d helped me get out of the City. When Sidonie stated her belief that he\u2019d done it to get me out of the way for good, it struck a chord. We already knew Joscelin believed it to be true.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt Uncle Barquiel believed Astegal would be swift to dispatch Imriel when he showed up in Carthage with this mad fantasy of rescuing me.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice softened. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t know my husband. Astegal took pity on Imriel and had his physicians treat him as best they could. He was kind that way. He had a generous, noble heart.\u201d</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>I swallowed my bile and tried to look humble.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you believe now, Imriel de la Courcel?\u201d Drustan asked in an implacable tone.</p> <p>I spread my hands. \u201cI believe whatever Sidonie tells me. I know there are thoughts in my head that are wrong. I know Sidonie doesn\u2019t love me. I saw that in Carthage. But I believe whatever she tells me, and I would never do anything to harm her or any of you. I just don\u2019t want to be sent away again.\u201d</p><p>I sounded like a simpleton to my own ears, but they seemed willing to accept it.</p><p>\u201cThis is Kratos.\u201d Sidonie switched to Hellene, laying a hand on Kratos\u2019 arm. \u201cHe was my lord\u2019s most trusted bodyguard, the companion of his childhood. At Astegal\u2019s command, he has seen me safe these long weeks. Now that we are here, he has agreed to keep watch over poor Imriel.\u201d</p><p>Kratos bowed.</p><p>Ysandre eyed him coolly and spoke in fluent Hellene. \u201cI do not recall seeing this man when General Astegal\u2019s delegation was here, and he has a rather memorable face.\u201d</p><p>Beads of sweat broke out on my brow. It wasn\u2019t a challenge any of us had anticipated. Gods, this was hard! They might have been in the grip of madness and paranoia and easily misled in some ways, but neither Drustan nor Ysandre had lost their faculties.</p><p>\u201cNo, your majesty.\u201d Kratos offered another bow. \u201cI was a wedding gift.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cA wedding gift?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy service was to the greater House of Sarkal.\u201d Kratos pressed a fist to his chest. \u201cMy lord Astegal\u2019s mother released me into the service of her son\u2019s household that he might have one retainer he trusted beyond all doubt to watch over that which was most precious to him.\u201d</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t known better, I would have believed he spoke with absolute sincerity and conviction. Ysandre relaxed, and I thanked the gods for Kratos and his quick wits.</p><p>\u201cAnd a wise woman my lord\u2019s mother proved to be,\u201d Sidonie murmured in D\u2019Angeline. \u201cFor in the end, the House of Sarkal was betrayed.\u201d</p><p>Although the rest of the tale was almost entirely a skein of lies, Sidonie spun it artfully, telling them how when word of Astegal\u2019s death reached New Carthage, the city devolved into bitter factions grasping for power. That was a familiar notion that fell on willing ears. She told them that on Astegal\u2019s orders, she was to flee with his kinsman Bodeshmun back to Carthage proper; but before it could be arranged, Bodeshmun was slain by the treachery of Gillimas of Hiram, who bribed the Amazigh guards. He\u2019d told her of the protective gem, bade her to flee to the City of Elua instead of Carthage, to find the gem and renew its charm.</p><p>Sidonie had witnessed violent death since she\u2019d left her parents\u2019 side. Her description of Bodeshmun\u2019s end, his gasped words and dying rattle, rang horribly true. And through it all ran that raw thread of genuine anguish, giving the weight of truth to her lies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my dear,\u201d Ysandre said when Sidonie finished. The unexpected gentleness in her voice brought a lump to my throat. Ysandre glanced at Drustan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to doubt you. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sidonie shivered. \u201cAlais.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard?\u201d Drustan asked gravely.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut why? Why would she do it? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one does. There are theories. But we\u2019ll talk about that on the morrow. You should rest. You must be weary to the bone and grief-stricken atop it.\u201d Ysandre rested her hands on her daughter\u2019s shoulders and gazed into her eyes. \u201cSidonie, I am so very, very sorry about Astegal\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The words were choked. I had to look away as Ysandre enfolded her in a comforting embrace. I couldn\u2019t bear to see Sidonie cling to what was left of her mother\u2019s goodness.</p><p>Drustan, too, embraced his daughter. \u201cThis gem,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you truly think it might help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Sidonie dashed the tears from her eyes. \u201cYou saw . . . we all saw what marvels Bodeshmun and his horologists were capable of achieving. I think he may have seen that the City of Elua would be in dire need of protection. I think it\u2019s terribly important that we find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll do so.\u201d Drustan held her hands. He glanced downward and frowned. \u201cWhy are you wearing an ollamh\u2019s charms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo keep her safe,\u201d I put in quickly and anxiously. \u201cIt was my idea.\u201d</p><p>This question, we had anticipated.</p><p>Sidonie glanced over her shoulder at me. \u201cI fear Imriel remembers,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAlban magic, my cousin Dorelei\u2019s death. It\u2019s all mixed up in his thoughts. He\u2019s afraid. Afraid that\u2019s what\u2019s behind Alais\u2019 and Talorcan\u2019s rebellion. He thinks this will help keep me safe from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d Drustan said shortly. \u201cIt\u2019s ambition, not magic, at stake here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sidonie smiled through tears at her father. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind and it brings him peace. Can we not let it be and concentrate on finding Bodeshmun\u2019s charm? For that I truly believe might prove effective.\u201d</p><p>Drustan released her hands. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Ysandre echoed.</p><p>There was a discreet knock at the door. Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion went to answer it. He returned, inclining his head. \u201cYour majesties,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Comtesse Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay de Montr\u00e8ve and her consort Joscelin Verreuil wish to see their foster-son. They have received word of his return.\u201d</p><p>My heart raced.</p><p>\u201cAdmit them,\u201d Ysandre said.</p><p>Seventy-Four</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t had time to brace myself. Not against this. The sight of them was like a spear to the gut.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre breathed my name and my arms opened. She walked into them and I embraced her, willing myself to forget the vile things I\u2019d said in my madness, wanting to believe for a few heartbeats that everything was well.</p><p>\u201cDid he harm you?\u201d Joscelin demanded. \u201cDid he harm you? Because I swear to Elua, I will butcher him if he did!\u201d</p><p>He meant L\u2019Envers. \u201cNo.\u201d I released Ph\u00e8dre. \u201cNo, no one harmed me. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t think straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill?\u201d Ph\u00e8dre whispered.</p><p>I glanced at Sidonie and nodded. \u201cStill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I heard you\u2019d returned, I hoped . . .\u201d Ph\u00e8dre gathered herself and turned to Drustan and Ysandre. \u201cForgive us, your majesties,\u201d she said in a formal tone. \u201cI apologize for the impropriety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop,\u201d Ysandre said irritably. \u201cYou know damnably well you don\u2019t need to stand on protocol. These are dire times and Sidonie brings dire tidings. Astegal of Carthage is dead and his army has suffered a great defeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName of Elua!\u201d Ph\u00e8dre gasped. \u201cOh, you poor child,\u201d she said to Sidonie. \u201cI\u2019m so terribly sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie looked near tears again. \u201cThank you, my lady,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bring such awful news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in Carthage?\u201d Joscelin asked me in bewilderment. I nodded. His right hand closed on my elbow, hard enough to hurt. He shook me roughly. \u201cWhy? Why did you flee? How could you do that to us? Do you have any idea how worried we were?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake him home,\u201d Drustan said brusquely. \u201cWe\u2019ll hold a conference on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flew open. \u201cNo! I need to be near Sidonie.\u201d I wasn\u2019t playing a role; I was terrified that her bindings would break or fail. I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if they did, but I knew I had to be there.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you do,\u201d Ysandre muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Sidonie said quietly. \u201cIt soothes his mind to know I\u2019m close at hand. Imriel, go with your foster-parents, at least for the night. You can return in the morning.\u201d She touched the croonie-stone at her throat, her eyes eloquent. \u201cKratos will stay with me to make sure I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, misliking it.</p><p>\u201cImriel!\u201d Ph\u00e8dre gazed at me with reproach. \u201cAfter all that we\u2019ve done for you, after all that you\u2019ve put us through, how could you possibly begrudge us a single night?\u201d</p><p>It was true, of course; but in all the years I\u2019d known them, they\u2019d never once thrown it in my face. It wasn\u2019t like Ph\u00e8dre to do it now, believing me to be in the grip of madness as she did. As unkindness went, it was surpassing mild; still, it made me heartsick.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>And so I went with them, willing myself to be calm and docile. The truth was, there wasn\u2019t anything I could do if Sidonie\u2019s bindings failed and there was a chance that she\u2019d turn on me if they did whether I was present or not. I felt frustrated and helpless. Mayhap she was right and I should have stayed out of the City, but it would have killed me to send her here alone with only Kratos to aid her. Quick-witted and loyal as he was, he barely spoke D\u2019Angeline.</p><p>Above everything, there hovered the pervasive sense that she needed me, that I needed to be here. It was the same sense Sidonie had felt on the ship. Blessed Elua had joined us for a purpose. If there was aught we could do, it would require us both.</p><p>Once I\u2019d willed myself to docility and we\u2019d entered Montr\u00e8ve\u2019s carriage, Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin seemed more themselves. Almost.</p><p>\u201cSo how was Carthage, love?\u201d Ph\u00e8dre asked gently, as though I were ten years old and I\u2019d gone on a pleasure-jaunt.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I forced a smile. \u201cThey were very kind to me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you . . .\u201d She hesitated. \u201cDid Prince Astegal\u2019s chirurgeons examine you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d I leaned my head back against the cushions. \u201cThey were able to help a little. They explained matters in a way I could understand. I know I\u2019m not right in my wits. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Imri.\u201d Joscelin exchanged a glance with Ph\u00e8dre. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of you. We\u2019ll always take care of you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes stung. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s townhouse in the City had always been a place of warmth and joy. Every time I\u2019d returned to it, I\u2019d been received with open arms and tears of happiness. Not this time. Our driver had to give a password before the gate was opened. In the narrow courtyard, Montr\u00e8ve\u2019s men-at-arms were arrayed to meet us, hands hovering over sword-hilts.</p><p>\u201cIs all well?\u201d Ti-Philippe called in a hard voice.</p><p>\u201cAs well as it gets,\u201d Joscelin affirmed. \u201cBad news from afar.\u201d</p><p>We descended from the carriage. There was no Eug\u00e8nie waiting to fold me to her bosom and accuse me of being heartless, no joyous reunion. Only hard-eyed, watchful men. One of them gave me a terse smile.</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel.\u201d Hugues inclined his head. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see you safe.\u201d</p><p>Hugues, sweet Hugues. He\u2019d always been among my favorite retainers at House Montr\u00e8ve, the strapping shepherd-lad Ti-Philippe had seduced ages ago, long since grown into a beautiful, gentle man with a heart as vast as his shoulders were broad. He\u2019d taught me to wrestle when I was a boy, taught me to wield a quarterstaff as effectively as a shepherd\u2019s crook. When I\u2019d wed Dorelei and gone away to Alba, Hugues had given me his treasured wooden flute as a parting gift. He should have been laughing with joy, concocting more bad poetry to declaim in his lovely voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Hugues,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Another curt nod. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>Inside it was worse. The household staff was quiet and furtive\u2014here, here in Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay\u2019s home, where it wasn\u2019t unknown for a stablehand to dine with the Comtesse of Montr\u00e8ve.</p><p>\u201cWhere . . .\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cWhere\u2019s Eug\u00e8nie?\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre shot me a puzzled look. \u201cIn the kitchen, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>There I found Eug\u00e8nie up to her elbows in flour, kneading dough. She bobbed an awkward curtsy. \u201cPrince Imriel,\u201d she said in a careful tone. \u201cWe had word of your return. I\u2019m making the quince tarts you like so much.\u201d</p><p>I made myself smile at her. \u201cThank you, Eug\u00e8nie.\u201d</p> <p>It was just all so wrong, as though I was caught in a waking dream where no one was quite themselves. I thought I\u2019d be better prepared than Sidonie to deal with it, since I\u2019d already experienced their madness. I was wrong. Matters had worsened, and I wasn\u2019t recovering from my own bout of insanity this time, questioning my own memories. I had to fight the urge to shake them, shout at them to wake up, to come to their senses. Ptolemy Solon had warned me that any attempt to struggle against the spell would cause it to tighten like a snare. I had to keep reminding myself of it.</p><p>It got worse when we dined in the early evening. Shortly after we\u2019d taken our seats at the table, there was a commotion in the courtyard. Joscelin went to attend to it and returned looking somber.</p><p>\u201cQueen\u2019s courier,\u201d he said. \u201cYsandre\u2019s declared a state of mourning. They\u2019re announcing it throughout the City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the City?\u201d Ph\u00e8dre inquired.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d only make a mockery of it outside the City\u2019s walls.\u201d Joscelin frowned. \u201cElua! Would that we knew what Alais and L\u2019Envers did to make them turn against the Crown itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlais.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre shook her head. \u201cI reckon myself a fair judge of character, but I\u2019ll admit, I never expected this of her.\u201d She glanced at me. \u201cYou were always close to her, Imri. Did you suspect she harbored such ambitions?\u201d</p> <p>I cleared my throat. \u201cNot . . . not in Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d I saw Alais\u2019 weary face in my memory, heard her words. I do not, want this responsibility. \u201cI knew she aspired to overturn the law of matrilineal succession in Alba. It surprised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Alais and L\u2019Envers,\u201d Joscelin said grimly. \u201cTalorcan\u2019s backing them, the treacherous bastard. Somehow he\u2019s managed to seize power in Alba. Drustan says he\u2019s got seven hundred men in Turnone. If he sends more, this war\u2019s truly going to be ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust it come to that?\u201d The words were out of my mouth before I could stop them. They both stared at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just . . . if the whole country is against us, do we even stand a chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said firmly. \u201cI have every hope that the support for this rebellion is broad, but not deep. When the commonfolk see the cost of it, I believe they will come to their senses and beg Alais and Barquiel to surrender. And if they do not . . .\u201d Her face took on an expression of stern dignity. \u201cThere are things in this world that are worth fighting and dying for, Imriel. Without respect for the rule of law, we are no better than the most savage of barbarians. What did we stand against Waldemar Selig for if not for this?\u201d</p><p>I bit my tongue and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou of all people should know that, Imriel.\u201d Joscelin sounded disappointed in me. \u201cDo you forget your own history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor boy.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s face softened. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. He\u2019s not himself, Joscelin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI blame those witches of the Maghuin Dhonn.\u201d Joscelin\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cHe\u2019s not been right since they sank their hooks into him. And Alais . . . I fear they got to her somehow. You recall, she seemed passing fond of that youngest son of the Lady of the Dalriada, the Maghuin Dhonn harpist\u2019s get.\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre shivered. \u201cAnd through her to Talorcan.\u201d</p><p>Joscelin nodded. \u201cI fear as much.\u201d</p><p>The damnable thing was that they made it almost seem plausible. We\u2019d come up with a similar tale ourselves. I licked my dry lips. \u201cI thought so, too. I gave Sidonie the croonie-stone that the ollamh gave me to protect her. I tried to copy the charm he wrought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, love!\u201d Ph\u00e8dre gave me a sorrowful smile. \u201cYour heart\u2019s in the right place, no matter how misguided the object of its affection. It gives me hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is one hope.\u201d I told them about Bodeshmun\u2019s gem and his death-bed charge to Sidonie.</p><p>Joscelin\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cDo you really think it holds the power to protect the City?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said, meaning it.</p><p>\u201cI remember seeing it.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre gestured at her throat. \u201cThe Chief Horologist wore it on a chain around his neck. Every facet was inscribed. And there\u2019s no denying that he was a man of surpassing gifts. The marvels he showed us . . .\u201d She smiled at me, this time with gladness. \u201cThat is a piece of hope, love. Whatever happens outside these walls, if the City of Elua can hold, the heart of Terre d\u2019Ange lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor no one, man, woman, nor child, may be rightfully crowned sovereign of Terre d\u2019Ange anywhere but here,\u201d Joscelin said.</p><p>\u201cNowhere,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre agreed.</p><p>They exchanged glances, remembering. I could guess at their memories. Ysandre de la Courcel riding fearlessly toward the City amidst a shower of silver coins, each one bearing her likeness. They believed they were fighting to preserve her legacy, their legacy.</p><p>And they were so very, very wrong.</p><p>Seventy-Five</p><p>I endured the night.</p><p>It felt terribly strange to sleep beneath the low roof of my boyhood bedchamber. I\u2019d not slept there for years. I\u2019d outgrown it in ways I couldn\u2019t even number. And yet it held so many memories. Long nights conversing with Eamonn when he had fostered with us. My own sickly reflection in the mirror as I\u2019d sawed at my Shahrizai braids with a dagger the day after I\u2019d visited Valerian House for the first time. Ph\u00e8dre adjusting the collar of my doublet on the day I\u2019d wed Dorelei mab Breidaia.</p><p>That was the last memory.</p><p>As I lay sleepless, I thought about Dorelei and our unborn son. Their spirits slept now beneath a green mound in Clunderry, Berlik\u2019s skull buried at their feet. I prayed for their forgiveness and understanding.</p><p>And I thought about Sidonie.</p><p>Ah, gods! Was simple happiness truly so much to ask? Was it ambitious to dream of a future in which we spent our lives together, taking pleasure in each other, in the bright mirror and the dark? In the heady abandon of love-play, in the homely comfort of watching our children dandled on the loving knees of their grandparents?</p><p>\u201cKushiel,\u201d I whispered into the darkness. \u201cI have spent my life trying to be good. I pray you hear your scion\u2019s prayers. There is no one here in need of your harsh justice, only your mercy.\u201d</p><p>There was no answer. Outside my narrow window, the moon inched closer to fullness in the night sky.</p><p>Some time after dawn, I arose hollow-eyed for lack of sleep and donned the clothing that the maidservant Clory had laid out for me. Black breeches and a black doublet. Mourning attire. It must have belonged to Joscelin.</p><p>It fit surprisingly well.</p><p>I descended the stairs to find the rest of the household likewise attired in mourning garb. Joscelin eyed me critically. \u201cYou\u2019re limping. I didn\u2019t notice that yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say that my healing wound stiffened when I slept, then caught myself. \u201cI took a tumble on the ship in some rough waters and got a nasty bruise.\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre cocked her head at me. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Astegal\u2019s ship continue up the Aviline? What made you decide to transfer to a barge?\u201d</p><p>For the first time in my life, I had cause to curse her agile wits. \u201cWe thought it would be safer if no one knew Sidonie had returned,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019d heard the rumors of impending war.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t blink. \u201cHow did you know you could trust the barge-captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I was too tired to invent a good lie. \u201cAstegal had made plans for every contingency. You\u2019d have to ask Kratos the details.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to satisfy her, at least for the moment. I trusted Kratos would field the question with aplomb if Ph\u00e8dre chose to pursue it. I hoped he\u2019d slept better than I had.</p><p>Word came from the Palace before we\u2019d finished breaking our fast; we were summoned to a funeral service in Astegal\u2019s honor that afternoon. It would take place at the Temple of Elua, followed by a reception at the Palace. Ysandre and Drustan were moving swiftly; but then, there was precious little time to spare.</p><p>\u201cI should attend as a member of House Courcel,\u201d I said, rising from the table. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the temple.\u201d</p><p>Another glance exchanged.</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said gently. \u201cI think it\u2019s best if you stay with us. I\u2019m pleased that the physicians in Carthage were able to explain your situation in a way you could understand, but Sidonie\u2019s in a great deal of pain right now. I fear worrying about your delusions is the last thing she needs.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth. \u201cActually, she said I was a solace. That it was a comfort to know that the last kinsman she expected had stayed loyal to the Crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she did,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said. \u201cShe\u2019s always had a keen sense of propriety, even as a little girl. I never understood why you disliked her, any more than I can understand why your illness turned your feelings inside out.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNonetheless, give the poor child a moment\u2019s peace.\u201d</p><p>Joscelin\u2019s hand closed on my shoulder. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we spar? It will be like old times.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head toward him. \u201cDo you mean to keep me here forcibly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImri.\u201d Joscelin\u2019s grip tightened, then released. He caught my hand instead and raised it, baring my wrist to reveal the faint scars there. His eyes were grave. The vile threats I could never unsay, never forget I\u2019d uttered, echoed in my memory. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help.\u201d</p><p>I looked away. \u201cI know. All right.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t begin to count the number of times I\u2019d sparred with Joscelin: here in the inner courtyard of the townhouse, in the gardens of Montr\u00e8ve. The hilts of the wooden practice-swords we used were smooth and shiny with wear. He\u2019d begun teaching me on the deck of a ship bound for Menekhet when I was ten years old. Betimes when I concentrated on my footwork, I could still remember the feel of the warm deck beneath my bare feet. I\u2019d been so grateful for his attention, for his loving patience.</p><p>My heart wasn\u2019t in it today.</p><p>My heart was in the Palace, agonizing for Sidonie as she prepared to hear Astegal of Carthage lovingly eulogized, worrying about the charm holding. It was with Alais and, gods help me, Barquiel L\u2019Envers as they went about the terrible chore of raising an ever-larger army. I fought mechanically. My feet remembered the steps of their own accord. My thigh throbbed. My arms remembered the dull exhaustion I\u2019d felt outside the gates of Am\u00edlcar, my muscles quivering with the aftermath of untold blows and parries.</p><p>Too many memories.</p><p>The dead; thousands of dead. Dead Amazigh, dead Carthaginians, dead Nubians . . . and, ah, Elua have mercy! Thousands of dead Euskerri. The flower of a generation.</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d We were both breathing hard when Joscelin called for a halt. He smiled at me, his summer-blue eyes crinkling at the corners. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept up your training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I forced the word past the tightness in my throat. \u201cI\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>Joscelin clapped my back. \u201cGood man.\u201d</p><p>When the hour arrived to depart for the Temple of Elua, it was almost a relief. Our carriage was draped with swags of black mourning-cloth and the headstalls of the horses had been dyed black. Our escort of outriders wore the forest-green and gold livery of House Montr\u00e8ve, but each man sported a black armband. We proceeded somberly through the streets of the City. Black cloth, black paint, black armbands. I remembered entering the City with Sidonie . . . how long ago? Almost two years. The black armbands, the down-turned thumbs.</p><p>This was different.</p><p>That had been a bitter reminder of my mother\u2019s legacy. This was a city in mourning. Mourning Astegal of Carthage, who had stolen away the love of my life, whose ambition had turned all those I loved against all they held dear. On the streets, men and women wept openly. I gazed out the window at their faces, my heart aching. And I allowed myself the fierce consolation of remembering the quiver that had run the length of my blade when Astegal had died, of Sidonie\u2019s hand firm atop mine on the hilt and her unflinching courage.</p><p>And Astegal\u2019s damned head on a pike, his slack jaw gaping.</p><p>The Temple of Elua was thronged with mourners and guards. In the vestibule, I pried off my boots quickly and slipped through the crowd in the inner garden sanctum to find Sidonie. She was with Drustan and Ysandre and Brother Thomas Jubert at the base of Elua\u2019s effigy, Kratos at her side. I saw her head turn as I made my way toward her. The quick flair of relief in her eyes eased a tight knot inside me.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Sidonie greeted me carefully. \u201cI thought to see you at the Palace this morning.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a brief bow. \u201cForgive me. Are you well?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders twitched. \u201cI\u2019m enduring.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cImri!\u201d Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s voice behind me held a note of despairing reproach. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your highness. I asked him not to trouble you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no trouble, my lady.\u201d Sidonie smiled at her with a mixture of sweetness and sorrow. \u201cI quite missed his presence this morning. In a strange way, I feel I\u2019ve lost a sister and gained a brother.\u201d She laid her hand on my arm. That irrepressible spark leapt between us, giving the lie to her words, but we\u2019d had long practice in dissembling. \u201cI know you\u2019ve missed him, but I hope you\u2019ll spare me his company from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said without hesitation. \u201cFor as long as you like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think of you as a sister,\u201d Ysandre noted suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d I said humbly.</p><p>Drustan gave me a hard look. \u201cSee that your man Kratos keeps an eye on him,\u201d he said to Sidonie.</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cOf course, Father. I only wish to have the comfort of family around me on this dark day.\u201d</p><p>Brother Thomas cleared his throat. \u201cSpeaking of which, we should begin, child.\u201d He took Sidonie\u2019s hands. \u201cAre you prepared?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The priest released her hands and took his place before the plinth on which Elua\u2019s effigy stood. He spread his arms, echoing the pose of the massive effigy behind him. The crowd ceased its murmuring and fell silent. Brother Thomas was a big man. I remembered how he\u2019d reminded me of Berlik when I\u2019d first seen him, with his black hair and light grey eyes. I remembered how I\u2019d spoken to Brother Thomas and an assembly representing all the priesthoods of Elua\u2019s Companions in an effort to convince them that my love for Sidonie was genuine. In the end, all of them had acknowledged the validity of our claim.</p><p>And now he gave her husband\u2019s eulogy.</p><p>\u201cWe are gathered here today to honor the passing of Astegal, Prince of the House of Sarkal, General of Carthage, husband of the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange, her highness Sidonie de la Courcel,\u201d Brother Thomas began. The crowd gave a collective sigh. \u201cAstegal of Carthage was a man of great and daring vision,\u201d the priest continued. \u201cHe came courting Terre d\u2019Ange with his arms laden with gifts and his mind brimming with ideas. He captured our imagination and he captured the heart of our young Dauphine . . .\u201d</p><p>It went on at considerable length. I daresay it was well done. I did my best not to listen, concentrating instead on the beating of the blood in my veins. I stood behind Sidonie, near enough for her to feel my presence, not so close that it aroused suspicion. I couldn\u2019t see her face, but I could feel the pain radiating from her as surely as though it were my own.</p><p>At last he ended. \u201c. . . pray that if Blessed Elua is merciful, they will find one another again in another life and live to see their dreams brought to fruition.\u201d Brother Thomas bent his head to Sidonie. \u201cYou may speak now, my child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Sidonie took his place before the plinth. Her face was streaked with tears. \u201cI will not . . .\u201d Her voice shook. She clasped her hands together hard and willed it to steadiness. \u201cI will not attempt to elaborate on the eloquent words Brother Thomas spoke. I can but thank him for bringing to life so beautifully the memory of the man with whom I fell in love and for whom I grieve today.\u201d</p><p>The sentence was delivered with seemingly perfect sincerity, and I knew in the marrow of my bones that those were the hardest words Sidonie had ever spoken. A few of the mourners sobbed aloud.</p><p>She paused, collecting herself. \u201cAstegal gave me many gifts during our too-short time together. He was as generous to me as he was to Terre d\u2019Ange. But there is one gift he gave in secret\u2014his greatest gift to me, to us, to the City of Elua. And it is of that gift I would speak on this fearful day, on the eve of a darker tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>In a clear, steady voice, with tears drying on her cheeks, Sidonie repeated the tale of Bodeshmun\u2019s death and the hidden gem.</p><p>She had inspired hope in Turnone and she inspired it here. I could feel the mood shift, hearts lifting. I watched Ysandre\u2019s eyes shine with pride, Drustan rest his hand on his wife\u2019s shoulder, nodding in approval. Ah, gods! They had every right to be proud of their heir. I prayed one day they would know why.</p><p>\u201cI beseech you.\u201d Sidonie opened her arms, echoing the priest, echoing Blessed Elua himself. \u201cAll of you in Elua\u2019s blessed City. Take up this search, leave no stone unturned. Amidst the tragedy of his death, let us lay claim to this last, best gift of my Astegal and snatch hope from despair, honor from treason.\u201d</p><p>They roared.</p><p>It went on and on; promises and vows and pledges shouted with ferocious determination. The denizens of the City of Elua would raze the very foundations of the City to find Bodeshmun\u2019s gem. Sidonie lowered her arms and stepped away from the plinth, stumbling a little. Kratos caught her, but it was my gaze she sought.</p> <p>\u201cMy Astegal,\u201d Sidonie whispered beneath the roar, her voice catching in her throat, barely audible. \u201cI feel sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>That was all the comfort I could offer. As in Turnone, the throng pressed forward, offering their sympathies, offering their fierce vows. The guards beat them back, restoring order. I was pushed to the side, unheeded. I found Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin beside me once more, Joscelin shoving at the guardsmen with an unwonted curse as they crowded us.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>All that mattered was that Sidonie had succeeded. She\u2019d been right; she had a role to play here. She had swayed them as no one else could have done: Ysandre\u2019s very well trained heir, Astegal\u2019s grieving widow.</p><p>I prayed it was enough.</p><p>And I prayed it was in time.</p><p>Seventy-Six</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said in wonderment, gazing out the window of the carriage as we rode to the reception following the service. \u201cThey\u2019re tearing up the city.\u201d</p><p>It was true.</p><p>Word had spread like wildfire. By the time we emerged from the Temple of Elua, it was already racing ahead of us. Men and women thronged the streets, worrying their fingertips bloody as they pried at paving-stones, clamoring to search the premises of merchants and wineshops and threatening violence to any who might forbid them entry.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Joscelin said briefly.</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre glanced at him. \u201cSurely there must be a more logical way to approach this.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re good at figuring out that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we know Bodeshmun had the gem the night of the f\u00eate when the delegation first arrived,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre said pragmatically. \u201cThat\u2019s when I noticed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had it the day of the marvel,\u201d I added. I was just as glad to have her mind working on this puzzle and not picking out inconsistencies in our story. \u201cSid\u2014\u201d I caught myself. Elua, this was hard. \u201cI went to watch the preparations in Elua\u2019s Square earlier in the day and I saw it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if Bodeshmun hid it himself, all we need to do is retrace his steps between the last sighting and the day he departed to limit the possibilities,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre mused. \u201cUnless of course he handed it off to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had runners going back and forth to adjust the mirrors on the walls.\u201d I pictured Bodeshmun pacing in his study, absentmindedly touching his chest where the painted leather talisman that held the key to unlocking the demon-stone was hidden. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he was the sort to hand off so powerful a charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She regarded me. \u201cWell, that would surely make the task easier. I\u2019ll have to ask Sidonie\u2019s opinion. Doubtless she came to know Bodeshmun quite well during her time in Carthage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtless,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Royal Treasury?\u201d Joscelin suggested. \u201cAfter all, where better to hide a single gem than amid a thousand others?\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre smiled at him. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent thought.\u201d</p><p>I stifled a groan. That was one of the few places L\u2019Envers had managed to search thoroughly; but I couldn\u2019t very well say it, and I couldn\u2019t think of a valid reason to discount the notion. I gazed out the window at the folk pelting through the city, spreading the word, searching haphazardly. A gem the size of a child\u2019s fist. It could be hidden anywhere. I remembered the icy-hot pain of a needle piercing my kidneys, Sunjata\u2019s voice hissing in my ear.</p><p>Go to Cythera.</p><p>An emerald flash.</p><p>\u201cDo you recall what Bodeshmun did after showing you the marvel?\u201d I asked. \u201cAfter the shadow had passed from the moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone went . . .\u201d Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s face went blank. \u201cThere was a f\u00eate, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d she asked Joscelin, who nodded uncertainly. \u201cElua! Between the wonder and the horror, I swear, the night\u2019s a blur.\u201d She stroked my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t remember much beyond hearing you\u2019d been found unconscious and raving, I fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a bad night,\u201d Joscelin murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sure others will recall it better.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t. I already knew Sidonie didn\u2019t; we\u2019d discussed it. But I held my tongue on the thought.</p><p>The reception took place in the Hall of Audience. The first thing I saw upon entering was the painting rendered in ground gems that had been the centerpiece of Carthage\u2019s largesse. It was on prominent display, the frame draped in black crepe. I stood and gazed at it for a long time. Ptolemy Solon had said that the image had defined the essence of the spell. A tall man with black hair and a crimson beard, a blonde woman. Standing before an oak tree, their hands clasped in friendship.</p><p>Or love.</p><p>I\u2019d assumed the woman was meant to be Ysandre; we all had. It could as easily have been Sidonie. Mayhap it represented both of them. I searched the image for clues, hoping to find an image of the emerald gem buried in the leaves of the oak tree or mayhap a word hidden in the glimmering whorls of its bark, but there was nothing. Like as not it was a futile hope. L\u2019Envers had said he\u2019d searched Elua\u2019s Square and the great oak tree itself. It had been barren in winter with no crown of green leaves to hide a gem. If the demon-stone was in Elua\u2019s Square, it could only be buried beneath the flagstones.</p><p>But a word . . . if there was a word hidden in the design, it was like to be written in Punic. I wouldn\u2019t even recognize the alphabet. I resolved to tell Sidonie to examine it herself at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>\u201cCousin.\u201d A familiar voice behind me startled me out of my reverie. \u201cA terrible story, is it not? But I hear your condition is improved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMavros!\u201d I turned and blinked at him. He was wearing a doublet of Courcel blue with braided silver trim and the insignia of the silver swan on its breast. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in mourning attire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Mavros showed me his black armband. \u201cOfficers of the Royal Army were given orders to remain in uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyal Army?\u201d I echoed.</p><p>His handsome face hardened. \u201cDo you expect me to stand by and do nothing while that ambitious chit and her snake of an uncle attempt to overthrow the throne? Yes, of course I put in my name for a commission. Every peer in the City with a shred of honor and courage has.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over in Joscelin\u2019s direction. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. No one mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>Mavros followed my gaze. \u201cAh. Yes, well, I expect they\u2019re being cautious around you. Joscelin did put in his name, but the Queen refused to allow it.\u201d His next words eradicated any dawning sense of relief I might have had. \u201cYsandre has sworn that Alais will never take the throne while she lives. We will fight to our last breath, but if it comes to it, if L\u2019Envers takes the City, she\u2019s asked Joscelin to remain that he might perform the terminus for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely not,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPh\u00e8dre would never consent to it.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201c\u2019Tis a grave sacrifice to be sure. But Joscelin Verreuil is the Queen\u2019s Champion. It\u2019s his duty.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to believe it, but I did. I remembered Sidonie aboard Deimos\u2019 ship as we prepared to set it afire and attempt the harbor at Am\u00edlcar. Believe me when I tell you I would far rather die by your hand than be restored to Astegal. There was a streak of fierce pride in the women of House Courcel. Ysandre might make such a vow rather than cede the throne alive. And Joscelin . . . in his right mind, Joscelin would never honor it, nor would Ph\u00e8dre consent to allow him.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t.</p><p>Mavros misread my expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cNo one expects you to serve, Imri. You\u2019re ill. If your madness returned on the battlefield, it would endanger us all.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAt any rate, I hear there\u2019s hope for the City. Carthage may save her after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I had to get away from this stranger with Mavros\u2019 face. \u201cWill you excuse me?\u201d</p><p>I plunged into the sea of mourners, seeking Sidonie. Now that Mavros had mentioned it, I realized there were more familiar faces than I\u2019d noticed wearing military uniforms. I did my best to avoid them, and in the process blundered into one of the few figures not clad in black or Courcel blue. I knew her by the gleaming fall of red-gold hair that hung down her back.</p><p>\u201cAmarante!\u201d I said in relief.</p><p>Elua, it was so damned easy to forget.</p><p>She turned, the crimson silk robes of a Priestess of Naamah swirling gracefully around her. Her brows knit as though she were trying for a moment to place me, and then she inclined her head. \u201cPrince Imriel,\u201d Amarante said politely. \u201cI was pleased to hear that you had returned safely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d We were within earshot of Sidonie. I glanced at her. Her expression was composed, but I could see the stricken look behind her eyes. From the first dawning of our liaison, even before it had begun, Amarante had known. She had been Sidonie\u2019s sole confidante and conspirator.</p><p>Amarante moved past me. \u201cSidonie.\u201d Her voice changed, softening. \u201cI\u2019m so very\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d Sidonie laid her fingers gently over Amarante\u2019s lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can bear to hear another word of sympathy today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Amarante took her hand and kissed it. \u201cWould you like me to stay with you for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie shivered. \u201cNo, thank you. It\u2019s a kind offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Amarante studied her face, frowning slightly. She was a Priestess of Naamah and although it happened precious seldom, she knew withdrawal when she encountered it. For a mercy, whatever she saw, she chose to attribute it to grief. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve only to send word to the temple if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d Sidonie watched her go. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much longer I can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour highness is weary,\u201d Kratos said in Hellene. \u201cYou should retire.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him with hope. \u201cDo you suppose I might?\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cI will speak to your lady mother.\u201d</p><p>Kratos strode through the crowd, gesturing for people to keep their distance from Sidonie. They deferred out of respect for their beloved Astegal\u2019s most trusted bodyguard.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I said in a low voice. \u201cBefore you go, I want you to look at the gem-painting that Astegal presented at the f\u00eate. It\u2019s part and parcel of the spell. See if there are any words hidden in it written in Punic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPunic.\u201d She nodded, closing her eyes briefly.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She opened her eyes. \u201cBut I can feel it. And I\u2019m afraid of slipping away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I caught her hand and squeezed it hard. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>She returned the pressure. \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>Across the hall, Ysandre was gesturing and Drustan was shaking his head. Kratos\u2019 face was flushed. He offered them a curt bow. Drustan made his way toward us. I released Sidonie\u2019s hand and moved a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d Drustan rested his hands on his daughter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI understand that you are weary and heart-sore. But you need to be strong.\u201d His fingers flexed. \u201cWe stand on the eve of war. This is the greatest test any ruler might face. And I know you cannot fathom what that truly means, but you are your mother\u2019s heir. The people need to see that neither grief nor betrayal will bow your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Father,\u201d Sidonie murmured.</p><p>And so she stayed, and I stayed near her, offering the meager comfort of my presence as the reception wore on and on and an endless line of well-wishers came to proffer their sympathies. Over and over, they offered the same regrets and platitudes; over and over, Sidonie accepted them with forced gratitude. Many of them asked if there was a chance she yet carried Astegal\u2019s child. Their faces fell when she shook her head.</p><p>What another piece of bitter irony it was. The peers of the realm, the lords and ladies of the Great Houses of Terre d\u2019Ange, had always held reservations regarding Ysandre de la Courcel\u2019s half-Cruithne heir. If Sidonie had truly fallen in love with a foreign prince, they would have shrieked to the heavens about the sacred bloodline of Blessed Elua being further diluted. And yet here they were, offering her adulation, mourning the loss of Astegal of Carthage.</p> <p>I willed myself not to hate them. It was the spell, only the spell.</p><p>I can feel it. I\u2019m afraid of slipping away.</p><p>Those words made my blood run cold.</p><p>At last the reception ended, the crowds thinning, departing with multitudinous vows to find Bodeshmun\u2019s charm. Ph\u00e8dre came to find me.</p><p>\u201cWill you not come home with us, love?\u201d she asked plaintively.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI need to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave no fear, my lady.\u201d Kratos\u2019 arm descended over my shoulders, heavy and solid. Whether or not he understood all the words spoken, he read the situation well. He smiled at her. \u201cAs her highness has bidden me, I\u2019ll make certain that the prince comes to no harm.\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre cocked her head and replied in Hellene. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a Carthaginian accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kratos\u2019 smile never wavered. \u201cI was born in Hellas and taken in battle many years ago, serving as a mercenary. Bad luck. On the day Astegal was born, his father freed me.\u201d He removed his arm from my shoulders and pressed his clenched fist to his heart. \u201cHence, my loyalty.\u201d</p><p>Her expression eased. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Once the hall was emptied, Sidonie went to stand before the gem-painting. She gazed at it for a long time as though lost in contemplation. The guards surrounding her, and even Drustan and Ysandre, waited with respect.</p><p>I lingered, hoping.</p><p>But no. At length she turned away, giving her head an imperceptible shake. There was no hidden clue.</p><p>The hunt continued.</p><p>Seventy-Seven</p><p>For five days the hunt for Bodeshmun\u2019s gem continued at a frantic pace. The City looked like it had been sacked and looted.</p><p>At first the mood was one of fierce jubilation. After conferring with Ph\u00e8dre and hearing her thoughts on a more logical approach, Ysandre ordered the Royal Army to assist with the search. They began by digging up the whole of Elua\u2019s Square, removing the massive paving-stones and hauling them away, sifting through the dirt below.</p><p>They found nothing.</p><p>The mood didn\u2019t sour all at once, but day by day the tension mounted. The search continued. The wing of the Palace in which the Carthaginian delegation had lodged was stripped bare. Following Joscelin\u2019s suggestion, the Royal Treasury was moved piece by piece to an array of empty storage chambers, every gem within it scrutinized. Routes from the Palace to the Square were scoured obsessively. Every crack and crevice along the white walls of the City where Bodeshmun\u2019s mirrors had been placed was examined.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>As hope dwindled, tempers flared. The semblance of looting became a reality and there was widespread fighting in the streets of the City. A rumor went around that a wandering Tsingani kumpania had found the gem and stolen it away, sparking riots in Night\u2019s Doorstep. A house was burned, an entire family killed in their sleep. The Cockerel closed its doors for the first time in memory.</p><p>Rumor ran rampant, fueled by the fact that no one could quite remember the details of the night surrounding the marvel.</p><p>Even the Night Court wasn\u2019t immune. Someone remembered that Astegal and a group of Carthaginians had visited there. A fresh rumor went around that Bodeshmun had accompanied them, that he had entrusted the gem to the safekeeping of Bryony House, whose treasury was renowned for being more secure than the Royal Treasury itself. An irate crowd stormed the gates of Bryony House, demanding that the Dowayne allow them to search the treasury. When she refused, claiming that her own household had already conducted a thorough search, the altercation turned violent. The Dowayne\u2019s skilled guards skirmished with the mob.</p><p>The incident killed three and wounded many others.</p><p>Every day brought irate petitioners to the Palace: robbed merchants, injured citizens, a furious Janelle n\u00f3 Bryony. Every day, the Hall of Audience rang with shouting.</p><p>Every day was worse than the last.</p><p>And worst of all, Sidonie was slipping away.</p><p>There was never enough time to talk. She sent for me when she could, but we didn\u2019t dare spend much time closeted without arousing suspicion. If it hadn\u2019t been for Kratos, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d have managed at all. The members of her personal guard had been recalled from the duties to which they\u2019d been assigned when she left for Carthage. All of the goodwill I\u2019d managed to earn had vanished, lost along with the memories of an affair that had divided the nation. The first time I saw Claude de Monluc, he regarded me with cool wariness. Still, so long as I only met with Sidonie with Kratos in tow, they were willing to allow it.</p><p>As long as it was brief.</p><p>As long as we did naught to arouse suspicion.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d It was on the fifth day that Sidonie greeted me at her door with a momentary look of blankness. She shuddered, her gaze clearing. \u201cThank you for coming. Please, come in.\u201d</p><p>I entered, Kratos padding behind me. \u201cHow bad is it, Sun Princess?\u201d I asked when the door closed behind us.</p><p>\u201cBad.\u201d She sat hunched on the couch, hands gripping opposite elbows. The hollows of her eyes looked sunken and bruised. \u201cIt hurts. It hurts all the time, and I\u2019m afraid to sleep. Afraid I\u2019ll tear away the bindings all unwitting. I have to think about it every minute of every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do this,\u201d I said steadily. \u201cYou can, Sidonie.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cI can feel it. It\u2019s out there. But it feels like it\u2019s everywhere in the City. Nowhere more than anywhere else. It\u2019s there and it\u2019s here. In my head, buzzing like a beehive. It keeps telling me it would be so much easier to let go and believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt lies,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sidonie took my hands, pressed them to her face. Her tears were hot on my skin. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help it. At least I feel myself starting to believe our lies, and not some skewed version of my own memories. Elua! How can we fail after all we\u2019ve tried? After all who\u2019ve died for our efforts?\u201d</p><p>I held her while she wept. \u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Over the crown of her head, I could see Kratos watching us. For the first time, there was doubt and fear on his broad features.</p><p>I fought against despair.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWe will not fail.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and kissed me, clinging to me, her mouth hot and desperate. \u201cI love you,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI do. I know it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, swallowing hard. \u201cNo magic so dire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Sidonie echoed.</p><p>But there was. Bodeshmun had crafted his spell with care and hidden the demon-stone with consummate skill. Day by day, its influence ate away at Sidonie\u2019s resolve, even as it ate away at the foundations of the City of Elua. In the end, Ysandre was forced to declare an end to the search and command the Royal Army to restore order.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ysandre said to Sidonie when we dined that evening. House Courcel, seemingly united, tolerating the presence of poor mad Prince Imriel. \u201cI know you placed a great deal of hope in Astegal\u2019s kinsman. But we cannot afford to have the City at its own throat. Not on the eve of war.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie leaned her brow against steepled fingers. \u201cI understand. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot afford to be soft, child.\u201d There was sympathy in Drustan\u2019s voice. \u201cI too wish that we had found Bodeshmun\u2019s charm. But we must deal with that which is, not that which we wish might be. In these final days, the army must be free to prepare for battle, knowing that we leave the City calm behind us when we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas there been word?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Drustan and Ysandre exchanged a glance. \u201cYes.\u201d It was Ysandre who answered. \u201cReports of a considerable force amassing on the plains east of Turnone. It seems our threat worked. Alais and L\u2019Envers mean to make a stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you . . .\u201d I hesitated. \u201cDid you truly mean it, Ysandre? Would you have put innocent villages to the sword?\u201d I knew I shouldn\u2019t ask, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. If there was any chance the answer was no, mayhap this looming tragedy could still be averted.</p><p>Ysandre looked at me with pity and sorrow. \u201cThat is not a threat one makes in idleness, Imriel. Of course I meant it. No village conspiring to give aid to traitors is innocent. It would have been a grievous measure, but a necessary one.\u201d</p><p>But you can\u2019t win! I wanted to cry the words aloud. I didn\u2019t. It wouldn\u2019t do any good. \u201cWhat if Sidonie and I attempted to treat with them?\u201d I asked instead. \u201cAlais might listen to her sister, and you know we\u2019ve always been close.\u201d</p><p>On the other side of the long table, Sidonie lifted her head, following my thoughts. If the search for Bodeshmun\u2019s gem was a loss, that would at least serve to get her out of the City of Elua, away from the spell\u2019s malign influence.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would Alais listen to either of you over the orders of her own mother and father?\u201d Ysandre\u2019s eyes narrowed. I could see the suspicion rising in her, abrupt and overwhelming. \u201cOr is there some other scheme behind this, hmm? You\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you? A chance to spirit Sidonie away for yourself. I daresay it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Sidonie said sharply. \u201cHe\u2019s only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre pointed at her. \u201cYou\u2019re overtrusting. If you\u2019d learned nothing else from your sister\u2019s betrayal and that which befell your husband\u2019s kinsman in New Carthage, I\u2019d expect you to be on guard against that particular weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only trying to help,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Drustan regarded me, his face impassive behind its woad markings. \u201cImriel, you did a great service to Alba after Dorelei\u2019s death, and I will always hold your memory in honor. But I fear so long as this delusion grips you, you\u2019re not to be trusted. Your words today prove it.\u201d His gaze shifted to Sidonie. \u201cAnd I fear it might be best if you were to avoid his company unless matters of state dictate otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKratos\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about Kratos!\u201d Drustan shouted. It was so out of character that Sidonie simply stared at him, shocked. He wrestled himself under control with a visible effort. \u201cKratos.\u201d This time it was a summons. Kratos, posted by the door like a good bodyguard, came forward in answer to it. \u201cEscort Prince Imriel to his quarters, or wherever it is he wishes to go,\u201d Drustan said. \u201cHe is no longer permitted to call upon the Dauphine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kratos hesitated, not entirely understanding the command. Sidonie repeated it for him in Hellene, her voice toneless. He bowed to her. \u201cAs my lady bids.\u201d</p><p>I rose. \u201cTake me to the townhouse, Kratos. I will place myself in Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin\u2019s care and free you to return to Sidonie\u2019s service. It\u2019s her that Astegal bade you to protect, not me.\u201d I glanced at Ysandre and Drustan. \u201cI trust that will suffice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d Ysandre said curtly.</p> <p>Gods, it had happened so quickly! After all our care, they\u2019d turned on me for one ill-chosen suggestion. I left the dining hall feeling the weight of their hard stares, and Sidonie\u2019s silent despair tugging at my heart.</p><p>I gathered a few things from my quarters at the Palace and sent for a carriage. We were on our way in short order, the carriage jolting over the torn-up streets of the City.</p><p>\u201cWhat now, my lord?\u201d Kratos asked soberly.</p><p>\u201cDo your best to protect her.\u201d I rested my aching head against the cushions. \u201cThe charm I wrought . . . it\u2019s beginning to fail. And it hurts. She\u2019s afraid to sleep for fear she\u2019ll tear the bindings loose. You can watch over her, at least give her the solace of sleep. Her guard trusts you; they\u2019ll not quibble at it. It might help.\u201d</p><p>Kratos nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think . . .\u201d I rubbed my temples. \u201cI think we have to begin to prepare for failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a tight lock on the city,\u201d he observed. \u201cNo one\u2019s allowed to come or go without a thorough inspection.\u201d Kratos met my gaze and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking. It won\u2019t be easy to get her out, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d I said slowly. The image of Joscelin performing the terminus leapt unbidden into my mind. I\u2019d never seen it done, but I\u2019d heard it described. The graceful turn, the steady hands. One dagger hurled, the other slashing his own throat. I closed my eyes, willing it to be gone. Joscelin would do his duty and Ph\u00e8dre would follow him into death. I knew that as surely as I knew the sun rose in the east. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Sidonie.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure I could abandon them.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure of anything.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t save them all, my lord,\u201d Kratos said gently. \u201cAnd mayhap none of them. I\u2019m sorry. But we\u2019re only mortal. You have to choose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d I buried my face in my hands and took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cSidonie, then. The City\u2019s defenses will be stretched thin once the army departs. If she can hold on long enough, at least there may be enough of her left to aid us. And mayhap . . . mayhap we can think of some way to help the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d Kratos said. \u201cMayhap, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The kindness in his voice nearly undid me. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up, Kratos,\u201d I said. \u201cNot while there\u2019s breath in my body.\u201d</p><p>He smiled with sorrow. \u201cI never thought you would, my lord. If it comes to it, I\u2019d be proud to die trying beside you. \u2019Tis a far nobler death than I\u2019d ever thought to earn these many years.\u201d</p><p>We rode the rest of the way in silence.</p><p>Seventy-Eight</p><p>Once the Queen declared an official end to the search for Bodeshmun\u2019s gem, a strange mood settled over the City: proud, defiant, hostile, despairing. All of these things at once.</p><p>War was coming.</p> <p>The full moon was a week away.</p><p>Companies of the Royal Army patrolled the streets, keeping order. They drilled in the City gardens, trampling the new spring growth. Drustan mab Necthana and Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion would be sharing command\u2014the Cruarch of Alba and the Royal Commander of Terre d\u2019Ange. Wherever they went, they were hailed with fierce shouts.</p><p>On an unofficial level, the search did continue. I took part in it, hoping against hope, desperate for the distraction. On the heels of Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s latest inspiration, I searched the river wharf with a company of Montr\u00e8ve\u2019s retainers. Alas, to no avail. I prowled the City, muttering the word under my breath in the hopes that it might unexpectedly release a demon. Ptolemy Solon had said it was needful to take possession of the gem to break the spell, but mayhap he was wrong. Over and over, I whispered the word of unbinding.</p><p>Emmenghanom.</p><p>Beholden.</p><p>And, ah, gods! I was beholden. Every day, rising under Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin\u2019s roof, I was reminded of it. I owed them my life. Almost everything I was, I owed to them. The thought of abandoning them, of being unable to save them, hurt more than I could say.</p><p>Kratos came regularly to the townhouse. When we could snatch a private moment, he reported on Sidonie\u2019s condition, his homely face grave, dark circles under his eyes. He was giving up his own sleep to safeguard hers, catching naps during the day.</p><p>At first it helped.</p><p>And then it didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re losing her, my lord,\u201d Kratos said simply. \u201cBit by bit.\u201d</p><p>I fought down a welling surge of helplessness. \u201cDoes she still trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Sometimes she forgets for a moment and addresses me as though I truly were Astegal\u2019s man. Either way, she trusts me.\u201d He withdrew a flask from the inner pocket of his doublet\u2014new livery in Courcel blue, freshly tailored to fit his broad frame. \u201cShe\u2019s stubborn. She\u2019s fighting it as best she can. This is a sleeping draught she had the Palace chirurgeon prepare.\u201d Kratos smiled ruefully. \u201cShe bade me use it on her if need be. Use her own tactics against her. She reckons she won\u2019t remember them by the time it\u2019s needful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d I sighed. \u201cKratos, do me a kindness. Have you run of the City unheeded?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAs far as anyone\u2019s concerned, I\u2019m General Astegal\u2019s right-hand man. No one tells me what to do but her highness.\u201d</p><p>I handed him a letter. \u201cDeliver this to Lieutenant Faucon. He and his men are lodging at the Jolly Whistler near the wharf. Tell him to get it to Alais as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d Kratos asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything we know,\u201d I said grimly. \u201cOur failure to find the gem, all the places that I know for a surety have been thoroughly searched. The fact that Sidonie\u2019s bindings are failing. The fact that Queen Ysandre has pledged herself to a death-pact if Alais and L\u2019Envers take the City. Is there aught I\u2019ve forgotten?\u201d</p><p>Kratos shook his head. \u201cDo you reckon any of it will help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I raked a hand through my hair. \u201cIf they know about the death-pact, they can hold off on entering the City. But what then? Do they remain camped outside its walls while day by day, week by week, month by month, the madness grows? You saw the way the violence has escalated. How long until those trapped within the City begin to turn on one another?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWe do what we can, my friend, and pray.\u201d</p><p>Kratos delivered the letter and reported back to me to say it was safely done, and that Marc Faucon believed he could get it to Alais without trouble. Their guise as barge-hands had proved effective; indeed, the men who\u2019d ferried Sidonie up the Aviline were reckoned heroes by the City Guard. Captain Gilbert would carry Faucon and his men to Yvens, from whence they would make haste to Turnone.</p><p>I wished to Blessed Elua I could think of a way to get Sidonie back aboard that barge. I couldn\u2019t. All vessels, incoming or outgoing, were being searched with ruthless thoroughness. I thought Marc Faucon stood a good chance of getting away with hiding a letter on his person. I didn\u2019t think there was a chance of hiding the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange on an outgoing barge.</p><p>Long ago, Ph\u00e8dre had been smuggled into the city of La Serenissima aboard a ship, hidden in a chest with a false bottom large enough to conceal her. I\u2019d mulled over the possibility. But fate hadn\u2019t seen fit to place such an item at my disposal, and I could only imagine the suspicion it would provoke if mad Prince Imriel sought to commission a carpenter to build him one.</p><p>Of course, if I was wrong about Faucon\u2019s chances, it was all moot. That letter would damn me for a traitor if it was found.</p><p>The following day, Kratos strolled the wharf and came to report that to all appearances, the barge had departed without incident. I breathed an inward sigh of relief. For the moment, at least, I was safe, safe in the knowledge that I\u2019d done all I could think of to do, and safe from the accusation of treason.</p><p>Then the Caerdicci idiot came.</p><p>His name was Antonio Peruggi, a name that became etched in my memory for its eternal association with sheer stupidity. The details of his story, I learned later; he was a merchant-captain trapped by the blockade in Am\u00edlcar with a cargo of silk he was unable to sell during war-time. When the blockade lifted, he decided his cargo would fetch better prices in Terre d\u2019Ange.</p><p>And so he sailed to Marsilikos carrying silk and news out of Am\u00edlcar.</p><p>Barquiel L\u2019Envers had been right; he and Alais had done an outstanding job of keeping the news from the City of Elua. They held the river and they held the roads, and no one they deemed unworthy of absolute trust had been allowed to pass. Unfortunately, Peruggi had heard the rumors in Marsilikos and gotten it into his head that Ysandre would surely reward him for being the first to deliver the news. He\u2019d purchased a horse and hired a guide to lead him to the City of Elua across the countryside, avoiding all of L\u2019Envers\u2019 checkpoints.</p><p>Stupidity, cunning, and greed.</p><p>The first we heard of it was a summons from a Queen\u2019s courier bidding me to Court. I thought mayhap I\u2019d rejoiced too quickly at Marc Faucon\u2019s successful escape and felt the blood drain from my face.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so pale?\u201d Ph\u00e8dre asked. \u201cMayhap the news is good.\u201d</p><p>I forced myself to smile. \u201cMayhap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely,\u201d Joscelin observed.</p><p>We arrived at the Hall of Audience to find Ysandre pacing in a fury, her color high and hectic. I glanced at Sidonie. She returned my gaze, but I couldn\u2019t read her expression. Beside her, Kratos grimaced in warning.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Ysandre fetched up before me, pointing toward a trembling figure. \u201cDo you know this man?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. He was of average height and middle years, muscle running to fat. Brown hair, a forgettable face. He sported several ostentatious rings, and his chin was quivering. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him before in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Antonio Peruggi,\u201d Ysandre said in a taut voice. \u201cHe claims to have news from Am\u00edlcar. He claims that you and Sidonie conspired to bring the Euskerri to defeat Astegal. He claims you killed Astegal with your own hand, and that my daughter aided you. And he seems to think I will reward him for this knowledge.\u201d</p><p>I went ice-cold.</p><p>\u201cWho paid you to say that?\u201d The words were out of my mouth before I knew I\u2019d thought them. Fear and rage drove my body and wits; I found myself standing before Peruggi without realizing I\u2019d moved. He gaped at me, uncomprehending. I struck his face hard enough to wrench his head sideways. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one!\u201d Peruggi cried in broken D\u2019Angeline. \u201cIt\u2019s true! Everyone knows!\u201d</p><p>I struck him again. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one!\u201d he cried again.</p><p>\u201cDo you know me?\u201d I demanded. \u201cHave you ever seen me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peruggi said raggedly. \u201cBut I heard the tales\u2014\u201d</p><p>I backhanded him across the face. \u201cWas it Alais? Barquiel L\u2019Envers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d It was Sidonie who spoke, her voice cool and commanding. \u201cHe speaks sedition,\u201d she said to her mother. \u201cI told you as much. I sense L\u2019Envers\u2019 hand behind it. It reeks of his tactics. This is some scheme to drive a wedge between us.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre considered her daughter\u2019s words. \u201cIs that so?\u201d she asked the Caerdicci merchant. She sounded eminently reasonable. \u201cWill you hold to your story or shall I have you tortured until you divulge the truth?\u201d</p><p>Antonio Peruggi shook his head. There was a trickle of blood at the corner of his mouth where I\u2019d struck him. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cPlease, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was L\u2019Envers,\u201d Ysandre pressed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He gazed at me, eyes damp. \u201cYes, the Duc L\u2019Envers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSedition.\u201d Ysandre lingered over the word. \u201cYou have sacrificed your rights here, Messire Peruggi, and I would be within mine to have you executed.\u201d He flinched. She glanced at Sidonie. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him be flogged.\u201d Sidonie fixed the Caerdicci merchant with an implacable gaze. \u201cLet him be put in stocks and given a public flogging, then turned loose to leave the City, his back bloody and bare, that all across the realm might know the price of speaking sedition in the matter of my husband.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre nodded. \u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p>Ah, gods! I was torn between relief and horror. Elua knows, the man had spoken the truth, even if it was driven by greed and idiocy. My rage had been unfeigned, although no one would have guessed at its cause.</p><p>But Sidonie . . .</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Later that day, Antonio Peruggi was flogged in Elua\u2019s Square, kneeling on sifted dirt denuded of its paving-stones, his bent head and helpless hands held in stocks, his thick, fleshy torso bare. I watched the Queen\u2019s chastiser\u2019s arm rise and fall, wielding the metal-tipped flogger. I watched it shred Peruggi\u2019s skin as he jerked and moaned in the stocks, blood running freely down his back. I watched Sidonie\u2019s calm, appraising gaze.</p><p>My heart ached.</p><p>When it was done, a watching crowd roared their approval. Members of the Queen\u2019s Guard helped a stumbling Peruggi from the stocks, helped him to mount. Slapped his horse\u2019s haunches and sent him toward the southern gates. I made my way unobtrusively to Sidonie\u2019s side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you still there, love?\u201d I murmured under my breath.</p><p>For the space of a few heartbeats, she didn\u2019t answer; but at last her head moved in an imperceptible nod. Wherever she\u2019d gone, it took a long time to come back. \u201cGet out of the City,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cSave yourself before this truth breaks in earnest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you,\u201d I said steadily.</p> <p>A glance, one glance. Anguish surfacing in her dark eyes. Gods, I wished I could make it go away! Instead, Kratos shifted, placing himself closer to Sidonie. Ysandre\u2019s suspicious gaze found us. I moved away.</p><p>That night I couldn\u2019t sleep. I gazed out my narrow window. The moon was very nearly full. Three days. In three days it would be full. I wondered if the spell\u2019s strength waxed and waned with the moon. I thought about the emerald flash I\u2019d seen before the madness on Sunjata\u2019s needle took me and wondered if mayhap the gem would emit a spark by the rising moonlight.</p><p>It seemed no less implausible than anything else, so I rose and went to saddle a horse. In the process, I awoke the sleeping stable-lad, who went to alert the guards. One went to fetch Joscelin, who came to stop me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go out there alone, Imri,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>I thought about all the dangerous places I\u2019d ventured alone and I could have laughed until I wept. Instead I told Joscelin my notion about the moon affecting the gem.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s worth a try,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>And so we rode out together, starting our quest under the moon-shadow of the ancient oak tree in Elua\u2019s Square, where the dirt was still clotted with Antonio Peruggi\u2019s dried blood. I kept feeling myself drawn to the place where it had begun. But there was no emerald flash, only the rustling of the spring breeze in new leaves.</p><p>We rode in aimless circles, making a rough outward spiral through the streets of the City. The City was restless, the sounds of harsh revelry and discordant music pouring from inns and wineshops open well past the usual hour. Atop Mont Nuit, the Houses of the Night Court were all ablaze with lamplight.</p><p>\u201cSoldiers,\u201d Joscelin said, gazing toward the distant lights. \u201cBidding farewell to the pleasures of the flesh. One can\u2019t begrudge them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I thought about Sidonie lying in my arms the night before battle. As much as I\u2019d like to make love to you until the sun rises, I\u2019d sooner have you go into battle well-rested. I\u2019d prayed to Blessed Elua for a hundred thousand nights to make up for that one. My eyes stung. \u201cBut I\u2019m surprised Drustan and Ghislain don\u2019t insist on better discipline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start thinking like a commander of men?\u201d Joscelin glanced at me. \u201cAh, well. I imagine they\u2019ll have a good long march to sweat out the excesses of debauchery. And in the end . . .\u201d He fell silent.</p> <p>\u201cIn the end it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I finished. \u201cBecause they\u2019re all dead men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it comes to it. Don\u2019t make mock of their sacrifice,\u201d Joscelin said in a somber tone. \u201cOne day, they\u2019ll be remembered as heroes who fought to preserve all that we hold dear in Terre d\u2019Ange. Their deaths will not be in vain if their valor lives on in the hearts of men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mocking,\u201d I said wearily. \u201cJust heart-sick.\u201d</p><p>Joscelin nodded. \u201cSo are we all.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to say no, no you\u2019re not. You\u2019re all sick, poisoned by Bodeshmun\u2019s vile spell, poisoned by this cursed demon-stone we\u2019re trying so hard to find. But I knew it would do no good, so I held my tongue and kept searching, riding the moonlit streets, hoping to spot an emerald spark amid the bobbing torches and spilling lamplight.</p><p>I didn\u2019t.</p><p>We made our way back to the townhouse at dawn. I watched the sun\u2019s rays breaking in the east.</p><p>Three days.</p> <p>Only three.</p><p>Seventy-Nine</p><p>For two more nights, I continued to roam the City, accompanied by Joscelin or Hugues and Ti-Philippe. I didn\u2019t really have much hope left, but sleep evaded me and I didn\u2019t know what else to do with myself.</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre didn\u2019t like it, fearing I was in the grip of a new obsession. For the first few days after Ysandre had declared an end to the search, folk in the City had continued to look for Bodeshmun\u2019s gem in a furtive manner under the wary eye of the Royal Army. But that had faded as their thoughts turned increasingly to war.</p><p>The mania to find the gem vanished as though it had never existed. War was the new mania.</p><p>War.</p><p>War.</p><p>War.</p><p>It was all I heard. In the townhouse, in the streets, spewing from the inns. An endless drumbeat of war. The City\u2019s mood ranged wildly from fierce, deluded optimism to maudlin sentiment. Theories abounded and were analyzed tirelessly. Alais\u2019 and L\u2019Envers\u2019 army would desert at the first show of strength. The battle would end in devastation and ruin, but poets would sing forever of the glorious sacrifice of the Royal Army of Terre d\u2019Ange. Folk argued heatedly on every side of the argument; but on one point, all agreed. They were eager for it to begin.</p><p>And I continued my futile, lonely search, Joscelin having succeeded in convincing Ph\u00e8dre that this obsession was at least harmless.</p><p>By the dawn of the third day, the last day, I felt hollow inside. I\u2019d done my best. It hadn\u2019t been enough. There was one more night. Tonight the moon would be full. If there was any merit to my theory, tonight would be the last, best chance. I took to my bed, willing my weary body to succumb to sleep. A few hours would be enough to sustain me. I had to keep trying.</p><p>It felt like my head had scarce touched the pillow before Ph\u00e8dre shook me awake.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Her face was grave. \u201cThere\u2019s a delegation from Alais. Ysandre and Drustan are receiving them at the Palace in an hour\u2019s time. I thought you\u2019d want to be there.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>I was still stifling yawns when we entered the Hall of Audience an hour later. It was an open audience and the Hall was crowded, but people made way for the Comtesse de Montr\u00e8ve and the Queen\u2019s Champion and, I suppose, poor mad Prince Imriel.</p><p>It was a formal affair. Drustan and Ysandre were seated in twin thrones on a dais, emblematic of their shared rule. Sidonie stood between them, the acknowledged heir to Terre d\u2019Ange, her features composed. That damnable gem-painting was displayed on an easel behind her, still draped in mourning crepe. Astegal and a blonde woman, their hands entwined before the oak tree.</p><p>I met Sidonie\u2019s gaze. She nodded at me with polite courtesy. There was nothing else there, nothing that I could see.</p><p>And no bindings of red thread at her wrists.</p><p>I\u2019d lost her.</p><p>And, ah, Elua! As if that weren\u2019t terrible enough, I saw that Alais and L\u2019Envers had chosen to send a delegate that might present no threat, that might move a hardened heart. I recognized her. She was a member of their shadow Parliament, the elderly L\u2019Agnacite woman who had wept and apologized for thinking terrible things of me. She held herself with dignity and grace, surrounded by an escort of some twenty men in humble attire. None of them were armed.</p><p>\u201cWe recognize the Baronesse Isabel de Bretel as an emissary of the avowed traitors Alais de la Courcel and Barquiel L\u2019Envers,\u201d Ysandre announced coolly. \u201cDo you bring word of their surrender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour majesties.\u201d Isabel de Bretel sank into a deep curtsy, then rose. \u201cWe come in peace. I bring one last plea for sanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ask for nothing more,\u201d Drustan said with deceptive mildness, resting his chin on one fist. \u201cHave they renounced their mad quest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is madness, but it does not lie outside the City\u2019s walls.\u201d Her voice quavered, then strengthened. \u201cYour majesties, we beg you to see reason! These men . . .\u201d Isabel de Bretel gestured. \u201cThese men surrounding me, they are farmers and tradesmen and merchants, fathers and husbands and sons. We come to beg you to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to what?\u201d Ysandre\u2019s voice rose. \u201cMore sedition?\u201d</p><p>A thousand voices murmured in agreement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ill!\u201d The old baronesse\u2019s voice broke. \u201cAll those outside the City\u2019s walls know it.\u201d I could tell by the angle of her head that she sought Sidonie\u2019s eyes, but there was nothing there she could speak to. \u201cPlease, we\u2019re searching for a cure. We\u2019re all searching. We beg you stay your hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drustan made an abrupt gesture. \u201cDo you bring terms of surrender?\u201d</p><p>Isabel de Bretel bowed her head. \u201cNo, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there is nothing to discuss.\u201d Ysandre nodded to the Palace Guard. \u201cThrow her in chains. Throw them all in chains and lock them in the dungeon.\u201d She paused. \u201cNo, wait. Save one of these farmer\u2019s sons to carry word to our youngest child. We will give no quarter. We will accept no terms save surrender.\u201d</p><p>Ah, gods! I was cold, so cold. Guards moved forward, chains at the ready. They\u2019d been prepared for this. The outcome had never been in question.</p><p>I daresay Isabel de Bretel had expected it. It had been a desperate measure. They knew reason held no sway here, but they\u2019d been compelled to try. I would have felt the same. She said a quiet word to her escort, then stood with her back proud and straight, holding out her hands to accept the shackles.</p><p>None of them protested. The guards handled them roughly nonetheless. They wrestled all but one of her party into chains, singled out a lanky young fellow with silken brown hair and cornflower-blue eyes, young enough that he was still rawboned with it.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Drustan pointed to him. \u201cCome here.\u201d The lad approached the throne, trembling. Drustan moved swiftly, rising and grabbing a handful of his hair. He stared into the lad\u2019s eyes, his face deadly. \u201cI should send you home in pieces, farmer\u2019s son,\u201d Drustan said softly. \u201cOr at the least have you flogged. But time is short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour majesty,\u201d the poor fellow whispered. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>Drustan put his free hand on the lad\u2019s chest and shoved him. There was a ripping sound. The lad cried out in pain, stumbling backward and falling hard. \u201cNo quarter.\u201d Drustan tossed a hank of brown hair on the lad\u2019s sprawling form, the roots bloody. \u201cNo terms but surrender. Go.\u201d</p><p>He went, weeping.</p><p>I wanted to weep, too.</p><p>\u201cTake the Baronesse de Bretel and the others,\u201d Ysandre said with disdain. \u201cGet them out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>The Palace Guards obeyed, shoving them past us. Isabel de Bretel paused before me, seeking my gaze as she\u2019d sought Sidonie\u2019s. Her gnarled hands rose, chains clanking at her manacled wrists. I could still remember the feeling of her hands pressing mine in gratitude and apology, the overwhelming sense of forgiveness and redemption that had come with it. But I didn\u2019t dare meet her eyes. I turned my head away from her and saw Sidonie\u2019s dispassionate face. As I gazed at her, her brows knit. For a second, for the merest space of a heartbeat, I thought mayhap there was a flicker of agonized awareness behind her eyes. Then it vanished and my heart ached anew.</p><p>We had given them hope.</p><p>We had failed them.</p><p>\u201cMy lords and ladies!\u201d Ysandre\u2019s voice rang clear and true. \u201cYou have heard the final word of those who would destroy the rule of law in Terre d\u2019Ange. They are relentless. They are the enemy. I bid you go forth this day. All who will serve, I bid you to say farewell to your families. All who will remain in the City, I bid you remain stalwart in your defense of her. And to all, I bid you reassemble here on the morrow, an hour past dawn, and hear a declaration of war!\u201d</p><p>The cheers shook the rafters.</p><p>My stomach roiled.</p><p>I walked out of the Hall of Audience in a daze. People streamed on either side of me, cheering. When I felt a heavy hand descend on my shoulder, I whirled, more than half-ready to fight.</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d Kratos backed away, raising his hands.</p><p>\u201cHow could you let her remove the bindings?\u201d I hissed. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>His broad chest rose and fell. \u201cShe pulled them loose in the bath,\u201d Kratos said simply. \u201cI can\u2019t be everywhere, my lord. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I clenched my fists, willing my fury and despair to subside. \u201cYou did your best. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t make much difference, my lord,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI think we\u2019d already lost her. At least she\u2019s no longer in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel?\u201d It was Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s voice somewhere behind us, worried.</p><p>\u201cGo. Don\u2019t give Sidonie any reason not to trust you.\u201d I jerked my chin at Kratos and he faded into the throng.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in such a hurry to be gone?\u201d Ph\u00e8dre reached my side, reached up to touch my cheek. \u201cDid you know that woman, Imri? The baronesse? The way she hesitated, it almost seemed she knew you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I gazed at Ph\u00e8dre, at her still-beautiful face. The scarlet mote of Kushiel\u2019s Dart floated atop the dark iris of her left eye. On the eve of war, I was still her greatest concern. I took her hand, pressed it as Isabel de Bretel had pressed mine. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know her,\u201d I lied. \u201cMay we go home?\u201d</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>That night, the moon rose full and silver and bright. It seemed far too lovely to be a harbinger of war. I searched the City with Hugues and Ti-Philippe accompanying me. As before, we began at the beginning, in Elua\u2019s Square and spiraling outward. I thought about how so many things seemed to have come around full circle, but mayhap it wasn\u2019t a circle after all. Mayhap it was a spiral, loop upon loop repeating, ending at the farthest point from where it had begun. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Valor turned to poisoned folly.</p><p>Heroes turned to destroyers.</p><p>Traitors turned to allies.</p> <p>I pushed the thoughts away and concentrated on my search. Ti-Philippe and Hugues didn\u2019t make much of a pretense of searching, chatting instead of the war to come. The retainers of House Montr\u00e8ve would be staying to defend those left behind in the City of Elua. Both were envious of those who would be serving under Drustan and Ghislain\u2019s command.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re not able to serve, Imri,\u201d Hugues said kindly to me. \u201cThat must hurt inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>We finished our winding circuit and retraced our steps. Circles. I thought about training with Joscelin, telling the hours on my own. Riding in an endless circle around the besieged city of Lucca on night patrol with Eamonn. The chambered nautilus shell on Master Piero\u2019s desk. Elua, that seemed like a long time ago. A golden ring, a coiled knot. Shackles of love, shackles of madness, shackles of protection, shackles of punishment.</p><p>My mind wandered in circles.</p> <p>It was an hour or so shy of dawn when we arrived back at Elua\u2019s Square. No emerald flash, no gem. I dismounted and knelt in the loose dirt, bowing my head and praying to Blessed Elua.</p><p>\u201cThis is your city,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThe city you founded, the city that bears your name. These are your people whom you have always loved dearly. I pray, if there be any way to save them, show me. Use me as you will.\u201d</p><p>And then I prayed to his Companions: to Naamah to spread her grace on true lovers, to Eisheth for the balm of healing, to Azza to avenge the pride of a nation deceived, to Shemhazai for the wits to avert this tragedy, to Anael to restore the sense of care and husbandry that war destroyed, to Camael to stay his martial hand in favor of compassion.</p><p>And although it was a thing seldom done, I prayed to Cassiel, the Perfect Companion. \u201cI know you do not like to be beseeched in prayer,\u201d I whispered, \u201cbut you will lose your greatest servant if we cannot turn aside this fate. If you hold any influence, I pray you wield it.\u201d</p><p>Last I prayed to Kushiel, echoing the prayer I\u2019d offered the night I\u2019d entered the City.</p><p>\u201cGrant them mercy,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cGrant us all mercy.\u201d</p> <p>The moon was paling in the sky by the time I rose stiffly. Another perfect circle. I gazed at it while Hugues and Ti-Philippe waited with ill-concealed impatience. They had indulged my madness. They were weary of it.</p><p>\u201cImri,\u201d Ti-Philippe said at last. \u201cWe\u2019re due at the Palace in a little over an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right.\u201d I swung astride the saddle and took up the reins. \u201cI\u2019m finished. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Eighty</p><p>At the townhouse, I scoured my face in the washbasin, pressing a cool cloth to my burning eyes. I changed into fresh clothing: more black mourning attire, this time commissioned by Ph\u00e8dre. I was lightheaded with grief and lack of sleep\u2014and like as not, hunger. I\u2019d been eating as poorly as I slept. I summoned Clory and sent her to bring me bread and honey.</p><p>While I waited, I fetched Bodeshmun\u2019s leather talisman from my purse. The lacquer had crackled and the ink was fading with wear. I studied the image, the faint inscription in Punic. A whirlwind sprouting horns and fangs, a word to bind or free it.</p><p>More circles, a mad gyre of circles.</p><p>\u201cI killed you too quickly, Bodeshmun,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIf you were alive, I\u2019d wind your entrails on a stick until you told me where that goddamned gem was.\u201d</p> <p>Somewhere, in whatever passed for hell among Carthaginians, I imagined Bodeshmun was smiling his dour smile.</p><p>Clory returned and I hid the talisman back in my purse. I drizzled honey on Eug\u00e8nie\u2019s fine, crusty bread, watching the amber-gold coils melt into themselves. I thought about the bee-skeps I\u2019d ordered built in Clunderry. Coils of golden straw. Dorelei\u2019s laughter and the round, rising circle of her belly.</p><p>Honey and gall.</p><p>I thought about Sidonie and the first time I\u2019d awoken in her bed. Tousled locks of golden hair spread across the pillow. Her face, smiling at me in the sunlight, still soft with sleep.</p><p>Love.</p><p>You will find it and lose it, again and again.</p><p>I\u2019d been fourteen years old when a Priest of Elua had said those words to me, and if I\u2019d had any idea how much it would hurt, I might have killed myself to spare the pain. But I wasn\u2019t the damaged, brooding boy I\u2019d been. I\u2019d failed Dorelei, and I\u2019d very nearly failed her a second time in Vralia. While my heart yet beat, I didn\u2019t mean to accept failure again.</p><p>And when it didn\u2019t . . . well.</p><p>As Kratos had said, it would be a noble death.</p><p>So I forced myself to eat, although Eug\u00e8nie\u2019s good bread tasted like ashes and the sweet honey was bitter in my mouth. When it was done, I felt a trifle less lightheaded. I heard Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s voice calling for me downstairs. I buckled my sword-belt around my waist, the old rhinoceros-hide belt that Ras Lijasu had given me many years ago in distant Mero\u00eb, a talisman in its own right.</p><p>A reminder of heroes.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Ph\u00e8dre asked as I descended the stair. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly late.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>We rode by carriage to the Palace. The mood in the City had shifted yet again. It had turned proud and somber. Folk saluted as we passed. Our outriders returned their salutes. War. We teetered on the precipice of war.</p><p>And the gods remained silent.</p><p>Once again, folk made way for us in the Hall of Audience. A heavy silence hung over the hall. The eternal susurrus of gossip and speculation had been stilled. I never thought I\u2019d miss it. Instead, there were only the sounds of people breathing, the rustle of fabric, the creak of armor. An ocean of armor, bright with the crests of dozens of the Great Houses of Terre d\u2019Ange. Almost the entire Parliament had been present the night Bodeshmun wrought his magic, many of them attended by their own men-at-arms. All of their forces would be serving.</p><p>We took our places at the head of the crowd. The thrones had been removed from the hall. Only the dais remained, the dais and that cursed gem-painting. Ysandre, Drustan, and Sidonie stood on the dais, still as a tableau. Drustan wore full armor. His breastplate was worked with the twin insignias of the Black Boar of the Cullach Gorrym and the Silver Swan of House Courcel. Sidonie didn\u2019t so much as glance in my direction.</p><p>The crowd waited.</p><p>\u201cMy lords and ladies,\u201d Ysandre said in a grave voice, \u201cI took the throne at a young age, facing what I believed would be the most dire threat of my lifetime. I was wrong. We have been betrayed. Betrayed by a terrible, cunning cabal. Betrayed by ambition and greed. Betrayed by forces we may never fathom.\u201d</p><p>The gods alone knew how horribly true that was, I thought.</p><p>Ysandre\u2019s voice rose. \u201cBut if those who poise themselves to strike at the very heart of Terre d\u2019Ange think to bring us to our knees, they are mistaken! Today, this day, in the presence of all here assembled, I declare war on Alais de la Courcel, Barquiel L\u2019Envers, their rebel army, and all who support them!\u201d</p><p>The silence broke, cheers crashing like waves. I closed my eyes, feeling the blood pound in my ears.</p><p>When the noise dimmed, Drustan spoke. \u201cTerre d\u2019Ange is not the country of my birth, but I have come to love her. I have shed my blood for her before. I go forth willingly today to do so once more.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhether we succeed or fail is in the hands of the gods, yours and mine. I go forth in the hope that they grant our prayers, that the resistance will collapse and I will return to stand before you and call upon you to send the valiant army of Terre d\u2019Ange to Alba to unseat my usurping nephew. And I go forth in perfect faith that if we fail, the effort will not have been in vain. History will remember this day. History will remember all of us as heroes.\u201d</p><p>The cheers rose again, loud and deafening. The clamor echoed inside my aching head. My skin felt tight.</p><p>Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion stepped forward and bowed toward the dais, then drew his sword in a crisp salute. Drustan drew his own sword and returned the salute.</p><p>\u201cMake way!\u201d Ysandre cried. \u201cMake way for Drustan mab Necthana, the Cruarch of Alba, and Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion, the Royal Commander of Terre d\u2019Ange! They shall lead us now to Elua\u2019s Square, where we will repeat this declaration for all the City to hear. And thence onward, onward to war!\u201d</p><p>The crowd began to part, cheering. The sound battered me. The sunlight slanting from the high windows glittered on a sea of armor. I should have slept more, eaten more. I was swept along with the throng, shoved to the side, dizzy and . . .</p><p>No.</p><p>The clamor was inside me, filling me, all of me. The silent gods were speaking, speaking to me, speaking through me. I listened. A sharp stab of joy went through me . . . and, ah, Elua! Everything changed. I\u2019d begged Blessed Elua to use me as he willed. He had answered. They had all answered. Hope and desire and tenderness and pride and ferocity and compassion, all filling me, lifting my heart. Emotions I couldn\u2019t name, glorious and wondrous. The brightness was inside me.</p><p>I was a chalice filled with light.</p><p>I walked forward into the corridor, my hands unbuckling my sword-belt without a conscious thought. Before the dais, I let it fall. Behind me, I could hear the familiar murmurs rising. I wanted to laugh for joy.</p><p>I gazed at their faces. At Drustan, calm and steady and courageous. At Ysandre, proud and noble-hearted. And, ah, gods, Sidonie! She gazed back at me, a perplexed frown creasing her brow, as though she were trying to remember a dream she\u2019d forgotten. My girl, still struggling deep inside against the spell that had ensnared her. I loved her so much.</p><p>I loved them all.</p><p>I forgave them all. None of this was their fault, none of it. And the gods were merciful after all.</p><p>I spread my arms wide, feeling as though light must be streaming from my fingertips. \u201cYour majesties.\u201d My voice seemed to come from very far away and it was filled with gentleness. \u201cYou must not do this thing. The gods themselves forbid it.\u201d</p><p>My words hung shimmering in the air.</p><p>Ysandre looked past me and nodded.</p><p>And my world went black.</p><p>Eighty-One</p><p>You didn\u2019t have to stay.\u201d</p><p>Joscelin\u2019s voice was the first thing I recognized as I swam slowly back to my senses. Kratos\u2019 was the second, low and rumbling, speaking faltering D\u2019Angeline with a pronounced Hellene accent.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Her highness cares for him in her way.\u201d</p><p>My head hurt with a splitting pain. I was . . . where? Their voices had an echoing quality. A vast space, empty. There was cool, hard marble beneath my cheek. My eyelids were too heavy to lift. I lay still and listened.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t always like this,\u201d Joscelin said with deep regret. \u201cHe suffered a terrible ordeal as a child.\u201d</p><p>Behind my closed eyelids, I could envision Kratos\u2019 broad shoulders lifting in a shrug. \u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>Echoing.</p><p>The Hall of Audience. I was still there; but all of the wondrous brightness that had filled me was gone. All gone. Blessed Elua and his Companions were silent. I had failed. I was a flawed vessel. My stomach lurched. I swallowed bile and cracked open my heavy eyelids.</p><p>I was lying on my side on the dais. Before the easel that held the painting\u2014that goddamned, thrice-cursed gem painting. It loomed over me. And this time, from my unlikely vantage point, I saw it. \u201cOh, gods!\u201d I sat up fast. Too fast. My head swam and my nausea surged. \u201cKratos. Kratos! It\u2019s in the tree. It\u2019s inside the damned tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImri?\u201d Joscelin asked cautiously.</p><p>I ignored him, reaching for my purse and finding my belt gone. \u201cMy belt,\u201d I said to Kratos. He looked blankly at me. \u201cMy sword-belt. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d Joscelin began.</p><p>Kratos handed me my sword-belt. I ignored the blade, wrenched open my purse. I pulled out Bodeshmun\u2019s faded talisman and turned it sideways, holding it up before the painting. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>The image was subtle, but it was there. Whorls in the bark. Circles. Circles within circles. I\u2019d taken it to be a bole on the oak tree. It wasn\u2019t. It was the image of the demon itself; the ghafrid, the elemental, turned on its side. Hidden in the design.</p><p>\u201cI see it,\u201d Kratos said slowly. \u201cBut wasn\u2019t the tree searched?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll over the outside, yes.\u201d I touched the image. It was nestled just below a fork in the trunk. \u201cBut there must be a niche, a hidden aperture. Somewhat that was missed, somewhat cleverly disguised. If there\u2019s a spell that can make me look like Leander Maignard, surely there\u2019s one that can hide a hole in a tree.\u201d I levered myself onto my feet, waiting for another surge of nausea to pass. \u201cHow long was I unconscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA quarter of an hour or so,\u201d Kratos said. \u201cNot too long.\u201d</p><p>I began buckling my sword-belt around my waist. \u201cThen there\u2019s time. The army won\u2019t have departed yet. Ysandre may not even have begun to address the City. It takes time to muster an event on that scale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Joscelin\u2019s tone was flat. \u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense. And you\u2019re indulging him,\u201d he added to Kratos. \u201cI\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoscelin, look.\u201d I held out Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman sideways again to show him the match . . . and remembered. My heart sank. Sidonie and I had omitted that part of the tale, reckoning it was too difficult to explain what a horned, fanged whirlwind had to do with protecting the City. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that the demon\u2014\u201d I bit the inside of my cheek, willing the dizziness that addled my wits to be dispelled. \u201cThat the gem\u2019s hidden in Elua\u2019s Oak.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joscelin put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cYou need to sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I forced myself to breathe slowly and evenly. \u201cI need to get to the Square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice hardened. \u201cPh\u00e8dre was right. I should never have let you continue in this mad hunt. It\u2019s made you worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJoscelin\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI promised Ysandre I\u2019d keep you out of the way. Kratos was kind enough to assist. And it was just barely enough to keep her from throwing you in the dungeon for safekeeping. You\u2019re not going anywhere near the Square, now or anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cI am begging you to please, please trust me, Joscelin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t. Not in this. You\u2019re not well.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes. \u201cKratos.\u201d</p> <p>Kratos didn\u2019t hesitate. He seized Joscelin from behind, pinning his arms\u2014or at least seeking to. But strong and skilled as he was, he\u2019d not reckoned on the highly trained reflexes of a Cassiline Brother. Joscelin twisted and struggled, working his right-hand dagger free of its sheath, and stabbing backward at a low, awkward angle. It was enough. Kratos grunted as it plunged into his thigh, his arms loosening.</p><p>Joscelin broke free, yanking the dagger with him and drawing his left-hand dagger to match it. He settled into a defensive stance, vambraces crossed, eyes wild with sudden shock and suspicion. \u201cWhat in the hell is this, Imri? Is it treason after all?\u201d</p><p>Kratos took a lurching step toward him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Joscelin flipped his right dagger, holding it by the bloody tip. \u201cOne more step and I\u2019ll plant this in his throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold,\u201d I said to Kratos. \u201cStay back.\u201d I raised my empty hands to Joscelin. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight you. Please, just let me pass. I need to get to the Square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Alais?\u201d Joscelin asked, angry and bewildered. \u201cAre you in league with her? What are you doing? What scheme is this? Does it have aught to do with your mother?\u201d I glanced past him toward the far end of the hall, thinking that if I could get past Joscelin, I could beat him in a foot-race. \u201cOh, no.\u201d He reversed his dagger again, grasping the hilt and setting himself against me. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>I took a deep breath. \u201cJoscelin Verreuil, as a Prince of the Blood and a member of House Courcel, I am ordering you to stand down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m obeying her majesty\u2019s orders,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve no authority to countermand them.\u201d Kratos attempted to sidle around him, limping. Joscelin took a few steps backward, better positioning himself to guard both of us. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here until Ysandre and the Palace Guard return.\u201d He pointed at Kratos with the tip of one dagger. \u201cAnd I swear to Elua, if this man moves again, I will throw on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe means it,\u201d I said to Kratos in Hellene. \u201cHe can kill you in the blink of an eye.\u201d</p><p>Kratos nodded stoically. \u201cWhat will you?\u201d</p><p>What I willed, what I longed for, was the wondrous, glorious certainty that had filled me: the voices of Blessed Elua and his Companions. I wanted it back. I wanted it to have worked in the first place. But mayhap I wasn\u2019t a flawed vessel after all. Mayhap words spoken to me long ago in Lucca were true: the gods answer our prayers sideways at best. I had my answer. I had the key to finding the gem, to saving Terre d\u2019Ange.</p><p>And the man I loved and honored above all others stood between me and my goal.</p><p>I drew my sword. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d Joscelin said steadily.</p> <p>I shook my head. It had gone too far. Kratos was exposed. We\u2019d both be accused of sedition, mayhap of treason. Mayhap they\u2019d still look for the demon-stone and find it. What then? Sidonie\u2019s memory had slipped away, and with it, the key to unlocking the spell. Others had it. Alais and L\u2019Envers. They could use it once they took the City if they could find the gem. But by then there wouldn\u2019t be much left to save.</p><p>\u201cI have to try,\u201d I said, and advanced on him.</p><p>Elua! We\u2019d sparred so many times, Joscelin and I. I never, ever thought we\u2019d duel in earnest. Not in a thousand years. And it wasn\u2019t . . . not quite. Not yet. My sword clattered off his vambraces. Joscelin made a deft move to attempt to trap it with the curved quillons of his daggers. I made a deft move to evade it. We circled one another, trading reluctant blows.</p><p>\u201cWhat did we do wrong, Imri?\u201d There was a note of anguish in Joscelin\u2019s voice. \u201cWas there aught you wanted that we failed to provide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I feinted at his left. He was slower to parry on his left side where his arm had been badly broken in Dar\u0161anga. But my head was still splitting and the dizziness and nausea hadn\u2019t gone away. I was slow today. \u201cNo, I never wanted for aught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we not love you enough?\u201d Joscelin asked softly.</p><p>My eyes stung. I blinked to clear them. \u201cNo! Name of Elua, no!\u201d</p><p>Astegal of Carthage hadn\u2019t succeeded in distracting me, but this . . . gods. It made me sick at heart, sick enough to break my concentration. Joscelin took advantage of it and made another pass at trapping my blade. This time I barely evaded it. Metal screeched on metal. We both whirled, then parted and fell back. I held my blade angled before me. Joscelin gazed at me, daggers crossed, a world of pain and sorrow in his summer-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>I swallowed. There was no answer I could give him that he would believe. And I didn\u2019t think I could defeat him without getting one or both of us mortally wounded. He was too good. He always had been. Even on my best days, I\u2019d won only one bout in three against him; and today was far from one of my best. And even if Joscelin gave me an opening, I wasn\u2019t sure I could bear to take it.</p><p>But there was one thing I was sure of.</p><p>Even here, even now, in the grip of Bodeshmun\u2019s cursed spell, even believing me a traitor, Joscelin loved me. He\u2019d gone for his daggers and not his sword. He was fighting defensively, seeking to disarm me. He didn\u2019t want to hurt me any more than I did him, mayhap less.</p><p>I dropped my sword.</p><p>Joscelin glanced at it. I charged him. I saw his eyes widen, his daggers sweeping up instinctively toward my throat. At the last minute, he grimaced and let them fall. I hooked my right foot behind his left ankle and brought us both crashing to the marble floor.</p><p>We rolled, grappling.</p><p>On the floor, unarmed, the odds changed. I was the better wrestler. At an age when most boys in Siovale were being taught the art and science of it, Joscelin had been training to be a Cassiline Brother. But Hugues had taught me to wrestle during the long summer days at Montr\u00e8ve. And I\u2019d learned a great deal more at the ungentle hands of a former Hellene champion in New Carthage.</p><p>In the end I pinned Joscelin as Astegal had pinned Kratos in the palaestra, wrenching his arm hard behind his back, my legs twined with his. Unlike Astegal, I didn\u2019t grind his face into the marble.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI pray you\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d Joscelin glared at me, his head twisted. I glanced up. \u201cKratos?\u201d</p><p>Kratos limped over, snatching up one of Joscelin\u2019s daggers along the way. He brought the pommel crashing down hard on the back of Joscelin\u2019s head.</p><p>I winced in sympathy.</p><p>Joscelin\u2019s eyes rolled back and his body went limp.</p><p>I released my grip on him, breathing hard. I turned Joscelin over and felt at his throat for a pulse. It beat strongly. I knelt and kissed his brow. Kratos eyed me impassively.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my foster-father,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a hero of the realm.\u201d I got to my feet. The hall spun around me, then steadied. \u201cAre there guards about?\u201d</p><p>Kratos shook his head. \u201cNot in earshot, I don\u2019t think.\u201d He nodded at Joscelin. \u201cThe Queen put a great deal of trust in him. There\u2019ll be guards on the outer doors, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your leg?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll let me pass alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d He continued to eye me. \u201cWhat was it you thought you were doing, anyway? Did you imagine they\u2019d listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I think the gods answer prayers sideways.\u201d I clapped his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll explain later. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Eighty-Two</p><p>I was right. Without Kratos\u2019 aid, I\u2019d never have gotten past the guards. He strode through the corridor toward the main doors of the Palace, shouting loudly for the guards to fetch our horses.</p><p>The guards looked dubious. \u201cI thought Prince Imriel\u2014\u201d one began.</p><p>\u201cHe is god-touched, man!\u201d Kratos roared, grabbing the fellow\u2019s doublet. \u201cNot mad! He had a . . . a seeing! You hit him before he could speak it! Do you people know nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA seeing?\u201d the guard repeated.</p><p>\u201cA vision,\u201d I said. \u201cI know where the gem is. Blessed Elua has decreed that it must be found before this war is launched.\u201d</p><p>They hesitated.</p><p>Kratos shook the man he held like a terrier with a rat. \u201cI serve the House of Sarkal. This was Lord Bodeshmun\u2019s last wish and her highness\u2019 great hope. Go! Now!\u201d</p><p>The guards exchanged glances. One unbarred the doors to let us pass and the other ran toward the stables, shouting for an ostler.</p><p>Ah, gods! Quickly, quickly, quickly. I waited in an agony of suspense, terrified at the thought that Joscelin would awaken and come in pursuit of us, terrified that someone would find him, terrified that the guards would grow suspicious at his absence and forbid us passage. But no; Kratos had rattled them and they still regarded him as their revered Astegal\u2019s sole representative in the City. The ostlers came at a run, leading the blaze-faced bay I\u2019d been riding and the sturdily built chestnut that Sidonie had given Kratos.</p><p>Kratos mounted with a grunt. I could see blood darkening the fabric of his blue breeches and moved my mount unobtrusively to block the sight, then swung astride.</p><p>\u201cDo you need an escort?\u201d the guard asked Kratos.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cJust open the gates.\u201d</p><p>The order was given, the gates were opened. \u201cYou\u2019d best take the lead,\u201d I murmured to Kratos. \u201cThey\u2019ll make way for you when we reach the Square.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and set his heels to the chestnut\u2019s flanks.</p><p>We burst through the gates and began racing through the City. The streets were as empty as I\u2019d ever seen them. Everyone was gathered at the Square, just as they had been the night of the marvel.</p><p>Only this time it was to hear a declaration of war.</p><p>How long did we have? I wasn\u2019t sure. Kratos thought I\u2019d been unconscious a quarter of an hour. I didn\u2019t imagine my head was any harder than Joscelin\u2019s. When he woke, he\u2019d be in a fury. Once he denounced us, it would be over.</p><p>Kratos didn\u2019t ride well and his injury made it worse. He jounced awkwardly in the saddle. His horse wasn\u2019t swift. Again and again, I had to check my own mount, fearful of clipping the chestnut\u2019s hooves, reining in my own impatience.</p><p>When Joscelin awoke, he would ride very, very swiftly in pursuit.</p><p>We passed empty townhouses, empty stores, empty wineshops. The thunder of our passage made my aching head swim.</p><p>We glimpsed the outer edge of the throng, ordinary citizens clogging the street. \u201cMake way!\u201d Kratos began shouting. \u201cMake way in the name of Astegal of Carthage!\u201d</p><p>People turned and stared. They knew him, knew his homely face with its squashed nose. They knew his heavily accented D\u2019Angeline. They moved, sluggish, their bunched ranks parting with frustrating slowness.</p><p>Kratos plunged into their midst and I followed.</p><p>People stared after us.</p><p>If I failed, if I was wrong . . . Kratos was dead. I didn\u2019t doubt it. He\u2019d aided me and assaulted Joscelin. The same twisted malevolence that had led the City to hail him as Astegal\u2019s trusted right-hand man would turn on him. They would tear him to pieces for his betrayal.</p><p>And likely me too.</p><p>The street opened. We had reached the outer edge of Elua\u2019s Square. It was packed with soldiers. They were slower to move, but they did, giving way reluctantly at the name of Astegal of Carthage. I gazed above a shining sea of helmets.</p><p>Elua\u2019s Oak.</p><p>It rose, vast and majestic, its spring canopy spreading over the Square. I\u2019d stood beneath it as a boy when Ysandre de la Courcel announced an end to Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s sentence of penance and gave her blessing to the quest to free the Master of the Straits. I\u2019d sat beneath it as a young man, beside a dry and empty fountain, suspected of treason thanks to Barquiel L\u2019Envers\u2019 machinations. Almost a year ago, I\u2019d groveled at its roots, succumbing to madness. And only a few hours ago, I\u2019d knelt beneath it and prayed.</p><p>I prayed now, sick and dizzy.</p><p>A wooden dais had been erected beneath the oak. There they were: Ysandre, Drustan, and Sidonie. Drustan\u2019s sword was in his hand. I guessed the speech had already been given, the salutes exchanged.</p><p>\u201cMake way!\u201d Kratos called, forging a steady path through the crowd of soldiers. \u201cIn the name of Astegal of Carthage, make way!\u201d</p><p>I followed in his wake.</p><p>Far behind us was the sound of a new commotion arising.</p><p>Joscelin.</p><p>No time.</p><p>No time for fear, no time for uncertainty. No time to try to explain what I was doing. I left that to Kratos. As we reached the oak, I draped my mount\u2019s reins over his neck, kicked my feet free of the stirrups. I drew myself up and stood atop my saddle, swaying unsteadily. My heart thudded in my breast. I caught the lowest limb, hauled myself atop it. Below voices rose in furious argument. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c. . . sorry, your majesty, but he\u2019s had a vision,\u201d Kratos was saying, his tone stubborn. \u201cYour men were too hasty.\u201d</p><p>I inched along the thick branch, trying to hurry. To the juncture, to the fork. There was a mossy hollow there. I locked my ankles around the tree limb and plucked the dagger from my belt, probing.</p><p>Nothing.</p> <p>The commotion grew louder. Joscelin was getting closer. I glanced down through the greening oak leaves. I saw Sidonie below me, her face upturned and puzzled. I stabbed at the crotch of the tree, prying away chunks of moss, chunks of bark. Bits and pieces of oak detritus fell like rain.</p><p>An arrow whizzed over my head.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice. \u201cHold!\u201d</p><p>Moss and bark, moss and bark. And then . . . hardened mud. A crude mortar, packed in a hole, crumbling under the tip of my blade. I kept my head low and dug frantically. My dagger scraped against somewhat hard. I dug harder, prying out large chunks of dried mud. I saw the silver link of a chain glinting. \u201cI have it!\u201d I cried, sticking my dagger in my belt and yanking on the chain. It came loose as a single piece, a dirt-encrusted emerald dangling from silver links. \u201cI have it!\u201d</p><p>The crowd below murmured in wonder.</p> <p>Joscelin\u2019s voice rang out, hard and urgent. \u201cGet him down from there! Whatever he means to do with that thing, do not let him do it!\u201d</p><p>Too late, I thought. I clutched the chain in my fist and whispered the word. \u201cEmmenghamon.\u201d</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cYour majesty, it\u2019s a trick,\u201d Joscelin called. The soldiers were parting for him now. He reached the dais, breathing hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; Elua knows, sorrier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life.\u201d</p><p>I tried it again. \u201cEmmenghamon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat passes here?\u201d Ysandre\u2019s voice could have frozen water.</p> <p>\u201cImriel attacked me,\u201d Joscelin said grimly. \u201cAnd this man\u2019s in league with him.\u201d He pointed at Kratos. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but they\u2019re frantic to get their hands on that gem. We\u2019ve been deceived. Somewhat is very, very wrong here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoscelin, no!\u201d Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s voice, horrified.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said more softly.</p><p>My head pounded, sick and throbbing. I clung to the branch, clung to the chain, and tried to shut out their voices. I was saying it wrong. I had to be. I pictured Sidonie in the hold of Deimos\u2019 ship, still disheveled from her sojourn in Bodeshmun\u2019s rug, her lips working as she sounded out the Punic word. \u201cEmmanghamon.\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cImriel de la Courcel.\u201d Drustan\u2019s voice, the umistakable tone of command. I glanced down to see a bank of arrows trained on me. Sidonie was still almost directly beneath me, gazing upward. \u201cYou will descend and place yourself in custody of the Palace Guard. Now.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie.</p><p>Spirals and circles.</p> <p>I wrapped the chain around my right wrist and drew my dagger. I fished Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman from my purse. I took a few slow, deep breaths. Quick. I\u2019d always been quick. I would have to be very, very quick. I whispered a little prayer to Blessed Elua and his Companions and felt a measure of my dizziness and nausea abate. It was a small mercy, but I\u2019d take it.</p><p>I inched back out onto the limb, swung my leg over and dropped.</p><p>The guards moved swiftly toward me. I moved faster. I grabbed Sidonie, putting the edge of my dagger to her throat and setting my back against Elua\u2019s Oak. \u201cNo one move!\u201d</p><p>No one did. The horror and loathing on their faces went through me like a spear. Sidonie\u2019s body was rigid against mine, trembling a little. Whether with fear or fury, I couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d I murmured in her ear. \u201cI know you don\u2019t remember it, but you once promised to trust me beyond all reason. And I swear to you that all that I am, all that I possess, including this gem-stone, is yours.\u201d With my left hand, I held Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman before her face. \u201cI need you. I can\u2019t do this alone. Forget your memories. Look into your heart. And if you find somewhat there, some lingering spark of trust and love that owes naught to reason, I beg you to speak the word written here.\u201d</p><p>She went very still.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Ysandre snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>Sidonie reached for the talisman. I let her take it, keeping my blade at her throat. No one dared move as she studied the scrap of leather.</p><p>\u201cAlways and always,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThat was the promise.\u201d</p><p>Her body shifted. I lowered the dagger and let her turn to face me. If my words hadn\u2019t reached her, I was a dead man anyway. But she was still between me and the guards and I heard Drustan order his archers not to attempt to shoot over his daughter\u2019s head. Sidonie\u2019s dark, dark eyes searched mine.</p><p>\u201cEmmenghanom.\u201d</p><p>It was faint, so faint! I could barely hear it, couldn\u2019t make out if her pronunciation differed from mine. For the space of a few heartbeats, I thought it must not have. I thought that we had failed, that we\u2019d gotten it wrong. That her knowledge of the Punic alphabet had been too imperfect, that Ptolemy Solon had been mistaken after all, that we\u2019d failed to fulfill the terms of the spell. And then I felt the chain wrapped around my wrist quiver. Sidonie made a startled sound and dropped the leather talisman.</p><p>The talisman was smoldering, the edges black and curling.</p><p>The emerald was glowing beneath the dirt that encrusted it, the symbols of the Houses of the Cosmos etched into its facets shining whitely.</p><p>\u201cMove away from him, Sidonie!\u201d Drustan shouted. \u201cStep away!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t budge. I could feel heat from the demon-stone rising. The silver chains wrapped around my wrist were growing warm. I dropped my dagger and unwound the chain.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d all better get back!\u201d I called. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to stop this!\u201d</p><p>I swung the chain like a goatherd with a rope lariat. The demon-stone left emerald trails of brightness lingering in the air. Circles upon circles. I meant to scare them, and it worked. They scrambled, pushing and shoving, trying to flee in a panic. Pressing outward, clearing a space. The chain was beginning to burn my palm. I prayed to Elua no one got crushed, and tossed the gem and chain into the empty space.</p><p>The emerald glare intensified. The gem spun on the trampled dirt, the chain lashing in circles around it. The silver links turned ruddy with heat. Brighter and brighter. The air grew hot and dry and hard to breathe.</p><p>The demon-stone burst.</p><p>I heard the sound of the first crack and moved without thinking, spinning Sidonie against the oak tree and shielding her with my body. The sound when it burst was like a splintering thunderclap, loud and deafening. Tiny shards flew outward with tremendous force. I felt a spray of them pierce me from behind, lodging in my flesh, needle-sharp.</p><p>And then the world roared.</p><p>It was a roar of fury, a roar of triumph. A roar of freedom. It seemed to suck all the air from Elua\u2019s Square. A hot, dry wind rose\u2014rose and rose. Spiraling. I warded my face with one arm, turning to peer behind me. I could see people struggling to flee, could see their mouths open to shout. I couldn\u2019t hear anything but the roaring. But mostly I saw it.</p><p>It gathered itself out of dirt, sucking up the trampled soil. Desiccating it, pulverizing it, rendering it as fine and dry as desert sand. A whirlwind of earth. Through slitted eyes, I watched it grow, rising into a column fit to rival the height of Elua\u2019s Oak. I watched it sprout horns, wicked and curving, shiny as mica. I watched a dark maw gape open in the whirlwind\u2019s midst, revealing jagged fangs the color of old bones.</p><p>It grew and grew.</p><p>And then it stopped growing. It spun in one place. The dirt spun; the horns and maw didn\u2019t. High in the sky, at the apex of the whirlwind, the wicked horns dipped. Toward us, toward Sidonie and me.</p><p>I looked at her.</p><p>She gazed back at me with awe.</p><p>We had freed a demon.</p><p>The world roared again. There was a rushing sound. When it moved, it moved quickly. It passed over the Square, passed over the City, scouring everything in its path with a blast of fine-ground dirt. In its wake, it left abraded skin, terrified and weeping folk. A deafening absence of sound. It passed beyond the walls of the City without slowing and continued. Moving south, going home.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>Eighty-Three</p><p>In the aftermath of the ghafrid\u2019s passage, Elua\u2019s Square was hushed.</p><p>The folk of the City were frightened; many were injured. And all of them were awakening from a malevolent dream to a terrible, terrible truth. The looks on their faces nearly broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d Ysandre said. She was speaking for everyone present. Her voice shook. \u201cElua! What have we all done?\u201d</p><p>Drustan fixed me with his dark gaze. One side of his face was bleeding, scored by myriad gashes from flying gem fragments. Here and there, shards of emerald glinted amid the tattooed whorls. \u201cNot all of us.\u201d</p><p>Now that it was over, I was trembling, too. My head ached and I stung in a hundred different places, shards embedded in my own flesh. Gods, it had been a near thing! \u201cIt was a spell,\u201d I said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. And you didn\u2019t do it. We were able to break the spell in time.\u201d</p><p>His gaze shifted to Sidonie. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely,\u201d she murmured, her face pale.</p><p>\u201cDoes that . . .\u201d Ysandre shivered. \u201cDoes that mean it didn\u2019t happen as we believed?\u201d A faint note of hope crept into her voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to Carthage and wed Astegal? Was that all part of the falsehood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sidonie said gently. \u201cI wish it were.\u201d</p><p>The sound of mourning arose in the Square, breaking the hush. Some folk were still silent and shocked, but others began keening. I saw soldiers on their knees, rocking back and forth, burying their faces in their hands. I looked at Ph\u00e8dre. Her eyes were closed, her face shuttered. Joscelin was staring at his hands, turned palms upward. I looked away.</p><p>\u201cAlais,\u201d Ysandre whispered in horror, the full realization striking her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>The Queen of Terre d\u2019Ange shook her head. What Ysandre was thinking, what she was feeling, I couldn\u2019t imagine. I felt sick at heart remembering what I\u2019d said and done in my madness. Ysandre de la Courcel had declared war on her own daughter. On her own nation.</p><p>The keening grew louder. I watched Ysandre gather herself with a profound effort of will. She and Drustan exchanged a glance. He nodded, knowing her mind. They bore the same burden of guilt.</p><p>Ysandre stepped to the dais. \u201cPeople of Terre d\u2019Ange!\u201d They quieted. She took a deep breath. \u201cIn the presence of all here assembled, I declare myself unfit to sit the throne. I relinquish the throne of Terre d\u2019Ange to my eldest daughter and heir, Sidonie de la Courcel.\u201d</p><p>Ten thousand hungry eyes turned to Sidonie.</p><p>This, neither of us had expected.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice was quiet, too quiet. She squared her shoulders and raised her voice. \u201cNo. I do not accept this charge. I, too, fell victim to Carthage\u2019s wiles. I, too, fell beneath the spell\u2019s influence. I fell farther and harder than anyone. I stand before you here today only because Imriel de la Courcel rescued me from it, as, in the end, he has saved all of us.\u201d</p><p>A poet\u2019s tale.</p><p>I glanced at Kratos and saw tears streaking his broad face.</p><p>\u201cBlessed Elua is merciful,\u201d Sidonie said. There were tears on her face, too. \u201cHe does not join hearts without a purpose. We have all been spared this day. We have all been granted mercy and redemption this day. I acknowledge my mother\u2019s wishes. I will serve as regent for a month\u2019s time. And as such, this is my order to you.\u201d</p><p>They hung on her words.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Sidonie said, and though her voice was soft, it carried. \u201cLet those with a chirurgeon\u2019s training among you come forward to tend to the wounded. Everyone else, I bid you go home. Go home and do penance. Go home and mourn at what very nearly happened. Go home and give thanks that it did not. There is a tale to tell here, and it will be told in due time. Now we need to grieve, all of us. We need to regret. And yet let us always remember, the gods had mercy on us. In the end, love prevailed.\u201d</p><p>She reached for my hand.</p><p>I took hers and squeezed it hard.</p><p>No one cheered. It was too somber a moment and they were too dazed by what had happened. By the demon\u2019s passage, by the dawning horror of what they\u2019d nearly done. Here and there, a number of folk yet knelt, rocking and wailing. Still, it gave many of them purpose. I saw them take heart from her words.</p><p>For the moment, it was enough.</p><p>The crowd began to stir, making way for those answering the call for chirurgeons. Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion shook himself from his own shocked torpor, giving orders in a hoarse voice. His men began to clear a space, separating the injured from the hale, facilitating the process.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d Sidonie murmured. \u201cYou need a chirurgeon.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Sidonie freed her hand from mine, reached up to touch my face. \u201cThere are no words. There will never be enough words.\u201d Her dark eyes were grave. \u201cThank you. I love you. Always and always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I you,\u201d I said. \u201cWe did it, Sidonie. You and I, together.\u201d</p><p>She smiled through the tears that still welled. \u201cWe did, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I took her hand, kissed her palm. \u201cI need to speak to Joscelin.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie nodded. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>I made my way to the edge of the dais and stepped down. Joscelin\u2019s head rose slowly, a new world of pain in his eyes. \u201cImri\u2014\u201d he began, his voice rough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I shook my head at him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, Joscelin. I couldn\u2019t bear it. I remember my own madness. I remember what I said and did, and it was vile and hurtful. With all that happened, even at the worst of it, you were only trying to protect me from myself.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shone. \u201cI thought . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>Joscelin embraced me, his callused hands firm against my shard-studded shoulder blades. I stifled the pain. Still, he felt it and let go. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d he said simply. \u201cSo proud.\u201d</p><p>I blinked away my tears. \u201cI sought but to follow your lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d At Joscelin\u2019s side, Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s closed eyes opened. A sweep of lashes lifting, unshuttered. She looked at me with wonderment. \u201cBlessed Elua joins more than the hearts of lovers,\u201d she said. \u201cFor surely he knew what he was about when he sent us into Dar\u0161anga to find you.\u201d</p><p>Joscelin glanced toward the south. \u201cWhat in Elua\u2019s name was that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPtolemy Solon called it a ghafrid,\u201d I said. \u201cAn elemental desert spirit. I called it a demon. It was trapped in the stone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPtolemy Solon,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre echoed. \u201cThe Governor of Cythera?\u201d She furrowed her brow, examining her restored memories. \u201cThe one rumored to be your mother\u2019s patron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d In the midst of everything her quick wits were beginning to work on the puzzle. Despite my aching head and stinging backside, it made me smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a very long and very strange tale. And I will gladly tell you the whole of it, but not right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do to help?\u201d Ph\u00e8dre asked without hesitation.</p><p>I looked around at the milling chaos. \u201cRight now, help people stay calm. Tell them it\u2019s all right; everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>It took a while to get everything sorted out. Dozens of people had been injured by the flying shards or suffered severe abrasions from the ghafrid\u2019s passage. The Royal Chirurgeon, Lelahiah Valais, arrived. Although she was no less dazed than anyone else in the City, she took control of the situation at Sidonie\u2019s order. Tents and cots were fetched and a makeshift infirmary quickly established in Elua\u2019s Square.</p><p>Aside from one young soldier who was in danger of losing an eye, most of the injuries were superficial; but it took a long time to remove all the tiny shards of emerald. Teams of chirurgeons worked diligently with tweezing implements, washing and salving myriad punctures or bandaging raw patches of scoured flesh. Lelahiah Valais attended me personally. She would have tended to Drustan first, but the Cruarch insisted that I take precedence. For once I didn\u2019t argue. I lay on my belly, listening to the sound of gem fragments plinking one by one into a metal pan.</p> <p>Sidonie stopped in to check on my progress.</p><p>\u201cHow are they?\u201d I asked, meaning everyone.</p><p>\u201cScared, confused, horrified.\u201d She was quiet a moment. \u201cI understand what they\u2019re feeling. I was there, too. If you hadn\u2019t found the gem, I would have been part of launching a civil war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe knew the risks of entering the City,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sidonie nodded. \u201cIt makes a difference. I\u2019ve already been through the shock of awakening from a lie. I\u2019ve had time to live with it. I\u2019m talking to as many people as I can, trying to reassure them that it\u2019s not their fault. But it will take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealing does,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d She cast a glance over my flesh. \u201cYou look like a demon\u2019s pincushion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d I said. \u201cMy head hurts.\u201d</p> <p>She gave me a weary smile. \u201cBetter laughter than tears. Come find me when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>It took almost an hour for Lelahiah Valais to pluck the last shard of emerald from my flesh. I rose and donned my clothing while her assistant went to fetch Drustan. He entered the tent and took my place on the cot, sitting quietly while Lelahiah examined his face. I found myself feeling awkward in his presence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry this came to pass, my lord,\u201d I said to him.</p><p>Drustan looked sidelong at me. \u201cI should have known. When I returned to Alba, the spell lost its hold on me. But when I returned, it reclaimed me and I forgot myself.\u201d He studied me. \u201cThat\u2019s why you put an ollamh\u2019s charm on Sidonie, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it worked only for a time. And I\u2019d been warned. You had no way of knowing, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI should have known.\u201d</p><p>I could tell there was no comfort I could offer that Drustan would accept. Not now. I bowed to him, then left in search of Sidonie.</p><p>I located Kratos first. He was seated outside one of the chirugeons\u2019 tents, his thigh bandaged, telling our tale in broken D\u2019Angeline to a group of wide-eyed soldiers who had suffered minor wounds. I paused, listening to his words.</p><p>\u201c. . . put her hand on his and zzzzt!\u201d Kratos gestured. \u201cThey push the sword into Astegal\u2019s black heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw it?\u201d a soldier asked in awe.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Kratos nodded, then caught my eye and shrugged. I smiled and said nothing. Let him tell the story. Let him give them heroes: let him redirect their horror and self-loathing into anger toward Astegal and Carthage. It could only help.</p><p>I found Sidonie in another one of the tents, holding the hand of a Namarrese marquise whose brow had been gashed badly enough to require stitching, a young woman with a hereditary seat on Parliament she\u2019d scarce warmed before the night of the marvel. The woman would have been tended to earlier, but she was sobbing too hard for the chirurgeons to do their work.</p><p>\u201c. . . thought, thought, thought it was real!\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sidonie murmured, stroking her hand. \u201cSo did I, so did we all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to have a scar!\u201d the woman wailed. \u201cEvery time I look in the mirror, I\u2019ll have to see it and remember!\u201d</p><p>Sidonie looked up, feeling my presence.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said to the distraught young marquise, sitting on a stool beside her cot. \u201cYou will. A very faint, tiny scar.\u201d I traced a line on her brow. \u201cAnd one day you will bear it with pride. You will say to your children and your children\u2019s children, \u2018See? I was there that day in Elua\u2019s Square, when Blessed Elua proved that there is no magic so dire it can stand against the force of love. I bear this scar as proof.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The marquise looked at me with fearful hope. \u201cWill I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Sidonie promised her.</p><p>It calmed her enough that she allowed the chirurgeons to sew her wound. Once they began, Sidonie rose. She looked tired, but steady.</p><p>\u201cAre matters under control?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWell enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to send word to Alais and my uncle.\u201d Sidonie shuddered. \u201cThey need to know that they\u2019re not under attack. We have to send a messenger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Baronesse de Bretel?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI should have seen to freeing them immediately, but it seemed important to be here. Will you come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I glanced around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ysandre?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie nodded toward another tent. \u201cLending comfort. It\u2019s the only thing she trusts herself to do right now, and I daresay she won\u2019t leave until Father\u2019s been seen to. Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin are with her. I promised to call an audience as soon as everything\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>There was a bit of confusion over who was to attend us. Diderot Duval, the Captain of the Palace Guard, was missing. In the end, Sidonie called for her personal guard. Claude de Monluc flung himself on his knees before her, head bowed, apologizing, to her, to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Sidonie said firmly. \u201cJust serve.\u201d</p><p>Claude gathered himself. \u201cYes, your highness.\u201d</p><p>We rode through the City to the royal dungeon. Despite Sidonie\u2019s orders, there were a good many folk wandering the streets, looking dazed and lost. One might have imagined that some great disaster had struck, that a vast earthquake had leveled the City, leaving its inhabitants to question the will of the gods. Most of them were ordinary citizens who had been too far away to hear Sidonie speak in the Square. On seeing us, they pressed close around our escort, begging for answers, halting our progress. Claude and his men had to push them away with their shields.</p><p>\u201cHold,\u201d Sidonie said to him. She raised her voice. \u201cMy people, you will have your answers by the day\u2019s end. That, I promise. But I beg you now to let us pass. We must send word to let the rest of Terre d\u2019Ange know that the City of Elua is no longer under the sway of Carthage\u2019s spell.\u201d</p><p>They fell back slowly, some still shouting pleas. I looked at Sidonie. Her face was drawn with sorrow and weariness. \u201cHow are you holding, Princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding.\u201d She glanced back at me. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d I said.</p><p>Everything was in disarray everywhere. We reached the royal dungeon and found ourselves besieged by bewildered guards, asking the same questions. Sidonie was forced to repeat a variant of the same speech before ordering the release of Isabel de Bretel and the men who had travelled with her.</p><p>As a rule, Terre d\u2019Ange is not cruel to prisoners. But when I saw the elderly Baronesse de Bretel and her men blinking at the spring sunlight in the dungeon\u2019s courtyard, I knew that at the least they had been confined in darkness since yesterday\u2019s audience. The baronesse stopped short, squinting at Sidonie and me. Her men cringed a little.</p><p>\u201cAh, gods,\u201d Sidonie whispered in pain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said to Isabel de Bretel. \u201cWe did it, my lady. We succeeded after all. The spell is broken. Sidonie serves as regent at her majesty\u2019s bidding. There will be no war.\u201d</p><p>Her head rose, her formerly neat coif of white hair lank and disheveled. The baronesse glanced slowly around at the shocked guards, their sudden attitude of humble respect. Her voice broke. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cMy lady, I had thought to ask you to bear this message to my sister and uncle, but given your travail, it was thoughtless\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Isabel de Bretel flushed, her skin as fine as wrinkled parchment. She gave a short, wondering laugh. She clasped her hands together. \u201cNo, your highness. Please, I beg you. Nothing would please me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Sidonie asked gravely.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The baronesse nodded. \u201cOh, yes. May I . . .\u201d She hesitated. \u201cForgive me, your highnesses, but may I touch you? May I be certain this is real and not some fevered dream born out of fear and confinement?\u201d</p><p>I answered for both of us. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>With slow, tentative steps, Isabel de Bretel came forward. Her men followed, strides gradually lengthening as they realized their shackles had been stricken for good, that they were no longer prisoners and there would be no war. Isabel de Bretel cupped Sidonie\u2019s face in her gnarled hands, then mine. Feeling and believing, her old eyes filled with hope and awe. After all the stricken faces I\u2019d seen, it gladdened my heart to see hers. I remembered the touch of her soft, wrinkled palms against my skin. Then it had felt like redemption. Today it felt like a benediction.</p><p>We had given them hope.</p><p>And we had not failed them.</p><p>Eighty-Four</p><p>We escorted the Baronesse Isabel de Bretel and her men to the Palace to prepare for their journey and found a new dilemma awaiting us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed entrance, your highness,\u201d the nervous guard at the gates informed us. \u201cCaptain Duval\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie stared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The guard licked his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t know. He came riding hell-for-leather from the Square. He said you wrought a terrible spell that\u2019s driven everyone mad and we had to trust him and keep you from claiming the throne at all costs.\u201d He looked ill. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t know what to believe. Have I lost my wits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it sounds like Captain Duval has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose some were bound to,\u201d Sidonie murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible strain.\u201d</p><p>Claude de Monluc drew his sword. \u201cOpen the gates and stand aside, man! I heard the Queen\u2019s words myself. Her highness is in command here.\u201d</p><p>The guard screwed up his face. Now it looked as though he were about to burst into tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many of the Palace Guard are with him?\u201d de Monluc asked.</p><p>\u201cForty or fifty?\u201d he guessed.</p><p>\u201cWe can take them, your highness,\u201d de Monluc said to Sidonie. He gave me a grim, sidelong smile. \u201cWith Prince Imriel\u2019s help, I don\u2019t doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElua, no!\u201d Sidonie said in alarm. She glanced at Isabel de Bretel, who had gone ashen. \u201cNo violence. It\u2019s not his fault. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault.\u201d She pressed her temples. \u201cImriel. Do you think you can persuade my mother that her presence is required more urgently here than among the wounded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll drag her here if I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I rode quickly back to Elua\u2019s Square, weaving and dodging hundreds of aimless, wandering pedestrians. I found Joscelin outside the tent where Lelahiah Valais was still working on Drustan\u2019s injuries, and Ysandre and Ph\u00e8dre within it. I bowed and explained the situation to the Queen.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ysandre didn\u2019t meet my eyes. \u201cI had Isabel de Bretel cast in chains for speaking the truth to madness. I can\u2019t possibly face her. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s why I abdicated the throne. It\u2019s Sidonie\u2019s duty now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSidonie refused your charge,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ysandre shrugged. \u201cShe accepted the regency.

I beheld the fault-lines of pride and shame in her and exploited them without mercy. \u201cWith all due respect, your majesty, your daughter\u2019s ordeal has been worse than yours.

Will you truly weighten her load?\u201d</p> <p>That stung her.</p><p>Ysandre\u2019s head rose, her cheeks flushing. \u201cYou dare speak to me thusly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said ruthlessly.</p><p>\u201cYsandre,\u201d Ph\u00e8dre murmured. Her name, nothing else. The Queen looked askance at her. If there was anyone in the world who knew aught about carrying terrible burdens, it was Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accompany you,\u201d Drustan offered.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ysandre closed her eyes, then opened them, squaring her shoulders in a familiar gesture. \u201cNo, stay. Lelahiah isn\u2019t finished. Imriel is right. I need to do this.\u201d</p><p>Exiting the tent, Ysandre summoned a company of the Palace Guard and placed them under Joscelin\u2019s command. He accepted it without comment, bowing in the Cassiline manner. Back to the Palace we rode, a hundred strong. This time, people cleared the streets. Ysandre sat very straight in the saddle, her face stark. No one begged her for answers. Outside the gates of the Palace, she met Isabel de Bretel\u2019s gaze without flinching.</p><p>\u201cMy lady de Bretel,\u201d Ysandre said in a steady tone. \u201cI am so very sorry for making you suffer.\u201d</p><p>The elderly baronesse bowed her head. \u201cYour majesty.\u201d</p><p>Ysandre looked at the guard. \u201cOpen the gates.\u201d</p><p>He did with alacrity. We entered the courtyard. The guards on the outer doors fidgeted.</p> <p>\u201cSummon Captain Duval,\u201d Ysandre said. \u201cSummon the guard. Summon the Royal Chamberlain Lord Robert and the household staff. I want them all assembled.\u201d</p><p>They obeyed. We waited while ostlers and stable-lads peered at us, gaping. In a short while, there was a considerable crowd of guards and attendants spreading into the courtyard. I knew Diderot Duval by sight. He stared at us, flanked by uncertain guards, his face working helplessly. I pitied him.</p><p>\u201cHear me,\u201d Ysandre said to them. \u201cUntil further notice, you will obey her highness Sidonie de la Courcel as the rightful and acknowledged regent of Terre d\u2019Ange. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Most murmured in agreement.</p><p>\u201cYour majesty, no!\u201d Captain Duval cried. \u201cYou\u2019re ensorceled! This is madness, this is sedition\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake him,\u201d Ysandre ordered the guards surrounding him. \u201cGently. See him to the Palace infirmary.\u201d The Palace Guardsmen descended on him as gently as possible, but he struggled. They bore him away, his cries echoing along the empty marble corridors. Ysandre shuddered, then gathered herself and turned to Sidonie. \u201cAm I asking too much of you?\u201d she asked, searching her daughter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sidonie said softly. \u201cYou taught me well. But the people need you, you and Father, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, we all need one another,\u201d I added.</p> <p>\u201cImriel de la Courcel.\u201d Ysandre looked at me and shook her head. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to insist on wedding him now,\u201d she said to Sidonie.</p><p>Sidonie gave her a faint smile. \u201cUnless you want to lose your heir and regent, yes. Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s proven himself worthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn child.\u201d Ysandre reached out to stroke Sidonie\u2019s hair, then leaned over in the saddle and kissed her brow. \u201cI do. And I don\u2019t want to lose either of you.\u201d She straightened. \u201cI\u2019m going to return to your father. But if you\u2019ve need of aught, send for me.\u201d</p><p>The Queen left the bulk of the company of guards with us, returning to the Square with only a score under Joscelin\u2019s command. She left us with a courtyard thronged with folk: the Palace Guard, the Dauphine\u2019s Guard, the Palace chamberlain and his household, Isabel de Bretel and her men, all looking to Sidonie for guidance.</p><p>\u201cWell and so.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cLord Robert, please prepare quarters for the Baronesse de Bretel and her men and see to their needs. They\u2019ll be carrying an important message of peace for us. Please see to it that they have suitable tents, supplies, and attendants.\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cAt once, your highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord de Monluc.\u201d Her gaze fell on Claude. \u201cSend a man to the Square to search for Michel Carascel. I believe he suffered minor injuries. He\u2019s still Captain Duval\u2019s second in command, is he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Claude affirmed.</p><p>\u201cInform him that he\u2019s been promoted,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cHe\u2019s to assume command of the Palace Guard. They are to return to their regular duties.\u201d Claude bowed. \u201cSend a messenger to Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion,\u201d she continued. \u201cI want an escort of fifty . . . no, thirty. Thirty members of the Royal Army for the Baronesse de Bretel.\u201d She glanced at me. \u201cThirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty\u2019s good,\u201d I said. \u201cEnough for safety\u2019s sake, too few to seem a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty, then,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cPrepared to depart for Turnone on the hour. I want all of them given white pennants of peace to carry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d Claude echoed.</p><p>\u201cAll of them,\u201d Sidonie said firmly. \u201cLet there be no mistake about our intentions. Terre d\u2019Ange is at peace. We will escort their company to the gates of the City. On the heels of their departure, we will hold an open audience. Lord Robert, please notify the Secretary of the Presence. Lady Denise should be on hand to record the proceedings. And please alert the Queen\u2019s Couriers. I will prepare a proclamation for them to carry throughout the City on the immediate conclusion of our audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the City?\u201d the chamberlain inquired.</p><p>\u201cFor the moment,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cWord of the full tale will spread quickly in the City. I\u2019ll prepare a more thorough account to be disseminated throughout the realm, but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve sufficient couriers for such a massive undertaking.\u201d She frowned in thought. \u201cThe Royal Army might serve, though there\u2019s the matter of aid to Aragonia to be discussed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d I interrupted her. \u201cThere\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>She caught herself. \u201cThat will do for now. I\u2019ll be in my quarters drafting a proclamation. Let me know when all is in readiness.\u201d</p><p>The crowd dispersed in various directions, grateful to be given a sense of purpose. I escorted Sidonie unbidden to her quarters. She dismissed the frightened chambermaid with a kind word of reassurance. Once the girl had gone, Sidonie sank to her knees, covering her face with both hands.</p><p>I crouched before her. \u201cAre you all right, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, muffled. \u201cAnd no.\u201d</p><p>I took her shoulders in my hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this all at once. And you don\u2019t have to do it alone. They\u2019re shocked. It will pass in time. Your mother\u2019s promised her aid if you need it. In the meanwhile, send for Alais and L\u2019Envers. They\u2019ve got a shadow Parliament in place: they\u2019ve been virtually governing Terre d\u2019Ange. And I think it will do everyone good to have a great public reconciliation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s a good thought.\u201d She dropped her hands. Her eyes were bright with tears. \u201cAh, gods! I\u2019m sorry. I tried. I tried and tried. I wasn\u2019t strong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie!\u201d I shook her. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurt.\u201d She rubbed her eyes with the heel of one hand. \u201cAnd it was just so damned terrifying to feel my memories slipping away, bit by bit. Then one day I was sitting in the bath, feeling like there were red-hot shackles around my wrists and ankles, and I thought, why am I enduring this? And I couldn\u2019t remember. So I took them off. Just like that. And then it didn\u2019t hurt anymore and I didn\u2019t care. I was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of you,\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gazed at me. \u201cWhen I saw you in the hall, walking toward the dais and dropping your sword, telling us the gods forbade the war . . . I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t remember, not exactly, but there was such a strange brightness about you. It tugged at somewhat inside of me. Why did you do it?\u201d</p><p>I told her.</p><p>\u201cElua!\u201d Sidonie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cIs that how you knew where to find the demon-stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled wryly. \u201cI woke up in the hall with my head splitting, staring sideways at the damnable gem-painting. And I saw it.\u201d I took her hand and traced a spiral on her palm. \u201cThe design from Bodeshmun\u2019s talisman. It was hidden in the whorls of bark on the tree.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie stifled an unexpected laugh. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d I leaned forward and kissed her lightly. \u201cYou have a proclamation to write and a letter to Alais. Can you manage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her fingers closed around mine. \u201cI just need . . . I need you beside me. And I need this to be the one place where I don\u2019t have to be strong.\u201d</p><p>I smiled again. \u201cI know. And in that, love, I\u2019m more than happy to oblige in any way that will ease your burden.\u201d</p><p>This time, Sidonie smiled back at me with a trace of genuine amusement. \u201cI can think of quite a few. Unfortunately, the most pressing would be helping me with this proclamation. Will you?\u201d</p><p>I rose, pulling her to her feet. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie stood without moving for a moment. I could feel her gathering her strength, gathering her will. She glanced up at me, somber once more. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll ever truly recover from this? All of us, I mean, not you and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said honestly. I placed her hand on my chest. She spread her fingers, feeling the ridges of the scars beneath my doublet. \u201cI don\u2019t think things will ever be the same. They can\u2019t be. But we\u2019ve survived. We\u2019ll grieve. We\u2019ll heal. We\u2019ll remember that there\u2019s laughter and joy and love and desire in the world. Enough to drive out the grief and sorrow. Enough to banish guilt and shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you promise it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I slid my arms around Sidonie\u2019s waist, pulling her against me. She put hers around my neck and clung to me, fierce and hard. I rested my cheek against her head, breathing in the scent of her hair. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Eighty-Five</p><p>My heart rose at the sight of Isabel de Bretel and her escort departing the City of Elua, a thicket of white pennants flying above them. Sidonie had been right to insist on them. It was a strong image, a powerful message of peace. No one cheered\u2014the mood was still far too sober\u2014but there was a feeling like a collective sigh of relief. A step toward normalcy had been taken.</p><p>We returned to the Palace to hold an audience.</p><p>Mere hours had passed since the demon had been freed from the stone and the spell broken. It felt like a great deal longer. I was weary for lack of sleep. My head ached, a tender lump having risen on the back of my skull. My entire backside stung with a hundred pinpricks. My stomach still roiled.</p><p>Given the choice, I\u2019d far sooner have told the tale quietly to a chosen few in a private salon, and I know Sidonie would, too. But it wouldn\u2019t have been fair. It wasn\u2019t only our story. The entire City was confused and hurting and scared, desperate to learn how they\u2019d been brought to the brink of civil war, to learn what the terrible whirling presence that had fled the City had been, to learn how in the world they\u2019d imagined themselves to be grieving for Astegal of Carthage.</p><p>And so once more the Hall of Audience was packed. This time it was Sidonie and I who stood on the dais alone, gazing out at a sea of faces. It felt strange to stand there and see Drustan and Ysandre\u2019s faces among them, gazing back at us.</p><p>\u201cMy lords and ladies,\u201d Sidonie said. \u201cElua\u2019s city awoke from a fearful dream today. We are here to tell you who cast us into this nightmare and how our long sleep was broken.\u201d</p><p>They listened, hushed.</p><p>She spoke of Carthage and the night of the marvel. Of the memories all of them shared, of waking to believe herself in love with Astegal. Of sailing away with him while crowds cheered. \u201cNot all your memories are a lie,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cThese things happened. I believed as you did. In Carthage, I wed Astegal of the House of Sarkal.\u201d</p><p>A sound somewhere between a hiss and a moan arose.</p><p>\u201cBut there is one among us whose memories of that night differ,\u201d Sidonie continued, turning to me.</p><p>I told the story as I\u2019d told it in Am\u00edlcar, leaving out the details of the Unseen Guild. They already knew about my madness. I told them what had preceded it\u2014the needle and the whisper, the stolen ring. This was Terre d\u2019Ange. When I told them the words Sunjata had spoken\u2014You\u2019re lucky your mother loves you\u2014there was a gasp. Still, there was no blame in their eyes. I kept going and spoke of waking from my madness to find the City in the grip of a delusion. I told them how I\u2019d sought Barquiel L\u2019Envers\u2019 aid and fled to Cythera.</p><p>My mother.</p><p>Ptolemy Solon, the Wise Ape, picking apart the spells that had been wrought, giving me the key to undoing them. Leander Maignard and the spell of disguise that Solon had wrought.</p><p>Carthage, and Kratos\u2019 true identity.</p><p>And then Sidonie picked up the thread of the tale and continued it. There were no theatrics this time, no shock of revelation as I shed Leander\u2019s guise. Only her voice, steadily recounting the story. The rising suspicion and fear she\u2019d felt, the realization that pieces of her memory were missing. New Carthage. How Astegal had left to beseige Am\u00edlcar. The attempt on her life. How I had come to know myself, how she had drugged her guards. How I had shown her the golden ring stolen back from Astegal, how I had told her of the spell, how I had revealed myself to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Astegal\u2019s mark etched in her flesh.</p><p>Begging me to cut it out of her.</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd I remembered.\u201d Sidonie fell silent. The hall was so quiet, the only sound was that of Lady Denise Grosmaine\u2019s, the Secretary of the Presence, quill scratching softly against paper, recording our history.</p> <p>\u201cWe made a plan.\u201d I took up the story. \u201cA desperate plan.\u201d</p><p>I told them how Sidonie had tricked Bodeshmun. How I\u2019d killed him, how I\u2019d found the talisman on him. Our harrowing escape, our flight on Captain Deimos\u2019 ship. The pursuit. Our fiery entrance into the harbor of Am\u00edlcar.</p><p>When I grew hoarse, Sidonie resumed the tale. Back and forth we traded it. Our negotiations with the council in Am\u00edlcar, our escape from the besieged city. The Euskerri\u2019s ambush of the Amazigh, the bargain on which the Euskerri insisted. The return to Am\u00edlcar and the terrible battle outside its walls. The bloody, costly victory.</p><p>Astegal\u2019s capture.</p><p>Astegal\u2019s death.</p> <p>Here and there I saw nods. Kratos had told parts of the story in the Square and some had heard bits and pieces of it. We told the whole of it. Sidonie and I wove the story between us, spinning it with our voices. My weariness vanished as I watched all those faces hanging on our words. We gave them the story as a gift. Its origins reached back into the past. A traitoress had given birth to a boy raised to believe himself a goat-herding orphan; two heroes of the realm had rescued a stolen boy and taught him to be good. The rulers of two nations had given birth to two girls and instilled ideals of valor and justice in them.</p><p>And it reached back farther into the tales of those who had shaped them: Anafiel Delaunay, Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s mentor and patron. A grandfather I\u2019d never known whose vicious charm had shaped my mother\u2019s youth. On and on it spiraled, backward into the mists of time.</p><p>But it would go forward, too. I thought of the words I\u2019d spoken to the injured young noblewoman today. The story would go on and on. One day, Sidonie\u2019s and my great-grandchildren would stand in the Hall of Portraits, holding their own children\u2019s hands. They would point to our likenesses and tell our story.</p><p>These were your great-great-grandparents . . .</p><p>And they would live tales of their own, spinning it ever farther into the future. On and on without end.</p><p>My voice faltered and ran dry. I\u2019d reached the present. The balance of our story was yet to be written.</p> <p>In the silence that followed, no one spoke. Ph\u00e8dre was the first to move. She came forward, her eyes shining with too many emotions to name. It didn\u2019t feel right to be raised on the dais, so I stepped down to her level, then helped Sidonie down beside me. Ph\u00e8dre embraced us both in wordless gratitude.</p><p>They all came forward then\u2014Drustan and Ysandre, Joscelin. Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion. All the hundreds of peers and citizens and soldiers packed into the hall. They embraced us and they embraced one another. Raul L\u2019Envers y Aragon was there, his face streaming with tears. His wife, Colette, whom I\u2019d known since I was a youth; her brother, Julian, unfamiliar in an officer\u2019s livery. Mavros. Courtiers and priests and chambermaids, all mingling together. Kratos, a limping hero.</p><p>I embraced them all\u2014I, who had once been a damaged, brooding boy reluctant to be touched. I took them into my heart and held them there.</p><p>And through it all, I felt the lingering echo of the presence of Blessed Elua and his Companions\u2014a promise of hope, a promise of healing, a promise of happiness. And always, I felt Sidonie\u2019s presence, as sure and unfailing as sunlight, her heart bound to mine by a golden cord.</p><p>How long it lasted, I couldn\u2019t say. Three hours, four . . . the moment stretched, endless and infinite.</p><p>It was what was needful.</p><p>It lasted as long as it lasted.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, it moved onward. The throng began to thin. They took our story and our blessing and carried it out into the City. The Queen\u2019s Couriers took Sidonie\u2019s proclamation and rode forth to announce in every quarter that Carthage\u2019s spell was broken and the realm was at peace.</p> <p>In the streets, strangers embraced and wept.</p><p>Poets in their chambers began to scribble notes.</p><p>The Secretary of the Presence\u2019s assistants began to transcribe copies of her record, preparing to send them throughout the realm.</p><p>In the nearly empty hall, I sat on the edge of the dais and sighed. Sidonie stood beside me, resting one hand on my shoulder. Apart from the attendant guards standing at a discreet distance and the hovering chamberlain, almost everyone had left. Only those who loved us best remained.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Ysandre broke the long, long silence. Her violet eyes were bemused. \u201cTerre d\u2019Ange owes its freedom to Melisande Shahrizai?\u201d</p><p>I nodded wearily. \u201cIn a sense.\u201d</p><p>Joscelin shook his head. \u201cThe humors of the gods are perverse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s gaze rested on us, on Sidonie and me. \u201cBut in the end, they are merciful.\u201d</p><p>Mercy.</p><p>Just the sound of the word felt like the touch of grace. I closed my eyes, feeling the tide of exhaustion returning to claim me, a spiraling weight dragging me downward. And then I forced them open so I could look at Sidonie. Her face was swimming in my vision and there was a sparkling darkness behind my eyes. I\u2019d slept very little in the past few days.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you?\u201d Drustan asked his daughter.</p><p>\u201cFood.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s fingers brushed over the lump on the back of my skull, feather-light. \u201cAnd sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d I echoed.</p><p>And then the sparkling darkness took me.</p><p>I roused briefly, long enough to allow myself to be assisted to a bed. I was vaguely aware of voices. I let them slip away and slid back into the darkness.</p><p>I slept and dreamed. I dreamed of blood and war and fire. I dreamed of showers of rose petals falling. I dreamed of Sidonie\u2019s black gaze staring at me through the falling petals, staring with stark fury before a mirror. A vast mirror reflecting the occluded moon. A paring knife. A slippery disk of flesh and blood, more blood. Bodeshmun\u2019s chest heaving futilely, his heels drumming. Swords. Men dying, men crying. Astegal\u2019s head on a stake, his mouth slack. A golden knot, whorls of bark. An emerald splintering. Whorls of dirt and sand, towering high above Elua\u2019s Oak. A gaping maw, horns shiny as mica dipping.</p><p>I blinked awake.</p><p>Moonlight spilled through the bedchamber, a moon just past fullness.</p><p>In the balcony door, Sidonie turned. \u201cImriel.\u201d</p><p>I propped myself on one arm. \u201cDid I miss aught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She came over and ran a lock of my hair through her fingers. \u201cHow\u2019s your head? Lelahiah said it was best to let you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d I said. \u201cI think it was mostly exhaustion. I felt like a candle that had been blown out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you eat?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ll send someone to the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d I folded back the bed-clothes. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shed her robe and slid into bed, slid into my arms, warm and naked. Her body pressed against mine. She shivered, a shiver that owed nothing to coldness. \u201cI keep thinking about it. The demon. It bowed to us.\u201d</p><p>I tightened my arms around her. \u201cI know. Mayhap even a demon may be grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>There was nothing else to say.</p><p>We slept.</p><p>Eighty-Six</p><p>In the days that followed, Terre d\u2019Ange slowly found its bearings.</p><p>Sidonie and I met with Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion and determined to dispatch five hundred soldiers throughout the realm, carrying copies of the transcript of our audience to be read in every city and village. She appointed Raul L\u2019Envers y Aragon to head a delegation to Am\u00edlcar with a pledge of aid should it be needed. The Siovalese lord Tibault de Toluard volunteered to serve as an ambassador to the fledgling Euskerria, carrying a charter stamped with the royal seal confirming Terre d\u2019Ange\u2019s end of the bargain. Together we drafted letters to D\u2019Angeline ambassadors scattered around the world, assuring them that Terre d\u2019Ange had regained its wits.</p><p>Drustan sent his honor guard to Alba carrying a message of peace and apology to his heir Talorcan.</p><p>Those members of Parliament who had remained ensconced in the City gathered their retinues and departed for their own estates, in many cases reuniting families torn apart by Carthage\u2019s spell.</p><p>The priesthoods of Blessed Elua and his Companions announced that the month of Sidonie\u2019s regency would be a time of contemplation for all. They bade their own members to meditate on the near-tragedy in an effort to discern what divine lessons it might hold.</p><p>I kept my word and dispatched a letter to my mother and Ptolemy Solon on Cythera, giving sincere thanks for their aid and including a generous reward for Captain Deimos and his men drawn on the Royal Treasury. It also included an official declaration stamped with the royal seal and signed by the Regent of Terre d\u2019Ange confirming that Melisande Shahrizai de la Courcel\u2019s sentence of execution had been reduced to one of exile.</p><p>Across the realm, there was no rejoicing, only quiet relief. In the City, a somber mood prevailed.</p><p>It was a strange time. I\u2019d returned to the City and been treated with wary care as an invalid, deranged and harmless. All of that had changed. Without being asked, the folk of the realm treated me as an unofficial co-regent. The captains of the Palace Guard and the City Guard consulted me on their decisions. Claude de Monluc, continuing as the head of Sidonie\u2019s personal guard, regarded my word as interchangeable with hers. And then there was Kratos, our unlikely hero, loyal to us both.</p><p>\u201cGods be thanked,\u201d Sidonie said when I commented on it.</p><p>Her workload was heavy. Within two days of the spell\u2019s breaking, petitioners began pouring into the City, heedless of the injunction to spend the time in contemplation. It seemed ten thousand petty disputes had sprung up during the time of madness. The judicial system had fallen apart under the strain. Some suits were unsettled and deserved a fair hearing; others had been settled by Alais in a manner the complainants disliked. Sidonie considered refusing to hear them until the month had passed, but after consulting with Brother Thomas from the Temple of Elua, she decided that the realm would be better served by accepting their petitions and hastening the return to normalcy.</p><p>Word from Alais and Barquiel L\u2019Envers had been swift and joyous on the heels of our news. Still, it took time for them to arrive. It was a week before we heard that their entourage had been sighted.</p><p>That was a glad day.</p><p>They came under the white banner of peace, trebling the number of pennants Sidonie had dispatched. I stood beside Sidonie under the arch that spanned the gates to the City, watching them come. All those white pennants fluttering, as though a flock of white doves hovered above the earth. The walls were lined with watchers.</p><p>My throat felt tight.</p><p>Aside from the pennants, it wasn\u2019t an impressive entourage. All the outriders wore mismatched livery, much of it threadbare. This was a fragment of the army we would have fought, cobbled together from commonfolk and the scions of the Lesser Houses. Still, their weapons were sturdy and sharp. It would have been a terrible thing.</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d Alais breathed her sister\u2019s name, dismounting before the gates. Barquiel L\u2019Envers followed suit. The man behind them remained in the saddle. I looked up with a shock and met Hyacinthe\u2019s sea-shifting gaze.</p><p>The crowd murmured.</p><p>Slowly and deliberately, the Lord of the Straits dismounted. He moved as though to offer a bow.</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d Sidonie sank into a curtsy. I bowed low. All our guards dropped to one knee. After a moment, Sidonie rose. \u201cTerre d\u2019Ange gives thanks to her highness Alais de la Courcel and his grace Barquiel L\u2019Envers for serving in her hour of need,\u201d she said in a clear, strong voice. \u201cLet it be noted!\u201d</p><p>There were cheers then, for the first time, ragged but heartfelt. L\u2019Envers clasped my hand as Sidonie embraced her sister.</p><p>\u201cImriel,\u201d he said steadily. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>Hyacinthe.</p><p>He was slighter than I remembered; still, there was that mantle of power that hung over him, those dark, roiling eyes that had stared into the prospect of a dreadful forever. He clasped my hand, too.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said to him. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>Hyacinthe smiled slightly. \u201cThank you for rendering my presence unnecessary.\u201d He looked past me, searching.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d I said, knowing he was looking for Ph\u00e8dre. \u201cThere\u2019s to be a ceremony in Elua\u2019s Square.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>I hugged Alais. She felt less frail than she had in Turnone. \u201cI\u2019m so glad,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo very, very glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I, love,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>We mounted and rode to Elua\u2019s Square. It had been left untouched, bereft of its paving stones, the wooden dais still on the dirt beneath the great oak tree. Drustan and Ysandre stood on it. Instead of guards, they were flanked by Priests and Priestesses of Elua, barefoot in blue robes.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been time to issue an announcement, but a sizable crowd had gathered nonetheless. They whispered among themselves as we approached, the rumor of Hyacinthe\u2019s presence spreading.</p><p>At a word from Sidonie, our company drew rein and dismounted. Alais and L\u2019Envers approached the dais.</p><p>\u201cIt is not truly my place to perform this office today,\u201d Ysandre said in a quiet tone. She gazed at her youngest daughter, sorrow etched on her face. \u201cBut I think it fitting that you receive this from my hand and no other. It is I who owes you the greatest debt.\u201d She held out a gold medallion strung on green ribbon. \u201cAlais de la Courcel, for your service to the realm, I present you with the Medal of Valor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alais bowed her head. Ysandre placed the medal around her neck, then kissed and embraced her daughter. Drustan put his arms around them both and said somewhat in a voice too low for anyone else to hear. Alais nodded, her face hidden. A soft sigh of approval ran through the crowd.</p><p>Terre d\u2019Ange was whole.</p><p>We would endure.</p> <p>The Medal of Valor was likewise presented to Barquiel L\u2019Envers, who received it with a modesty I didn\u2019t think was feigned. This ordeal had altered him, as it had all of us. He looked tired and relieved, a man spared a dreadful burden. But Alais . . . when Alais turned to face the crowd, she gave a smile so bright and dazzling, so utterly genuine, that I felt myself smiling in reply.</p><p>We would heal.</p><p>The ceremony was concluded. I watched Hyacinthe pay his respects to Drustan and Ysandre. There was somewhat reassuring about his presence there, a reminder that there were benign forces in the world able to match Carthage\u2019s magic. I thought about the mysterious journey that Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin had undertaken at his behest some years ago. Somewhere, I suspected, the pages of the Book of Raziel from whence his arcane knowledge came lay hidden and guarded. Mayhap they would vanish forever, or mayhap they would become a thread in someone else\u2019s tale.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know for sure.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to know.</p> <p>All that I wanted, I had. I glanced sidelong at Sidonie and caught her doing the same. She laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking, Sun Princess?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Her eyes sparkled. \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI think I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely.\u201d Sidonie reached up to kiss me, and there were no murmurs of disapproval from the slowly dispersing crowd, no underlying current of suspicion, only quiet smiles and nods. The fact that we were together had become emblematic of the fact that all was well in Terre d\u2019Ange. Our love had been woven into the fabric of the realm.</p><p>My arm resting around Sidonie\u2019s waist, I watched Hyacinthe approach Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin.</p> <p>\u201cTsingano,\u201d Joscelin said in greeting.</p><p>Hyacinthe nodded at him. \u201cCassiline.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak to Ph\u00e8dre, only folded her in his arms. I watched her cling to him, holding him hard, taking solace in his presence. He was the Master of the Straits, but he was her oldest friend, too. Their story reached back a long, long way. Across the crowd, I met Joscelin\u2019s eyes. He shrugged, the hilt of his sword rising over his left shoulder. Joscelin understood.</p><p>Everything was intertwined.</p><p>If Ph\u00e8dre had never cared so deeply for Hyacinthe, she would never have set out on a quest to free him from his curse. Never have found herself in Menekhet, where the threads of our stories intertwined. Never have gone to Dar\u0161anga to free me. And if Joscelin hadn\u2019t loved her beyond all reason, he would never have accompanied her. Never have defended us all in a dark and terrible hall that stank of death and ran red with blood.</p><p>None of us would be here.</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice broke my reverie. I realized that the official participants of the ceremony were waiting on us. They wouldn\u2019t leave before we gave the signal. That was something else to which I\u2019d have to grow accustomed, a taste of the future to come. Sidonie\u2019s regency would end in a month, but I had fallen in love with the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange, heir to a throne that my mother had coveted and I had never wanted. One day she truly would rule in her mother\u2019s stead, with me at her side. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I will be.\u201d</p> <p>Eighty-Seven</p><p>The month passed swiftly.</p><p>There was an endless amount of work to be done, but the arrival of Alais and L\u2019Envers and their shadow Parliament was a great help. With their aid, we were able to assemble a Court of Assizes willing and qualified to review the multitude of petitions. There were a handful of cases in which Alais admitted to questioning her own judgment\u2014she knew a great deal more about Alban law than D\u2019Angeline\u2014but many could be dismissed out of hand by the Court. The rest, Sidonie agreed to review herself.</p><p>The moon waned and waxed. The trade routes grew busy. Life in the City began to resume some of its normal rhythms.</p><p>Alais met with her royal parents to speak to them about her desire to end her betrothal to Talorcan and pursue her studies to become an ollamh. Sidonie and I attended the meeting. They heard Alais out in silence.</p><p>\u201cI am willing to give my blessing to this plan,\u201d Drustan said when she had finished. \u201cAs an ollamh, her stature and influence will be greater than that of a Cruarch\u2019s wife. But I do not know if that would be understood in Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar better than it would have been a year ago,\u201d Ysandre murmured. \u201cThough there is still the question of succession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about that, too.\u201d Alais hesitated. \u201cAunt Breidaia . . . we\u2019ve grown close since Dorelei\u2019s death. I think she would be pleased to adopt me as a foster-daughter. And if she did . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be Talorcan\u2019s sister in the eyes of Alban law,\u201d Drustan mused, finishing the thought. \u201cYour children would be eligible to be named his heirs.\u201d</p><p>Alais nodded without speaking.</p><p>\u201cAh, love!\u201d Ysandre studied Alais\u2019 face. \u201cIs it truly your heart\u2019s desire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Alais said in a steady voice.</p><p>Ysandre smiled with sorrow. \u201cThen I think I too must consent to give my blessing. If we have learned naught else, of a surety we have learned the dangers of placing politics over love.\u201d Her gaze fell on Sidonie and me. \u201cSo one oft-postponed wedding is to be cancelled and one much-thwarted one announced. I think it would be best if we waited until I\u2019ve resumed the throne to issue both proclamations. I want there to be no question that this was in accordance with my will and done with my blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d Drustan said quietly.</p><p>So it was decided.</p><p>The waxing moon grew full. In a small, modest ceremony, Sidonie relinquished the regency and Ysandre reclaimed the throne. The banns were posted announcing our betrothal. The wedding would take place the following summer, in one year\u2019s time. All of us reckoned the realm needed time yet to heal, and Sidonie and I would sooner be wed in joy than sorrow. For now it was enough that our betrothal was recognized and accepted.</p><p>There were no protests, no mention of Melisande Shahrizai. Carthage\u2019s treachery had overshadowed hers. The love affair that had strained the realm had proved its salvation.</p><p>The world had changed.</p><p>A few weeks after Ysandre resumed the throne, word came from Aragonia. Pressed by the presence of the D\u2019Angeline fleet and fearful of further military support coming from Terre d\u2019Ange, bereft of its ambitious general and his sorcerous kinsman, Carthage was cutting its losses and negotiating for a truce.</p><p>Aragonia itself was in disarray. There were factions supporting Serafin L\u2019Envers y Aragon and factions supporting the deposed king, Roderico de Aragon. There were factions that held that the best compromise was for the childless Roderico to name Serafin his heir. There were factions supporting the accord with the Euskerri and factions opposing it. After consulting with Sidonie, Ysandre sent a sharply worded message indicating that if Aragonia failed to honor its bargain with the fledgling sovereign nation of Euskerria, Terre d\u2019Ange would withdraw its naval support, leaving their ports defenseless.</p><p>Beyond that, it was their story to tell.</p><p>There was talk of retribution against Carthage. As spring wore onto summer, Ysandre convened Parliament to discuss the matter\u2014a Parliament altered and expanded by circumstance. The members of the shadow Parliament who had helped Alais govern had been inaugurated as official members under Ysandre\u2019s rule. The debate was waged by old members and new, the bright mirror and the dark.</p><p>All voices were heard. Sidonie and I spoke against war. We\u2019d both seen too much bloodshed. We both carried our own scars. No amount of further blood would erase them.</p><p>In the end it was Hyacinthe\u2019s voice that decided it.</p><p>He had elected to stay until Drustan returned to Alba. I daresay there was a part of him that missed the land of his birth. The Master of the Straits was reckoned the equal to the Queen and Cruarch, and his counsel was always welcome.</p><p>\u201cIt is my thought that our nations have seen enough war for one lifetime,\u201d Hyacinthe said, sitting at Drustan\u2019s right hand. \u201cI, too, speak against it. You are within your rights to demand some manner of restitution.\u201d He shrugged slightly, and the air around him seemed to shudder. \u201cAnd you are within your rights to decide that the tribute-gift with which Carthage gained entry to the City suffices. As to that, I do not care. But I will say this.\u201d His voice rose, threaded with ominous thunder. \u201cCarthage\u2019s deeds threatened and damaged the lives of those I love. If that had been known to me, I would not have hesitated to use any and all power against them.\u201d</p><p>The hall was hushed and breathless.</p><p>Hyacinthe smiled grimly. \u201cI consider it a debt owed. If Carthage should ever think to raise its hand against the least citizen of Terre d\u2019Ange or Alba while I live, I will sink it beneath the waves.\u201d</p><p>There was no further talk of retribution.</p><p>With the matter settled, Drustan returned to Alba, escorted by the soldiers who\u2019d come to defend Terre d\u2019Ange against itself. Alais and Hyacinthe went with them. Before they left, I\u2019d remembered a promise unkept. I spoke to Ph\u00e8dre, who sent Ti-Philippe and Hugues to Montr\u00e8ve to see it fulfilled. Unlike in other years, there was no great farewell f\u00eate for the Cruarch, but there was a small gathering of family and friends. It was there that I fulfilled my promise. Sidonie laughed at me, but she willingly consented to be part of it.</p><p>Alais\u2019 eyes widened when she saw us enter. The wolfhound paced before us on a leash, tall and dignified, no longer a pup. \u201cOh, Imri!\u201d She pressed her cheeks with both hands. \u201cYou remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Elua,\u201d Ysandre murmured in fond despair.</p><p>I handed the leash to Alais. \u201cWe chose her a year ago. Her dam was one of Celeste\u2019s littermates. Artus Labb\u00e9 said she was the best of the lot. He called her Allegra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllegra,\u201d Alais whispered, stroking the dog\u2019s head. Its plumed whip of a tail beat. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>It was another thing brought around full circle. I\u2019d mocked myself after that day long ago when Alais\u2019 dog Celeste, my gift to her, had been gored by a boar and I\u2019d sought to protect Sidonie from a harmless deer. Imriel, savior of dogs, defender against deer. Later, when it truly mattered, I had failed. Failed to protect Dorelei, failed to protect Celeste. The bear that had killed my wife and our unborn son had slain Alais\u2019 dog, too.</p><p>The bear-witch.</p><p>Berlik.</p><p>So many sacrifices, great and small. Had they been needful to bring us to this moment? I would never know. All I could do was mourn and honor them, great and small. The Cruithne princess who taught me what it meant to love selflessly. The noble-hearted dog who died trying to defend her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Alais repeated. She gave the wolfhound a hug and straightened, unselfconsciously brushing dog hair from her gown. \u201cI thought . . .\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWhen I return, I thought I might stay at Clunderry. It was a place of happiness, once. I\u2019m ready to remember it thus.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like that. I\u2019d like to think of you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot alone, surely?\u201d Sidonie inquired.</p><p>Alais shook her head. \u201cNo, of course not. Aunt Breidaia and I talked of it before I left. And Firdha or one of the other ollamhs would have to consent if I\u2019m to continue my studies there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I raised my brows. \u201cSo you might invite Aodhan of the Dalriada, who wrought my bindings. And mayhap his pupil, Conor mac Grainne, the son of the Lady of the Dalriada and a certain harpist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might in time.\u201d Alais flushed. \u201cI told you I believe the Maghuin Dhonn know things we\u2019ve lost. Mayhap it\u2019s time to reclaim them. To work together in peace and understanding.\u201d</p><p>I eyed her until her flush deepened. \u201cMayhap.\u201d</p><p>Mayhap it was, I thought. Mayhap Dorelei\u2019s death and Berlik\u2019s sacrifice were part of another pattern yet to emerge, one in which Alais played a role no one could have guessed. Or mayhap her role was a bridge to another tale, one that would be told by generations yet to be born.</p><p>I hoped it would be a joyous one.</p><p>Eighty-Eight</p><p>Summer gave way to fall. In the countryside, it was harvest time. In the City, the peers arranged hunting parties and began to talk of wintering at the Palace. The endless stream of petitions abated. The D\u2019Angeline fleet returned from Aragonia with the glad news that King Roderico had agreed to honor the Euskerri treaty and name Serafin his heir, settling the discord overseas. The ordinary rhythms of life slowly took precedence.</p><p>Terre d\u2019Ange continued to heal.</p><p>The paving-stones were replaced in Elua\u2019s Square. All across the City, the signs of damage wrought in the quest to find Bodeshmun\u2019s gem were erased. People began to gather in wineshops and inns. Trade in the Night Court, which had slowed for all of the Thirteen Houses save Balm House, resumed at a livelier pace.</p><p>There were reminders. The swathe the demon had cut on its passage through the City was visible, cobblestones and the sides of buildings scoured clean and smooth. Where it had crossed the outer wall, the stones gleamed especially white.</p><p>And there was the charred foundation in Night\u2019s Doorstep where a humble dwelling had been burned to the ground and a family of Tsingani killed. During her tenure as regent, Sidonie had ordered it left untouched.</p><p>Never forget.</p><p>None of us ever would. But bit by bit, we learned to live with the memories.</p><p>The plans for Sidonie\u2019s and my wedding got under way in earnest. It was to be a grand f\u00eate, the greatest celebration the realm had seen since Ph\u00e8dre had staged a celebration for the entire City on the occasion of Hyacinthe\u2019s freedom. Like an idiot, I expected Sidonie to take a deep and abiding interest in the process. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wrinkled her nose at me. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, feeling foolish. \u201cIn my experience, women do. There\u2019s naught Ph\u00e8dre likes better than planning a f\u00eate. Your mother, too.\u201d</p><p>We were lying in bed. Sidonie shook her head, her hair loose over her bare shoulders. \u201cI used to hate formal occasions. All the stares, folk muttering about Ysandre\u2019s half-breed heirs tainting House Courcel\u2019s pure bloodline. It was worse for Alais because she looks less D\u2019Angeline than I do. I told you how much I hated the fact that I couldn\u2019t keep the gossip from hurting her.\u201d She traced the scarred welt on my left thigh. \u201cIt\u2019s different now. I\u2019ve learned to enjoy f\u00eates and I\u2019m looking forward to ours. But I\u2019d rather plan somewhat larger. And I\u2019d rather do it with you.\u201d</p> <p>I ran my fingers through her hair. \u201cAn academy of magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap.\u201d She shot me a look. \u201cWe could start smaller. I did promise Amarante to see a new Temple of Naamah dedicated in the City if she would return and stay. And she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I smiled. \u201cWell, if there\u2019s anyone owes Naamah a temple, it\u2019s you and I.\u201d I circled the pink disk between her shoulder blades. \u201cKratos is of the opinion that the City of Elua needs a palaestra. I fear he\u2019s growing bored.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie shivered. \u201cDon\u2019t, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk of Kratos?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She peered over her shoulder. \u201cI hate it, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>I flattened my palm against her skin. \u201cIt\u2019s a badge of honor, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sidonie sat upright, quick and deft. \u201cBut I still hate it. More than I hated gossip.\u201d She straddled my lap and stroked my chest, her eyes dark and grave. \u201cYour scars are a reminder of love and loss, of struggle and sacrifice and honor. Mine\u2019s just a reminder of Astegal.\u201d</p><p>I pulled her against me and kissed her. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze softened. \u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>Fall turned into winter; a quiet season, a fallow season. The Palace was filled with a fresh crop of young peers embarking on the Game of Courtship. The Hall of Games was filled once more with activity, though its jocularity wasn\u2019t quite the same.</p> <p>For the most part, Sidonie and I ignored it. We made love and we made plans. A temple, an academy, a palaestra. Anything and everything was possible. She\u2019d had a taste of what the burden of rulership would be like, and I of what it would be like to share it with her. Now, before the burden fell on our shoulders in earnest, we had time to dream and begin the work of bringing our dreams to life.</p><p>Some would be easily brought to fruition, like the temple. We had in mind that it would be a haven dedicated to oppressed lovers, a cozy little sanctuary. It was a fitting tribute. I proposed building it on the site of the burned Tsingani house.</p><p>\u201cIt would still serve as a reminder,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it would be a more uplifting one. There\u2019s enough guilt and shame.\u201d</p><p>We debated whether or not that was a good thing, whether or not it would be disrespectful to the memories of the Tsingani who had died. We met with members of Naamah\u2019s priesthood and wrote to the Lady B\u00e9r\u00e8ngere, who was the head of the order.</p><p>And we went to Night\u2019s Doorstep and met with Emile at the Cockerel and spoke with many of the Tsingani who frequented the inn and lived in the quarter. It made me smile to see Sidonie among them, listening gravely to their concerns. In the end, everyone seemed pleased by the idea, and we proceeded to consult with various architects.</p><p>The academy would be an infinitely larger and more challenging project. If it were to happen, it truly would be our legacy. For now we merely talked about it, debating where it might be, debating its nature. Would it be an institution of pure academic study or would we seek practitioners of arcane arts to teach the actual practice? Should there be a philosophical component? What rules should govern the practice of magic? To whom should the practitioners be accountable? Where to even begin?</p><p>They were questions to be settled over the course of a lifetime, like as not questions that would outlive us.</p><p>That was all right.</p> <p>We had a lifetime.</p><p>And we had the nights\u2014a hundred thousand nights that Blessed Elua in his mercy had granted us. Neither of us ever forgot that each night we spent together was a blessing, and long as the winter nights were, they passed swiftly.</p><p>The Longest Night came and went, celebrated with somber joy. The nights grew shorter and fled ever more quickly.</p><p>Spring came.</p><p>The trees greened and flowers blossomed. Workers began clearing the burnt debris from the site where Naamah\u2019s new temple would be built. Pledges to attend our wedding began flooding in from far afield.</p><p>Some of them surprised me. My Serenissiman cousin Severio Stregazza and his wife planned to come. I\u2019d met him only once, long ago. Some surprised and delighted me. I\u2019d sent word to Lucius Tadius da Lucca, having kept up an intermittent correspondence with him all these years. Lucius was coming. Some of them honored me. Hyacinthe would be attending, the Master of the Straits and his family. And some, like Eamonn and Brigitta, simply delighted me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve touched a good many lives, Imriel,\u201d Sidonie observed.</p><p>\u201cA good many lives have touched mine,\u201d I said in reply.</p><p>I thought in those days about the ones who wouldn\u2019t be attending. Women killed in the Mahrkagir\u2019s zenana; and those who had survived. If I could have chosen one soul among the living, it would have been Kaneka, the strong-willed Jebean woman whose courage had been an inspiration to us all. On that long, grueling voyage with Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin to find the Name of God, Kaneka\u2019s home village had been the first place I\u2019d remembered what it meant to be happy.</p><p>I hoped she was there with a love and children of her own, dandling them on her knee and telling them stories. Telling them of dire magics and unlikely heroes.</p><p>And I thought of Dorelei.</p><p>Often.</p><p>Sidonie came upon me unexpectedly one day in our quarters, sitting cross-legged on the balcony and playing the wooden flute that Hugues had given me. I\u2019d never played it for her. I didn\u2019t know she was there until I stopped and felt her presence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty tune,\u201d she said softly behind me.</p><p>I lowered the flute. \u201cIt\u2019s a silly song. I learned it as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be.\u201d Sidonie rested her hands lightly on my shoulders. I\u2019d told her things she remembered. How I used to make Dorelei laugh by playing a child\u2019s goatherding song. \u201cWill you play it again?\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>She bent down to kiss me. \u201cDorelei wanted you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s what hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sidonie said.</p><p>Private griefs, private shames. There were some we could never share with one another, not wholly. But that was all right, too. We knew one another. We bore our scars and carried our memories as best we could. We watched the pale green leaves darken and broaden, spring hurtling toward summer. We watched Ysandre stew and fret over the preparations for our wedding, silk tents blossoming on the greensward of the royal gardens. We made our plans, made love, whispered words of solace and passion to each other.</p><p>Elua knows, there was passion.</p><p>Less than a week before our wedding, I caught Sidonie conspiring with Amarante in our quarters.</p><p>\u201c\u2014don\u2019t want to risk blasphemy,\u201d she said.</p><p>Amarante\u2019s voice was tranquil. \u201cI would never have suggested it if I thought it did. But if it eases your mind, my mother agrees that it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not?\u201d I asked without announcing myself.</p><p>They both glanced at me and fell silent. Sidonie\u2019s dark eyes narrowed; Amarante\u2019s, calm and apple-green, her gaze as steady as it had been the day she\u2019d helped me stitch Alais\u2019 dog\u2019s wounds.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Sidonie said.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Amarante added.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I leaned down to kiss them both. \u201cKeep your secrets.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, it didn\u2019t trouble me. I trusted Amarante without question. She\u2019d kept Sidonie\u2019s secrets for as long as she\u2019d been her companion, and she\u2019d kept our secrets when it would have meant the Queen\u2019s wrath on her head. Without her aid, we might never have found the means to carve out enough time to discover that our feelings for one another ran far deeper than the lure of the forbidden. And I daresay there were secrets of Sidonie\u2019s that she kept even now. If Sidonie needed to speak of Astegal, to tell someone things she couldn\u2019t bear to tell me, it would be to Amarante that she\u2019d turn.</p><p>The City swelled. Peers from all over the realm came, guests from overseas. The Palace was a whirl of activity. The inns were crowded and there wasn\u2019t a townhouse to be rented. Every night there was a new f\u00eate to attend.</p><p>Terre d\u2019Ange had come out of mourning.</p><p>I was reunited with old friends and introduced them to new ones. Eamonn and Brigitta brought with them a strapping one-year-old boy with bright blue eyes and a thatch of ruddy hair. Lucius arrived with his satyr\u2019s grin, unaccompanied by family. Raul and Colette returned from Aragonia accompanied by Nicola, who had played a role in brokering the peace there and ensuring Serafin\u2019s succession to the throne. Maslin de Lombelon arrived unannounced, smiling crookedly at my surprise. The Lady of Marsilikos arrived accompanied by both her son and daughter. The Shahrizai came in numbers. The Cruarch\u2019s flagship brought Hyacinthe and Sibeal and their two children, grown startling older than my memories placed them. Urist was in Alais\u2019 vanguard, serving once more as commander of the garrison of Clunderry.</p><p>There was sorrow mixed in with the joy.</p><p>But mostly there was joy.</p><p>We needed it, all of us. And so we toasted the mourned dead and celebrated the living. I watched Joscelin glower at the sight of Ph\u00e8dre laughing with Severio Stregazza, who had once offered for her hand, and smiled as Nicola succeeded in coaxing him into a better mood. I heard Maslin\u2019s tales of his adventures in distant Vralia and the changes yet brewing there. I watched Mavros flirt unabashedly with an amused Lucius, and decided that Master Piero\u2019s best pupil could hold his own against my obstreperous cousin. I listened to Eamonn and Brigitta\u2019s animated account of developing their own philosophical academy, making notes in my thoughts.</p><p>And I watched Sidonie.</p><p>It seemed we were parted more often than not at each glittering affair. There was too much clamor for our attention. But we always knew where the other was. Time and again, I would glance across a crowded room and find her gaze meeting mine.</p><p>Two days before our wedding, I didn\u2019t see her at all. She departed with Amarante, bound, I thought, for a last fitting with Favrielle n\u00f3 Eglantine, but day turned into evening without her return. The guards bade me not to worry, but they would say naught of her whereabouts. I attended a f\u00eate hosted by Lady Nicola, thinking to see Sidonie there.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nicola said, her eyes dancing. \u201cHer highness sent her regrets. It is her hope that you might make an early night of it. You\u2019ll not be seeing each other on the eve of the wedding.\u201d</p><p>My pulse quickened. \u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>Nicola laughed and made a shooing gesture. \u201cGo to her.\u201d</p><p>I returned to our quarters to find them ablaze with candlelight and Sidonie awaiting me. All the attendants had been dismissed and the drapes were drawn. The air in the room took on a charge. I could feel the blood beating in my veins.</p><p>\u201cYou planned this well, love,\u201d I said.</p><p>Sidonie gave me a quick smile. \u201cI have somewhat to show you.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cWill you see?\u201d</p><p>The words sparked a faint memory of a tale Ph\u00e8dre had told me long ago about her foster-brother Alcuin and their lord and mentor Anafiel Delaunay. Those three simple words were the formal request made by adepts of the Night Court on completing their marques. The debt was not fully concluded until the marque was acknowledged. I gazed at Sidonie, the air quivering between us. She looked young and a little uncertain.</p><p>\u201cPresent yourself,\u201d I said.</p><p>She undid the laces of her bodice and pushed her gown from her shoulders. It fell around her ankles in a shimmering pool of amber silk. She stepped neatly out of it and removed her undergarments. Candlelight made her naked skin glow. I forced myself to breathe slowly. Sidonie gathered her clothing and placed it carefully over the arm of the couch.</p><p>And then she knelt as I\u2019d taught her, clasping her hands behind her neck. But there was one difference. She turned and knelt with her back to me.</p><p>My breath caught in my throat. \u201cAh, love!\u201d</p><p>A sunburst. Astegal\u2019s scar formed the center of it, the pink disk turned to gold. Gold lines radiated outward, edged in black for definition. I walked forward and touched it. It was a bit larger than the span of my hand, perfectly centered between her shoulder blades.</p><p>I remembered Amarante assuring her there was naught blasphemous in whatever they were plotting. Now I understood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your mark.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice shook. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I circled her, stooped. Took her chin in my hands and tipped her face up toward mine. I kissed her until I felt her body sway toward me, yearning warring with obedience, fear warring with desire. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. You\u2019re beautiful. I love it. And I love you.\u201d</p><p>She made a soft sound and slid her arms around my neck, kissing me. I gathered her in my arms and carried her into the bedchamber where a dozen more candles blazed. I laid her on the bed and opened the door of the cupboard that stood beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you, Princess?\u201d I asked gravely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy choice?\u201d Sidonie asked.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>She withdrew a length of silken gold rope.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d I asked. I\u2019d not bound her since Carthage\u2019s spell had been broken. Too many memories of pain and fear, the ollamh\u2019s bindings and her wits slipping away. But tonight Sidonie placed her wrists together and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>I tied her wrists together, lashing them securely. Lashing them to the bedposts. I placed her on her belly first. I stripped off my own clothes, kissed her from the nape of her neck to the cleft of her buttocks, lingering over the sunburst. I fingered the slick cleft and bud between her thighs until she writhed beneath me, face pressed against the pillow. And then I pulled the pins from her hair and turned her over. The golden cord stretched her arms tight overhead, her breasts taut.</p><p>\u201cImriel . . .\u201d Sidonie said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cAh, no.\u201d I spread her thighs wide, sliding downward to taste her. \u201cI\u2019m only beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Kushiel\u2019s mercy, cruel and sweet. I had learned the art of patience making love to her. Mine. She was mine. I took her to the precipice of pleasure and abandoned her there, over and over, until she wept and begged.</p><p>So good.</p><p>And then I fitted myself between her thighs, propped on one arm. I rubbed the crown of my phallus between her slick nether-lips, over Naamah\u2019s Pearl. I slid the tip of my shaft into her, only enough to make her body jerk and strain, then withdrew, over and over.</p><p>Sidonie glared at me, her face damp with tears. \u201cI hate you!\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d she begged. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p> <p>I clutched my aching phallus, feeling it throb in my fist, rubbing it against her. \u201cTell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Her back arched. \u201cAlways and always.\u201d</p><p>I sank into her, deep and true.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods.\u201d She began to climax, ankles locked around my hips. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Please, don\u2019t ever stop.\u201d</p><p>And I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Not for a long, long time.</p><p>Eighty-Nine</p><p>Two days later, we were wed.</p> <p>The day before the wedding, we didn\u2019t see one another. I knew Sidonie was being taken to Eisheth\u2019s temple, where she would light a candle to Eisheth and beseech the goddess to open the gates of her womb and grant her children. It was a mystery in which men were not allowed to partake.</p><p>I thought about that alone in my quarters. I thought about the unborn son who had died with Dorelei. Aniel. We had chosen that name for him. If Sidonie had a boy, I wondered if she\u2019d consent to name him Aniel.</p><p>I thought she might.</p><p>Whatever fate saw fit to grant us, girl or boy, a lively horde or a cherished few, I thought, we would love them. We would never let a day go by unmarked, unnoticed, without letting them know they were loved. Without letting them know we loved one another. Our lives together were a gift. I would always be grateful for it.</p><p>The day of our wedding dawned clear and bright. How not? The Master of the Straits was in attendance. Favrielle n\u00f3 Eglantine\u2019s assistants came to make certain that my attire was immaculate. It was simple, very simple. Black breeches, a white shirt open at the throat, embellished with subtle white-on-white embroidery along the neckline. No doublet. I remembered sweltering when I\u2019d wed Dorelei.</p><p>Not today.</p><p>They fussed over the lay of the shirt and fussed over my hair and the shine of my boots until I grew impatient and dismissed them. Not long afterward, Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin arrived to escort me. Ph\u00e8dre caught her breath at the sight of me.</p><p>\u201cYou look\u2014\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>And then it was time to go. We rode the short distance from the courtyard to the Palace gardens, wreaths of flowers draped around the necks of our mounts. At every step of the way, there were folk flanking our path, cheering and throwing petals. I thought half the flowers of Terre d\u2019Ange must have been stripped bare for this one day. We reached the gardens and dismounted, continuing on foot. Petals fell like a blizzard.</p><p>Through the falling petals, I saw her.</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s dress was white, white on white, matching my shirt. It looked vivid and bright against the greensward and the blue robes of Brother Thomas standing behind her. Her arms and shoulders were bare. There were white roses woven into her honey-gold hair. We smiled at one another. There was a throng of thousands present, but I saw only her.</p><p>I walked across the greensward and took her hand.</p><p>Another moment in life come around full circle.</p><p>Brother Thomas stooped to touch the green, growing grass, then lifted his hands to the blue, blue sky. He invoked Elua\u2019s blessing on us. Once more, I felt my brow anointed with oil. I touched the golden torc at my throat, remembering. I saw understanding in Sidonie\u2019s dark gaze. And then B\u00e9r\u00e8ngere of Namarre came forward and anointed us a second time in Naamah\u2019s name. Her daughter had kept our secrets, but she knew the role desire had played in our union. The oil on the Lady B\u00e9r\u00e8ngere\u2019s fingers smelled of jasmine, and her expression was at once solemn and glad.</p><p>There were vows then. I repeated the words that Brother Thomas gave me to recite, finding my voice gone suddenly soft and husky. Tears stood in Sidonie\u2019s eyes. I watched Sidonie recite the same vows. A thousand memories crowded me. We\u2019d gone through so very much to reach this place, this moment in time.</p><p>\u201cLet it be done.\u201d Brother Thomas\u2019 voice was firm and carrying. He spread his arms wide as though to embrace the world. \u201cIn Blessed Elua\u2019s name, I bid you seal this union with a kiss.\u201d</p><p>The cheers rose.</p><p>Petals fell.</p><p>Sidonie smiled at me through her tears, joyous tears. She slid her arms around my neck. I cupped her face in my hands and kissed her as though the fate of the world depended on it.</p><p>It was done.</p><p>We were wed. Melisande Shahrizai\u2019s son and Ysandre de la Courcel\u2019s heir. And the realm rejoiced at our union, their cheers ringing to the heavens. A vast band of musicians began to play. Servants began to circulate bearing trays of joie. I downed a glass at one swallow, gasping at the cold fire that burned its way down my throat. Sidonie laughed with delight at my reaction.</p><p>The celebration began.</p><p>I would that I could have stopped time and preserved that day forever. It was a perfect day. There was the shadow of sorrow, yes. It would always be there. But that was the nature of life. The bright mirror and the dark, reflecting one another. And today there was so much brightness.</p><p>So many people I loved were there.</p><p>\u201cDagda Mor!\u201d Eamonn said good-naturedly, folding me into a rough hug. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you truly happy before, Imri.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cElua willing, you\u2019ll see a lot more of it.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Maslin de Lombelon go to one knee before Sidonie, taking her hand and speaking in a low tone. She listened, then kissed his cheek softly.</p><p>Urist came to clasp my hand, his grip hard and strong. We nodded at one another, sharing memories in silence. \u201cShe\u2019d be glad,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>My eyes stung. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Maslin, rising to approach me, his gaze clear of the old bitterness. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d he said, honest and direct. \u201cTruly. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at him. \u201cMy thanks, my bright angel.\u201d It made him laugh. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came.\u201d</p><p>Alais, looking older and self-assured. She hugged me hard and whispered in my ear. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to have you as a brother, really and truly.\u201d</p><p>I hugged her back. \u201cYou always did, villain.\u201d She didn\u2019t protest at the nickname, only laughed. \u201cNo harpist?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Alais pulled away to regard me with amusement. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>And then Drustan and Ysandre approached. I bowed. \u201cYour majesties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel.\u201d Drustan laid his hand on my shoulder. \u201cI told you once that you would always be family to me.\u201d He smiled quietly. \u201cI am pleased to find it true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I,\u201d Ysandre echoed.</p><p>I bowed again. \u201cI will try to be worthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve managed,\u201d Ysandre said wryly; but then she embraced me and touched my face, her touch gentle and lingering. \u201cI did a very good thing when I sought to heal the rifts in our realm by finding you, Imriel de la Courcel. Better than I knew. I\u2019m sorry it took me so long to see it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, words failing me.</p><p>It went on and on. Mavros and my Shahrizai kin. Lady Nicola. Ghislain n\u00f3 Trevalion; his wife, who\u2019d sought to have me killed. Their son, Bertran. Lucius Tadius da Lucca. Barquiel L\u2019Envers. Old friends, old enemies.</p><p>All happy.</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said to them. \u201cJust . . . thank you.\u201d</p><p>For the gift of my life, for the gift of all that I was. For everything. I owed them everything. I always would.</p><p>Ph\u00e8dre smiled. \u201cYour happiness is all the thanks either of us ever needed, love. I pray to Elua it never ends.\u201d She turned her head, sensing Hyacinthe\u2019s approach. \u201cWhat does the dromonde see today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappiness, indeed.\u201d Hyacinthe\u2019s sea-shifting gaze settled on my face. He smiled, too. \u201cOrdinary and mortal and messy. A great deal of it. Will that suffice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Joscelin said firmly.</p><p>\u201cGods, yes!\u201d I echoed fervently.</p><p>The congratulations ended and the f\u00eate began in earnest. There was food, an abundance of food. Long tables had been laid beneath the silk tents and they were filled to groaning. Musicians played in shifts, unceasing. There were acrobats from Eglantine House and strolling poets. Sidonie and I sat side by side, reveling in the joyous pageantry. We listened to a thousand toasts, we received a thousand gifts. We made a toast of our own, drinking deep to one another, to all of those we loved who were present. To those who could not be here today. I watched Sidonie fulfill a vow, dancing with lumbering Kratos as the setting sun streaked the sky with fire.</p><p>I thought about my mother, far away on Cythera.</p><p>And Ptolemy Solon.</p><p>Happiness is the highest form of wisdom.</p><p>I thought the Wise Ape might be right.</p><p>\u201cYour highness,\u201d Claude de Monluc\u2019s voice said at my ear. \u201cThere\u2019s a fellow here seeks entrance to your nuptial feast. He says you\u2019ll know him. Says he has your horse. Sure as hell looks like it.\u201d</p><p>I rose, a trifle unsteady. \u201cDid he give his name?\u201d</p><p>Claude shook his head. \u201cHe said you\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>I went to meet him. In the fiery wash of light, the Bastard\u2019s spotted hide glowed. He pricked his ears forward at the sight of me. The figure astride him raised one hand, backlit by the setting sun. I looked up at him, shading my eyes, and gazed at a face I\u2019d seen in the mirror, disconcertingly familiar. \u201cLeander Maignard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Imriel.\u201d He bowed from the saddle, then dismounted with a lithe twist and handed me the reins. \u201cThought you might like your horse back. He\u2019s a fine mount and you seemed passing fond of him.\u201d</p><p>I stroked the Bastard\u2019s neck. The Bastard snuffled my hair. \u201cYou came all this way to return my horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Leander grinned. \u201cI was supposed to be here days ago, but the damned ship was wind-stilled during the passage. Her ladyship\u2019s going to be disappointed that I missed the ceremony. She was expecting a thorough accounting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I glanced back at the reveling throng. \u201cIt would surprise me to learn that she doesn\u2019t have other spies in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cDoubtless. But none who might hope to gain a lengthy audience with the Dauphine of Terre d\u2019Ange that they might report back to her ladyship in great depth and detail on the singular nature of this young woman for whom my lady\u2019s only child was willing to take such great risks.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cOh, you reckon, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me,\u201d Leander said shrewdly. \u201cI loaned you my face, I gave you the clothes off my back. I gave you my memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s curious, isn\u2019t she?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He grinned again. \u201cPerishing.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cAll right. Let me have a word with my captain here.\u201d I turned the Bastard over to Claude de Monluc and bade him have someone stable him. \u201cYou can put Leander\u2019s things in my quarters,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll not be needing them tonight.\u201d I lowered my voice. \u201cAnd have a discreet guard set on him. I want him watched while he\u2019s here. I\u2019ll want to know where he goes and whom he meets with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you will.\u201d Claude looked bemused. \u201cHe\u2019s your mother\u2019s spy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d I said. \u201cBut he\u2019s right. I owe him.\u201d</p><p>I rejoined Leander. We crossed the greensward, toward the sound of music and laughter. The servants were lighting the lamps, sunset\u2019s glow giving way to blue twilight. The scent of thousands upon thousands of flower petals crushed underfoot and thousands more blossoms blooming hung in the air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Leander mused. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel!\u201d Sidonie came toward me, holding Lucius by the hand, her eyes sparkling. \u201cLucius has been telling me tales from your days in Tiberium. I knew about your dalliance with his sister, but you never told me you posed . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she stared at my companion. \u201cLeander Maignard,\u201d she said in wonderment.</p><p>Leander bowed. \u201cHer highness Sidonie de la Courcel, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell met, messire.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAgain, as it were.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He straightened. \u201cThe honor is a first for me, your highness. I offer my congratulations to you and Prince Imriel on this joyous day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here to spy for my mother,\u201d I informed her. \u201cShe\u2019s perishing of curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s welcome here today. We wouldn\u2019t be here if not for his aid.\u201d Sidonie took Leander\u2019s hands in hers. \u201cThank you, Messire Maignard,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cTerre d\u2019Ange owes you a great debt. I owe you a great and personal debt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Leander began in a modest tone.</p><p>Sidonie reached up to tug his head down and kissed him. There was enough ardor in it that Leander flushed to the roots of his hair when she released him. \u201cI didn\u2019t, I just . . .\u201d he stammered; then blew out his breath. \u201cUm. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows at her. \u201cAre you trying to unsettle him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I do such a thing?\u201d She flashed me a wicked smile. \u201cI reckon I owed the real Leander Maignard at least that much.\u201d She kissed him again\u2014lightly, on the cheek. \u201cEnjoy yourself, messire. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll speak more during your time here. Lucius, I would very much like to hear the end of your tale.\u201d</p><p>Leander stared after her.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not what you expected,\u201d I said to him. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in Carthage, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gave himself a shake. Such a strange thing it was to be standing beside a man whose memories I shared, whose life I\u2019d lived without his sharing in it. \u201cNo, I suppose she wasn\u2019t. I guessed that much when Deimos returned and told us how you\u2019d ended Astegal\u2019s life together.\u201d Leander gave me a sidelong glance. \u201cDid she come to care for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d I clapped a hand on his shoulder. \u201cAnd if you wish to know her better, I suggest you ask her to play a game of chess ere you depart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d he said, bemused.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cCome. There are others you should meet.\u201d</p><p>I introduced him to Drustan and Ysandre, who received him with wary courtesy. To his distant kin in House Shahrizai, who regarded him with interest. To Kratos, who shook his head and marveled, remembering.</p> <p>To Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin.</p><p>Leander gazed at Ph\u00e8dre for a long, long time, as though he were seeking to memorize her features. At length, he sighed. \u201cI have a message for you from her ladyship, my lady.\u201d He beckoned her close and whispered in her ear. I saw Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s dart-stricken gaze shift, coming to rest on me. After a time, Leander drew back. \u201cHave you any reply?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ph\u00e8dre smiled. \u201cTell her she\u2019s welcome. Tell her it was my honor and my privilege.\u201d She glanced at Joscelin, who smiled back at her with his wry half-smile. The saviors of my life, the heroes of my heart. \u201cOur honor. Our privilege. And we are no less proud than she.\u201d</p><p>Leander bowed. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Twilight into dusk, dusk into night. The revels continued. The musicians played, tireless. We danced, trampling the greensward. I could not count my partners. I only knew, as the sky began to lighten in the east, that the last one was the one that mattered. I held Sidonie in my arms. The prophecy an old Priest of Elua had spoken for me so many years ago had proved true. I had found love and lost it, over and over again.</p><p>This time I meant to keep it.</p><p>Weary-looking servants began making the rounds, handing out gilded baskets filled with rose petals. One last ritual, one last gift for the merry-makers who had stayed to usher in the dawn. There were more of them than I would have guessed. The musicians laid down their instruments. Someone\u2014Mavros, I thought\u2014started a bawdy chant. A hundred more voices took it up.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d I asked Sidonie.</p> <p>She shook her head, eyes gleaming. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I scooped her into my arms and started toward the Palace. The crowd followed, cheering. \u201cNeither am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImriel!\u201d Sidonie laughed and wound her arms around my neck. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not planning to carry me all the way to our bedchamber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d I kissed her without pausing. \u201cIt\u2019s not as far as the harbor in New Carthage, and you\u2019re a good deal easier to handle when you\u2019re awake and not wrapped in a carpet. I don\u2019t ever want to lose you again, Princess. I might never let you go.\u201d I kissed her again, hard and demanding. \u201cNothing and no one will ever come between us again.\u201d</p><p>She kissed me back. \u201cDo you promise it?\u201d</p><p>The crowd swirled around us, pelting us with petals, laughing and shouting, offering traditional blessings and bawdy jests. Love. It was all done in love. I gazed at Sidonie, at the mixture of love and desire and perfect trust in her black eyes, rose petals caught in her hair. My unlikeliest of loves, found in the last place I would ever have thought to look.</p><p>My sunlight.</p><p>My heart swelled, my happiness feeling too vast for my body to contain. I felt the touch of divine grace brush us both like a mighty unseen wing, setting somewhat deep inside me to quivering, filling me with brightness.</p><p>It felt like a promise.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I said. \u201cAlways and always.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
